https://openalex.org/W1970569586,"The p160 family of coactivators, SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF2, and p/CIP, mediate transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a previously unidentified protein that binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of p160 coactivators, enhanced transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, but only when GRIP1 or SRC-1a was coexpressed. Thus, CARM1 functions as a secondary coactivator through its association with p160 coactivators. CARM1 can methylate histone H3 in vitro, and a mutation in the putative S -adenosylmethionine binding domain of CARM1 substantially reduced both methyltransferase and coactivator activities. Thus, coactivator-mediated methylation of proteins in the transcription machinery may contribute to transcriptional regulation."

These mice produced no detectable CD36 protein, were viable, and bred normally. A significant decrease in binding and uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein was observed in peritoneal macrophages of null mice as compared with those from control mice. CD36 null animals had a significant increase in fasting levels of cholesterol, nonesterified free fatty acids, and triacylglycerol. The increase in cholesterol was mainly within the high density lipoprotein fraction, while the increase in triacylglycerol was within the very low density lipoprotein fraction. Null animals had lower fasting serum glucose levels when compared with wild type controls. Uptake of3H-labeled oleate was significantly reduced in adipocytes from null mice. However, the decrease was limited to the low ratios of fatty acid:bovine serum albumin, suggesting that CD36 was necessary for the high affinity component of the uptake process. The data provide evidence for a functional role for CD36 in lipoprotein/fatty acid metabolism that was previously underappreciated.

Monocytes/macrophages isolated from a null mouse carrying a mutation in the class A receptors showed partial loss in the ability to bind and internalize oxidized LDL (â¼30%) (36Lougheed M. Lum C.M.

Although functionally related to SR-AI/II, the class B receptors differ significantly in structure. CD36, the defining member of this class, is a highly glycosylated, single chain 88-kDa protein that binds oxidized LDL, fatty acids, anionic phospholipids (including phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidlyserine) and the proteins collagen and thrombospondin (2Endemann G.

In vitroand in vivo studies indicate that a significant proportion of binding and internalization of oxidized LDL by tissue-differentiated macrophages occurs through CD36 (41Nicholson A.

Antibodies to CD36 have been shown to block up to 50% of oxidized LDL binding and uptake in normal peripheral blood-derived macrophages (41Nicholson A. Pearce S.F.A. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler.

Monocytes/macrophages from donors with a human polymorphism associated with lack of CD36 expression (Nakaâ), bound and internalized 40% less oxidized LDL and accumulated 40% less cholesterol ester (43Nozaki S.

Recently, CD36 has been shown to be involved in the differentiation of monocytes and accumulation of lipid in macrophages as a result of exposure to oxidized LDL, and through the induction of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) (44Nagy L.

In addition to its role as a scavenger receptor, CD36 is also one of five structurally unrelated proteins that have been proposed to function as long chain fatty acid transporters and facilitate uptake of long chain fatty acids in adipocytes, mammary epithelia, small intestine, and cardiac and skeletal muscle (55Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R.

The physiologic role of these transporters remains controversial, however, because there is indirect evidence in support of an alternative theory that fatty acids may freely diffuse into cells (59Zakim D.

The evidence that CD36 plays a role in fatty acid transport includes its identification by reaction with a fatty acid derivative and subsequent binding of fatty acid in vitro (62Harmon C.M.

The expression of CD36 correlates strongly with tissues active in fatty acid metabolism, and it predominates in oxidative red muscle fibers (55Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.-Z. Grimaldi P.A.

CD36 is up-regulated, together with fatty acid uptake, by electrical stimulation and muscle contraction and is increased in the muscle of diabetic animals and those fed a high fat diet (65Bonen A.

There is mounting evidence implying at least a correlation between expression of these putative long chain fatty acid transporters such as CD36, and adipocyte transcriptional regulators, such as PPARÎ³ and others (70Motojima K.

These reports and those involving macrophage storage of oxidized LDL imply new parallels in two very different contexts of lipid storage and suggest a role for CD36 in normal lipid metabolism that has been thus far unappreciated. To further characterize the role of CD36 in fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism and oxidized LDL binding and internalization, we have generated a mouse null for CD36 by homologous recombination. Our data show that monocytes/macrophages from these mice had an impaired ability to bind and internalize oxidized LDL, a well characterized function of CD36. Adipocytes from null mice exhibited a significantly decreased ability to transport the long chain fatty acid, oleate, at low fatty acid:BSA ratios. Incorporation of oleate into triacylglycerol was reduced in adipocytes from null mice, while incorporation into diacylglycerol was increased. These animals had an increase in fasting serum/plasma cholesterol, an increase in nonesterified free fatty acid and triacylglycerol levels, and a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, revealing a more significant role for CD36 in lipoprotein and fatty acid metabolism than previously appreciated. Cell culture reagents including leukemia-inhibitory factor (Esgro) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal bovine serum was from Gemini Bio-Sciences, Inc.; total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, albumin, and glucose quantitative assay kits and calibrators and miscellaneous chemicals were from Sigma; standards and a quantitative assay kit for serum nonesterified fatty acids were from Wako; FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories; rabbit anti-rat CD36 IgG was prepared as described by Ryeom et al.(74Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse SR-A antibody (2F8) was from Serotec, Ltd.; carrier-free 125I-NaCl was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; [Î±-32P]dCTP, 14C-labeled palmitate, and 3H-labeled oleate were from NEN Life Science Products; the targeting vector, pPNT, was a gift from H.-C. Liou (Weill Medical College of Cornell University); the murine CD36 cDNA was a gift from G. Endemann (Scios Nova Inc.); CJ7 embryonic stem (ES) cells, passage 7, and neomycin-resistant (neo r) mice were gifts of V. Soarez and E. Lacey (Sloan Kettering Institute); blastocyst injections were done through the core facilities at Sloan Kettering Institute and Rockefeller University; and fast protein liquid chromatography of plasma lipoproteins was performed in collaboration with the Rogosin Institute Clinical Research Laboratory for Comprehensive Lipid Analysis (Drs. T. Parker and D. Levine, Directors). Murine CD36 genomic sequences were obtained from a mouse strain 129/Sv genomic phage library (Stratagene) using a 551-base pair cDNA probe beginning at cDNA base pair 2. A phage containing a 13-kb insert was identified, and by restriction enzyme analysis, Southern blotting, and dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), it was proved to be genomic CD36 (data not shown). Construction of the CD36 targeting vector was carried out in the plasmid pPNT, which contains neo r and thymidine kinase for selection of homologous recombinants (75Tybulecwicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Two fragments flanking exon 3 of murine CD36, which contained the translation start site, were subcloned into pPNT in a transcription orientation opposite to the neo r cassette (Fig. 1 A). Exon 3, which encodes the first 40 amino acids of CD36 and contains the putative N-terminal transmembrane domain, was deleted entirely in the homologous recombined allele. The CJ7 ES cell line was cultured on growth-arrestedneo r embryonic fibroblasts as described (76Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar). For electroporation, ES cells were resuspended at a concentration of 2.5 Ã 107/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) lacking calcium and magnesium. 0.9-ml aliquots were mixed with 20 Î¼g of the linearized targeting vector and pulsed at 250 V, 500 microfarads (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser). The cells were then diluted in culture medium and plated at 5 Ã 106 cells/100-mm dish. After 24 h, G418 (Life Technologies) selection (250 Î¼g/ml) was begun, and selection with ganciclovir (2 Î¼m; Cytovene from Syntex Laboratories, Inc.) began on day 3. Resistant colonies were picked on days 8â10, dissociated with trypsin, and divided into two wells of a 96-well plate. Upon confluence, one well of ES cells was frozen and the other was expanded for DNA isolation and Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA was prepared from ES cells and tail biopsies by digestion at 55 Â°C with proteinase K. Approximately 10 Î¼g of genomic DNA were digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease, electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel, transferred to ZetaProbe GT (Bio-Rad), and hybridized with the random primed32P-radiolabeled probe indicated in Fig. 1. The probe/enzyme strategy was such that a different size restriction fragment would result from the endogenous locus, integration of the plasmid nonspecifically, and homologous recombination. A second probe/restriction enzyme strategy and probes to both the thymidine kinase and neo r genes were used to ensure that homologous recombination and not random integration of the targeting vector had occurred (data not shown). Primers specific to exon 3 were designed, and these failed to give rise to product from genomic DNA of null mice in polymerase chain reactions while yielding a fragment of the correct size in wild type animals (data not shown). Two separate ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts as described (76Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar) and resulted in chimeras with 75â99% agouti coats. Male chimeras were bred with C57BL/6 females, and agouti offspring were screened for the presence of the mutated CD36 gene by Southern blot hybridization. Offspring heterozygous for the mutation were interbred, and mice homozygous for the CD36 disrupted allele were identified by Southern blot hybridization. Tissues were excised from euthanized mice after perfusion with PBS and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, and 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin). The tissues were Dounce-homogenized, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the extracts were stored at â20 Â°C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using a polyclonal rabbit anti-rat CD36 antiserum (74Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. After immunoprecipitation for 2 h at 4 Â°C, beads were thoroughly washed, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with the same antiserum. Proteins were visualized with an ECL detection system (Bio-Rad). Human and mouse platelets served as positive controls. To demonstrate specificity, an identical blot was incubated with normal rabbit serum. LDL (density 1.019â1.063 g/ml) was prepared from human plasma and isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation, extensively dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.3 mm EDTA, sterilized by filtration (0.22 Î¼m), and stored under nitrogen gas at 4 Â°C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent. LDL was iodinated by the method of Goldstein et al. (77Goldstein J.L. Basu S. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), using carrier-free 125I-NaCl. LDL and 125I-LDL were oxidized by dialyzing against 5 Î¼mol/liter CuSO4 in PBS at 37 Â°C for 16 h. The purity and charge of the lipoproteins were evaluated by examining electrophoretic mobility in an agarose gel. The degree of oxidation was determined by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. LDL had thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances of <1 nmol/mg. Oxidized LDL had thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances of >10 and <30 nmol/mg. The specific activity of the 125I-oxidized LDL was approximately 0.05â0.1 Î¼Ci/Î¼g. Resident peritoneal macrophages and thioglycolate-elicited macrophages (4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2â4 ml of 4% sterile thioglycolate solution) were collected by lavage into ice-cold PBS and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 1â2 days. Blood was collected into heparinized syringes by heart puncture. Buffy coat cells were collected after centrifugation and in"

In addition, mammalian sHsps are rapidly phosphorylated by MAPKAP kinase 2/3 at two or three serine residues in response to various extracellular stresses. Here we analyze the effect of sHsp phosphorylation on its quaternary structure, chaperone function, and protection against oxidative stress. We show that in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant sHsp as well as molecular mimicry of Hsp27 phosphorylation lead to a significant decrease of the oligomeric size. We demonstrate that both phosphorylated sHsps and the triple mutant Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D show significantly decreased abilities to act as molecular chaperones suppressing thermal denaturation and facilitating refolding of citrate synthase in vitro. In parallel, Hsp27 and its mutants were analyzed for their ability to confer resistance against oxidative stress when overexpressed in L929 and 13.S.1.24 cells. While wild type Hsp27 confers resistance, the triple mutant S15D,S78D,S82D cannot protect against oxidative stress effectively. These data indicate that large oligomers of sHsps are necessary for chaperone action and resistance against oxidative stress whereas phosphorylation down-regulates these activities by dissociation of sHsp complexes to tetramers.

Buchner J. Gaestel M. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 533-575Google Scholar). Within the cell they can form oligomeric complexes of up to 1 MDa (2Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Overexpression of different mammalian sHsps increases cellular thermoresistance to a significant degree (3Knauf U. Jakob U. Engel K. Buchner J. Gaestel M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells certain sHsps, e.g. mouse Hsp25 or human Hsp27, form a converging element of the cellular stress response since they show both a stress-induced increase in expression and phosphorylation. Under heat shock conditions increased phosphorylation can be detected after several minutes while changes in expression are detected after several hours (15Landry J. Chretien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The rapid stress-induced phosphorylation is the result of stimulation of the p38 MAP kinase cascade and subsequent activation of MAPKAP kinases 2 and 3 which directly phosphorylate mammalian sHsps (16Stokoe D.

Since sHsp phosphorylation and stress-induced expression show different kinetics, it is assumed that phosphorylation of the pre-existing constitutively expressed sHsps is a first phase of the stress response while the elevated expression at a time when their phosphorylation is already down-regulated comprises the second phase. So far, it is not clear whether sHsps fulfill different cellular functions at these different stages of the stress response. In contrast to plant sHsps, which are not phosphorylated and structurally reorganized in response to stress (20Suzuki T.C. Krawitz D.C. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), increased phosphorylation of mammalian sHsps leads to changes in the oligomeric organization resulting in both smaller (21Kato K.

In cells exposed to TNFÎ± a transient formation of large oligomers was followed by the accumulation of small oligomers (25Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell.

Hence, although some aspects of sHsp function already have become clear, a comprehensive picture of their function is still lacking. In this study, we phosphorylated sHsps by MAPKAP kinase 2 to investigate the influence on their oligomerization and chaperone properties in vitro. In a second approach, we used âmolecular mimicryâ of serine phosphorylation of Hsp27 to study the effect of phosphorylation also in vivo. To this end phosphorylatable serines were replaced by negatively charged aspartate residues with similar overall structure. This strategy has been used before to obtain information about the structure and function of phosphorylated isoforms of a wide variety of proteins, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (31Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-19425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), serum response factor (32Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For Hsp27 we constructed three different mutants replacing one (S15D), two (S78D,S82D), or all three (S15D,S78D,S82D) phosphorylation sites by aspartate. These mutants were compared in their oligomerization and chaperone properties with the phosphorylated protein. Furthermore, overexpression of these mutants was used to analyze the dependence of the protective function of Hsp27 on oligomerization. Size exclusion liquid chromatography was carried out on a Superose 6 HR 30/10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 30 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, 50 Î¼mNaN3, and 2 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For estimation of the molecular mass a combination of several proteins of the LMW and HMW calibration kit (Pharmacia) were used (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase 232 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; and chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa). 200 pmol of recombinant Hsp25 or Hsp27 were incubated with 17 pmol of recombinant GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 Î3BÎPC or 60 milliunits of native purified MAPKAP kinase 2 (Upstate Biotechnology), 10 nmol of ATP, and 3 pmol of [Î³-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a reaction volume of 50 Î¼l containing 50 mmÎ±-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm magnesium acetate at 30 Â°C for 3 h. Before and after the incubation aliquots of 10 Î¼l were taken and proteins were precipitated with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were washed twice with 20% trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were measured in a scintillation counter in order to calculate the relative incorporation of phosphate. Mutagenesis of pAK3038-Hsp27 (11Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed using the TransformerTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) and the oligonucleotides 5â²-GCGCTCGACCGGCAACTCGACAGCGGGG-3â² changing the codons for both serine 78 and 82 to aspartate and 5â²-CTTCCTTTTTCGATATCATTGAAGCATTT-3â² for selection of positive clones by changing the restriction siteSspI to EcoRV. The resulting plasmid was pAK3038-Hsp27-S78D,S82D. For the mutagenesis of serine 15 to aspartate we used the Quickchange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and the two corresponding oligonucleotides 5â²-GGGGCCCCGACTGGGACCCC-3â²and 5â²-GGAAGGGGTCCCAGTCGGGGCCCCGCAGG-3â² leading to plasmid pAK3038-Hsp27-S15D. pAK3038-Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D was constructed by inserting the NdeI/KpnI fragment of pAK3038-Hsp27-S15D into NdeI/KpnI cut pAK3038-Hsp27-S78D,S82D. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Near and far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter. Hsp27 and its mutants were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. After centrifugation of the samples to remove aggregates the protein concentrations were determined. Near UV spectra were recorded at 245â330 nm in thermostated 0.5-cm quarz cuvettes at 20 Â°C. The far UV spectra were recorded at the same temperature at 200â250 nm in 0.1-cm quartz cuvettes. As a control for unstructured protein, Hsp27 was incubated in 6 m guanidinium chloride in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 4 h at 20 Â°C. The protein was then treated and measured like the native samples. All spectra were buffer corrected and 12 times accumulated. Mean residue ellipticities for the spectra were calculated based on a mean residue molecular weight of 112. Electron microscopic investigations were performed with negatively stained protein samples. Negative staining was done at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml with 1% uranyl formiate using the double-carbon film technique (38Behlke J. Lutsch G. Gaestel M. Bielka H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken with a Philips EM400T at 80 kV and a magnification of Ã 60,000. For statistical evaluation selected micrographs were digitized using a linear-CCD densitometer (EMiL, Image Science GmbH, Berlin, Germany) with a sampling size corresponding to 1 nm at the specimen scale. Analysis was done with the analySIS software (Soft Imaging System GmbH, MuÌnster, Germany). Briefly, micrographs were shading corrected, median filtered, and binerized using an adequate threshold to eliminate background staining. Particles were separated using a watershed algorithm, and detected and classified according to their area size. Thermal aggregation of CS and oxaloacetic acid-induced reactivation of CS were performed as described in Ref. 13Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar in the presence and absence of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Hsp27 and its mutants. IgG was used as a control for unspecific protein effects. The experiments were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl in a volume of 120 Î¼l in quartz microcuvettes (path length: 1 cm). Insulin was added to a final concentration of 45 Î¼m (0.25 mg/ml) to the buffer in the presence and absence of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated Hsp27. The reaction was started by 1:25 dilution of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 20 mm (stock solution: 0.5 m in assay buffer). Turbidity due to the aggregation of the insulin B chain was then monitored at 30 Â°C and 400 nm in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature control unit. All Hsp27 concentrations refer to a 16-subunit oligomeric complex. The pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) carrying the cytomegalovirus promoter was used to drive eukaryotic expression of Hsp27 and its mutants. At the amino-terminal end of Hsp27 a HA-tag (MAYPYDVPPYASLGGH) was added during re-cloning from pAK3038 vectors. Exponentially growing L929 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) were plated at a density of 106 cells/78 cm2 and allowed to grow in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 Â°C 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 5 Î¼g of DNA (either pcDNA3 plain vector or pcDNA3-Hsp27-WT, -S15D, -S78D,S82D, or -S15,S78D,S82D) using DAC30 (Eurogentec, Angers, France). Before transfection, serum was removed from the cell culture. DNA and DAC 30 at a ratio of 1:2 (w:v), respectively, were separately diluted in 600 Î¼l of 150 mm NaCl. The different DNA solutions were then added to their corresponding DAC30 solutions and incubated 20 min at room temperature. The different mixes were subsequently added to the cells and incubated 3 h in normal culture conditions before supplementing the culture media with 10% fetal calf serum. The efficiency of transfection was estimated in parallel experiments using pSVÎ² plasmid that contains the gene encoding Î²-galactosidase under the control of the SV40 promoter (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Cells expressing Î²-galactosidase were monitored by 5-bromochloro-3-indolyl-Î²-d-galactosidase staining (39Lim K. Chae C. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was determined to range at 20 Â± 3%. Expression of the different proteins was monitored by immunoblot analysis using a specific polyclonal antibody directed against human Hsp27 as described previously (40Mehlen P. Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were plated at a density of 104 cells per well in 96-well plates (Nunc, Rockskilde, Denmark) and were grown 24 h before being analyzed for their resistance to TNFÎ± or H2O2. Two-fold serial dilutions of TNFÎ± or H2O2 were added to the cells. Actinomycin D (0.5 Î¼g/ml) was used to enhance the killing activity of TNFÎ±. Incubations were 24 h with TNFÎ± or 16 h with H2O2. Survival was measured with alamarBlueTM (Interchim, MontlucÌ§on, France) which is a metabolic indicator that yields a fluorescent signal in response to metabolic activity. Briefly, alamarBlueTM was added to the cells at a 5% final volume and incubated 3 h at 37 Â°C. The fluorescence of each well was read with an excitation wavelength of 560 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm using a VictorTMfluorometer (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Crystal violet staining (40Mehlen P. Preville X. Chareyron P. Briolay J. Klemenz R. Arrigo A.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar) was selected for the determination of the survival rates in the hydrogen peroxide set of experiments because of the unreliability of the alamarBlueTM assay due to interference with H2O2. The percentage of cell survival was defined as the relative absorbance of sample versusuntreated control cells. Immortalized rat neuroblasts 13.S.1.24 have been described previously (41Coronas V. Feron F. Hen R. Sicard G. Jourdan F. Moyse E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.3 mg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Exponentially growing 13.S.1.24 cells were plated at a density of 5 Ã 103cells/cm2 and allowed to grow at 37 Â°C for 24 h prior transfection. Cells were transfected using Fugen-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturers instructions with 2.34 Î¼g of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-Hsp27-WT, -S15D, -S78D,S82D, or -S15D,S78,82D vector together with 0.26 Î¼g of the green fluorescent protein expressing vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 24 h after transfection, cells were plated at a density of 5 Ã 103 cells/cm2 and were further grown for 24 h before their resistance to cytotoxicity induced by the free radical inducer menadione (Sigma Chimie, Saint-Quentin, Fallavier, France) was analyzed. After 24 h of incubation in the presence of 10 Î¼m menadione, cells were harvested by trypsination, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI). After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, cell fluorescence was recorded by flow cytometric analysis using a FACScan cytometer (Beckton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France) equipped with FL1 and FL3 detectors. Excitation: 488 nm, emission filters 530 nm for GFP and 630 nm for PI. To study the influence of Hsp27 phosphorylation on its oligomeric structure, recombinant Hsp27 (11Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K.

Our analysis shows that nonphosphorylated Hsp27 exhibits an average mass of 530 kDa which correlates with an oligomer of about 24 subunits (Fig.1 A). In human glioma cells (21Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in transfected hamster cells (22Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) induction of Hsp27 phosphorylation has been shown to lead to the reduction of the oligomeric size to about 70â250 kDa. In our analysis phosphorylated Hsp27 (0.6 mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of Hsp27 monomer, about 65% of the phosphate was covalently bound to Ser-82, 22% to Ser-78, and 13% to Ser-15 (16Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar)) shows only traces of the large oligomer, and predominantly a peak corresponding to a molecular mass of about 110 kDa indicative of a Hsp27 tetramer (Fig. 1 A). Since these data were in contrast to former results for the murine homolog Hsp25, where no influence of phosphorylation on the oligomerization, as judged by gel filtration, could be detected (3Knauf U. Jakob U. Engel K. Buchner J. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we repeated the experiments for Hsp25 under the same conditions as shown above. Interestingly, even before phosphorylation, a significant amount of Hsp25 forms small oligomers. In addition, as a result of phosphorylation by MAPKAP kinase 2 (1.6 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, where 55% of the phosphate was covalently bound to Ser-86 and 45% to Ser-15, (16Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar)) we detected a significant shift to small Hsp25 oligomers (Fig. 1 B) similar to the results obtained for Hsp27. The phosphorylation dependence of Hsp27 oligomerization was further characterized by subsequently mixing the phosphorylated Hsp27 with different amounts of the nonphosphorylated protein. After an incubation of 60 min at 25 Â°C allowing the exchange of subunits between the different oligomers the samples were analyzed by gel filtration (Fig.1 C, mixing of equimolar amounts of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated, 0.6 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, Hsp27). The amounts of tetramers and larger oligomers were determined as a function of Hsp27 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D). The dissociation of the large oligomers and the formation of tetramers depends on the degree of phosphorylation with a midpoint of transition being reached at a phosphorylation level of about 0.3 mol of phosphate/mol of Hsp27 monomer and complete tetramer formation occurs above 0.6 mol of phosphate/mol of Hsp27. Since the mixing experiment leads to different oligomers and since 32P-labeled phosphorylated Hsp27 could be detected to a lower degree also in the large complexes (Fig.1 C), it is supposed that the oligomerization process is reversible and that the equilibrium is regulated by phosphorylation. We decided to replace the different phosphorylation sites of Hsp27 by aspartate to obtain mutant proteins where phosphorylation is constitutively mimicked by a negatively charged residue. This should allow to analyze the effect of phosphorylation also in cellular systems avoiding susceptibility to protein kinases and phosphatases. Three Hsp27 mutants were generated, S15D, S78D,S82D, and S15D,S78D,S82D. We did not produce all possible combinations of serine/aspartate replacement in Hsp27, since Ser-78 is not conserved in the other mammalian sHsps and this position is not phosphorylated in mouse Hsp25 or hamster Hsp27. Hence, in the limits of the molecular mimicry approach (see âDiscussionâ) these three mutants should be sufficient to further characterize the effect of phosphorylation on Hsp27 structure and function. The mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described for the wild type protein (11Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD measurements were carried out to make sure that the mutants represent properly folded proteins with a high degree of Î²-structure characteristic for sHsps (1Ehrnsperger M. Buchner J. Gaestel M. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 533-575Google Scholar). All mutants show defined CD signals when compared with chemically denatured protein indicating that overall folding was not affected by the mutations introduced. Wild type Hsp27 and the mutants show very similar spectra in the near UV region (Fig.2 A) indicating no differences in tertiary structure. Apart from small deviations between 220 and 240 nm the mutants S78D,S82D and S15D,S78D,S82D (Fig. 2 B) show far UV spectra comparable to the wild type protein and the single mutant S15D. With a maximum signal of â4000 deg cm2molâ1 in the far UV region all proteins show predominantly Î²-structure with apparently no significant changes in secondary structure due to the introduction of additional negative charges. All mutants as well as wild type Hsp27 show a temperature transition between 62 and 64 Â°C as measured by far UV spectroscopy 2M. Ehrnsperger, unpublished data. indicating that the introduced aspartates do not alter the stability of the protein. Analysis of the mutants by size exclusion gel filtration revealed that both Hsp27-S15D and Hsp27-S78D,S82D showed an increased amount of smaller oligomers while the large oligomeric structures are still dominating (Fig. 3). Only the triple mutant Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D, in which both conserved phosphorylation sites of the sHsps (Ser-15 and Ser-82) were replaced, has almost completely lost the ability to form large oligomeric structures and predominantly exists in the tetrameric form mimicking the phosphorylated protein.

However, cell lines expressing wild type APP can produce and release AÎ² primarily after internalization of APP from the cell surface (19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

Although familial mutations in APP can enhance AÎ² secretion (e.g. the Swedish KM â NL mutation; Refs. 20Perez R.G. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. J. Biol.

Gen. 1994; 6: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), almost all humans express wild type APP. Therefore, the major pathway for AÎ² production appears to involve endocytic recycling of APP from the cell surface. To date, the specific contribution of APP endocytic processing to AÎ²42 production in particular has not been established.APP endocytosis relies on signals in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. An NPXY sequence similar to that found in the C terminus of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR, 24) and the LDLR-related protein (25Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) is also found in APP. Because the tyrosine in NPXY is crucial for LDLR endocytosis (24Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russell D.W. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it has long been assumed that the homologous tyrosine in the APP NPXY motif is the principal signal for APP endocytosis. In the LDLR, an additional amino acid upstream of the NPXY motif was identified as a contributor to LDLR endocytosis, making FXNPXY the accepted LDLR internalization motif (reviewed in Ref. 27Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In the only detailed study to date, the APP endocytic signal from an APP-transferrin receptor chimera was localized to the GYENPTY motif (amino acids 737â743), with a potential additional contribution by tyrosine 709 in the YTSI motif adjacent to the membrane (28Lai A. Sisodia S. Trowbridge I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, because the APP-transferrin receptor chimera changed both the orientation and the distance of the potential APP endocytic signal with regard to the plasma membrane, it is uncertain whether this reorientation may have contributed to some of the unexpected findings in that study. In addition, the effect of the endocytic signal on AÎ²42 release, in particular, has not been investigated. We therefore undertook extensive mutagenesis studies to identify the specific amino acids required for APP endocytosis and to measure their potential effects on APP processing.Because tyrosines are associated with endocytosis of multiple proteins (29Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 30Leitinger B. Hille-Rehfeld A. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we generated point mutations of all the APP cytoplasmic domain tyrosines as well as of the amino acids G, N, and P in the GYENPTY motif. We studied the effects of these mutations in stably transfected cell lines and now report that single amino acids contribute substantially to both APP endocytosis and the release of APP secreted fragments. Of particular note, we observed that although Tyr738, the first tyrosine in GYENPTY, contributed to APP endocytosis, neither the second tyrosine in this motif (Tyr743) nor Tyr709 near the membrane were functional endocytic signals. Nonetheless, Y743A mutant cell lines exhibited slower APP turnover. Moreover, we documented a very tight correlation between the degree of APP endocytosis and AÎ² secretion. Interestingly, changes in AÎ²42 and total AÎ² secretion generally paralleled each other, suggesting that endocytic processing contributed to the secretion of both the pathogenic AÎ²42 peptide and the more abundantly produced AÎ²40 peptide by our cell lines.DISCUSSIONStably transfected CHO cells have been shown in numerous studies to process APP similarly to other cells (e.g. Refs. 7Haass C.

First, we have identified the tetrapeptide motif, YXNP (amino acids 738â741 in APP751 or 682â685 in APP695) in the APP C terminus as the dominant APP endocytic signal. Second, we observed that whereas mutation of Tyr743 in the NPXY motif had no effect on APP endocytosis, this mutation significantly altered metabolism (half-life) of full-length APP. Third, we identified dramatic and parallel effects on the secretion of APPs, total AÎ², and AÎ²42 in association with C-terminal mutations that altered normal APP endocytosis.Some APP holoprotein, including cell surface APP, is found in clathrin-coated vesicles (5Nordstedt C. Caporaso G.L. Thyberg J. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 608-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yamazaki T. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that APP utilizes a clathrin-based endocytic pathway. Many integral membrane proteins, including APP, undergo continued recycling and trafficking throughout their lifetime, a phenomenon common to cell surface receptors (extensively reviewed in Ref. 27Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). A key receptor molecule used to define endocytic recycling is the LDLR (e.g. 24, 26, 27). Based on its role in LDLR endocytosis, NPXY has been assumed to be the signal for APP endocytosis (24Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the four amino acids of this NPXY motif, an aromatic amino acid residue upstream of NPXY also contributes to LDLR endocytosis, making the recognized endocytic signal for this molecule the hexapeptide motif FXNPXY (24Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once FXNPXY had been defined as the LDLR endocytic motif, an analogous sequence in the APP C terminus, YENPTY, became the primary focus for APP endocytosis and trafficking studies (19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lai A. Sisodia S. Trowbridge I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although studies suggested that the APP endocytic signal was localized within this YXNPXY motif, the specific amino acids underlying APP endocytosis remained undefined. Furthermore, potential contributions to endocytosis had also been suggested for the proximal tyrosine Tyr709 (in the YTSI motif), and for the glycine (Gly737) in GYENPTY of APP (28Lai A. Sisodia S. Trowbridge I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, we systematically analyzed the residues thought to contribute to APP endocytosis using a well characterized method for evaluating APP endocytosis (10Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In our study, we show that mutations of Tyr, Asn, or Pro or a double mutation of Tyr and Pro but not a mutation of the C-terminal Tyr in YENPTY significantly diminish APP endocytosis. Point mutations within the YXNP motif all reduced APP internalization dramatically. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that the four amino acid sequence, YENP, is the major signal for clathrin-mediated APP endocytosis. The single amino acid Asn740 appears to be a major component of the APP endocytic signal because the N740A mutation alone reduced endocytosis to a level similar to that observed for cells (ÎC) lacking nearly the entire APP cytoplasmic domain.In addition, our data showed that neither Tyr709 nor Gly737 contributed to APP internalization in our studies, suggesting that these amino acids, like Tyr743 in NPXY, are not part of the APP endocytic signal. In native APP, Tyr709 lies 5 amino acids from the plasma membrane, rather than 46 amino acids from the plasma membrane as was the case in the reported APP-transferrin-receptor chimera (28Lai A. Sisodia S. Trowbridge I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and this may explain why the YTSI tyrosine promoted internalization in the latter model. Although N-terminal ectodomain residues of APP may play a role in basolateral sorting in polarized epithelial cells (37De Strooper B. Craessaerts K. Dewachter I. Moechars D. Greenberg B. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), support for the YTSI tyrosine subserving basolateral sorting of APP has also been shown (33Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It may be that the YTSI tyrosine (Tyr709 in APP751 and Tyr653 in APP695) interacts with the newly identified PAT1 molecule (a protein with kinesin homology that interacts with microtubules) to sort APP to the basolateral compartment in polarized epithelial cells (40Zheng P. Eastman J. Vande Pol S. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Regarding the role of Tyr743 in APP processing we found that Tyr743 in the NPXY motif is not an APP endocytic signal and that cells overexpressing APP with this mutation produced normal levels of AÎ². Although endocytosis was not measured in their studies, other investigators using cells with mutations of the NPXY tyrosine have also observed normal AÎ² secretion from their cell lines (41Jacobsen J.S. Spruyt M.A. Brown A.M. Sahasrabudhe S.R. Blume A.J. Vitek M.P. Muenkel H.A. Sonnenberg-Reines J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8376-8382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wild-Bode C.

Although therefore not an endocytic signal, Tyr743, when mutated, reduced the otherwise rapid turnover of APP. Although the APP half-life was longer in Y743A cells, APP was converted from immature to fully glycosylated APP similarly to WT and Y738A APP, suggesting that trafficking through the Golgi compartment was normal for these cell lines. Thus, we speculate that Tyr743 may function, in part, as a lysosomal targeting signal for APP.We previously showed that cells expressing C-terminal deletions have reduced levels of total AÎ² secretion (19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Perez R.G. Koo E.H. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Nishimura T. Takeda M. Wisniewski H. Alzheimer's Disease: Biology, Diagnosis and Therapeutics. John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., London1997: 407-416Google Scholar). As anticipated, total AÎ² release was again diminished by cells expressing mutations that reduced APP endocytosis. Specifically, Y738A, N740A, P741A, Y738A/P741A, and ÎC cell lines all had dramatically reduced total AÎ² secretion as measured by immunoprecipitation. No decrease in total AÎ² secretion was observed for Y709A, G737A, or Y743A, cell lines that also had normal APP endocytosis. These data strongly reinforce the importance of the endocytic pathway for the generation of total AÎ² released by cells.When we measured AÎ²42 secretion by sandwich ELISA we were surprised to see that in parallel with the diminution of total AÎ² secretion, the Y738A, N740A, P741A, Y738A/P741A, and ÎC cell lines also secreted less AÎ²42. This unexpected finding suggested that processing of APP in the endocytic pathway contributes substantially to AÎ²42 secretion. However, non-neuronal (20Perez R.G. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. J. Biol.

Because several studies have identified AÎ²42 production in the early compartments of the secretory processing pathway (42Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J.

Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), we were surprised to see that endocytic processing appeared to contribute significantly to the pool of AÎ²42 secreted from our mutant cell lines. However, it is not known whether the intracellular AÎ² identified in the earlier studies ultimately gets secreted by the cells. Our results suggest that perhaps most AÎ²42 does not become secreted, because the level of AÎ²42 released into the medium was strongly dependent on the endocytic signal. Because we did not measure intracellular AÎ² species in our current studies, measurements for total AÎ², AÎ²40, and AÎ²42 in cell lysates or in isolated endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi vesicles of our C-terminal mutants will be required to determine whether or not a deficiency in endocytosis can affect the various intracellular AÎ² species. Furthermore, it should be noted that although our data indicate that mutations that affected APP internalization reduced AÎ² secretion, whether the same mutations may have affected exocytic APP trafficking remains to be elucidated.Although it is unknown how the amino acids in the YXNP motif mediate endocytosis, it is appealing to speculate that it may occur by interaction with APP-binding proteins such as BP1, X11, or Fe65 (reviewed in Ref. 51Russo T. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. DeCandia P. De Renzis S. Zambrano N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recent data in which APP processing was assessed in cells overexpressing X11 or Fe65 (52Borg J.P. Yang Y. De Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 53Guenette S. Chen J. Ferland A. Tanzi R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: S72Google Scholar) suggest that the interaction of APP with these molecules may occur in different pathways and that AÎ² production is perturbed by altered protein-protein interactions of this sort. X11 may bind to APP primarily in the secretory pathway because overexpression of X11Î± reduced APPs cleaved by Î±-secretase (52Borg J.P. Yang Y. De Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), possibly because of reduced amounts of APP arriving at the cell surface. Conversely, interaction with Fe65 may occur in an early stage of the endocytic pathway because overexpression of human Fe65 (hFe65L) in H4 neuroglioma cells increased APPs secretion (53Guenette S. Chen J. Ferland A. Tanzi R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: S72Google Scholar), an effect possibly related to retention of APP at or near the cell surface, where it could undergo enhanced Î±-secretase cleavage, as recently reported for MDCK cells overexpressing rat Fe65 (54Sabo S.L. Lanier L.M. Ikin A.F. Khorkova O. Sahasrabudhe S. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7952-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This enhancement of Î±-secretase cleavage may be associated with APP binding to caveolin-1 within plasma membrane microdomains (55Ikezu T. Trapp B.D. Song K.S. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10485-10495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Additionally, an NPXY motif-dependent interaction between APP and the receptor LDLR-related protein by way of the cytosolic adaptor proteins mDab (mammalian Disabled protein) and Fe65 has also been identified that may affect APP trafficking and processing (56Trommsdorff M. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). These possibilities require additional experimental validation.In conclusion, our data indicate that the dominant signal for APP endocytosis resides in the motif YXNP, that other signals in the APP C terminus contribute to different APP processing/trafficking pathways, and that endocytic trafficking of APP contributes importantly to both APPs and AÎ² secretion. Further understanding of the mechanisms by which cells convert APP into secreted fragments may provide new insights for designing or testing the efficacy of inhibitors of AÎ² generation and secretion as potential treatments for AD. APP1 is a transmembrane protein with homology to glycosylated cell surface receptors (1Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K.

Here we report that apoptosis results in the caspase-dependent cleavage of protein kinase C-Î´ (PKCÎ´) to a 40-kDa fragment, the appearance of which correlates with a 9-fold increase in PKCÎ´ activity. To understand the function of activated PKCÎ´ in apoptosis, we have used the PKCÎ´-specific inhibitor, rottlerin. Pretreatment of parotid C5 cells with rottlerin prior to the addition of etoposide blocks the appearance of the apoptotic morphology, the sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and inactivation of extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2. Inhibition of PKCÎ´ also partially inhibits caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Immunoblot analysis shows that the PKCÎ´ cleavage product does not accumulate in parotid C5 cells treated with rottlerin and etoposide together, suggesting that the catalytic activity of PKCÎ´ may be required for cleavage. PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 activities also increase during etoposide-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of these two isoforms with GoÌ6976 slightly suppresses the apoptotic morphology, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation, but has no effect on the sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or inactivation of extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2.

A variety of studies indicate that specific isoforms of PKC may be either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic, depending on the stimulus and cell type (23Lucas M. Sanchez-Margalet V. Gen.

The atypical PKC isoforms, PKCÎ» and PKCÎ¶, have likewise been shown to protect against apoptosis in many cell types (33Pongracz J. Tuffley W. Johnson G.D. Deacon E.M. Burnett D. Stockley R.A.

In support of a pro-apoptotic role for PKC, activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or overexpression of PKCÎ±, can induce apoptosis in prostatic carcinoma cells (36Zhao X.

A recent report also shows that cleavage and activation of PKCÎ¸ by caspase-3 occurs in U937 cells in response to agents that induce apoptosis (44Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20317-20320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The present studies were undertaken to ask if specific isoforms of PKC regulate apoptosis in salivary acinar cells in response to genotoxic agents. These studies demonstrate that PKCÎ´ is activated during etoposide-induced apoptosis in a cell line derived from parotid gland acinar cells and that the activity of this isoform is essential for complete apoptosis in these cells. PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 are likewise activated following treatment of parotid acinar cells with etoposide; however, the contribution of these activated isoforms to the apoptotic process appears to be more modest, suggesting that specific isoforms of PKC may have distinct functions in cell death. The isolation of the immortalized salivary parotid C5 cell line has been described elsewhere (45Quissell D.O. Barzen K.A. Redman R.S. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1998; 34: 58-67Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on Primaria 60-mm culture dishes (Falcon Plastics, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1 mixture) supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, 5 Î¼g/ml transferrin, 1.1 Î¼m hydrocortisone, 0.1 Î¼mretinoic acid, 2.0 nm triiodothyronine, 5 Î¼g/ml insulin, 80 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), 5 mml-glutamine, 50 Î¼g/ml gentamicin sulfate, and a trace element mixture (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise indicated. Adherent and floating cells were scraped into the culture media, collected by centrifugation (3,000 Ãg for 10 min), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of JNK lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, and 4 Î¼g/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). The lysate was allowed to sit on ice for 30 min and then clarified by spinning at 12,500 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated Savant SRF13K microcentrifuge. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay kit purchased from Bio-Rad. Cell lysates (25â50 Î¼g) were resolved on a 10% gel, transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted with the desired antibody as described previously (46Reyland M.E. Williams D.L. White E.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C780-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by autoradiography was used to detect the signal. Antibodies to all PKC isoforms were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All anti-PKC antibodies recognize epitopes in the C-terminal portion of the protein. The anti-active ERK2 antibody, which cross-reacts with both phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2, was obtained from Promega Biotechnology (Madison, WI). An anti- mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody, which cross-reacts with both ERK1 and ERK2, was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). PKCÎ±, PKCÎ²1, and PKCÎ´ enzymatic activity was assayed using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay as follows. Cytosolic protein (0.25 or 0.5 mg), prepared as described for immunoblotting, was immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 Â°C using 2 Î¼g of anti-PKCÎ± (C-20), anti-PKCÎ²1 (C-16), or PKCÎ´ (C-17) antibody. The antigen-antibody complexes were collected by incubation with Sepharose-protein A (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 Â°C, washed 3 times in JNK lysis buffer, 3 times in 2Ã kinase buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 Î¼m ATP, and 2.5 mm CaCl2), and resuspended in 20 Î¼l of 2Ã kinase buffer. To prevent contamination with activated PKCÎ´, immunoprecipitation of PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 was done using cell lysates that were pre-cleared by immunoprecipitation with anti-PKCÎ´ as described above. Twenty Î¼l of reaction buffer (0.4 mg of H1 histone (Sigma), 50 Î¼g/ml phosphatidylserine, 4.1 Î¼m dioleoylglycerol, and 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mm)) was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 Â°C. In some experiments phosphatidylserine and dioleoylglycerol was omitted from the reaction buffer. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2Ã SDS sample buffer, boiled, and the reaction products resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The extent of H1 histone phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography and in some experiments quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). DNA fragmentation was assayed using a Cell Death Detection Assay kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. This assay detects the appearance of histone-associated low molecular weight DNA in the cytoplasm of cells and was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The activation of caspase-3 was detected with the Caspase-3 Cellular Activity Assay Kit PLUS obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) which usesN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroaniline (Ac-DEVD.FMK-pNA) as a substrate. The assays were conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Z-VAD.FMK (Z-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)-CH2F) and DEVD.FMK (Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-(O-methyl)-CH2F) were obtained from Enzyme Systems (Livermore, CA). The GST-c-Jun-(1â79) expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Lynn Heasley (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO), and the fusion proteins were prepared as described (14Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). JNK activation was assayed using the GST-Jun kinase assay (47Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C.A. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). To collect both adherent and floating cells, cells were scraped into the culture media, collected by centrifugation (3,000 Ã g for 10 min), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of JNK lysis buffer. The lysate was allowed to sit on ice for 30 min and then clarified by spinning at 12,500 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated Savant SRF13K microcentrifuge. For the assay a 100-Î¼l volume of a 10% suspension of GST-c-Jun-(1â79) was added to 300 Î¼g of total cellular protein in a final volume of 1 ml and incubated for 2 h at 4 Â°C. The beads were then washed three times with 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100. Forty Î¼l of 50 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMgCl2, and 20 Î¼m ATP containing 10 mCi [Î³-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol in the final reaction) was added to the washed beads, and the reaction was incubated at 30 Â°C for 20 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 Î¼l of 5Ã SDS sample buffer, boiled, and the reaction products resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The position of GST-Jun was determined by staining the gel, and the extent of GST-Jun phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. Apoptosis occurs in a series of well defined steps that involve specific biochemical changes to the cell. We have previously examined the ability of etoposide to induce apoptosis in the parotid C5 cell salivary acinar cell line. 2S. M. Anderson, M. E. Reyland, S. Hunter, L. M. Deisher, K. A. Barzen, and D. O. Gwissel, submitted for publication. These cells were derived from the rat parotid gland and retain many characteristics displayed by parotid acinar cells in vivo (45Quissell D.O. Barzen K.A. Redman R.S. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1998; 34: 58-67Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was demonstrated by the appearance of cytoplasmic blebbing and nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation.2In addition, etoposide induced activation of JNK and suppressed accumulation of activated ERK1 and ERK2.2 The current studies were undertaken to explore the contribution of the PKC family of enzymes to specific events in the apoptotic process. As an initial approach we asked if treatment of parotid C5 cells with etoposide results in changes in the abundance of specific PKC isoforms. Parotid C5 cells strongly express PKCÎ±, PKCÎ´, and PKCÎ¶, whereas much weaker expression of PKCÎ²1 and PKCÎµ is detected. Expression of PKCÎ²11, PKCÎ³, PKCÎ·, and PKCÎ» is not detectable in this cell line. 3Reyland, M. E., and Matassa, A. A. (1999)Cell Death Differ. 6, 454â462. As shown in Fig.5 B, by 18 h of treatment with 50 Î¼metoposide, >80% of parotid C5 cells display an apoptotic morphology. Fig. 1 shows an immunoblot of untreated parotid C5 cells or cells treated with 50 Î¼m etoposide for up to 18 h, and probed for expression of PKCÎ±, PKCÎ²1, PKCÎ´, PKCÎµ, and PKCÎ¶. As seen here, the expression of PKCÎ± protein (panel A), and PKCÎ²1 protein (panel B) increases by 4 h and continues to increase up to 18 h after the addition of etoposide. PKCÎ± expression increased about 2â3-fold in 5 similar experiments, whereas PKCÎ²1 expression is increased about 3â5-fold in 4 similar experiments. In contrast, the abundance of PKCÎµ (panel C) decreases slightly in etoposide-treated cells by about 12 h. Expression of full-length PKCÎ´ protein also decreases during apoptosis, whereas a cleavage product of approximately 40 kDa begins to accumulate by 4 h following the addition of etoposide (panel D). Accumulation of this cleavage product correlates with loss of the full-length PKCÎ´ protein (Fig. 1,panel D, and Fig. 2). Expression of PKCÎ¶ (panel E) likewise decreases slightly following treatment with etoposide, and this decrease correlates with the accumulation of a small amount of a PKCÎ¶ cleavage product of about 40 kDa. No PKCÎ±, PKCÎ²1, or PKCÎµ cleavage products were detected (data not shown).Figure 1Changes in the levels of PKC isoforms following etoposide treatment.

To determine if cleavage of PKCÎ´ is caspase-dependent, we utilized the cell-permeable, irreversible, caspase inhibitors Z-VAD.FMK and DEVD.FMK. Parotid C5 cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 30 min prior to the addition of etoposide or 1-Î²-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). As seen in Fig. 2, ara-C treatment results in accumulation of a PKCÎ´ cleavage product which appears to be identical in molecular weight to the product generated in response to etoposide. Inclusion of either caspase inhibitor blocks cleavage of PKCÎ´ in response to ara-C or etoposide, although Z-VAD.FMK is more potent. Z-VAD.FMK is thought to inhibit apoptosis at an early stage, prior to activation of caspases-2, -3, -6, or -7, which may explain its higher potency (49Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). Neither caspase inhibitor blocked accumulation of the 40-kDa PKCÎ¶ cleavage product, indicating that generation of this fragment is not caspase-dependent (data not shown). Pretreatment of parotid C5 cells with Z-VAD.FMK or DEVD.FMK likewise did not block the increase in PKCÎ± protein accumulation in apoptotic parotid C5 cells (data not shown). To determine if the increased abundance of PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 protein, or the cleavage of PKCÎ´, results in an increase in PKC activity, immunoprecipitation kinase assays were performed on the cell lysates used in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 3 A, the activity of PKCÎ´, as determined by its ability to phosphorylate histone H1, increases by 4 h of etoposide treatment, coincident with generation of the cleavage fragment. By 18 h of treatment PKCÎ´ activity is increased 9-fold as determined by quantification of 3 similar experiments. Notably, this increase in activity does not require the addition of lipid activators to the in vitroreaction (Fig. 3 A, âLipid), suggesting that the C-terminal cleavage product generated during apoptosis represents the free catalytic domain of the molecule. Since accumulation of the PKCÎ´ cleavage product is caspase-dependent, we asked if pretreatment of parotid C5 cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.FMK could block the increase in PKCÎ´ activity observed. As seen in Fig.3 B, pretreatment with Z-VAD.FMK prior to the addition of etoposide completely blocks the etoposide-induced increase in lipid-independent PKCÎ´ activity. This indicates that cleavage of PKCÎ´ is required for the increase in lipid-independent kinase activity seen following etoposide-induced apoptosis. To determine if the increase in PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 protein seen during apoptosis correlates with an increase in kinase activity, immunoprecipitation kinase assays for these isoforms were performed on the cell lysates used in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig.4 A, the activity of PKCÎ± increases dramatically following the addition of etoposide. Quantification of histone phosphorylation of 3 similar experiments indicates that PKCÎ± activity increases 3â8-fold during etoposide-induced apoptosis. In some experiments the increase in PKCÎ± activity appears to exceed the increase in PKCÎ± protein expression (see Fig. 1 A), suggesting that PKCÎ± activity may be regulated by additional mechanisms. As seen in Fig. 4 B, PKCÎ²1 activity increases 5â6-fold following the addition of etoposide. In the case of PKCÎ²1, however, the increase in kinase activity closely parallels the observed increased in protein abundance (compare Fig. 1 to Fig. 4). Unlike PKCÎ´, the increased activity of both PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 during apoptosis is dependent on the addition of exogenous lipid to the kinase reaction (data not shown). The experiments described above demonstrate that specific isoforms of PKC are activated during etoposide-induced apoptosis. Although activation of PKC by apoptotic stimuli may be important, the fundamental question is whether the activation of these molecules is required for apoptosis to occur. To address the role of PKCÎ´, PKCÎ±, and PKCÎ²1 activation in apoptosis, we have examined the effect of isoform-specific inhibitors on biochemical and morphologic markers of apoptosis. To inhibit specifically PKCÎ´ in vivo, we have used rottlerin. The IC50 of rottlerin for inhibition of PKCÎ´ is reported to be 3â6 Î¼m, whereas PKCÎ±, PKCÎ², and PKCÎ³ are inhibited at significantly higher concentrations (40 Î¼m) (50Gschwendt M. Muller H.-J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). To inhibit PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 we have used the calcium-dependent PKC isoform inhibitor GoÌ6976. The IC50 of GoÌ6976 for inhibition of the PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²1 is reported to be 2â6 nm, whereas no inhibition of PKCÎ´ is seen even at Î¼m concentrations (51Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H.

In this report, pharmacological properties of the three G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for SPP, EDG-1, -3, and -5 are characterized using aXenopus oocyte expression system, which lacks endogenous SPP receptors. Microinjection of the EDG-3 and EDG-5 but not EDG-1 mRNA conferred SPP-responsive intracellular calcium transients; however, the EDG-5 response was quantitatively much less. Co-expression of EDG-1 receptor with the chimeric GÎ±qi protein conferred SPP responsiveness. GÎ±qi or GÎ±qco-injection also potentiated the EDG-5 and EDG-3 mediated responses to SPP. These data suggest that SPP receptors couple differentially to the Gq and Gi pathway. All three GPCRs were also activated by sphingosylphosphorylcholine, albeit at higher concentrations. None of the other related sphingolipids tested stimulated or blocked SPP-induced calcium responses. However, suramin, a polycyclic anionic compound, selectively antagonized SPP-activated calcium transients in EDG-3 expressing oocytes with an IC50of 22 Î¼m, suggesting that it is an antagonist selective for the EDG-3 GPCR isotype. We conclude that the three SPP receptors signal differentially by coupling to different G-proteins. Furthermore, because only EDG-3 was antagonized by suramin, variations in receptor structure may determine differences in antagonist selectivity.

Specifically, it is not clear whether various actions of SPP are due to its role as an extracellular mediator that signals via plasma membrane receptors or whether it acts intracellularly as a second messenger molecule. However, these possibilities need not be mutually exclusive. It is nevertheless important to define specific biological responses regulated by SPP as an extracellular mediator and those regulated by intracellular action. Recently, the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) EDG-1 was identified as a plasma membrane receptor for SPP (10Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Specifically, SPP bound to EDG-1 with a K d of â¼ 8 nm, stimulated Gi-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, induced the small GTPase Rho-dependent adherens junction assembly and increases in P-cadherin levels (10Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Two independent groups also concluded that EDG-1 is a Gi-coupled receptor for SPP (14Zondag G.C.M. Postma F.R. van Etten I. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem.

EDG-1 was originally cloned as an endothelial differentiation gene from phorbol myristic acetate-treated differentiating human endothelial cells (16Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that platelet-derived SPP, which is secreted during thrombosis, could regulate endothelial cell signaling events via the EDG-1 receptor. EDG-1 is a prototype of a subfamily of GPCRs, whose known members include EDG-2/VZG-1 (17Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), EDG-3 (18Yamaguchi F. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Brenner S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chun and colleagues (17Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) showed that EDG-2 (which they termed as VZG-1) is a high affinity receptor for LPA, and regulated Gi- and Gq-dependent events (22Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A highly related receptor, EDG-4 was cloned and was shown to be an LPA receptor, which potently stimulated the Gq/PLCÎ²/calcium signaling pathway (19An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). EDG-3 and EDG-5, which are closer in sequence identity to EDG-1, responded to low concentrations of SPP in a Xenopusoocyte-based calcium efflux assay and serum response factor-based transcriptional activation assay in Jurkat T-cells (19An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These data suggest that EDG-3 and EDG-5, like EDG-1 are high affinity SPP receptors and that EDG-2 and EDG-4 are high affinity LPA receptors. The response of EDG-6 to LPA and SPP is not known. The three known receptors for SPP, EDG-1, -3, and -5 exhibit overlapping as well as distinct patterns of expression in various tissues (16Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Okazaki H. Ishizaka N. Sakurai T. Kurokawa K. Goto K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although expression studies have by and large focused on low resolution studies, i.e. whole tissue Northern blots, in situ hybridization studies indicate widespread expression patterns of EDG-1 and EDG-5 (25Liu C.H. Hla T. Genomics. 1997; 43: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26MacLennan A.J. Browe C.S. Gaskin A.A. Lado D.C. Shaw G. Mol. Cell.

Genomics. 1998; 53: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Various cell lines in tissue culture express one or more of the EDG receptors. These data raise the question of the role of multiple receptors for SPP. Several cell systems were tested for endogenous expression of the SPP receptor transcripts. All cell lines tested, namely, HEK293, Jurkat, HEL, HepG2, vascular smooth muscle cells, (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) expressed one or more of EDG-1, -3, or 5. 2N. Ancellin and T. Hla, unpublished observations. Although some cell lines expressed low levels, for example Jurkat and HepG2 cells, prolonged exposure of Northern blots yielded detectable signals. Also SPP-induced rapid intracellular calcium response has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells, mouse NIH 3T3 cells, monkey COS-1 cells, human bladder carcinoma J82 cells, and rat C6 glioma cells, among others. Indeed, most cell lines tested exhibited biological responses to SPP such as cell rounding, ERK-2 activation, proliferation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase (13Hla T. Leem M.J. Ancellin N.

Thus, establishment of a truly negative heterologous expression system is an important step to molecularly characterize each SPP receptor isotype. In this report, we characterize the SPP receptors in aXenopus oocyte functional signaling assay by switching the intracellular signaling pathways of the SPP receptors with chimeric GÎ± proteins. Furthermore, we examine the signaling and pharmacological properties of EDG-1, -3, and -5 GPCRs for SPP. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (ffa-BSA), collagenase type IA, O-phosphorylethanolamine, phosphorylcholine chloride were purchased from Sigma. Sphingosine, dimethylsphingosine, SPP, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), sphingomyelin,N-acetylsphingosine (C2), N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6), N-palmitoylsphingosine (C16),N-octanoylsphingosine 1-phosphate (C8-P), suramin sodium were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sphingolipids were added to cells as a complex with 0.4% ffa-BSA in OR2 buffer (5 mm Hepes, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.7). Cap analogue and T7 polymerase are from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The cDNA encoding the different receptors were cloned by polymerase chain reaction was performed with a Pfu/Taqpolymerase mix (1-10 ratio) on human heart cDNA for EDG-3 and on rat heart cDNA for EDG-5. Primers used were 5â²-ACTCGAGGCAACTGCCCTCCCGCCGCGT-3â² (sense) and 5â²-ACTTAGATCAGTCGAGCTTGCAGAAGATCC-3â² (antisense) for the human EDG-3 receptor, 5â²-AAACTCGAGGGCGGTTTATACTCAGAGTAC-3â² (sense) and 5â²-ATCTAGATCAGTCGACGACCACTGTGTTGCCCTCCAG-3â² (antisense) for the rat EDG-5 receptor, respectively. EDG-3 and EDG-5 polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned in frame with an N-terminal Flag peptide (DYKDDDDK) into pcDNA3.1Neo and pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). DNA sequence was confirmed by double-stranded sequencing. Human EDG-1 receptor cDNA has been described previously (16Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1Neo. cDNA coding for the Î²2-adrenergic receptor was a generous gift from Dr. J. M. Elalouf (28Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Tessiot C. Bellanger A.C. Dublineau I. de Rouffignac C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Plasmid vectors containing GÎ±qi, GÎ±qs and mouse GÎ±q cDNA have been kindly provided by Dr. B. Conklin (29Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Synthetic complementary messenger Cap RNA (ccRNA) corresponding to the different receptors and G protein Î± subunits was produced as described previously (30Ancellin N. Morel A. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase in the presence of the m7G(5â²)ppp(5â²)G Cap analogue. ccRNA was quantified by gel electrophoresis and was stored at â70 Â°C until use. Female albinoXenopus laevis (NASCO laboratory, Fort Atkinson, WI) were cold anesthetized, and stage V and VI albino oocytes were obtained by laparotomy (31Barnard E.A. Bilde G. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Neurochemistry: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford and Washington, DC1987: 243-270Google Scholar). Defolliculation was performed for â¼2 h with gentle rocking at 20 Â°C in a calcium-free OR2 buffer containing 2 mg/ml of collagenase type IA. Then oocytes were gently rocked for 15 min in a potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, followed by an extensive wash with plain OR2 supplemented with 0.1% ffa-BSA. After manual selection, oocytes were maintained in OR2, 0.01% ffa-BSA at 18 Â°C until use. Each oocyte was injected on the same day with 20 nl of ccRNA sample at 1 Î¼g/ml in sterile water. Injection was performed with a glass micropipette connected to a pneumatic microinjector Picopritzer II (General Valve Corp., Faifield, NJ). Cytoplasmic calcium mobilization was detected as light emission generated by the photoprotein aequorin (obtained from Dr. J. Blinks) essentially as described previously (30Ancellin N. Morel A. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected with 20 nl of 1 mg/ml aequorin in calcium-free water. Each oocyte was individually placed in a 3-ml vial containing 200â450 Î¼l of OR2, 0.01% ffa-BSA. Light emission was detected by a luminometer (Turner Design). Results are expressed as relative light units. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with oocytes from different frogs. Oocytes were homogenized with a 25-gauge needle in the buffer containing 30% sucrose, 75 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA. Extracts were centrifuged (900 Ãg for 5 min and 10,000 Ã g for 10 min) to clarify yolk proteins, diluted to 10% sucrose and finally centrifuged at 21,000 Ã g for 10 min to pellet the crude membrane fraction. Membranes were solubilized directly in the Laemmli sample buffer and proteins were electrophoresed on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), blocked overnight with 5% dry fat milk dissolved in PBS, and immunoblot analysis was done using a polyclonal antibody against a mammalian GÎ±q (kindly provided by Dr. Laurinda Jaffe, Dept. of Physiology, University of Connecticut Health Center). We searched for a system that lacks any endogenous response to SPP. As previously reported (30Ancellin N. Morel A. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), defolliculated oocytes injected with the photoprotein aequorin constitute a highly sensitive assay for the Gq-linked receptors, inducing rises in intracellular calcium via the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. We confirmed that oocytes contain an endogenous Gq-linked LPA receptor, which induced strong intracellular calcium rises when stimulated with nanomolar concentrations of LPA (32Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Moorman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C896-C900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, even micromolar concentrations of SPP were inactive suggesting that SPP receptors are not expressed in oocytes or, if present, are unable to couple to the Gq pathway (data not shown). To address these issues, we used the G-protein chimeras GÎ±qi and GÎ±qs, which couple Gi- and Gs-protein-coupled receptors to the Gq/phospholipase-CÎ² pathway, respectively (29Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). When oocytes were microinjected with only chimeric GÎ±qi and GÎ±qs ccRNAs, allowed to express these proteins, and subsequently stimulated with nanomolar-micromolar SPP, calcium rises were not induced. These data suggest that oocytes do not express any detectable calcium-coupled SPP receptors linked to the Gq, Gqi, or Gqs pathway. Next, injection of human EDG-1, human EDG-3, and rat EDG-5 ccRNA, followed by stimulation with SPP was performed. As shown in Fig.1 A, strong intracellular calcium increases were induced upon expression of the EDG-3 receptor and stimulation of the cells with 50 nm SPP. Although weaker, nanomolar concentrations of SPP also induced significant calcium increases in EDG-5-expressing oocytes. In contrast, EDG-1 expression did not yield any SPP-induced calcium responses. To detect the functionality of the human EDG-1 expressed in oocytes, we co-expressed the receptor with the chimeric G-protein GÎ±qi or GÎ±qs and stimulated the cells with SPP. As shown in Fig. 1 B, GÎ±qi but not GÎ±qs nor GÎ±q allowed EDG-1 to couple efficiently to the Gq/PLCÎ²/calcium pathway. As a control for the functional GÎ±qs chimera, stimulation by 1 Î¼m isoproterenol of oocytes co-expressing the Î²2-adrenergic receptor and the GÎ±qs chimera protein induced calcium mobilization (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, to determine whether the microinjected Gq was overexpressed and indeed functional, we co-expressed EDG-1, -3, and -5, respectively, with the mouse GÎ±q. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, potentiation of SPP-induced calcium rise was observed only for the EDG-3 and -5 receptors. Further, immunoblot analysis (Fig.1 C, inset) shows significant expression of the transfected mammalian GÎ±q in oocytes. Co-injection of GÎ±qi ccRNA (but not GÎ±qs) also greatly potentiated the EDG-5 response to SPP (Fig. 1 D). However, EDG-5, in contrast to EDG-1, can couple to the XenopusGq-like protein, albeit less efficiently than EDG-3. Likewise, co-expression of GÎ±qi with the EDG-3 receptor potentiated the calcium response induced by SPP (data not shown). Thus, aequorin-loaded oocytes expressing EDG-3 alone or EDG-1 and EDG-5 with the GÎ±qi protein, constitute a sensitive assay to investigate the specific stimulation of SPP (or any agonists) on these receptors. Dose-response analysis of SPP stimulation of the three receptors was conducted next. As shown in Fig.2 A, SPP stimulated calcium responses with an EC50 of 2.7, 5, and 7.1 nmfor EDG-1, -3, and -5 receptors, respectively. The SPP response was also saturable, indicative of a receptor-dependent response. Related sphingolipids as well as the degradation products of SPP catabolism were also tested for potential agonistic effects. As summarized in Table I, sphingosine, dimethylsphingosine, C2-ceramide, C16-ceramide, C8-ceramide 1-phosphate, sphinganine, dihydrosphingosine, sphingomyelin, phosphocholine, and phosphoethanolamine as well as the polycyclic compound suramin did not stimulate any of the EDG-1, EDG-3, or EDG-5 receptors. In contrast, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, a related bioactive sphingolipid, stimulated all three receptors (Fig.2 B). The EC50 values for SPC were determined to be 11.6, 5.2, and 11.8 Î¼m, for EDG-1, -3, and -5, respectively.Table ISpecificity of SPP as an agonist on EDG-1, -3, and -5 receptorsEDG-1 + GqiEDG-3EDG-5 + GqiSphingosine, 10 Î¼m<5%<5%<5%DimethylSphingosine, 10 Î¼m<5%<5%<5%Ceramide 2, 10 Î¼m<5%<5%<5%Ceramide 16, 10 Î¼m<5%<5%<5%Ceramide-8 1-phosphate, 500 nm<5%<5%<5%Sphinganine, 10 Î¼m<5%<5%<5%Dihydrosphingosine, 10 Î¼m<5%<5%<5%Sphingomyelin, 10 Î¼m<5%NDaND, not determined.<5%Phosphocholine, 1 mmND<5%<5%Phosphoethanolamine, 1 mm<5%<5%<5%Suramin, 1 mg/ml (700 Î¼m)<5%<5%<5%Sphingosine 1-phosphate100% Â± 20.85100% Â± 12.98100% Â± 14.55Aequorin-loaded oocytes expressing EDG-1 + GÎ±qi, EDG-3, or EDG-5 + GÎ±qi were stimulated with 10 Î¼msphingosine, 10 Î¼m dimethylsphingosine, 10 Î¼m dihydrosphingosine, 10 Î¼mC2-ceramide, 10 Î¼m C6-ceramide, 10 Î¼m C16-ceramide, 1 Î¼m ceramide-8 1-phosphate, 10 Î¼m sphingomyelin, 1 mmphosphorylcholine, 1 mm O-phosphorylethanolamine, or 1 mg/ml suramin, and light emission was integrated for 120 s.

Results are expressed as percent relative light units induced by 5 nm SPP on the respective receptor. Results are mean Â± S.E. for at least ten oocytes. Next, we tested whether related compounds acted as antagonists for SPP action. Oocytes expressing respective receptors (with chimeric GÎ±qi for EDG-1 and EDG-5) were pretreated with the test compounds for 150 s, followed by stimulation with 5 nmSPP, and calcium responses were quantitated. As shown in Fig.3, none of the sphingolipids or phosphoethanolamine, the breakdown product of SPP, antagonized any of the EDG-1, -3, or -5 receptors. Suramin, an anionic polycyclic compound that blocks many receptor/ligand interactions including the bioactive lipids such as LPA and SPP, was also tested. As shown in Fig. 3, suramin antagonized SPP activation of EDG-3 receptor but not EDG-1 or EDG-5. Dose response analysis of suramin action is shown in Fig.4 A. Selective antagonism of SPP action on the EDG-3 receptor was observed with an IC50 of â¼22 Î¼m (0.03 mg/ml). The action of suramin seems directed at receptor/ligand interaction rather than the receptor/G-protein interaction because (i) EDG-5 was not antagonized whether GÎ±qi was co-injected or not, and (ii) the effect of suramin on oocytes co-expressing GÎ±qi and EDG-3 are identical to those expressing EDG-3 alone (data not shown). Dose-response analysis of SPP in suramin-treated oocytes shows that it antagonizes EDG-3 with a competitive isotherm (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that suramin acts as a subtype-specific functional antagonist of EDG-3.Figure 4Differential effect of suramin on SPP activation of receptors.

Recent identification of EDG-1 as a high affinity GPCR for SPP has provided a molecular basis for SPP as an extracellular mediator (10Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R.

Because EDG-1 is a prototypical member of a subfamily of GPCRs, several laboratories have addressed whether such receptors are also SPP receptors. Indeed, EDG-3 and -5 have been shown recently to mediate responses to low concentrations of SPP in heterologously expressed systems (19An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that EDG-1, -3, and -5 are high affinity SPP receptors. The critical question from these recent studies is why multiple receptors exist for SPP. It could be that these three receptors are unique subtypes of SPP receptors that couple to distinct signaling pathways and thereby regulate specific biological responses. Alternatively, these receptors may couple to similar signaling pathways in a redundant manner. Of course these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Pharmacological approaches to the study of SPP receptors have been hampered by difficulties in radioligand binding assays, lack of truly negative cell lines and expression systems and lack of subtype-specific agonists or antagonists. In this study, pharmacological properties and signaling characteristics of EDG-1, -3 and -5 SPP receptors are compared. Our data indicate that albino Xenopus oocytes represent an extremely useful system to analyze the properties of individual SPP receptors. SPP did not induce calcium responses in uninjected or GÎ±q, GÎ±qi, or GÎ±qs-expressingXenopus oocytes. However, expression of SPP receptors, EDG-3 and EDG-5, conferred SPP-responsive calcium increases. It is known that oocytes express a Gq-like protein, and the downstream signaling pathways can be efficiently activated by heterologous expression of Gq-coupled receptors (30Ancellin N. Morel A. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When stimulated by SPP, EDG-3 induced a robust calcium response in oocytes, suggesting that it is a Gq-coupled SPP receptor. Although the EDG-5 response to SPP was detectable, it was much less than EDG-3, suggesting that it coupled less efficiently to the XenopusGq. However co-expression of GÎ±q or GÎ±qi potentiated the coupling of EDG-3 and EDG-5 to intracellular calcium rises, suggesting that EDG-3 and -5 may also couple to Gi. EDG-1, on the other hand, was unable to couple to the Gq pathway, even when overexpressed with the GÎ±q proteins. We have previously shown that EDG-1 is a Gi-coupled receptor (33Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, as expected, co-expression of EDG-1 with GÎ±qi allowed ligand-activated coupling to the Gq pathway. EDG-1-induced calcium increases in other cell lines may be due to a non-Gq pathway, for example by the activation of phospholipase-CÎ²2 by Î²Î³ subunits of the Gi proteins (34Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Indeed, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, EDG-1 mediated calcium responses were inhibited by pertussis toxin (15Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Gonda K. Okazaki H. Chang K. Yatomi Y. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These manipulations allowed the efficient testing of the three SPP receptors in the oocyte system, which has no endogenous responses to SPP. All three SPP receptors were stimulated by SPP with EC50values in the nanomolar range. None of the related lipids activated these receptors as agonists. We have previously shown that the bioactive lipid LPA is a low affinity agonist for the EDG-1 receptor (35Lee M.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, a limitation of this system is that we cannot test the efficacy of LPA to activate these receptors because of the presence of endogenous Gq-coupled LPA receptors in oocytes (32Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Moorman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C896-C900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fergusson J.E. Hanley M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we found that the related bioactive sphingolipid mediator, SPC, is a potent activator of SPP receptors. This bioactive lipid mediator induces a variety of effects including cell proliferation, intracellular calcium increases, and wound healing (37Desai N.N. Carlon R.O. Mattie M.E. Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,38Sun L. Xu L. Henry F.A. Spiegel S. Nielsen T.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently vascular smooth muscle cell calcium increases and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity were shown to be regulated by SPC (39AugeÌ N. Escargueil-Blanc I. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Suc I. Andrieu-Abadie N. Pieraggi M.T. Chatelut M. Thiers J.C. JaffreÌzou J.P. Laurent G. Levade T. Negre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12893-12900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whether some or all of SPC responses occur through EDG-1, -3, and -5 remains to be determined. Using the oocyte system, we also tested whether related lipids acted as antagonists for the EDG-1, -3, and -5 receptors. We found that none of the structurally related sphingolipids, as well as the SPP breakdown product phosphoethanolamine, antagonized these receptors. The polycyclic anionic compound suramin is known to block many ligand receptor interactions including those of LPA and ATP. Suramin was shown to inhibit Rho-dependent neurite retraction induced by SPP in N1E-115 neuronal cells (40Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2388-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Suramin is also able to inhibit SPP- or LPA-induced invasion of T-lymphoma cells (23Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Moolenaar W.H. Collard J.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4066-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, it did not inhibit SPP-induced cell proliferation and stress fiber induction in NIH 3T3 cells (9Wang F. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Spiegel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK (a downstream target of Rho) or DNA synthesis induced by SPP in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (9Wang F. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Spiegel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This last observation was compared with the strong inhibition by suramin of LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and DNA synthesis, leading the conclusion of the intracellular signaling action of SPP (9Wang F. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Spiegel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that the effect of suramin is receptor subtype specific. Suramin did not block the SPP-induced calcium mobilization by the EDG-1 and the EDG-5 receptors but inhibited the EDG-3 receptor with an IC50 of â¼22 Î¼m. The differential effect of suramin may be related to heterogeneity of the structure of the receptors, particularly those residues involved in ligand activation and antagonist binding. Further mutagenesis studies should address this issue. In conclusion, our data show that EDG-1, -3, and -5 receptors are (i) activated by extremely low concentrations of SPP; (ii) activated by SPC; and (iii) capable of coupling the GÎ±qi protein to the phospholipase-CÎ² pathway. Further, only EDG-3 and EDG-5 receptors are able to couple to the Gq signaling pathway. In addition, the EDG-3 subtype is selectively inhibited by suramin as a functional competitive antagonist. These observations support the notion that distinct SPP receptors are involved in the regulation of specific biological processes by coupling to discrete signaling pathways.

The significance of this increase, however, is unclear. Accordingly, we examined the obligate nature of cyclin-dependent kinases and select downstream targets of these kinases in death of neurons evoked by B-amyloid (AB) protein. We present pharmacological and molecular biological evidence that cyclin-dependent kinases, in particular Cdk4/6, are required for such neuronal death. In addition, we demonstrate that the substrate of Cdk4/6, pRb/p107, is phosphorylated during AB treatment and that one target of pRb/p107, the E2FÂ·DP complex, is required for AB-evoked neuronal death. These results provide evidence that cell cycle elements play a required role in death of neurons evoked by AB and suggest that these elements play an integral role in Alzheimer's disease-related neuronal death.

Alzheimer's disease B-amyloid B-amyloid precursor protein cyclin-dependent kinase lactate dehydrogenase dominant negative Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive loss of memory and impairment of cognitive ability. Patients with AD display neuropathological lesions including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and eventual neuronal loss in brain regions associated with cognitive function (1Cotman C.W. Pike C.J. Terry R.D. Katzman R. Bick K. B-amyloid and Its Contribution to Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease. Raven Press, New York1994: 305-315Google Scholar). The amyloid plaque, an invariant pathological hallmark of AD, is composed of B-amyloid (AB), a 39â43-amino acid residue hydrophobic peptide that assembles into insoluble aggregates (2Jarret J.T. Lansbury P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 3Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is derived by alternative proteolysis from an integral membrane localized B-amyloid precursor protein (BAPP) (4Haas C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The importance of AB in progression of AD is underscored by the identification and linkage of mutations of BAPP and the presenilins in familiar cases of AD (5Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Rush D.K. Aschmies S. Merriman M.C. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Presenilins are transmembrane proteins thought to be involved in BAPP processing and trafficking (4Haas C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Additional support for the importance of AB in AD comes from reports demonstrating the neurotoxic properties of aggregated AB (7Rush D.K. Aschmies S. Merriman M.C. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) The mechanism by which AB causes neuronal death is not well understood.Recently, several groups have reported abnormal up-regulation of a variety of cell cycle proteins in brains from AD patients (8Busser J. Gedmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McShea A. Harris P.L. Webster K.R. Wahl A.F. Smith M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1933-1939PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether these deregulated cell cycle events contribute to neurodegeneration in AD or whether they are a byproduct of a stressed brain. The cell cycle is a tightly regulated process controlled by sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases by up-regulation of its obligate activating cyclin partner (11Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 195-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Generally, it is thought that Cdk4/6 and cyclin D1 complex regulate the G0 to G1 transition, whereas Cdk2/cyclin E and Cdk3 control G1 to S transitions. Finally, Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdc2/cyclin A are believed to control G2 and M progression. One important target substrate for the CDKs is the tumor suppresser, retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which is phosphorylated by activated Cdk4/6/cyclin D (13Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Once hyperphosphorylated, Rb is released from the transcription factor complex E2FÂ·DP, which then activates genes required for S phase transition (14Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is up-regulation of several of the above discussed cell cycle control elements that have been reported in brains of AD patients. They include cyclin B, D, and E, Cdc2, and Cdk4 (8Busser J. Gedmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McShea A. Harris P.L. Webster K.R. Wahl A.F. Smith M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1933-1939PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increased Cdc2 activity has also been shown in AD brains (9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we test the hypothesis that cell cycle elements play an obligate role in neuronal death evoked by AB. We provide support that certain cell cycle-related elements, Cdk4/6 and E2FÂ·DP, are required for AB-induced neuronal death and that this signaling pathway may be a required component of neurodegeneration in AD.DISCUSSIONPrevious evidence indicated that a variety of cyclins and CDKs are up-regulated in brains of AD patients (8Busser J. Gedmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McShea A. Harris P.L. Webster K.R. Wahl A.F. Smith M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1933-1939PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that elements that normally control cell cycle progression in proliferating cells may also modulate neuronal death. Accordingly, we examined 1) whether CDKs play a required role in death of cortical neurons evoked by AB and 2) whether certain signaling elements downstream of CDKs (pRb and E2FÂ·DP) are modified and/or required for death.Involvement of CDK in Death of Neurons Evoked by ABWe show presently that the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and expression of DN Cdk4/6 but not DN Cdk2 or 3 block death of PC12 cells and/or cortical neurons evoked by AB. These results imply that Cdk4/6 activity is an obligate signaling component of AB-induced neuronal death. In support of this observation, several groups have suggested that CDKs may play an important role in neuronal death. For example, NGF deprivation leads to increased Cdc2 activity and cyclin B expression in neuronal PC12 cells (24Gao C.Y. Zalenka P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as well as elevated cyclin D1 transcript levels in sympathetic neurons (25Freeman R.F. Estus S. Johnson E.M Neuron. 1994; 12: 343-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 protein is also increased incis-platinum-treated sensory neurons (26Gill J.S. Windebank A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2842-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the CDK inhibitor p21 is required for survival of differentiated neuroblastoma cells (27Poluha W. Poluha D.K. Chang B. Crosgie N.E. Schonoff C.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Ross A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1334-1341Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and the CDK inhibitor p16 protects these cells from death caused by trophic factor deprivation (28Kranenburg O. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Pharmacological cell cycle blockers suppress death of sympathetic and cortical neurons evoked by trophic factor deprivation (21Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 29Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1150-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or DNA damaging conditions (17Park D.S. Morris E.J. Stefanis L. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Park D.S. Morris E.J. Greene L.A. Geller H.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1256-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, virally mediated expression of CDK inhibitors such as p16 and p27 and of dominant negative forms of Cdk4 and 6 inhibit the death of neurons because of the above mentioned apoptotic stimuli (15Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16Park D.S. Levine B. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8975-8983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the up-regulation of cyclin D1 in AD brains and in several other neuronal death paradigms (see above), we do not observe increased expression of this protein with AB treatment. Cyclin D1 is readily detectable in our untreated control cultured cortical neurons. The failure to see an increase in cyclin D1 levels may reflect on the embryonic nature of our culture system and suggests that activation of Cdk4 may occur via post-translational mechanisms. In support of this, we have observed an increase in cyclin D1-associated kinase activity in dying cortical neurons evoked by DNA damage (15Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This increase is observed without change in levels of cyclins, CDKs or CDK inhibitors. 2D. S. Park, E. J. Morris, H, M. Geller, and L. A. Greene, unpublished data. CDK activation may proceed through a different mechanism in the adult brain, perhaps requiring cyclin and/or CDK synthesis.Rb and E2FÂ·DP1 as Mediators of Neuronal Death Evoked by ABWe observed a transient increase in pRb/p107 phosphorylation during AB treatment of cortical neurons consistent with the requirement for Cd4/6 activity. These results are intriguing in light of recent observations that pRb may play a role in apoptosis as well as cell cycle control. For example, overexpression of pRb in several cell contexts results in increased survival (31Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar, 32Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 33Berry D.E. Lu Y. Schimdt B. Falon P.G. O'Connell C. Hu S.-X. Xu H.-J. Blanck G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1809-1819PubMed Google Scholar), whereas loss of Rb is associated with increased death (34Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Shan B. Durfee T. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, mice lacking in pRb display massive neuronal loss during development (36Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Finally, phosphorylation of Rb has been shown to occur in dying neurons treated with cis-platinum (26Gill J.S. Windebank A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2842-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and camptothecin. 3E. J. Morris, D. S. Park, H. M. Geller, and L. A. Greene, unpublished results. One consequence of the phosphorylation of pRb/p107 is release from and activation of E2FÂ·DP complexes (12Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 13Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that E2FÂ·DP may play a required role in death of cortical neurons evoked by AB. Interestingly, several groups have suggested that E2F, like pRb, may play a role in cell death. For example, overexpression of E2F in a variety of non-neuronal cells triggers apoptotic death (37Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 91: 10918-10922Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar,38Hiebert S.W. Packham G. Strom D.K. Haffner R. Oren M. Zambetti G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6864-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed that overexpression of E2F1 induces death of neurons. 4D. S. Park, M. O'Hare, and R. S. Slack, unpublished results. To test our hypothesis, we expressed a DN binding form of DP1, an obligate binding partner to E2F, wild type, and deletion mutants of DP1, which do not display DN characteristics (23Wu C.-L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In support of the involvement of E2FÂ·DP complexes in neuronal death evoked by AB, we demonstrate that expression of DN DP1 inhibits death, whereas the non-DN deletion constructs had no effect.At present the means by which E2FÂ·DP may mediate neuronal death are unclear. The fact that the DN DP1 construct contains a deletion of the DNA-binding domain suggests a critical role for such activity in mediating neuronal death (23Wu C.-L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The apparent requirement for this DNA-binding domain in death signaling suggests the importance of transcriptionally mediated events. Recent reports, however, suggest that E2F may mediate death in certain proliferating systems through a transcriptionally independent mechanism that requires the E2F DNA-binding domain (39Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).Although we favor a mechanism by which pRb/p107 mediates death through release from E2FÂ·DP complexes and DN DP1 blocks death through inhibition of E2FÂ·DP1 activity, other possibilities must be considered. For example, pRb is known to interact with multiple proteins including c-Abl (40Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In addition, E2F and DP are also reported to physically interact with p53 both in vitro and in proliferating cells (41O'Connor D.J. Lam E. Griffin S. Zhong S. Leighton L.C. Burbidge S.A. Lu X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6184-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 42Sorensen T.S. Girling R. Lee C.W. Gannon J. Bandara L.R. La Thangue N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 16: 5888-5895Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The existence of such interactions in neurons and/or their potential function/importance are unknown and cannot be ruled out.The findings presented here represent a significant insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the loss of neuronal function and viability in the brains of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The action of amyloid to induce a state of neuronal de-differentiation, indicated by an attempted return to cell cycle, may be an early event in the progressive loss of neuronal and synaptic function. In this context, intervention and reversal of this process may lead not only to an alteration in the progression of cognitive decline in the Alzheimer's patient, but the potential to restore neuronal function and improve cognition. Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive loss of memory and impairment of cognitive ability. Patients with AD display neuropathological lesions including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and eventual neuronal loss in brain regions associated with cognitive function (1Cotman C.W. Pike C.J. Terry R.D. Katzman R. Bick K. B-amyloid and Its Contribution to Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease. Raven Press, New York1994: 305-315Google Scholar). The amyloid plaque, an invariant pathological hallmark of AD, is composed of B-amyloid (AB), a 39â43-amino acid residue hydrophobic peptide that assembles into insoluble aggregates (2Jarret J.T.

The importance of AB in progression of AD is underscored by the identification and linkage of mutations of BAPP and the presenilins in familiar cases of AD (5Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum.

Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Presenilins are transmembrane proteins thought to be involved in BAPP processing and trafficking (4Haas C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Additional support for the importance of AB in AD comes from reports demonstrating the neurotoxic properties of aggregated AB (7Rush D.K. Aschmies S. Merriman M.C. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) The mechanism by which AB causes neuronal death is not well understood. Recently, several groups have reported abnormal up-regulation of a variety of cell cycle proteins in brains from AD patients (8Busser J. Gedmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McShea A. Harris P.L. Webster K.R. Wahl A.F. Smith M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1933-1939PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether these deregulated cell cycle events contribute to neurodegeneration in AD or whether they are a byproduct of a stressed brain. The cell cycle is a tightly regulated process controlled by sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases by up-regulation of its obligate activating cyclin partner (11Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 195-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Generally, it is thought that Cdk4/6 and cyclin D1 complex regulate the G0 to G1 transition, whereas Cdk2/cyclin E and Cdk3 control G1 to S transitions. Finally, Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdc2/cyclin A are believed to control G2 and M progression. One important target substrate for the CDKs is the tumor suppresser, retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which is phosphorylated by activated Cdk4/6/cyclin D (13Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Once hyperphosphorylated, Rb is released from the transcription factor complex E2FÂ·DP, which then activates genes required for S phase transition (14Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is up-regulation of several of the above discussed cell cycle control elements that have been reported in brains of AD patients. They include cyclin B, D, and E, Cdc2, and Cdk4 (8Busser J. Gedmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McShea A. Harris P.L. Webster K.R. Wahl A.F. Smith M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1933-1939PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increased Cdc2 activity has also been shown in AD brains (9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we test the hypothesis that cell cycle elements play an obligate role in neuronal death evoked by AB. We provide support that certain cell cycle-related elements, Cdk4/6 and E2FÂ·DP, are required for AB-induced neuronal death and that this signaling pathway may be a required component of neurodegeneration in AD. DISCUSSIONPrevious evidence indicated that a variety of cyclins and CDKs are up-regulated in brains of AD patients (8Busser J. Gedmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McShea A. Harris P.L. Webster K.R. Wahl A.F. Smith M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1933-1939PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that elements that normally control cell cycle progression in proliferating cells may also modulate neuronal death. Accordingly, we examined 1) whether CDKs play a required role in death of cortical neurons evoked by AB and 2) whether certain signaling elements downstream of CDKs (pRb and E2FÂ·DP) are modified and/or required for death.Involvement of CDK in Death of Neurons Evoked by ABWe show presently that the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and expression of DN Cdk4/6 but not DN Cdk2 or 3 block death of PC12 cells and/or cortical neurons evoked by AB. These results imply that Cdk4/6 activity is an obligate signaling component of AB-induced neuronal death. In support of this observation, several groups have suggested that CDKs may play an important role in neuronal death. For example, NGF deprivation leads to increased Cdc2 activity and cyclin B expression in neuronal PC12 cells (24Gao C.Y. Zalenka P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as well as elevated cyclin D1 transcript levels in sympathetic neurons (25Freeman R.F. Estus S. Johnson E.M Neuron. 1994; 12: 343-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 protein is also increased incis-platinum-treated sensory neurons (26Gill J.S. Windebank A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2842-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the CDK inhibitor p21 is required for survival of differentiated neuroblastoma cells (27Poluha W. Poluha D.K. Chang B. Crosgie N.E. Schonoff C.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Ross A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1334-1341Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and the CDK inhibitor p16 protects these cells from death caused by trophic factor deprivation (28Kranenburg O. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Pharmacological cell cycle blockers suppress death of sympathetic and cortical neurons evoked by trophic factor deprivation (21Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 29Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1150-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or DNA damaging conditions (17Park D.S. Morris E.J. Stefanis L. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Park D.S. Morris E.J. Greene L.A. Geller H.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1256-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, virally mediated expression of CDK inhibitors such as p16 and p27 and of dominant negative forms of Cdk4 and 6 inhibit the death of neurons because of the above mentioned apoptotic stimuli (15Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16Park D.S. Levine B. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8975-8983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the up-regulation of cyclin D1 in AD brains and in several other neuronal death paradigms (see above), we do not observe increased expression of this protein with AB treatment. Cyclin D1 is readily detectable in our untreated control cultured cortical neurons. The failure to see an increase in cyclin D1 levels may reflect on the embryonic nature of our culture system and suggests that activation of Cdk4 may occur via post-translational mechanisms. In support of this, we have observed an increase in cyclin D1-associated kinase activity in dying cortical neurons evoked by DNA damage (15Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This increase is observed without change in levels of cyclins, CDKs or CDK inhibitors. 2D. S. Park, E. J. Morris, H, M. Geller, and L. A. Greene, unpublished data. CDK activation may proceed through a different mechanism in the adult brain, perhaps requiring cyclin and/or CDK synthesis.Rb and E2FÂ·DP1 as Mediators of Neuronal Death Evoked by ABWe observed a transient increase in pRb/p107 phosphorylation during AB treatment of cortical neurons consistent with the requirement for Cd4/6 activity. These results are intriguing in light of recent observations that pRb may play a role in apoptosis as well as cell cycle control. For example, overexpression of pRb in several cell contexts results in increased survival (31Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar, 32Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 33Berry D.E. Lu Y. Schimdt B. Falon P.G. O'Connell C. Hu S.-X. Xu H.-J. Blanck G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1809-1819PubMed Google Scholar), whereas loss of Rb is associated with increased death (34Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Shan B. Durfee T. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, mice lacking in pRb display massive neuronal loss during development (36Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Finally, phosphorylation of Rb has been shown to occur in dying neurons treated with cis-platinum (26Gill J.S. Windebank A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2842-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and camptothecin. 3E. J. Morris, D. S. Park, H. M. Geller, and L. A. Greene, unpublished results. One consequence of the phosphorylation of pRb/p107 is release from and activation of E2FÂ·DP complexes (12Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 13Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that E2FÂ·DP may play a required role in death of cortical neurons evoked by AB. Interestingly, several groups have suggested that E2F, like pRb, may play a role in cell death. For example, overexpression of E2F in a variety of non-neuronal cells triggers apoptotic death (37Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 91: 10918-10922Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar,38Hiebert S.W. Packham G. Strom D.K. Haffner R. Oren M. Zambetti G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6864-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed that overexpression of E2F1 induces death of neurons. 4D. S. Park, M. O'Hare, and R. S. Slack, unpublished results. To test our hypothesis, we expressed a DN binding form of DP1, an obligate binding partner to E2F, wild type, and deletion mutants of DP1, which do not display DN characteristics (23Wu C.-L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In support of the involvement of E2FÂ·DP complexes in neuronal death evoked by AB, we demonstrate that expression of DN DP1 inhibits death, whereas the non-DN deletion constructs had no effect.At present the means by which E2FÂ·DP may mediate neuronal death are unclear. The fact that the DN DP1 construct contains a deletion of the DNA-binding domain suggests a critical role for such activity in mediating neuronal death (23Wu C.-L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The apparent requirement for this DNA-binding domain in death signaling suggests the importance of transcriptionally mediated events. Recent reports, however, suggest that E2F may mediate death in certain proliferat"
https://openalex.org/W1989961111,"Cell surface-bound receptors represent suitable entry sites for gene delivery into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we have taken advantage of the mannose receptor that is highly expressed on antigen-presenting dendritic cells for targeted gene transfer by employing mannosylpolyethylenimine (ManPEI) conjugates. Several ManPEI conjugates were synthesized and used for formation of ManPEI/DNA transfection complexes. Conjugates differed in the linker between mannose and polyethylenimine (PEI) and in the size of the PEI moiety. We demonstrate that ManPEI transfection is effective in delivering DNA into mannose receptor-expressing cells. Uptake of ManPEI/DNA complexes is receptor-specific, since DNA delivery can be competed with mannosylated albumin. Additionally, incorporation of adenovirus particles into transfection complexes effectively enhances transgene expression. This is particularly important for primary immunocompetent dendritic cells. It is demonstrated here that dendritic cells transfected with ManPEI/DNA complexes containing adenovirus particles are effective in activating T cells of T cell receptor transgenic mice in an antigen-specific fashion."

We performed pharmacological studies directed at understanding the biochemical basis of Hst 5 candidacidal activity. Three inhibitors of mitochondrial metabolism: carbonyl cyanidep-chlorophenylhydrazone, dinitrophenol, and azide inhibited Hst 5 killing of Candida albicans, while not inhibiting cellular ATP production. In contrast, Hst 5 caused a drastic reduction of C. albicans intracellular ATP content, which was a result of an efflux of ATP. Carbonyl cyanidep-chlorophenylhydrazone, dinitrophenol, and azide inhibited Hst 5-induced ATP efflux, thus establishing a correlation between ATP release and cell killing. Furthermore, C. albicans cells were respiring and had polarized membranes at least 80 min after ATP release, thus implying a non-lytic exit of cellular ATP in response to Hst 5. Based on evidence that transmembrane ATP efflux can occur in the absence of cytolysis through a channel-like pathway and that released ATP can act as a cytotoxic mediator by binding to membrane purinergic receptors, we evaluated whether extracellular ATP released by Hst 5 may have further functional role in cell killing.

Holmes A.R. Mason A.B. Monk B. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 1152-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Pathogenicity of C. albicans is postulated to involve adhesion to host cells and filamentous growth (2Gale C. Bendel C. McClellan M. Hauser M. Becker J. Berman J. Hostetter M. Science. 1998; 27: 1355-1358Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis has risen dramatically in the past 20 years due to increased antibiotic and pharmaceutic drug use and longer survival of people with compromised immune systems including patients on cancer chemotherapy, diabetics, and premature infants. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is so frequently associated with AIDS that it is a criterion for staging progression of disease (3Coleman D.C. Bennett D.E. Sullivan D.J. Gallagher P.J. Henman M.C. Shanley D.B. Russell R.J. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 19: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Increased use of current antifungal agents to treat candidiasis in late stage AIDS and cancer patients has resulted in emergence of Candidal species with antifungal drug resistance, especially to azole-based drugs. Even with aggressive treatment with the available antifungal drugs, morbidity from C. albicans infections in immunocompromised patients is high. These facts point to a pressing need for new antifungal agents and improved drug therapies.Innate host defense systems include a wide variety of small (3000â5000 Da) cationic proteins with potent antibacterial and antifungal activity (4Gabay J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 373Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Most locations that are in contact with indigenous microorganisms directly express or posses cells that can produce antimicrobial proteins. Despite structural variations, virtually all antimicrobial proteins carry a net positive charge.Histatins (Hsts)1 are structurally related histidine-rich basic proteins of acinar cell origin expressed only in humans and higher subhuman primates (5Oppenheim F.G.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Salivary Hsts possess in vitro candidacidal and candidastatic activities (5Oppenheim F.G. Xu T. McMillian M. Levitz S.

Immun. 1984; 44: 695-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hst 1 and Hst 3 are the full-length proteins (38 and 32 amino acids, respectively) encoded by two closely linked and related genes, HIS1 and HIS2 (9Sabatini L.M. Azen E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), while Hst 2 and Hsts 4â12 are generated by proteolytic cleavage during secretion (10Perinpanayagam H.E.R. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Ji Z.S. Tabak L.A. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In vitro, Hst 5 (24 amino acids) is the most potent candidacidal member of the family that kills yeast and filamentous forms of Candida species at physiological concentrations (15â50 Î¼m) (11Xu T. Levitz M. Diamond R. Oppenheim F. Infect. Immun. 1991; 70: 2549-2554Crossref Google Scholar, 12Raj P.A. Edgerton M. Levine M.J. J. Biol.

Salivary Hsts have potential as therapeutic agents in patients with oral candidiasis, being potent antifungal agents, while non-toxic to humans.Hsts have similar size and net positive charge as other naturally occurring antimicrobial proteins; however, they possess unique structural features such as high histidine content and lack of disulfide bonds. Extensive structural and conformational analysis of Hst 5 revealed that the weak amphipathic character of the helical structure precludes spontaneous insertion into microbial membranes and direct formation of pores or ion channels across the membrane (12Raj P.A. Edgerton M. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3898-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Raj P.A. Marcus E. Sukumaran D. Biopolymers. 1998; 45: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hst 5 variants with reduced killing ability exhibited similar helical content to Hst 5, suggesting the Î±-helical conformation alone is not solely responsible for optimal candidacidal activity (15Tsai H. Raj P.A. Bobek L.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5000-5007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the wealth of knowledge obtained on the primary structure and conformation of Hst 5, very little is known about its mode of action. Previous studies on the biochemical mechanism of Hsts activity have revealed three major findings: 1) K+ was rapidly released following exposure of C. albicans cells to a mixture of purified Hsts (16Pollock J. Denepitiya L. MacKay B. Ionoco V. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 702-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) Mg2+ and Ca2+ inhibited Hst 5-induced killing of C. albicans (11Xu T. Levitz M. Diamond R. Oppenheim F. Infect. Immun. 1991; 70: 2549-2554Crossref Google Scholar); 3) exposure of C. albicans cells for 1 h to Hst 1 did not alter membrane permeability to the vital dyes methylene blue and acridine orange (13Oppenheim F. Yang Y. Diamond R. Hyslop D. Offner G. Troxler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1177-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although altered yeast membrane permeability would readily account for the observed release of K+, Hst 5 direct channel-forming properties or Hst-induced nonspecific permeabilization of C. albicans cell membrane is not supported by the structural studies (14Raj P.A. Marcus E. Sukumaran D. Biopolymers. 1998; 45: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), early dye exclusion assays (13Oppenheim F. Yang Y. Diamond R. Hyslop D. Offner G. Troxler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1177-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or Hsts' inability to lyse lipid membranes (17Edgerton M. Koshlukova S. Lo T. Chrzan B. Straubinger R. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have recently reported the presence of functional C. albicans-binding sites for salivary Hsts and a 67-kDa yeast Hst 5-binding protein. This finding provided a new insight into the potential mechanism of killing and suggested a basis for the selectivity of Hst 5 yeast killing and lack of toxicity to human host cells (17Edgerton M.

Immunol. 1992; 4: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) is thought to be related to their abilities to disrupt lipid packing or form ion-permeable channels (14Raj P.A. Marcus E. Sukumaran D. Biopolymers. 1998; 45: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,15Tsai H. Raj P.A. Bobek L.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5000-5007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The currently used drugs in treatment of candidiasis, polyene antimycotics and azole derivatives have also been reported to alter yeast membrane permeability. Polyene antimycotics complex with ergosterol of the plasma membrane resulting in release of cellular K+ (23Prasad R. Prasad R. Candida albicans: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

The azole-based drugs inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol (23Prasad R. Prasad R. Candida albicans: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 215-252Google Scholar, 25Vanden Bossche H. Willemsens G. Marichal P. CRC Crit. Rev.

Shigematsu M. Arai T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ultraviolet absorbing materials could represent ATP since release of cellular ATP was detected following 10 min of C. albicanstreatment with ketoconazole and other azole derivatives (27Ansehn S. Nilsson L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 26: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cell lysis is one route by which ATP could be released from the cells. However, release of cytosolic ATP via plasma membrane channels in the absence of cytolysis has also been described, and members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family were putatively associated with conductive ATP transport (28Schwiebert E.

Furthermore, released ATP can function outside of the cell via activating membrane purinergic receptors of the P2X family to cause increased K+ and Clâ membrane permeability and even cell lysis (29Wang Y.

However, despite extensive efforts, this goal has not been achieved in large part because of lack of understanding of the cellular target and mechanism of action of Hsts. We examined the biochemical mechanism of Hst 5 yeast killing by performing pharmacological assays and functional studies on C. albicans cells. We showed that Hst 5 induced efflux of cellular ATP that correlated with cell death. Furthermore, the detected extracellular ATP did not represent leakage from lysed cells, but rather appeared to be released from intact and metabolically active cells. We conclude that, under the experimental paradigms used, extracellular ATP released by Hst 5 can activate putative purinergic receptors on C. albicans to induce cell death.DISCUSSIONThis is the first study to describe ATP efflux from C. albicans in response to Hst 5 that occurs in the absence of cytolysis and correlates with cell death. We report here that Hst 5-induced killing of C. albicans is initiated by a release of intracellular ATP while yeast cells are metabolically active and have polarized membranes. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the presence of putative purinergic-like receptors on these cells. Extracellular ATP, released from C. albicans by Hst 5, may activate membrane ATP receptors to cause cell death.We began the characterization of the mechanism of Hst 5 candidacidal activity by testing pharmacological agents for effects on Hst 5-induced killing of C. albicans. Of many agents tested, the proton ionophore CCCP partially inhibited Hst 5-induced killing of C. albicans, while not affecting the viability of control cells. The effect of CCCP was specific to the cells and was not due to interaction and/or inactivation of Hst 5, since increased survival was observed when cells were first preincubated with CCCP, then washed free of drug before exposure to Hst 5 (data not shown). Uncouplers like CCCP dissipate the electrochemical gradient (Fig. 6) resulting in a decline in proton-coupled ATP synthesis, acidification of cytoplasm, inhibition of active transport of nutrients, and export of toxic drugs (35Noshiro A. Rurwin C. Laux M. Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14154-14157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Clark F. Parkinson T. Hitchcock C. Gow N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 419-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Serrano R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed inhibition of Hst 5 cell killing by CCCP can be due to the inhibition of Hst 5 initial interaction with the cell, e.g. binding or transport, or to the inhibition of an essential step in the intracellular cascade leading to cell death. The proton ionophore DNP and azide at concentrations higher than 1 mm have also been reported to function as uncouplers inC. albicans (37Olson V. Hansing R. McClary D. Can. J. Microbiol. 1976; 23: 166-174Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and both agents protected these cells from Hst 5 killing (Fig. 3, Table I). Interestingly, the same three agents (CCCP, DNP, and azide) were shown to inhibit human neutrophil defensin-1 killing of C. albicans (43Lehrer R. Ganz T. Szklarek D. Selested M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The abilities of these drugs to reduce human neutrophil defensin-1 cytotoxic action were tentatively ascribed to their effects on mitochondrial metabolism. However, our ATP measurements revealed that ATP content in the presence of CCCP and azide was the same as in the control cells and DNP caused only a 2-fold reduction of the intracellular ATP level (Fig. 4). Therefore, the protective effects of these agents to C. albicans against Hst 5 killing cannot be explained by depletion of cellular ATP.A striking finding of this study is that Hst 5 itself induced a drastic reduction of intracellular ATP (Fig. 4), which coincided with the 180-fold increase of the extracellular ATP (Fig. 5). ATP release occurred in 10 min (the earliest time investigated) following exposure to Hst 5 and the extracellular ATP level remained unchanged or slightly increased for up to 1.5 h. Most importantly, studies using inhibitors of Hst 5 activity suggested a relationship between ATP release and killing of C. albicans. Preincubation of the cells with concentrations of CCCP, DNP, and azide that inhibited Hst 5-induced killing by 50, 69, and 82%, also inhibited Hst 5-induced ATP release by 87, 69, and 97%, respectively (Table II). Although the exact mechanism by which CCCP, DNP, and azide induce protection is currently unclear, the use of these agents was crucial in establishing a correlation between ATP release and cell killing.Several observations indicate that Hst 5-induced ATP release fromC. albicans represents an efflux from structurally intact and metabolically active cells. First, flow cytometry experiments, using membrane potential sensitive dye showed that C. albicans cell membranes remained polarized after 1.5 h of exposure to Hst 5 (Fig. 6). Second, released ATP was not hydrolysed extracellularly for approximately 80 min (from 10 min to 1.5 h incubation of the cells with Hst 5) at 37 Â°C, suggesting that the cell membrane was intact and no intracellular ATPases were present to rapidly degrade ATP. This is consistent with the finding that C. albicans cells were not stained by methylene blue and acridine orange after 1 h of exposure to Hst 1 (13Oppenheim F. Yang Y. Diamond R. Hyslop D. Offner G. Troxler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1177-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, C. albicans cells treated with Hst 5 for either 10 min (ATP release) or 1.5 h (complete cell killing measured by inability to form colonies) were consuming oxygen at rates similar to untreated cells, indicating active respiration (Table III). Although the concentration of ATP in the cells is an indicator of viability and ATP is rapidly degraded when cells die, actively metabolizing organisms with inhibited DNA replication have also been described (44Abbott A. Odds F. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1989; 24: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Perhaps, the loss of cellular ATP, caused by Hst 5, forces the cell to maintain the proton gradient across the membranes at the expense of all of the newly synthesized ATP. Whether cells maintain their integrity, but have no energy to replicate, or Hst 5-induced ATP release initiates processes leading to later loss of cell structure will require further study. However, the effect of Hst 5 on cell viability, at least during the 1.5 h of treatment, is not a result of a destructive action.The findings described here suggest a specific cellular mechanism for exit of ATP in response to Hst 5. The known mechanisms of specific ATP release include: 1) facilitated transport of ATP through a transporter down a favorable concentration gradient; 2) conductive transport through an ATP-specific or anion channel; and 3) release of ATP by exocytosis (28Schwiebert E. Egan M. Guggino W. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 664-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although little is known about ATP-specific channels, members of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, such as P-glycoprotein (45Roman R.M. Wang Y. Lidofsky S.D. Feranchak A.P. Lomri N.

Fulmer S.B. Allen S. Cutting G. Guggino W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), have been implicated in conductive transport of ATP. ABC transporters which carry out transport of a wide range of substrates or function as efflux pumps have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and resistance to azole antifungal agents in C. albicans has been shown to be mediated by the ABC transporters CDR1 and CDR2 (47Prasad R. Wergifosse P. Goffeau A. Balzi E. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar,48Sanglard D. Ischer F. Monod M. Bille J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Furthermore, S. cerevisiae released ATP in response to the toxic H+/K+ ionophore nigericin, while the cell membrane permeability was not altered (41Boyum R. Guidotti G. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and a plasma membrane ATP-specific transporter was purified from Aspergillus nigerthat was activated by the lipid-reactive antibiotic mycobacillin (49Chowdhury B. Bose S. Bhaduri S. Bose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Extracellular ATP can cause striking changes in membrane permeability through activating membrane receptors for extracellular nucleotides (purinoceptors, P2) expressed on susceptible cells (50Burnstock G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Among the P2 receptors, P2Y are G-protein-coupled receptors and P2X are ligand-gated channels more selectively localized on excitable cells (31Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 51Dubyak G. Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, P2Z (P2X7) receptors operate as ATP-gated pores and cells expressing these receptors are killed when stimulated with agonists, ATP, or ATP analogues (30Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima R. North R. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 31Di Virgilio F. Immunol.

ATP binding, but not hydrolysis is needed for receptor activation. We showed here that stimulation of C. albicans cells with the purinergic agonists BzATP or ATPÎ³S resulted in 72 and 57% loss of cell viability, respectively; and purinergic antagonists suramin and PPAD prevented Hst 5 killing (Table IV), thus, providing evidence for the presence of Candidal purinergic-like receptors. The P2Z/P2X7 receptor is selectively activated by ATP in its fully dissociated tetra-anionic form (ATP4-) and extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ prevent channel opening and cell lysis (30Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima R. North R. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 31Di Virgilio F. Immunol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C1224-C1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, it is of interest to note that Ca2+ and Mg2+ have been reported to abolish Hst 5 killing C. albicans (11Xu T. Levitz M. Diamond R. Oppenheim F. Infect. Immun. 1991; 70: 2549-2554Crossref Google Scholar).Activation of P2Z/P2X7 receptors requires relatively high doses of extracellular ATP, from 100 Î¼m to 1 mm. The most likely source of this amount of ATP is release from stressed or injured cells, intracellular concentration of ATP is 5â10 mm for higher eukaryotic cells (31Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and about 1 mm for yeast cells (35Noshiro A. Rurwin C. Laux M. Nicolay K. Scheffers W.A. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14154-14157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data showed that Hst 5 induced release of more than half of the reported C. albicansintracellular ATP, a sufficient amount to activate P2Z/P2X7 receptors. ATP-pulsed cells expressing these receptors appear to initially maintain their integrity and physiological function, yet cytolysis occurs 10 to 12 h after receptor stimulation (31Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 54Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. DalSusino M. Collo G. Buell G. DiVirgilo F. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Similarly, C. albicans cells were actively respiring and had polarized membranes after 1.5 h treatment with Hst 5, but could not subsequently form colonies after 24 h. Admittedly, purinergic-like receptors have not been described on yeast and, P2Z/P2X7 cytotoxic receptors have been found mainly on immune and inflammatory cells. However, C. albicans is known to possess complement receptors, CR2- and CR3-like proteins for C3d and iC3b, that are mostly expressed on the B lymphocytes and phagocytic cells (55Hostetter M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 7: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 56Calderone R. Braun P. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our findings provide support for the concept that extracellular ATP plays a role in cell killing and raise the possibility of a novel mechanism for Hst 5 cytotoxic action that include: (a) killing of C. albicans is initiated with release of cellular ATP; (b) ATP release is via non-lytic, perhaps, conductive pathway; (c) extracellular ATP, released in response to Hst 5, may activate putative purinergic receptors on C. albicansto ultimately induce cell death.Characterization of many other important aspects of Hst 5 cytotoxic action will require further study. It is currently unknown whether Hst 5 induces efflux of cellular ATP through binding to a cell surface component or needs to be transported into the cells. Furthermore, it is yet unanswered how ATP is released from the cells and whether ATP-binding cassette proteins are involved in conductive transport of ATP. We have previously reported the presence of C. albicansbinding sites for salivary Hsts and a 67-kDa yeast Hst 5-binding protein (17Edgerton M. Koshlukova S. Lo T. Chrzan B. Straubinger R. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This protein is of similar size to the purified plasma membrane ATP transporter from A. niger (49Chowdhury B. Bose S. Bhaduri S. Bose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and may function as an ATP channel activated upon Hst 5 binding. Purification and identification of the Hst 5-binding protein would be an important step in understanding the killing mechanism. Exploring the protective effects of the uncouplers to C. albicans cells against Hst 5 killing will aid in understanding the biochemical mechanism of Hst 5 candidacidal activity. Finally, the molecular identity of ATP receptors involved in Hst 5 killing of C. albicans is crucial in understanding the cytotoxic mechanism. The mechanism described here for Hst 5-induced yeast killing has not been evaluated for other antifungal agents and antimicrobial proteins. Consequently, it will be important to determine whether it represents a common antifungal mechanism or it is unique to Hst 5.In conclusion, major disadvantages of currently used antifungal drugs to treat candidiasis are their toxicity and the development of resistant yeast strains. In contrast, salivary Hsts are nontoxic to humans and yet potent candidacidal agents even with drug-resistant strains. While the therapeutic potential of Hsts is becoming apparent, particularly against azole-resistant strains, the exact mechanism of cell killing must be elucidated to fully utilize them as therapeutic agents. Oral candidiasis is a superficial mucosal infection in whichCandida albicans is the predominant species isolated from infected areas (1Cannon R.D. Holmes A.R. Mason A.B. Monk B. J. Dent.

Most of the cellular iron is utilized within mitochondria, where it is required for the generation of heme by ferrochelatase in the matrix (7Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar) and for several iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins (Fe/S proteins)1 of both the matrix (e.g. aconitase and homoaconitate hydratase) and the inner membrane (e.g. Rieske Fe/S protein; see Refs. 8Graham L.A.

Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). The import of iron into mitochondria must be tightly regulated, as hardly any accumulation of iron is observed in mutants defective in heme biogenesis (10Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limiting the iron content would impair the metabolic and respiratory activity of the organelle, whereas excess iron may exert toxic effects by generation of an oxidative stress through radical formation (11Crichton R.R. Charloteaux-Wauters M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 485-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Free iron ions might be particularly harmful in mitochondria, where free reactive oxygen species are generated as a side reaction of the electron transport (see, e.g. Ref. 12Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Three proteins have recently been described as being important for iron homeostasis within mitochondria: the yeast ABC transporter Atm1p of the inner membrane (13Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Defects in any of these proteins cause large increases in the mitochondrial iron content. Mutations in the human homolog of Atm1p, hABC7, may cause a form of sideroblastic anemia (14Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G.

Ssq1p, a member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family, was proposed to be required for correct processing of frataxin (17Knight S.A.B. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) even though recent findings indicate that this relation may be more complex (20Strain J. Lorenz C.R.

In any case, the distinct function of these proteins in iron homeostasis within mitochondria remains to be determined.Despite the central importance of iron for mitochondrial biogenesis, the molecular basis of its import into the organelles is not understood. Earlier studies have attempted to investigate iron uptake into mammalian mitochondria by assessing the iron associated with the organelles (summarized in Refs. 11Crichton R.R. Charloteaux-Wauters M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 485-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar and 21Egyed A. Saltman P. Hegenauer J. The Biochemistry and Physiology of Iron. Elsevier Publishers, Amsterdam1982: 103-119Google Scholar). Contradicting results have been achieved concerning the energy dependence of the import reaction. Although some reports found no obvious requirement for a potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane (22Strickland E.H. Davis B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 104: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Cederbaum A.I. Wainio W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4593-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), evidence has been presented for iron uptake occurring in both a membrane potential-dependent and an independent fashion (24Flatmark T. Romslo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6433-6438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No conclusive evidence is available in what form (free, chelated, reduced, or oxidized) iron must be presented to mitochondria to be competent for import (for review, see Ref. 21Egyed A. Saltman P. Hegenauer J. The Biochemistry and Physiology of Iron. Elsevier Publishers, Amsterdam1982: 103-119Google Scholar). A serious shortcoming of previous reports has been the failure to localize the iron associated with mitochondria to one of the organellar compartments; i.e. it was not possible to differentiate truly imported iron from iron unspecifically associated with mitochondrial membranes. Using isolated yeast mitochondria we also failed to distinguish between imported and unspecifically bound iron. The reason for these obstacles is the avid association of iron with biological membranes.We have developed an in vitro assay for the import of iron into the matrix of yeast mitochondria to study the biochemical mechanism of iron transport. The assay circumvents previous technical difficulties by following the uptake of iron through the generation of radioactively labeled heme from [55Fe]iron and a porphyrin substrate. This reaction is catalyzed by ferrochelatase, a protein of the mitochondrial matrix peripherally associated with the inner membrane (7Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar, 25Jones M.S. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because this procedure detects only biochemically competent iron that has crossed the inner membrane, well known problems with precipitation and unspecific membrane attachment of iron are avoided. Our strategy also makes it unnecessary to localize the iron associated with mitochondria. Using this assay, we were able to unravel mechanistic details of iron transport to ferrochelatase in the mitochondrial matrix. The energy for iron transport is provided by the potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane but not by hydrolysis of ATP. Our data suggest that iron must be delivered to ferrochelatase in its reduced form and reaches the enzyme directly from the inner membrane without transient passage through the matrix. The transport reaction is highly specific for iron ions, i.e.the transporter precludes other metals such as zinc and copper from access to ferrochelatase. Furthermore, the generation of heme can be reconstituted efficiently using proteoliposomes formed from detergent extracts of mitochondria. Reconstitution of iron transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane will now facilitate identification of components involved in this reaction and their biochemical characterization. Similar developments were opened by detergent solubilization and reconstitution of other central biochemical processes such as preprotein translocation and vesicular transport (26Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G.

We have used the in organello synthesis of heme to monitor the transport of this metal across the inner membrane thereby avoiding well known problems resulting from the unspecific and membrane potential-independent association of iron with mitochondria. Despite the increased complexity of the assay involving the transport of both iron and porphyrin, it was possible to define the requirements for iron transport. This was due to the observation that porphyrin is transported across the mitochondrial membranes in a spontaneous fashion. Porphyrin accumulated within mitochondria at 0 Â°C in the absence of a membrane potential and could be provided for heme synthesis before iron was added. Apparently, under our in vitro conditions this compound is able to permeate the membranes by virtue of its hydrophobicity.Iron import into isolated mitochondria was dependent on a membrane potential as an energy source. A similar requirement for energized mitochondria was observed in vivo. This appears to be the only driving force, because iron import occurred independently of adenine nucleotides both inside and outside of mitochondria. It is therefore unlikely that the transport of iron is mediated by a transport ATPase. Further studies are needed to define whether the electrochemical or the pH gradient at the inner membrane drives import of iron.Only the reduced (ferrous) form of iron was found to be competent for transport to ferrochelatase. Iron could not be reduced by isolated mitochondria even when the organelles were supplied with NADH and thus exhibited a high reducing capacity. Transport of reduced iron to ferrochelatase across the inner membrane might provide a mechanistic advantage because ferrochelatase is known to utilize specifically ferrous iron for incorporation into the porphyrin ring (38Camadro J.M. Labbe P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 707: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, ferrochelatase appears to be supplied with the proper iron substrate.Iron preloaded into mitochondria does not serve as a pool for ferrochelatase activity. Rather, iron had to be delivered to ferrochelatase directly from the inner membrane to be competent in heme synthesis. It seems unlikely that iron, upon entry into the matrix, becomes rapidly incompetent, e.g. by oxidation, because the mitochondrial matrix represents a reducing environment. We therefore propose that ferrous iron reaches the active site of ferrochelatase directly after its passage across the inner membrane without transient movement through the matrix. This raises the interesting question of whether the transporter supplying ferrochelatase with iron is also involved in importing iron into the mitochondrial matrix for biogenesis of Fe/S proteins or whether a separate transporter performs this reaction.Heme synthesis by intact mitochondria and by ferrochelatase in solution displays differential sensitivities to various metal ions. Zinc, copper, and nickel do not appreciably inhibit ferrochelatase function in intact organelles at concentrations that block free ferrochelatase almost completely. Apparently, the iron transporter of the mitochondrial inner membrane is highly selective and efficiently excludes zinc, copper, and nickel ions from being transferred to ferrochelatase. Zinc has long been known to represent a strong competitive inhibitor of free ferrochelatase because it becomes incorporated into the porphyrin ring instead of iron (38Camadro J.M. Labbe P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 707: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Camadro J.M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An unsolved question therefore was how the formation of zinc protoporphyrin IX is precluded in vivo. The observed selectivity of iron transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane provides a clear explanation for this problem. In contrast to what is found for these metals, manganese ions efficiently inhibit heme synthesis in organello at concentrations that do not impair soluble ferrochelatase. Thus, manganese ions interfere directly with iron transport. However, inhibition occurs only at rather high concentrations that may not elicit any significant inhibition of iron transport to ferrochelatase in vivo.The rate of heme synthesis in our in vitro experiments is about 1.5 nmol of heme/mg of mitochondrial protein/h. Yeast cells contain about 100 nmol of total heme/g of dry weight (7Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar, 46Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235-285Google Scholar). Assuming that 30% of dry weight corresponds to protein and 1/10 of that represents mitochondrial protein, a total of 3.3 nmol of heme/mg of mitochondrial protein has to be synthesized per generation time. With an average doubling time of 2 h, the estimated in vivoheme requirement of a growing yeast cell (about 1.7 nmol of heme/mg of mitochondrial protein/h) nicely matches the amounts of heme produced in our in vitro experiments. Clearly, our experimental system using isolated mitochondria faithfully and efficiently reproduces thein vivo reaction. Previous studies have suggested that ferrochelatase is present in yeast cells in amounts exceeding the needs of a living cell (7Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar, 46Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235-285Google Scholar). Our studies on detergent solubilization and reconstitution of heme synthesis confirm these observations and provide an explanation for the previous measurements. A 5-fold higher enzyme activity was observed using solubilized (free) ferrochelatase compared with the reaction in intact organelles. Apparently, direct access of iron to ferrochelatase results in significantly higher activity in heme synthesis. These results suggest that iron import is rate-limiting for heme formation in intact mitochondria.Two proteins of the inner membrane, Mmt1p and Mmt2p, have been claimed to function as mitochondrial iron transporters (45Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, transport has not been measured directly. Our quantitative analysis of heme synthesis in mitochondria isolated from Îmmt1Îmmt2 cells shows that these proteins are not required for the transport of iron to ferrochelatase. These data fit well the observation of unchanged amounts of cytochromes in these cells relative to wild-type cells. Our study does not experimentally address the question of whether these two proteins might be involved in the transport of iron into the matrix to provide iron for the biogenesis of Fe/S proteins such as aconitase. This seems unlikely though because the activity of mitochondrial aconitase was unchanged upon simultaneous deletion of theMMT1 and MMT2 genes (not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that Mmt1p and Mmt2p are not essential for iron import into mitochondria.Iron transport into mitochondria can be reconstituted efficiently in proteoliposomes. As found with intact mitochondria, the reaction is dependent on a membrane potential and requires reduced iron. The possibility of dissolving the mitochondrial membranes in detergent and forming proteoliposomes that retain the activity of transporting iron across the lipid bilayer breaks the grounds for isolation and characterization of the components involved in this process. Our biochemical characterization of the mechanism of iron transport into mitochondria represents a crucial step toward better understanding of mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Our study will also facilitate the elucidation of the function of the ABC transporter Atm1p and of frataxin in maintaining proper mitochondrial iron levels. The acquisition of iron by eukaryotic cells involves various transport systems that ensure the regulated uptake of this essential metal (for review, see Refs. 1Klausner R.D. Dancis A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 3Kaplan J.

Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Most of the cellular iron is utilized within mitochondria, where it is required for the generation of heme by ferrochelatase in the matrix (7Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar) and for several iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins (Fe/S proteins)1 of both the matrix (e.g. aconitase and homoaconitate hydratase) and the inner membrane (e.g. Rieske Fe/S protein; see Refs. 8Graham L.A.

Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). The import of iron into mitochondria must be tightly regulated, as hardly any accumulation of iron is observed in mutants defective in heme biogenesis (10Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limiting the iron content would impair the metabolic and respiratory activity of the organelle, whereas excess iron may exert toxic effects by generation of an oxidative stress through radical formation (11Crichton R.R. Charloteaux-Wauters M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 485-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Free iron ions might be particularly harmful in mitochondria, where free reactive oxygen species are generated as a side reaction of the electron transport (see, e.g. Ref. 12Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Three proteins have recently been described as being important for iron homeostasis within mitochondria: the yeast ABC transporter Atm1p of the inner membrane (13Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Babcock M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the matrix proteins frataxin (yeast Yfh1p; 15, 16) and Ssq1p (17Knight S.A.B. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Defects in any of these proteins cause large increases in the mitochondrial iron content. Mutations in the human homolog of Atm1p, hABC7, may cause a form of sideroblastic anemia (14Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,18Shimada Y. Okuno S. Kawai A. Shinomiya H. Saito A. Suzuki M. Omori Y. Nishino N. Kanemoto N. Fujiwara T. Horie M. Takahashi E. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Frataxin is mutated in patients with Friedreich's ataxia (19Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese L. Cossee M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A. Zara F. Canizares J. Koutnikova H. Bidichandani S. Gellera C. Brice A. Trouillas P. DeMichele G. Filla A. deFrutos R. Palau F. Patel P.I. DiDonato S. Mandel J.L. Cocozza S. Koenig M. Pandolfo M. Science. 1996; 271: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Ssq1p, a member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family, was proposed to be required for correct processing of frataxin (17Knight S.A.B. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) even though recent findings indicate that this relation may be more complex (20Strain J. Lorenz C.R.

In any case, the distinct function of these proteins in iron homeostasis within mitochondria remains to be determined. Despite the central importance of iron for mitochondrial biogenesis, the molecular basis of its import into the organelles is not understood. Earlier studies have attempted to investigate iron uptake into mammalian mitochondria by assessing the iron associated with the organelles (summarized in Refs. 11Crichton R.R. Charloteaux-Wauters M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 485-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar and 21Egyed A. Saltman P. Hegenauer J. The Biochemistry and Physiology of Iron. Elsevier Publishers, Amsterdam1982: 103-119Google Scholar). Contradicting results have been achieved concerning the energy dependence of the import reaction. Although some reports found no obvious requirement for a potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane (22Strickland E.H. Davis B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 104: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Cederbaum A.I. Wainio W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4593-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), evidence has been presented for iron uptake occurring in both a membrane potential-dependent and an independent fashion (24Flatmark T. Romslo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6433-6438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No conclusive evidence is available in what form (free, chelated, reduced, or oxidized) iron must be presented to mitochondria to be competent for import (for review, see Ref. 21Egyed A. Saltman P. Hegenauer J. The Biochemistry and Physiology of Iron. Elsevier Publishers, Amsterdam1982: 103-119Google Scholar). A serious shortcoming of previous reports has been the failure to localize the iron associated with mitochondria to one of the organellar compartments; i.e. it was not possible to differentiate truly imported iron from iron unspecifically associated with mitochondrial membranes. Using isolated yeast mitochondria we also failed to distinguish between imported and unspecifically bound iron. The reason for these obstacles is the avid association of iron with biological membranes. We have developed an in vitro assay for the import of iron into the matrix of yeast mitochondria to study the biochemical mechanism of iron transport. The assay circumvents previous technical difficulties by following the uptake of iron through the generation of radioactively labeled heme from [55Fe]iron and a porphyrin substrate. This reaction is catalyzed by ferrochelatase, a protein of the mitochondrial matrix peripherally associated with the inner membrane (7Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar, 25Jones M.S. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because this procedure detects only biochemically competent iron that has crossed the inner membrane, well known problems with precipitation and unspecific membrane attachment of iron are avoided. Our strategy also makes it unnecessary to localize the iron associated with mitochondria. Using this assay, we were able to unravel mechanistic details of iron transport to ferrochelatase in the mitochondrial matrix. The energy for iron transport is provided by the potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane but not by hydrolysis of ATP. Our data suggest that iron must be delivered to ferrochelatase in its reduced form and reaches the enzyme directly from the inner membrane without transient passage through the matrix. The transport reaction is highly specific for iron ions, i.e.the transporter precludes other metals such as zinc and copper from access to ferrochelatase. Furthermore, the generation of heme can be reconstituted efficiently using proteoliposomes formed from detergent extracts of mitochondria. Reconstitution of iron transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane will now facilitate identification of components involved in this reaction and their biochemical characterization. Similar developments were opened by detergent solubilization and reconstitution of other central biochemical processes such as preprotein translocation and vesicular transport (26Driessen A.J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, transport has not been measured directly. Our quantitative analysis of heme synthesis in mitochondria isolated from Îmmt1Îmmt2 cells shows that these proteins are not required for the transport of iron to ferrochelatase. These data fit well the observation of unchanged amounts of cytochromes in these cells relative to wild-type cells. Our study does not experimentally address the question of whether these two proteins might be involved in the transport of iron into the matrix to provide iron for the biogenesis of Fe/S proteins such as aconitase. This seems unlikely though because the activity of mitochondrial aconitase was unchanged upon simultaneous deletion of theMMT1 and MMT2 genes (not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that Mmt1p and Mmt2p are not essential for iron import into mitochondria. Iron transport into mitochondria can be reconstituted efficiently in proteoliposomes. As found with intact mitochondria, the reaction is dependent on a membrane potential and requires reduced iron. The possibility of dissolving the mitochondrial membranes in detergent and forming proteoliposomes that retain the activity of transporting iron across the lipid bilayer breaks the grounds for isolation and characterization of the components involved in this process. Our biochemical characterization of the mechanism of iron transport into mitochondria represents a crucial step toward better understanding of mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Our study will also facilitate the elucidation of the function of the ABC transporter Atm1p and of frataxin in maintaining proper mitochondrial iron levels.

PBP, penicillin-binding protein polymerase chain reaction Interest in the mode of action of glycopeptide antibiotics was rekindled by the emergence of glycopeptide resistance among enterococci (1Leclercq R. Derlot E. Duval J. Courvalin P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar) and, more recently, by reports on the appearance of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin (2Kaatz G.W.

Vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice in the therapy of infections by methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, and it has become the last effective antibiotic left against multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus. In an attempt to obtain some insights into the mechanism of staphylococcal glycopeptide resistance, we isolated laboratory step mutants using either vancomycin (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) or teicoplanin (7Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1998; 4: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as the primary selective agent. Despite several differences in the properties of mutants selected by vancomycin as compared with those selected by teicoplanin, both types of highly glycopeptide-resistant mutants showed decreased cross-linking of muropeptides and several other properties, suggesting extensive perturbation of cell wall metabolism. In this communication we use a combination of biochemical and genetic techniques to further explore the mechanism that has led to the striking changes in cell wall structure and metabolism of these mutants. The parental strain for both of the independently isolated glycopeptide-resistant mutants was the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain COL (8Murakami K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Mutant VM was isolated by serial selection with vancomycin (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and mutant TNM by selection for bacteria capable of growing on tryptic soy agar containing increasing concentrations of teicoplanin (final concentration, 100 Î¼g/ml) (7Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1998; 4: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A third mutant, TM, was derived from mutant VM as a spontaneous, single step teicoplanin-resistant derivative, capable of growing on agar containing 800 Î¼g/ml teicoplanin (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The methicillin-susceptible strain RN450 (9Novick R. Virology. 1967; 33: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) was also used in some of the experiments. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of these strains are shown in Table I. All strains were grown in tryptic soy broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) at 37 Â°C with aeration. For each experiment, overnight cultures were diluted 10,000-fold into prewarmed tryptic soy broth and growth was followed by monitoring optical density (620 nm, using an LKB Spectrophotometer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) and by plating on tryptic soy agar to determine viable titers of the cultures. Antibiotic resistance levels were determined by plating diluted cultures on tryptic soy agar for population analysis, as described previously (10Sieradzki K. Villari P. Tomasz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 100-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IAntibiotic susceptibility profiles of Staphylococcus aureus strains used in the studyStrainMinimal inhibitory concentrationMethicillinVancomycinTeicoplaninÎ¼g/mlCOL8001.53.0VM1.510050TM0.75100>3,200TNM2006.0200RN4500.750.40.4 Open table in a new tab Cell wall peptidoglycan was prepared and enzymatic cell wall hydrolysates were analyzed with reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (11de Jonge B.L.M. Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the alkaline phosphatase step was omitted. Peptidoglycan prepared from the parental strain and from the three resistant mutants was analyzed after digestion with three different types of enzymes. In the first type of enzymatic hydrolysis, digestion by the M1 muramidase was used. In the second type of digestion, M1 was replaced by lysostaphin, and in the third type of digestion lysostaphin treatment was followed by a second digestion with the M1 muramidase. Purified cell walls were suspended in appropriate buffer (for lysostaphin, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; for muramidase, 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5) to initialA 620 = 1.0. Lysis was measured as a decrease inA 620 during incubation of the wall samples at 37 Â°C. Membranes were prepared from cells grown to the late exponential stage in the following way: harvested cells were washed once in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 buffer, pH 7.5, resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) and Î²-mercaptoethanol (10 mm). Lysostaphin, DNase, and RNase were added to the final concentration of 100, 20, and 10 Î¼g/ml, respectively, and the suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by sonication for 5 min with 2 min intervals on ice-water batch after each 1 min cycle. Partially lysed/broken cells were harvested by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 Ã g for 40 min at 4 Â°C, washed twice in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and membranes were solubilized by 2% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Membranes (80 Î¼g/sample) were labeled with [3H]benzylpenicillin NEP salt (87.4 mCi/mg) (Merck) for 10 min at 30 Â°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of an access of unlabeled benzylpenicillin. Separation of proteins was carried out by the technique of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) on 8% acrylamide gels at constant current of â20 mA until the blue dye reached the bottom of the separation gel. PBPs were visualized by fluorography (13Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar). DNA fragments including thepbp4 gene and its promoter region (2,076 base pairs) were amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNAs isolated from the parental strain COL and its mutants VM, TM and TNM. GeneAmp PCR reagent kit (Perkin Elmer) was used with 20 pmol of primers ATAAGACCCACTGGCCATGATAG and CTGGGGACAAAAAGAAGACGATG. The following conditions were used for amplification: 94 Â°C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 Â°C for 30 s, 53 Â°C for 30 s, and 72 Â°C for 3 min; and one final extension step of 72 Â°C for 5 min. The PCR product was purified with Wizard PCR Preps (Promega), and DNA sequencing was done at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center with Taqfluorescent dye terminator sequencing method by using a PE/ABI 377 automated sequencer. Fig. 1 shows the HPLC elution profiles of muropeptide species generated from the peptidoglycans of the parental strain COL and its vancomycin-resistant (VM) and teicoplanin-resistant (TNM) derivatives, and a third mutant, TM, selected from mutant VM as a highly teicoplanin-resistant derivative (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The HPLC profiles in panels A show muropeptide species obtained after treatment of the peptidoglycans with the M1 muramidase, an enzyme that breaks glycosidic bonds between the disaccharide units in the peptidoglycan (14Lichenstein H.S. Hastings A.E. Langley K.E. Mendiaz E.A. Rohde M.F. Elmore R. Zukowski M.M. Gene. 1990; 88: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Drastic reduction in the proportion of highly cross-linked muropeptide oligomers (i.e. muropeptide species eluting from the HPLC column with the retention time of muropeptide 17 and with retention times longer) is apparent in each one of the mutant cell walls (see Fig. 1). Fig. 2 documents in quantitative terms the altered cell wall muropeptide composition in the glycopeptide-resistant mutants. Panels B in Fig. 1 show HPLC profiles obtained after hydrolysis of parental and mutant peptidoglycan with lysostaphin, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the oligoglycine cross-bridges in the peptidoglycan (15Browder H.P. Zygmunt W.A. Young J.R. Tavormina P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 2-8Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Xu N. Huang Z.-H. de Jonge B.L.M. Gage D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A large increase in the proportion of muropeptide species eluting with long retention times from the reverse phase column is apparent in each one of the resistant mutants. If one assumed that the lysostaphin digestion resulted in a quantitative breakage of all oligoglycine cross-bridges in the peptidoglycan, then the muropeptide species with the long retention time most likely represented muropeptide monomers attached to glycan chains of increased length as compared with glycan chains in the parental peptidoglycan. This interpretation was confirmed by the results of double digestion shown in panels C of Fig. 1. It may be seen that a subsequent treatment of the lysostaphin hydrolysates with the M1 muramidase generated a virtually identical set of muropeptides from both parental as well as from the mutant peptidoglycans, and these were identified on the basis of their elution patterns as a group of muropeptide monomers expected to be produced if the lysostaphin digestion preceding the treatment with M1 was complete (11de Jonge B.L.M. Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the radically decreased peptide cross-linking of the peptidoglycan of the glycopeptide-resistant mutants was accompanied by increase in the average length of the glycan strands. Plasma membrane preparations isolated from the glycopeptide-resistant mutants were tested with the fluorographic assay using [3H]penicillin for the presence of staphylococcal penicillin-binding proteins in the membrane preparations. No PBP4 could be detected in any one of the three highly resistant bacterial mutants (Fig.3). The pbp4 gene from the parental strain COL and from mutants VM, TM, and TNM was amplified and sequenced. The sequence of the pbp4 gene revealed that mutants VM and TM both carried a 17-amino acid duplication at position 305 of the parental gene. In the third mutant TNM, the alteration in the pbp4 gene involved introduction of a stop codon into the KTG motif at position 261 in the sequence (Fig.4). The decreased peptide cross-linkage and the apparent increase in the average glycan chain length in the peptidoglycan of the resistant mutants suggested that these alterations may have also caused an alteration in the relative susceptibilities of the mutant cell walls to lysostaphin and the M1 muramidase. This was in fact confirmed. Susceptibility of mutant cell walls to degradation by the M1 muramidase increased, whereas susceptibility to lysostaphin decreased, as compared with the properties of the parental cell wall (Fig.5). Such a shift in sensitivity would be consistent with the documented decrease in the peptide cross-linking and with the proposed increase in the average glycan chain length in the mutants, because the structural integrity of the mutant cell walls would depend less on the peptide cross-linking network than on the glycan chains. The observations described in this study confirm and extend our findings reported earlier (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1998; 4: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The drastically reduced level of peptidoglycan cross-linking, both in the vancomycin-resistant and also in the independently selected teicoplanin-resistant mutants, strongly suggests that this change in peptidoglycan composition is related, directly or indirectly, to the mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Highly cross-linked muropeptides, representing nearly 60% of all muropeptide species in the parental strain, were reduced to about 30, 15, and 17% in mutants VM, TM, and TNM, respectively. Results described in this study strongly suggest that these cell wall alterations are caused by the disruption of pbp4 in the mutants, resulting in the inactivation or greatly reduced production of PBP4, as evidenced by the negative results of the fluorographic assay. PBP4 has been shown to have both transpeptidase and D,D-carboxypeptidase activities (17Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this protein was postulated to act in vivo as a secondary transpeptidase required for the extensive cross-linking of peptidoglycan (18Wyke A.W. Ward J.B. Hayes M.V. Curtis N.A.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A mutant of S. aureus lacking pbp4 (19Curtis N.A.C. Hayes M.V. Wyke A.W. Ward J.B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 9: 263-266Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was reported to have a hypo-cross-linked peptidoglycan layer (18Wyke A.W. Ward J.B. Hayes M.V. Curtis N.A.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as well as a slight increase in susceptibility to Î²-lactam antibiotics. Other studies (20Henze U.U. Berger-Bachi B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Domanski T.L. de Jonge B.L.M. Bayles K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that overproduction or modification of PBP4 leads to increase in peptidoglycan cross-linking and to increased resistance to methicillin. Results described in this study indicate that a defect in PBP4 is also associated with the extensive reduction of peptidoglycan cross-linkage in glycopeptide-resistant S. aureus. That this abnormality may be related to the mechanism of resistance is suggested by disruption of pbp4 by two distinct modes of inactivation: the insertion of a 51-nucleotide sequence near the active site in the mutants with the primary selection for vancomycin resistance; and the introduction of a stop codon at the KTG motif in the mutant selected for by teicoplanin. The drastic reduction in peptidoglycan cross-linking in the resistant mutants was accompanied by an increased representation of monomeric muropeptides carrying intact carboxyl-terminald-alanyl-d-alanine residues (Fig. 2), which are known to be the recognition sites for glycopeptide antibiotics (22Nieto M. Perkins H.R. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 789-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated earlier that during the growth of cultures of the glycopeptide-resistant staphylococcal mutants, the bacteria can remove teicoplanin and vancomycin from the medium, and subsequently the sequestered antibiotic can be recovered in biologically active form from the cell walls (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1998; 4: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the resistant staphylococci, the antibiotic molecules captured by the monomer-rich peptidoglycan may sterically block the porous channels in the cell wall through which incoming drug molecules normally reach sites of cell wall biosynthesis at the plasma membrane (Fig.6). In this model the diffusion barrier by the captured antibiotic molecules is assumed to become part of the mechanism of resistance. Although the correlation between the structural abnormality of peptidoglycan and glycopeptide resistance is striking, genetic and biochemical experiments clearly indicate that this cell wall abnormality alone cannot be fully responsible for the mechanism of resistance (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). For instance, whereas cell walls purified from glycopeptide-resistant mutants have clearly increased (2â4-fold) drug binding capacities over that of the cell walls of the parental strain, this increase in binding capacity is much less than what would be expected for the disproportionately large increase in glycopeptide minimal inhibitory concentration value (6,7). Alterations in the secondary structure of the cell walls and/or changes in other cell surface polymers may also accompany acquisition of glycopeptide resistance (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1998; 4: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Glycopeptide-resistant laboratory mutants carry multistep mutations and show extensive and diverse abnormalities in cell wall metabolism, and the relationship of these to the mechanism of antibiotic resistance remains to be elucidated. One of these unexplained anomalies is the decrease in the methicillin resistance level of mutant VM (6Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this observation is not known. However, a similar inverse relationship between the methicillin and vancomycin resistance level was also detected in a set of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain with reduced vancomycin susceptibilities (26Sieradzki K. Roberts R.B. Haber S.W. Tomasz A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 340: 517-523Crossref Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Another abnormality of wall metabolism was detected by in vitro testing of the susceptibility of mutant cell walls to degradation by lysostaphin and by the M1 muramidase, as described in this study. The tests showed that there was a reversal in the relative sensitivities of the cell walls to these enzymes as compared with the susceptibility of the parental cell walls. Cell walls from the mutants had an increased sensitivity to the M1 muramidase and a decreased sensitivity to lysostaphin, suggesting that the structural integrity of the mutant cell walls has become more dependent on the glycan strands as compared with the peptide cross-linking. The activity responsible for such a structural change is unknown. Nevertheless, this observation is consistent with the results of the experiments illustrated inpanels B and C of Fig. 1, which we interpret as an apparent increase in the average glycan chain length in the peptidoglycan of the resistant mutants, perhaps âcompensatingâ for the decrease in peptide cross-linkage."

Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 2425-2433Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that activation of Stat5 is not directly involved in the induction of DNA synthesis in response to IL-2 (10Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Schindler U. Kawahara A. Mori H. Goulleux F. Groner B. Ihle J.N. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 11Nakajima H. Liu X.-W.

Wang H.Y. Wang R. Shi Y. Logmore G.D. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3502-3512PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of Stat3 was recently demonstrated to be essential for cell cycle progression and c-myc induction mediated by IL-6 (13Fukuda T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukuda T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although Stat3 was also shown to bind the c-myc E2F site upon stimulation with IL-2, and to be involved in induction of the IL-2 receptor Î± chain expression, Stat3 is not essential for cell growth signaling mediated by IL-2 (15Akaishi H. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Shineha R. Satomi S. Takeda J. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 10: 1747-1751Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, little is known about additional signaling molecules possibly associated with Jak3, which may play critical roles in intracellular cell growth signaling mediated by IL-2. During the search for signaling molecules involved in the IL-2-induced signaling pathway downstream of Jak3, at least two molecules were revealed to be associated with Jak3, STAM, a signal-transducing adaptor molecule (16Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and Pyk2, a member of the focal adhesion kinase family (17Miyazaki T. Takaoka A. Nogueira L. Dikie I. Fujii H. Tsujino S. Miyani Y. Maeda M. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The kinase-negative Pyk2 showed a suppressive effect on IL-2-mediated cell proliferation, suggesting a possible involvement of Pyk2 in the IL-2-mediated cell growth signaling (17Miyazaki T. Takaoka A. Nogueira L. Dikie I. Fujii H. Tsujino S. Miyani Y. Maeda M. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we demonstrated that STAM contains an SH3 domain and an ITAM region and directly interacts with Jak2 as well as Jak3 through its ITAM region (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Since the SH3 deletion mutant of STAM conserving the association site of the Jaks acts as a dominant negative in signaling for cell growth, and the wild type STAM but not the STAM mutant enhances c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, we suspect that a certain critical signaling molecule interacts with the SH3 domain of STAM to transduce downstream signals from the JaksÂ·STAM complex. The present study demonstrates that a novel molecule named AMSH is associated with the SH3 domain of STAM and plays an important role in signal transduction for cell growth and c-mycinduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. A Î»gt11 phage cDNA library was constructed with cDNAs derived from human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and recombinant human IL-2. An Escherichia coli strain Y1090Râwas incubated with the phages, mixed with top agarose, and plated onto the LB plates and incubated at 42 Â°C until small plaques just become visible. Then the nitrocellulose membranes pretreated with isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactoside was overlaid onto the plates and incubated at 37 Â°C for 4 h to allow the transfer of proteins produced. The transferred membranes were immersed in the blocking solution at 4 Â°C and then incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of STAM. The membranes were washed three times for 5 min each in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with anti-GST antibody for 1 h at 4 Â°C. After washing in TBST, the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h and then immersed into the color development solution with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.15 mg/ml)/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (0.3 mg/ml) for 10 min. In this far Western screening, GST protein was used as a negative control. One positive clone (clone 11) containing a 1.1-kbp insert was obtained from 5 Ã 105 independent phage clones. To obtain a full-length cDNA clone, a Î»ZAPII cDNA library from activated human PBLs was screened with the 1.1-kbp fragment used as a probe. Among the overlapping clones obtained, the longest cDNA clone (K1) was sequenced for both strands and determined to be the full-length cDNA clone. Cell lines used were MOLTÎ² (a human T cell leukemic cell line stably transfected with the IL-2 receptor Î² chain), BAF-B03 (an IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line), and COS7 (a simian fibroblastoid cell line). Antibodies used were anti-STAM mAb (TUS1, IgG1) (16Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), anti-FLAG mAb, M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.), anti-B19 parvovirus mAb (PAR3, IgG1) as a control mAb, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Stratagene). An anti-AMSH mAb (TUAM1, IgG1) was prepared by immunization of mice with a GST fusion protein containing 56 amino acid residues (Lys125 to Lys180) of human AMSH. A multiple tissue Northern blot containing poly(A)+ RNA preparations derived from various human tissues was purchased (CLONTECH). A 1.9-kbp fragment from the AMSH clone K1 and a 2.0-kbp fragment of human Î² actin were used as probes. The probes were labeled with random primers, [Î±-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Bca-BEST labeling kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto). Hybridization was performed for 20 h at 42 Â°C in 50% formamide, 5Ã Denhardt's solution, 5Ã SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 200 Î¼g/ml sonicated and denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were washed in 0.2Ã SSC and 0.1% SDS three times at 65 Â°C. Radioactivity was analyzed with a bio-image analyzer MacBAS1500 (Fuji Film). pGST-STAMSH3 is a prokaryotic expression vector for the GST-SH3 fusion protein. The gene fragment coding for the SH3 domain (Gly212 to Ala266) of STAM was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector in frame into the EcoRI site to produce the fusion protein. pGST-AMSH was constructed by cloning the cDNA fragment from AMSH in frame to express a GST-AMSH (Glu128to Lys180) fusion protein. Other eukaryotic gene expression plasmids used were pSRB5 for the human IL-2 receptor Î² chain (19Takeshita T. Ohtani K. Asao H. Kumaki S. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2154-2158PubMed Google Scholar), pSRG1 for the human IL-2 receptor Î³c chain (20Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), pENL for the Î²-galactosidase, and human GM-CSF receptor Î± and Î²c plasmids. pHXLuc is a luciferase-reporter plasmid containing a chimera between the luciferase gene and human c-MYC promoter fragment (â2329 to +510) (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). pFLAG-AMSH is an expression vector for the wild type AMSH, constructed by insertion of the wild type AMSH cDNA as a polymerase chain reaction product into HindIII-XbaI sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Kodak). Similar polymerase chain reaction-based procedures were utilized to create other FLAG-tagged AMSH mutants as follows: DBS2 mutant deleted of a PXXP motif (Pro227 to Pro231, pFLAG-DBS2); DBS3 mutant deleted of the two PXXP domains (Pro195 to Val233; pFLAG-DBS3); DC2 mutant deleted of the C-terminal half (Asp234 to Arg424, pFLAG-DC2); DJS mutant deleted of the JAB1 subdomain homologous region (Gln323 to Pro369, pFLAG-DJS); and DNL mutant deleted of the bipartite nuclear localization signal (Lys112 to Lys127, pFLAG-DNL). Untagged wild type and mutant AMSH expression plasmids were constructed with another expression vector, pCXN2 (21Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar), and we used these untagged constructs in luciferase and [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. All the constructs were verified by sequence analyses for both strands with the 377 autosequencer (Applied Biosystems). pCXSTAM, pCXDSH3, pCXDIT, and pCXDY2 were expression plasmids for the wild type STAM, STAM DSH3 mutant deleted of the SH3 domain, STAM DIT mutant deleted of the ITAM region, and STAM DY2 mutant deleted of the tyrosine cluster region, respectively (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). BAF-B03 cells were transiently transfected with 20 Î¼g of AMSH expression plasmids together with 5 Î¼g of human IL-2 receptor Î² (pSRB5) and Î³c (pSRG1) plasmids, or together with 5 Î¼g of human GM-CSF receptor Î± and Î²c plasmids (22Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in addition to 10 Î¼g of pHXLuc and 5 Î¼g of Î²-galactosidase expression plasmids (pENL) by electroporation using a Gene Pulser with 960 microfarads at 200 V as described previously (18Takeshita T.

The cells were then stimulated with 10 nm human recombinant IL-2 (provided from Ajinomoto Co., Japan) in the presence of anti-mouse IL-2 receptor Î± chain (PC61) and Î² chain (TUm122) mAbs (23Nemoto T. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Kondo M. Higuchi M. Satomi S. Nakamura M. Mori S. Sugamura K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or with 10 ng/ml human recombinant GM-CSF for 12 h, and assayed for luciferase and Î²-galactosidase activities. BAF-B03 cells maintained in IL-3-containing medium were transiently transfected with 10 Î¼g of AMSH expression plasmids together with 2 Î¼g of human IL-2 receptor Î² (pSRB5) and Î³c (pSRG1) plasmids or together with 2 Î¼g of human GM-CSF receptor Î± and Î²c plasmids by electroporation. The cells (1 Ã 105/well) were cultured with medium containing 10 nm IL-2 in the presence of anti-mouse IL-2 receptor Î± chain (PC61) and Î² chain (TUm122) mAbs, or 10 ng/ml GM-CSF for 24 h, and assayed for [3H]thymidine incorporation for the last 4 h of incubation as described previously (23Nemoto T. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Kondo M. Higuchi M. Satomi S. Nakamura M. Mori S. Sugamura K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (24Higuchi M. Asao H. Tanaka N. Oda K. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Van Snick J. Sugamura K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated with 200 Î¼g/ml dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the cells were lysed with cell extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 Î¼g/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). After incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20, the filters were probed with indicated antibodies and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To isolate cDNA clones encoding a protein associated with the SH3 domain of STAM, GST fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of STAM was used as a probe by far Western screening of a Î»gt11 cDNA library derived from human-activated PBLs. As described under âMaterials and Methods,â a full-length cDNA clone was isolated, which encodes a protein consisting of 424 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 48.1 kDa and named AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM). The deduced amino acid sequence of AMSH indicated the presence of at least three characteristic regions (Fig. 1 A); 1) two Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Pro (PXXP) motifs known as possible binding sites for the SH3 domain, located at Pro195âPro198 (P1) and Pro227âPro231 (P2); 2) a JAB1 subdomain homologous (JSH) region between Gln323 and Pro369, defined to be highly homologous to one of the three subdomains of c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1) (25Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and yeast Pad1 (26Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B); and 3) a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Lys112âLys127) homologous to the NLS of human p53 (27Shausky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rptter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). The chromosomal location of human AMSH gene was determined by FISH with AMSH cDNA probes. The human AMSH gene was mapped onto chromosome 2p12â13 (data not shown). Expression of AMSH gene was examined for various human tissues by Northern blot analyses. A single 2.1-kbp mRNA species related to AMSH was seen in all the human tissues tested, including spleen, lymph node, thymus, appendix, PBLs, bone marrow, fetal liver, heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. 2). In addition to the 2.1-kbp major band, two minor bands of approximately 4.0 and 1.6 kbp in size were also detected in the human tissues. These results indicate that AMSH is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues. We assessed association between STAM and AMSH in a human T cell line, MOLTÎ², expressing the functional IL-2 receptor. Lysates of IL-2-stimulated and unstimulated MOLTÎ² cells were treated with a chemical cross-linker, DSP, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-AMSH mAb (TUAM1) or the control antibody (PAR3), and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-STAM mAb. STAM faintly but significantly co-immunoprecipitated AMSH irrespective of IL-2 stimulation (Fig.3), indicating the association of AMSH with STAM in MOLTÎ² cells. Since AMSH was isolated as a protein interacting with the SH3 domain of STAM in the far Western screening, we next confirmed whether the SH3 domain of STAM is the binding site for AMSH in co-immunoprecipitation studies using various STAM mutants. The FLAG-tagged wild type AMSH was co-transfected into COS7 cells with the wild type STAM and three mutants of STAM, namely DSH3 deleted of the SH3 domain, DIT deleted of the ITAM, and DY2 deleted of the tyrosine cluster region (Fig.4A). Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb (M2), and the immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-STAM mAb (TUS1). AMSH co-immunoprecipitated the wild type STAM, DIT, and DY2 but not DSH3 (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). The expression levels of the wild type STAM, STAM mutants, and AMSH were assessed in the transfectant cells (Fig. 4 B, middle andbottom panels), confirming that DSH3 was expressed equally well with the other STAMs, and AMSH expression was constant. These results indicate that the SH3 domain of STAM indispensably contributes to the binding with AMSH. We also attempted to define the binding site of AMSH for STAM. Expression vectors were prepared for the FLAG-tagged wild type AMSH and five AMSH mutants such as DBS2 deleted of a PXXP motif (Pro227âPro231), DBS3 deleted of two PXXP motifs (Pro195âVal233), DC2 deleted of the C-terminal half (Asp234âArg424) containing JSH, DJS deleted of the JSH region (Gln323âPro369), and DNL deleted of the NLS region (Lys112âLys127) (Fig. 4 C). They were co-transfected with the wild type STAM into COS7 cells, and their lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-STAM mAb. STAM was co-immunoprecipitated with the wild type AMSH, DJS, DNL, and DC2 but not with DBS2 and DBS3 (Fig. 4 D, upper panel). Expression levels of DBS2 and DBS3 were not significantly different from those of the other AMSHs (Fig. 4 D, lower panel). These results indicate that the PXXP motif (Pro227âPro231) of AMSH is a major binding site for the SH3 domain of STAM. Since the SH3 deletion mutant of STAM was previously reported to have a dominant negative effect on signaling for DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we assumed that the binding of AMSH to the SH3 domain of STAM is also involved in a similar signal transduction pathway. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effects of the wild type and various mutants of AMSH on DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF in IL-3-dependent BAF-B03 cells, transiently reconstituted with receptors for IL-2 or GM-CSF. Initially, BAF-B03 cells were transfected with the wild type AMSH or its mutants along with human IL-2 receptor Î² and Î³c chains and stimulated with human IL-2. The cells transfected with the wild type AMSH and its mutants of either DJS, DNL, or DBS2 exhibited significant increases of [3H]thymidine incorporation, comparable with the control vector transfectant cells. In sharp contrast, the transfectant cells with DC2 mutant AMSH resulted in 58% inhibition of [3H]thymidine uptake as compared with those with the control vector (Fig. 5 A). The inhibition of IL-2-induced [3H]thymidine uptake was dependent on the DC2 plasmid dose (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained with the GM-CSF stimulation system. BAF-B03 cells were transfected with the wild type AMSH, AMSH mutants, and control vector along with human GM-CSF receptor Î± and Î²c chains and stimulated with human GM-CSF. Only the transfectant with DC2 mutant showed 55% inhibition of [3H]thymidine uptake mediated by GM-CSF as compared with the control vector (Fig. 5 C). The inhibition of the GM-CSF-induced [3H]thymidine uptake was also observed in the plasmid dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 D). These results indicate that exogenous expression of DC2 mutant of AMSH induces appreciable inhibition of DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, suggesting a dominant negative effect of DC2 mutant on intrinsic AMSH, which is involved in the cell growth signal transduction from receptors for IL-2 and GM-CSF. STAM was reportedly shown to be involved in c-myc induction in response to IL-2 and GM-CSF (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined whether AMSH also contributes to signaling for c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. BAF-B03 cells were transfected with the wild type AMSH, its mutants, or the control vector together with the human IL-2 receptor Î² and Î³c chains and the c-myc promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene. They were then stimulated with IL-2 and assayed for c-mycinduction by luciferase activity. Transfectant cells with the wild type AMSH, DJS, DNL, and DBS2 exhibited significant increases of c-myc induction upon IL-2 stimulation, similar to those achieved by the control vector (Fig.6 A). However, with the DC2 mutant, c-myc induction was suppressed to less than half the activity observed with the control vector (Fig. 6 A). The suppression of IL-2-mediated c-myc induction was dependent on the DC2 plasmid dose (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained with the GM-CSF stimulation system. BAF-B03 cells were transfected with the wild type AMSH, AMSH mutants, or the control vector, together with the human GM-CSF receptor Î± and Î²c chains, and c-myc promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene. After stimulation with GM-CSF, they were assayed for c-mycinduction by luciferase activity. The c-myc induction was significantly suppressed by transfection of the DC2 mutant but not of the wild type AMSH, other AMSH mutants, and the control vector (Fig.6 C). The suppression of GM-CSF-mediated c-mycinduction was dependent on the DC2 plasmid dose (Fig. 6 D). These results indicate that the DC2 mutant of AMSH also acts as a dominant negative in c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, suggesting the involvement of AMSH in signal transduction for c-myc induction mediated by these cytokines. On the other hand, we detected marginal effects of the wild type AMSH and its mutants on c-fos promoter-driven luciferase activities mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF (data not shown), suggesting non-involvement of AMSH in signaling for c-fosinduction. The present study documented the existence of a novel molecule named AMSH, which is associated with STAM and is involved in the signal transduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. We previously demonstrated that STAM containing the SH3 domain and ITAM region is associated with both Jak2 and Jak3 tyrosine kinases via its ITAM region irrespective of cytokine stimulation (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Jak2 and Jak3 are known to be associated with the Î²c chain of GM-CSF receptor and Î³c chain of IL-2 receptor, respectively, and to be indispensable for intracellular signal transduction mediated by GM-CSF and IL-2, respectively (28Silvennoinen O.

The SH3 deletion mutant of STAM acts as a dominant negative in cell growth signal transduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, indicating the possible existence of an interacting molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM, which plays a critical role in the downstream signal transduction of the Jak2/Jak3Â·STAM complex (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Upon investigation of a signaling molecule associated with the SH3 domain of STAM, we hereby successfully cloned a cDNA encoding AMSH. AMSH contains two regions with the PXXP motif known to be a putative binding site for the SH3 domain. It is present in many signaling molecules including kinases and adaptor molecules and appears to be responsible for intermolecular interaction (34Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 35Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation with various deletion mutants of AMSH and STAM demonstrated that the PXXP region (Pro227âPro231) of AMSH is a binding site for the SH3 domain of STAM. AMSH also contains a putative bipartite NLS. However, since nuclear localization of AMSH has not been observed even after stimulation of cells with cytokines (data not shown), the functional significance of AMSH NLS is still unknown. Another unique sequence, JSH, is present in AMSH, which is homologous to one of the three subdomains of c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1). The JSH sequence of AMSH is conserved among human JAB1 and yeast Pad1. Although JAB1 and Pad1 are known to be co-activators for transcription of AP-1 target genes through interaction with c-Jun or Jun D, we have no evidence for association of AMSH with c-Jun or Jun D in co-immunoprecipitation or electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). Hence, the biological significance of the JSH region of AMSH is still unknown. AMSH was revealed to be implicated in signal transduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. An AMSH mutant, DC2, deleted of the C-terminal half including the JSH region, possessed an apparent suppressive activity for DNA synthesis and c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, indicating that DC2 mutant acts as a dominant negative for intrinsic AMSH, which is critical for intracellular signal transduction mediated by the cytokines. However, the other AMSH mutants such as DBS2, DBS3, DJS, and DNL did not induce such a suppressive effect on the cytokine-mediated signal transduction, suggesting that these AMSH mutants do not act as dominant negatives. The dominant negative effect of the DC2 mutant suggests the possibility that the C-terminal half of AMSH interacts with a certain unidentified molecule that plays an important role in signal transduction for DNA synthesis and c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Although the JSH region is included in the C-terminal half, it seems unnecessary for such molecule association, because the DJS mutant deleted of the JSH region did not show any dominant negative effect in the signaling. Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of c-myc gene activation in cytokine-induced cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (36Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite extensive study in cytokine-mediated intracellular signal transduction, little is known about the signaling pathway for c-myc induction and cell cycle progression except for the Stat3-mediated pathway. Stat3 was recently demonstrated to be involved in signaling for the G1 to S cell cycle transition and c-mycinduction through its binding to the c-myc E2F site in response to IL-6 (13Fukuda T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukuda T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The binding of Stat3 to the c-mycE2F site was also detectable upon stimulation with IL-2 (14Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukuda T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible involvement of Stat3 in IL-2-mediated c-myc induction. However, we have evidence that the c-myc E2F site of c-myc gene is not essential for full induction of c-myc in response to IL-2. 2T. Arita, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, the recent study using the Stat3 knock-out mice demonstrated an essential involvement of Stat3 in the IL-2 receptor Î± chain expression mediated by IL-2 but nonessential for IL-2-induced cell growth signaling (15Akaishi H. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Shineha R. Satomi S. Takeda J. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 10: 1747-1751Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although another member of the Stat family, Stat5, is activated by stimulation with various cytokines including IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF (10Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Schindler U. Kawahara A. Mori H.

Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 2425-2433Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In concert with these observations, Stat5 activations mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF were not affected by overexpression of the wild type AMSH and its mutants (data not shown), suggesting AMSH is nonessential for Stat5 activation. Our present study demonstrated that the STAMÂ·AMSH complex plays a critical role in signaling for c-myc induction and cell cycle progression mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF in the downstream pathway of Jak3 and Jak2, which may be distinct from the pathway for Stat5 activation. STAM interacting with AMSH binds to Jak2 and Jak3 (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K.

These observations suggest a possible formation of the tetrameric complex composed of the cytokine receptors, Jaks, STAM, and AMSH in vivo. However, since AMSH is co-immunoprecipitable with STAM, only when the cells are treated with the chemical cross-linker DSP, the binding affinity between AMSH and STAM may be too low for detection of the tetrameric complex. AMSH was found to be expressed ubiquitously among various human tissues including thymus, spleen, brain, testis, liver, kidney, and lung, which is well correlated with the expression pattern of STAM (16Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since STAM is known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with a variety of cytokines and growth factors such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, GM-CSF, IL-3, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor (16Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Exploring the mechanism of formation, we found that LDLâ can be produced in plasma in the absence of oxygen following LDL incubation with oxidized hemoglobin species. A high degree of apolipoprotein B100 modification results from covalent association of hemoglobin with LDL involving dityrosine formation but not due to the malonaldehyde epitope formation. This was evidenced by the cross-reactivity of oxidized LDL with antibodies against hemoglobin that was accompanied by a 60-fold increase in dityrosine levels. In this study we found significantly higher LDLâ levels in the blood of hemodialysis patients, perhaps contributing to their greatly increased risk of atherosclerosis. The mechanism of LDLâ formation was studied during ex vivoblood circulation using a model system resembling clinical hemodialysis in terms of the induction of inflammatory responses. This circulation increased free hemoglobin and LDLâ levels compared with non-circulated blood without appreciable lipid peroxidation. Pronounced increases in LDLâ were found also during circulation of plasma supplemented with nanomolar hemoglobin levels. The increase in dityrosine content and presence of heme in LDL after blood circulation suggest that LDL is modified, in part, by hemoglobin-LDL conjugates containing heme.

Up to 10% of the plasma LDL consists of particles with increased net electronegative charge on apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation products (6Cazzolato G.

High LDLâ levels are considered potentially proatherogenic due to the high cytotoxicity and oxidizability of this LDL fraction (7Hodis H. Kramsch D. Avogaro P. Bittolo-Bon G. Cazzolato G. Hwang J.

Moreover, LDLâmay have a prolonged lifetime in the circulation determined by less effective binding of LDLâ to the normal LDL receptor (11Demuth K. Myara I. Chappey B. Vedie B.

Modification of LDL into LDLâ could be linked to oxidative stress induced during inflammatory events. Reactive oxygen species generated by inflammatory cells or cell-derived peroxidases have been proposed as agents responsible for LDL oxidation in the artery wall (5Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Many of these species oxidize lipids to hydroperoxides (LOOH) and reactive aldehydes (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. JuÌrgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar) or can specifically generate aldehydes from amino acids (13Hazen S.L.

These products can modify amino groups on apoB100, thereby increasing LDL electronegativity (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. JuÌrgens G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16990-16998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, this modification requires relatively high concentrations of malonaldehyde (MDA) (14Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) or lipid hydroperoxides (15Kim J.G. Sabbagh F. Santanam N. Wilcox J.N. Medford R.M. Parthasarathy S. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 23: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in in vitroexperiments. These reactions are thought to occur in extracellular matrices of the arterial wall, an environment that is depleted of inhibitory plasma proteins and plasma- or cell-derived antioxidants (5Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 16Rice-Evans C. Leake D. Bruckdorfer K.R. Diplock A.T. Free Radical Res. 1996; 25: 285-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In blood, radicals can be formed on heme proteins, such as hemoglobin (Hb) or myoglobin, following the oxidation with hydrogen peroxide released from activated white blood cells (17Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1998; 24: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hb-based protein radical was identified in vivo in animals under oxidative stress (19Maples K.R. Kennedy C.H. Jordan S.J. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Hb can effectively catalyze lipid peroxidation and LDL cross-linking in plasma-free medium inin vitro experiments (20Miller Y.I. Altamentova S.M. Shaklai N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12189-12198Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21Miller Y.I. Felikman Y. Shaklai N. Arch. Biochem.

Whether oxidative reactions mediated by Hb lead to LDLâ formation in undiluted plasma or blood under inflammatory conditions is presently unclear. Hb-mediated reactions can be implicated in oxidative stress during hemodialysis (HD), characterized by inflammatory reactions induced after contact of blood with hemodialysis (HD) membranes (24Tetta C. Segoloni G. Mariano F. Montrucciho G. Turello E. Camussi G. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1991; 6 Suppl. 2: 24-30PubMed Google Scholar) and by occasional hemolytic complications (25Daul A.E. Schafers R.F. Wenzel R.R. Loew H. Windeck R. Philipp T. Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 1994; 119: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress induced during HD is believed to modify LDL and produce cardiovascular complications in HD patients (26Maggi E. Bellazzi R. Falaschi F. Frattoni A. Perani G. Finardi G. Gazo A. Nai M. Romanini D. Bellomo G. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 876-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 27Yukawa S. Hibino A. Maeda T. Mimura K. Yukawa A. Maeda A. Kishino M. Sonobe M. Mune M. Yamada Y. Niside I. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1995; 10 Suppl. 3: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, enhanced lipid peroxidation in HD patients remains a controversial issue since many recent reports have failed to confirm the increase in plasma MDA or LOOH in these patients (28Banni S. Lucchi L. Baraldi A. Botti B. Cappelli G. Corongiu F. Dessi M.A. Tomasi A. Lusvarghi E. Nephron. 1996; 72: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Delmas-Beauvieux M.-C. Combe C.

The level of apoB100 modification in HD subjects, including that arising from lipid peroxidation and LDLâ formation, has yet to be described. We report here a link between LDLâ levels and oxidative stress during the HD-induced inflammation based on two novel findings as follows: 1) significantly increased LDLâ levels in HD patients, and 2) LDLâ formation in blood circulatedex vivo in a model HD system. Furthermore, we describe a novel mechanism for LDLâ formation in plasma which occurs without appreciable lipid peroxidation but involves conjugate formation between Hb and apoB100. Sigma provided all reagents unless otherwise indicated. The reagents used were of analytical grade. Patients (19 male and 10 female, ages 26â84 years) who had various forms of end-stage renal failure and were on chronic hemodialysis therapy for 3.5â10.7 years (mean Â± S.D. was 5.9 Â± 2.3) and 14 healthy subjects (9 male and 5 female, ages 20â55 years) were recruited for this study from the vicinity of Los Angeles. None of the participants in this study were taking vitamin E supplement. HD patients were dialyzed three times a week for 3â4 h using polysulfone filters, and one patient was dialyzed using a cellulose acetate filter. Blood was obtained before the heparin injection. Blood for experiments using the model hemodialysis system, and for the preparation of LDL, was obtained from overnight-fasted normolipidemic healthy donors. Blood was collected into tubes (VWR Scientific) containing EDTA (final concentration 1 mg/ml) or into the Vacutainer glass tubes containing sodium citrate (final concentration 2.6%), stored on ice, and used for the HD model circulation system within 1 h after withdrawal. The circulation line was comprised of 2 blood chambers and cuprophane and polysulfone mini-filters (Bellco S.p.A., Mirandola, Italy) (Fig.1). Mini-filters (surface area 0.027 m2) resemble the HD filters that are commonly used in clinical practice. Blood was continuously circulated at a flow rate of 5 ml/min, using pump Masterflex C/LTM (Cole-Palmer), in a temperature-controlled box at 37 Â°C protected from light. The circulation line was pre-washed with a 0.9% NaCl containing 5 units of heparin/ml (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NJ) and with an initial 3 ml of blood. Approximately 30 ml of blood incubated in a glass beaker in the same box was used as a non-circulated control. Aliquots were obtained from circulated and non-circulated blood at 0, 2, and 4 h of incubation, where â0 hâ was collected after approximately 4 min of circulation through the HD filters, representing the initial effects on blood during circulation. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 Â°C and stored on ice prior to isolation of LDL. The remaining plasma was stored at â70 Â°C. Concentrations of Hb species in plasma were determined according to Winterbourn (30Winterbourn C.C. Greenwald R. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985Google Scholar). LDL (d = 1.019â1.063) was separated by sequential ultracentrifugation as described by Hodis et al. (7Hodis H. Kramsch D. Avogaro P. Bittolo-Bon G. Cazzolato G. Hwang J. Peterson H. Sevanian A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within 24 h of isolation, LDL was separated by anion exchange chromatography into three fractions: native LDL (nLDL), LDLâ, and LDL2â detected simultaneously at 280 nm (Perkin-Elmer LC-95 UV-detector) and at Î»ex 327 nm/Î»em400 nm (RF-535 Shimadzu) (Fig. 2). Chromatography was performed using either an UNOTM Q1 column (Bio-Rad) or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono QR HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) following the method of Chang et al. (31Chang Y.H. Abdalla D.S.P. Sevanian A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 23: 202-214Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). MDA content in LDL, containing 1 mg/ml EDTA and 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene, was determined by the method of Wong et al. (32Wong S.H.Y. Knight J.A. Hopfer S.M. Zaharia O. Leach C.N. Sunderman F.W. Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). HPLC analyses were performed on RP-18 column (250 Ã 4 mm, 5 Î¼m) using phosphate buffer (50 mm; pH 6.8)/ethanol (60:40, v/v). MDA was detected using a Shimadzu RF-535 fluorometer set at Î»ex 525 nm/Î»em 550 nm, respectively. MDA-protein adducts were measured using polyclonal antibody against MDA-modified LDL from rabbit in a solid-phase sandwich fluorescence assay as described previously (33Greilberger J. Schmut O. JuÌrgens G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Simultaneously apoB100 was determined using anti-apoB antibody (Behring AG, Germany). Results are given as ratios of the counts. Lipid hydroperoxides were measured by the method of Auerbach et al. (34Auerbach B.J. Kiely J.S. Cornicelli J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Concentrations were based on cholesterol or protein levels in LDL measured using cholesterol assay and the Protein MicroAssay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard, respectively. SDS-PAGE of LDL (5â10 Î¼g of protein) was performed according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for 45 min at 200 V using a Mini-PROTEAN II cell (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated on 5 and 12% polyacrylamide layers (2:1 of the separating gel length) and stained using Coomassie Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for 1 h at 100 V using a Mini Trans-BlotR electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies to the Î²-chain of Hb (Cortex Biochem, San Leandro, CA) at 1:20,000 dilution. Membranes were incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) at 1:3,000 dilution and visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Dot blots were carried out under the same conditions using antibodies to the Î±- and Î²-chains of Hb. Relative electrophoretic mobility of LDL samples was determined by means of agarose gel electrophoresis (Beckman Paragon system) as described previously (7Hodis H. Kramsch D. Avogaro P.

Samples were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 12-m DB-1 capillary column (0.2 mm diameter, 0.33-m film thickness, J & W Scientific) and a Hewlett-Packard 5988A mass spectrometer with extended mass range. Selected ion monitoring was obtained with the n-propyl heptafluorobutyryl derivative of both authentic and isotopically labeled amino acids in the negative ion chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. MDA stock solution (4m) was prepared immediately before use by rapid acid hydrolysis of 0.2 ml of malonaldehyde bis(diethyl acetal) with 20 Î¼l of 1 m HCl at room temperature according to Haberlandet al. (14Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and then diluted with 0.6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Plasma (3.96 ml), containing 1 mg/ml EDTA was incubated with 40 Î¼l of the MDA stock solution (final concentrations in plasma are indicated in figure) for 2 h at 37 Â°C under argon, final pH 7.2. Human met-Hb was oxidized to ferryl-Hb for 1 min using a 6-fold excess of H2O2 (37Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was added dropwise to LDL (â¼6 mg/ml), containing 1000 units of catalase/ml under a stream of argon incubated at 0 Â°C. Hb was added at a 2:1, LDL/Hb ratio based on the tyrosine content of LDL (see below). To increase Hb concentrations, another portion of Hb was oxidized and added to reaction mixture, i.e. the procedure described above was repeated to reach the desired Hb concentrations. Control samples consisted of LDL only and LDL mixed with catalase and H2O2 at concentrations corresponding to that used for the highest amounts of Hb added to LDL. After addition of the desired oxidized Hb concentrations, the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h under argon at 37 Â°C in the dark. LDL was then isolated by centrifugation as described. Prior to analysis, LDL was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using an Econo-pac 10 DG column (Bio-Rad). Concentrations of Hb species in reaction mixture were determined according to Miller et al. (20Miller Y.I. Altamentova S.M. Shaklai N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12189-12198Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and were calculated assuming LDL composition reviewed in Ref. 12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. JuÌrgens G.

Differences between treated groups were determined using Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, paired or unpaired Student's t tests, and the level of significance was set atp < 0.05. Data are shown as mean Â± S.D. for three measurements, as one representative experiment, or as means of the results from experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. The extent of apoB100 modification in LDL samples was determined as the proportion of LDLâ in each subject's total LDL. LDLâlevels in HD patients were significantly higher than in healthy subjects (mean Â± S.D., 5.7 Â± 4.1% of the total LDL in HDversus 2.5 Â± 1.0% in healthy controls) (Fig.3 A). In 30% of HD patients the LDLâ levels were extremely high (7.0â18.9%) and comparable to those reported after LDL oxidation in vitrowith Cu2+ (31Chang Y.H. Abdalla D.S.P. Sevanian A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 23: 202-214Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cholesterol levels in HD patients were slightly lower than those in healthy subjects (mean Â± S.D., 105 Â± 27 and 148 Â± 27 mg/dl, respectively) and, therefore, cannot account for the elevated LDLâ levels. Total LDL and isolated LDLâ subfractions from HD patients or healthy subjects were analyzed for MDA-protein adducts using polyclonal antibodies to MDA-modified LDL (33Greilberger J. Schmut O. JuÌrgens G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the proportion of MDA-protein adducts in LDL of HD patients (n = 15) was similar to that in healthy subjects (n = 10). Mean Â± S.D. of anti-MDA-protein adducts/anti-apoB100 ratios were 0.011 Â± 0.006 and 0.015 Â± 0.005, respectively. The proportion of MDA-protein adducts appears to be higher in LDLâ subfraction compared with total LDL; however, this trend does not reach statistical significance (Fig.3 B). The effect of HD on LDLâ formation was studied using an ex vivo blood circulation system (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Blood circulation in this model HD system leads to pronounced LDLâ formation. An approximately 2-fold increase in LDLâ over initial levels was found in blood after 4 h circulation (p < 0.0013) (Fig. 4). In contrast, LDLâ levels remained unchanged over this period in non-circulated blood (p = 0.24). LDLâ was formed using different types of anticoagulants (heparin, sodium citrate, and EDTA), as well as in the presence of LPS. LDLâ formation during 4 h circulation varied from 135 to 270% of the initial levels in blood obtained from different donors (n = 9) (Fig. 4, inset). To determine if LDLâformation involved reactions with reactive aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation or following cyclooxygenase activation in cells, we measured the MDA content as well as MDA-protein adduct in LDL after circulation. MDA content in LDL was measured by HPLC after the acidic hydrolysis of LDL (32Wong S.H.Y. Knight J.A. Hopfer S.M. Zaharia O. Leach C.N. Sunderman F.W. Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The initial MDA content was 0.08 Â± 0.05 mol/mol LDL (n = 5). After 4 h of blood circulation in the presence of LPS, the MDA content in LDL reached a level of 3.0 Â± 3.2 mol/mol LDL (Fig.5). The amount of MDA formed after blood circulation varied considerably among different donors (Fig. 5,upper inset). In contrast, circulation of blood without LPS leads to moderate increases in MDA, i.e. up to 1.0 Â± 0.79 mol/mol LDL. In some LDL samples where the initial MDA content was higher than 1.5 mol/mol LDL, MDA levels in LDL were not affected by circulation. Increasing the MDA content in LDL did not increase significantly the formation of MDA-protein adducts measured by immune assay (Fig. 5, lower inset). To study the effect of higher MDA concentrations on LDLâformation, plasma was incubated with different concentrations of MDA reagent. This led to the MDA incorporation of up to 12.4 mol/mol LDL but did not change the proportion of LDLâ (Fig.6, upper panel). Neither the increase in MDA levels nor the initial MDA content of LDL correlated with the proportions of LDLâ that were formed (Fig. 6,lower panel). These findings show that formation of LDLâ during circulation cannot be explained on the basis of MDA formation or production of LDL-MDA conjugates, and other mechanisms likely account for the production of LDLâ. A continuous increase in oxy-Hb to micromolar levels was found in blood during the extracorporeal circulation of blood (Fig.7, left panel, solid lines), whereas the met-Hb levels were transiently increased during the circulation (Fig. 7, right panel). Hemolysis increased approximately 30-fold in the presence of LPS (triangles) and 2-fold without LPS (circles). A moderate increase in Hb was also observed in non-circulated blood. Clinical HD can also occasionally lead to hemolysis and can increase plasma-free Hb levels to 110â2400 mg/dl (correspondent to 0.17â3.8 Î¼m) free Hb (25Daul A.E. Schafers R.F. Wenzel R.R. Loew H. Windeck R. Philipp T. Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 1994; 119: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine whether LDLâ formation in circulated whole blood was dependent on Hb, we measured LDLâ levels in plasma circulated with or without Hb. Hb added to plasma at final concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 ng/ml (0.8, 1.6, and 2.4 nm Hb, respectively), increased the proportions of LDLâ from 150, 550, and 450%, respectively, over initial levels during 4 h circulation in the model HD system (Fig.8). This increase was similar to or higher than LDLâ formation during blood circulation (Fig.4.). LDLâ formation appears to be influenced by plasma components because plasma from different donors responded differently when Hb was added. LDLâ formation in circulated plasma containing Hb was not accompanied by MDA formation (data not shown). LDLâ did not form in non-circulated plasma (Fig. 8,dashed line). These results indicate that nanomolar concentrations of Hb markedly increase LDLâ levels in plasma exposed to the model HD system, and the release of Hb at micromolar concentrations during the extracorporeal circulation of whole blood can account for LDLâ formation. LDL oxidized by Hb in vitro has a number of specific properties compared with LDL oxidation mediated by Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+. The radical species of Hb that forms by oxidation of metHb with H2O2 to ferryl-Hb (37Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) induces cross-linking of LDL (21Miller Y.I. Felikman Y. Shaklai N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) accompanied by an increase in dityrosine-like fluorescence at Î»ex 327 nm/Î»em 400 nm (21Miller Y.I. Felikman Y. Shaklai N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We observed the increase in dityrosine-like fluorescence in each LDL subfraction isolated from blood exposed to the circulation. This was performed by comparing the peak areas in the chromatograms from the fluorescence signal to that of the UV-visible signal (280 nm). One representative example is shown in Fig. 2 B. During circulation of blood, the proportion of dityrosine-like fluorescence increased in the nLDL fraction (p = 0.02) compared with the nLDL recovered from non-circulated blood (Fig. 9). This effect is due to dityrosine formation rather than to a decrease in 280 nm absorption (due to oxidation of amino acids), since a positive linear correlation was found between peak areas obtained by fluorescence and UV detectors (Fig. 9, inset). Dityrosine-like fluorescence appears to be higher in the LDLâ fraction as compared with the nLDL fraction (p = 0.0005). However, further studies are needed to confirm this observation because this phenomenon can, in part, be due to protein oxidation. Nevertheless, the significant increase in dityrosine-like fluorescence within nLDL and LDLâfractions was also observed during oxidation of LDL with Hb speciesin vitro (discussed below). The formation of LDLâ in blood and plasma supplemented with Hb as well as the increase in dityrosine-like fluorescence suggest that Hb-induced oxidation may modify LDL when whole blood is circulated in the model HD system.

For most G-protein-coupled receptors that have been tested so far, the disulfide bonds linking together the extracellular loops (ECL) are required for maintaining the structural integrity necessary for ligand binding and receptor activation. A natural mutation affecting Cys20, which is thought to form a disulfide bond with Cys269, has been described in various human populations, although the consequences of this mutation for CCR5 function are not known. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we mutated the four extracellular cysteines of CCR5 singly or in combination to investigate their role in maintaining the structural conformation of the receptor, its ligand binding and signal transduction properties, and its ability to function as a viral coreceptor. Alanine substitution of any single Cys residue reduced surface expression levels by 40â70%. However, mutation of Cys101 or Cys178, predicted to link ECL1 and ECL2 of the receptor, abolished recognition of CCR5 by a panel of conformation sensitive anti-CCR5 antibodies. The effects of the mutations on receptor expression and conformation were partially temperature-sensitive, with partial restoration of receptor expression and conformation achieved by incubating cells at 32 Â°C. All cysteine mutants were unable to bind detectable levels of MIP-1Î², and did not respond functionally to CCR5 agonists. Surprisingly, all cysteine mutants did support infection by R5 strains of HIV, though at reduced levels. These results indicate that both disulfide bonds of CCR5 are necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of the receptor necessary for ligand binding and signaling.

In addition, the second extracellular loop of CCR5 is responsible for the binding selectivity of the receptor, and determines the range of chemokines to which it responds functionally (24Samson M.

Detailed antigenic mapping of CCR5 also indicates that CCR5 is structurally complex, with the reactivity of many antibodies being dependent upon multiple CCR5 domains (25Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C.

Mutation of these cysteines in the Î²2-adrenergic, muscarinic M1, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors results in a dramatic impairment of receptor function (27Fraser C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A few rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors, such as the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and the mas oncogene do not share this conserved disulfide bond (31Gerard C.M. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 32Young D. Waitches G. Birchmeier C. Fasano O. Wigler M. Cell. 1986; 45: 711-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition to this conserved disulfide bridge, the various chemokine receptors have in common two additional cysteines located in the N-terminal domain and the third extracellular loop. These two cysteines are thought to form a second disulfide bond (33Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar), which is expected to provide an additional structural constraint that contributes to the stability and conformation of the receptor. Indeed, all GPCRs that have been demonstrated to interact with chemokines contain these additional Cys residues, suggesting that the structure imposed by the additional bond is essential for the interaction of the receptors with the common core structure of their ligands. A natural variant of CCR5 has been described in which the N-terminal domain Cys20 is replaced by Ser (34Carrington M. Kissner T. Gerrard B. Ivanov S. O'Brien S.J. Dean M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although the consequences of this mutation on receptor function was not described, this allele was found in two seropositive non-progressors, suggesting that the mutant receptor could play a role similar to that of the prevalent CCR5 mutant allele CCR5Î32. In order to address the role of the disulfide bonds of CCR5 for its receptor and coreceptor functions and to investigate the consequences of the Cys20polymorphism, we substituted alanine residues for the four extracellular cysteines, individually or in combination. The various mutants were tested for their ability to bind chemokines, to respond functionally to agonists and to allow infection by macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains. The mutants were also tested by flow cytometry, using a panel of well defined monoclonal antibodies to determine surface expression and/or modifications of receptor conformation. We show that alanine substitution of any of the four conserved cysteines resulted in a moderate decrease of CCR5 expression level, but abolished completely chemokine binding and functional response to chemokines. The disulfide bond bridging extracellular loops 1 and 2 was found to be necessary for maintaining the complex conformational structure of the extracellular domains. Finally, none of the disulfide bonds was an absolute requirement for the coreceptor function of CCR5. Recombinant MIP-1Î² was obtained from R&D Systems. It was shown locally to be active at adequate concentrations on wild-type CCR5 expressed in CHO-K1 cells. The lyophilized chemokine was dissolved as a 10 Î¼m solution in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at â20 Â°C in aliquots. It was diluted to the working concentration immediately before use.125I-MIP-1Î² (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) in the pcDNA3 vector (Stratagene) was used as a template for site directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. After sequencing, the mutated cassettes were transferred into pcDNA3-CCR5. Double and quadruple mutants were generated by further transfer of mutated cassettes. The mutant CCR5 genes were also transferred into a bicistronic vector (pEFIN3) as described previously (24Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

All final constructs were verified by sequencing. 293T cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine. CHO-K1 cells were cultured using Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 2D7 and the 3A9 monoclonal antibodies (35Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp.

The monoclonal antibodies CTC5 and CTC8 were received from Protein Design Labs (25Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M.

The monoclonal antibodies 501, 531, and 549 were donated by R&D Systems (25Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N.

Doranz B.J. Rana S. Yi Y. Mellado M. Frade J.M. Martinez A. O'Brien S.J. Dean M. Collman R.G. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7450-7458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 18 h following transfection, the cells were suspended in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and washed with PBS. The cells were incubated in FACS staining buffer (PBS supplemented with 2.5% calf serum, 0.5% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide), containing 10 Î¼g/ml monoclonal antibody, followed by a phycoerythrin-conjugated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) at a 1/100 dilution. The concentration used for the monoclonal antibodies was at least 2-fold the saturating concentration. FACS analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). The mean channel fluorescence (MCF) was used to compare the levels of receptor expression at the cell surface. Results were normalized for the MCF obtained for a particular antibody against wild-type (wt) CCR5 (normalized as 100%) after subtraction of the background MCF obtained against pcDNA3 transfected cells (normalized as 0%). A plasmid encoding apoaequorin and GÎ±16 under control of the SRÎ± promoter (38Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected into CHO-K1 cells, using Fusgene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Zeocin (250 Î¼g/ml, Invitrogen) selection of transfectants was initiated 2 days after transfection, and 3 weeks later, stably transfected cell lines were cloned by limit dilution. The best responding clone was selected on the basis of the functional responses to ionomycin A (100 nm) and ATP (10 Î¼m). Constructs encoding wild-type CCR5 and alanine substitution mutants were transfected using Fusgene 6 in this apoaequorin expressing cell line. Selection of stably transfected cells was made for 14 days with 400 Î¼g/ml G418 (Life Technologies), and the population of mixed cell clones expressing each of the constructs was used for binding and functional studies. The level of receptor expression was measured by flow cytometry using antibodies directed against the N terminus (3A9) and second extracellular loop (2D7) of CCR5. Transfected CHO-K1 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant CCR5 were collected from plates with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000 Ãg and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% BSA). Competition binding assays were performed in Minisorb tubes (Nunc), using 0.24 mm125I-MIP-1Î² (2200 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) as tracer, variable concentrations of competitors and 40,000 cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Total binding was measured in the absence of competitor and nonspecific binding was measured with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 27 Â°C, then bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 1% BSA. Filters were counted in a Î²-scintillation counter. Binding parameters were determined with PRISM software (Graph-Pad software) using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition model. Dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment on wtCCR5 was carried out with 100 nm at 37Â° for 1 h. Cells were than washed three times, and binding experiments were performed as described above. Functional response to chemokines was analyzed by measuring the luminescence of aequorin as described (39Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The stably transfected cell lines were collected from plates with Ca2+/Mg2+-free DMEM supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, pelleted for 2 min at 1000 Ã g, resuspended in DMEM at a density of 5 Ã 106 cells/ml and incubated for 2 h in the dark in the presence of coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 5 Î¼m. Cells were diluted 7.5-fold before use. Agonists in a volume of 50 Î¼l were added to 50 Î¼l of cell suspension (33,000 cells), and luminescence was measured for 30 s in a Packard luminometer. Plasmids encoding the HIV-1 ADA and BaL Env. were provided by John Moore (Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, NY). The NL4â3 luciferase virus backbone (pNL-Luc-Eâ Râ) was provided by Ned Landau (Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center). Luciferase reporter viruses were prepared as described previously by cotransfecting 293T cells with the indicated Env and the NL4â3 luciferase virus backbone (40Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Target cells were prepared by co-transfecting 293T cells with CD4 and a constant amount of appropriate coreceptor cloned in pcDNA3 vector. Incubation was done at 37 or 32 Â°C as indicated. Four days after infection, cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and an appropriate aliquot was analyzed for luciferase activity. The four extracellular cysteines of CCR5 believed to be involved in the formation of disulfide bonds were mutated to alanine, individually or in combination. A schematic representation of the CCR5 extracellular domains highlighting the position of the four cysteines and the location of the two putative bonds is presented in Fig. 1. The disulfide bond linking Cys101 and Cys178 is common to most G protein-coupled receptors, while the bond linking Cys20 and Cys269 is specific to chemokine receptors and is not found outside this subfamily. Plasmids encoding the mutant receptors were transfected into 293T cells and cell surface expression evaluated by FACS using two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against linear epitopes located within the N-terminal domain of CCR5 (CTC5 and CTC8, Figs. 1 and2 a). CTC5 recognizes the very distal part of CCR5 N terminus, including Asp2; CTC8 reacts with a more proximal region involving Tyr10 to Asn13 (25Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Gaylord H. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The location of these epitopes coupled with the fact that these mAbs recognize fully denatured and reduced CCR5 by Western blot argues that binding of these mAbs to CCR5 is unlikely to be affected by the Cys mutations, either directly or indirectly through altered receptor conformation. Using these two mAbs, we found that surface expression of the CCR5 mutants was consistently reduced by 40â70%, demonstrating that the disulfide bonds are dispensable for surface expression but nevertheless contribute to the generation of a receptor conformation compatible with efficient trafficking to the cell surface. Simultaneous substitution of the two cysteines involved in a putative disulfide bond (e.g. Cys101 and Cys178 or Cys20 and Cys269) did not result in further impairment of surface expression, which is compatible with the hypothesis that disulfide bond disruption is more important than the actual amino acid replacements. Disruption of both disulfide bonds by concomitant replacement of the four cysteines by alanine did not affect expression more dramatically than single bond disruption.Figure 2a, FACS analysis of CCR5 mutants using different anti-CCR5 mAbs. 293T cells were transfected with wild-type CCR5 or mutant receptors, kept for 18 h at 37 Â°C, and stained with six mAbs directed against different domains of CCR5. CTC5 and CTC8 recognize well defined linear epitopes at the N terminus of the receptor. 2D7 and 531 recognize epitopes of the second extracellular loop, located, respectively, before and after Cys178. mAbs 501 and 549 recognize multidomain epitopes involving at least ECL1 and ECL2. Results have been normalized against the MCF values obtained with each antibody for wild-type CCR5 (set at 100%) after subtraction of background fluorescence (MCF value obtained for pcDNA3 transfected cells). The results shown are representative of two to three independent experiments (depending on the antibodies) that provided similar results (less than 10% variation between experiments). b, influence of temperature on CCR5 mutant conformation. Following transfection, the cells were incubated for 18 h at 32 Â°C instead of 37 Â°C. FACS analysis was performed with the same panel of mAbs as that used in Fig. 1. Results were normalized as for Fig. 1. Mutation of Cys101 and Cys178, or their combination, strongly impaired the recognition by multi-domain mAbs 501 and 549 without altering the surface expression of the mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The reduced levels of surface expression observed after mutation of any single Cys residue suggested that disulfide bond disruption could affect receptor conformation, resulting in partial impairment of receptor trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. To test this hypothesis further, mAbs recognizing other regions of the receptors were used. mAbs 2D7 and 531 recognize conformation-dependent determinants in the second extracellular loop of CCR5 (Fig. 1). The epitope of 2D7 maps to the first part of ECL2 (35Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and involves Lys172 and Asp173, while that of mAb 531 maps to the second half of ECL2, from Tyr184 to Phe189. In addition, two mAbs (mAb 501 and mAb 549) which interact with multiple CCR5 extracellular domains were also used (Fig. 1). mAb 501 requires both the first and second loops of CCR5, while mAb 549 requires the combination of the N terminus and the first two extracellular loops for efficient recognition of this receptor (25Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Gaylord H. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). None of the four mAbs recognizes CCR5 by Western blot. All four conformation-dependent mAbs recognized the C20A and C269A single and combination mutants as well as the N-terminal mAbs CTC5 and CTC8. Thus, disruption of the disulfide bond involving the N-terminal domain of CCR5 and the third extracellular loop did not affect conformationally sensitive antigenic determinants involving extracellular loops 1 and 2 (Fig. 2 a). By sharp contrast, 2D7 barely detected the C101A and C178A mutants, while mAbs 531, 501, and 549 were totally unable to label these mutants. Interestingly, the mutant combining C101A and C178A was recognized more efficiently by 2D7 and mAb 531 than the individual mutants (Fig. 2 a). These results are consistent with these two cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond, since elimination of one Cys residue involved in a disulfide bond leaves behind an unpaired, reactive Cys residue that has the potential to form aberrant intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds. By contrast, simultaneous replacement of both cysteines involved in a disulfide bond will not leave an unpaired Cys, and so might result in more efficient protein folding. These data demonstrate that the disulfide bond linking ECL1 and ECL2, but not the bond linking the N terminus to ECL3, is essential for rendering the extracellular domains of CCR5 compatible with their recognition by conformation-sensitive antibodies. Mutations that affect protein folding are sometimes temperature-sensitive. Thus, a mutation that results in misfolding at 37 Â°C may not do so at 32 Â°C. To determine if the Cys mutants exhibited a temperature-sensitive phenotype, cells were incubated for 18 h at 32 Â°C following transfection and CCR5 expression monitored by FACS using the panel of mAbs described above (Fig.2 b). We found that incubation at 32 Â°C dramatically increased the relative expression level of all the CCR5 mutants as de"

Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), contains a variety of modified nucleosides of unknown function (2McClosky J.A. Crain P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The most common single modification is the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine (Î¨),1 the 5-ribosyl isomer of uridine (3Cohn W. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1488-1498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Î¨ is formed by isomerization of specific uridines after the RNA chain is formed. The mechanism of the reaction, which involves breaking of the N1-glycosyl bond, rotation of the uracil ring, and formation of a C5-glycosyl bond is unknown but is thought to involve an active site carboxyl group of an aspartate residue (4Huang L. Pookanjanatavip M. Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Î¨ is found in the rRNA of all organisms so far examined (5Ofengand J. Fournier M. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 229-253Google Scholar), and in Escherichia coli, which has one Î¨ in the 16 S RNA (6Bakin A. Kowalak J.A. McCloskey J.A. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3681-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and nine in the 23 S RNA (7Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13475-13483Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is the most prevalent of the modified nucleosides. The single Î¨ in the 16 S RNA is found adjacent to the â530â loop, whose sequence has been almost completely conserved in all organisms and is known to be involved in the fidelity of codon recognition (reviewed in Refs. 9Ofengand J.

Santer U. Nurse K. Bakin A. Cunningham P. Zain M. O'Connell D. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In 23 S RNA, the nine Î¨ residues are distributed among three distinct areas, which, despite their separation in two-dimensional secondary structure representations, are at or near the peptidyl transferase center when in the ribosome (11Ofengand J. Bakin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 246-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, despite the congruence of the Î¨ residues with the two functional centers of the ribosome, namely decoding and peptide bond formation, there is so far no known role for Î¨ in the process of protein synthesis. To approach this problem, we have initiated a program to identify the genes for the specific synthases that make the 10 Î¨ in E. coli rRNA on the assumption, subsequently shown to be correct, that distinct synthases are used to form Î¨ at the different sites in the rRNA molecule. Once identified, gene inactivation will result in the loss of a specific synthase and should therefore cause the loss of specific Î¨ residues for which the effect on cell physiology can then be assessed. Thus far, three Î¨ synthase genes have been inactivated in this manner. One, rluC, codes for a synthase solely responsible for formation of Î¨ residues 955, 2504, and 2580 in 23 S RNA (12Conrad J. Sun D. Englund N. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18562-18566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and a second, rluD, codes for the synthase that makes 23 S RNA Î¨1911, 1915, and 1917 (13Raychaudhuri S. Conrad J. Hall B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1998; 4: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The third,rsuA, codes for the synthase that forms 16 S RNA Î¨516 (14Conrad J. Niu L. Rudd K. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Inactivation of rluC and rsuA and the consequent loss of their respective Î¨ had no physiological effect. However, disruption of rluD with the loss of its three Î¨ severely inhibited cell growth. Another synthase, RluA, was shown to form only Î¨746 when in vitro transcripts of 23 S RNA were the substrate. The synthase also specifically catalyzed the formation of Î¨32 in E. coli tRNAPhe (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to be highly specific for a single site in more than one class of RNA, a property termed âdual specificityâ (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar), has since been reported for another Î¨ synthase (16Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) as well as for a ribose methylating enzyme, although in the latter case the dual specificity resides in the guide RNA (17Tycowski K.T. You Z.-H. Graham P.J. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A question left open by the work on RluA was whether it is the only synthase in E. coli capable of forming rRNA Î¨746 and tRNA Î¨32 and what the effect of its absence would be on the cell. This issue has now been addressed by deleting rluA and comparing the growth rate with wild type both separately and in a competition experiment. In addition, by mutating aspartate 64, which was predicted to be an essential residue by virtue of its location in a conserved sequence, HRLD (4Huang L. Pookanjanatavip M. Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we have shown that RluA, as well as RsuA (14Conrad J. Niu L. Rudd K. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), RluD, 2S. Raychaudhuri and J. Ofengand, unpublished results. and TruA (4Huang L. Pookanjanatavip M. Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), requires this residue for function. TherluA gene was deleted by the method of Hamilton et al. (18Hamilton C.M. Aldea H. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insert, cloned into the XbaI andKpnI sites of pMAK705, was prepared by PCR as described by Nelson and colleagues (Fig. 2 in Ref. 19Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It contained 818 bases 5â² to the AUG start and 785 bases 3â² to the UAA termination codon. Sixteen bases of the N-terminal portion of the gene and 52 bases of the C terminus were retained with the remainder being replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene, obtained by PCR amplification from pUC4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, catalog no. 27-4958-01). The host strain for pMAK705 was the leucine auxotroph MC1061, as described by Hamiltonet al. (18Hamilton C.M. Aldea H. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deleted rluA gene was moved into strains MG1655 (Ref. 20Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M.

Selection was done on either rich (LB, Ref. 22Zyskind J.W. Bernstein S.I. Recombinant DNA Laboratory Manual.

The preparation of wild-type rescue plasmid pET15b/rluA has been described previously (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type rescue plasmid pTrc99A/rluA was constructed by insertion into the NcoI and HindIII sites of pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, catalog no. 275007-01) of a segment of DNA that was PCR-amplified from pET15b/rluA and consisting of the rluA gene starting from the initiator AUG and ending at the terminator UAA. The N-terminal primer had anNcoI site adjacent to the initiating AUG, whereas in the reverse orientation, the C-terminal primer incorporated aHindIII site after the terminator UAA. These plasmids were prepared by the megaprimer PCR mutagenesis procedure (23Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed using the pTrc99A/rluA rescue plasmid as template and three oligonucleotide primers, two outer primers, which were upstream and downstream of the mutation site, and one mutagenic primer. The upstream and downstream primers contained the restriction sites NcoI and HindIII, respectively, so that the product could be ligated directly into pTrc99A. Mutagenesis was carried out in three steps. The initial PCR reaction was performed with either mutagenic primer 5â²-CATCGTCTGACTATGGCTACC-3â² for the D64T mutation or 5â²-CATCGTCTGAATATGGCTACC-3â² for the D64N mutation (mutation sites shown in bold) and with the downstream primer 5â²-GGGAAGCTTTTAAAAATCCGCTGGCGC-3â² having aHindIII site (underlined). A 100-Î¼l reaction contained 50 ng of template plasmid DNA, 15 pmol each of the mutagenic primer and downstream primer, 3 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.75, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixture was denatured at 95 Â°C for 60 s, and then 10 cycles of amplification (95 Â°C, 30 s; 47 Â°C, 60 s; 72 Â°C, 70 s) were performed, followed by a 5-min extension at 72 Â°C. Fifty pmol of the upstream primer was added (5â²-GGGGCCATGGATGGGGATGGAAAACTAC-3â²,NcoI site underlined), and the reaction mixture was subjected to the same amplification program. Finally, 50 pmol of downstream primer was added, and the sample was subjected to the same amplification program again. The amplified product was purified by gel electrophoresis, digested with NcoI and HindIII, and ligated with similarly digested and purified pTrc99A for 16 h at 16 Â°C. The ligation mixture was transformed into Novablue cells (Novagen, Inc.) by standard methods yielding 4 positive clones of 5 tested for D64T and 3 positive of 4 tested for D64N. DNA sequencing of the isolated plasmids verified that the expected mutation had been produced at the desired site. Transfer of the mutant rluAgenes into pET15b was done by PCR amplification of the mutantrluA genes in pTrc99A. The N-terminal primer extended from â9 to +18, where the A of the initiating AUG of rluA is +1 with changes at â2 to â5, to create an XhoI site adjacent to the initiating AUG. The C-terminal primer, in the reverse orientation, extended from +643 to +669, where the last sense nucleotide is 657, and contained mismatches at +661 to +666 to create aBamHI site. The amplified product was purified, digested with XhoI and BamHI, and subsequently ligated with identically treated pET15b vector for 16 h at 16 Â°C. DNA sequence analysis verified the constructs (data not shown). pET15b/rluA-D64T and pET15b/rluA-D64N were transformed into Novablue cells (Novagen, Inc.) by standard methods and yielded 7 positive clones of 9 tested (D64T) or 5 of 7 (D64N). They were transferred into BL21/DE3(rluA â) cells by standard methods. Overexpression and affinity purification were carried out as described previously (13Raychaudhuri S. Conrad J. Hall B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1998; 4: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). pET15b/rluA was processed in the same way. 5-[3H]Uridine-labeled transcripts of full-length 23 S RNA (specific activity 168 dpm/pmol uridine residues) were prepared as described previously (13Raychaudhuri S. Conrad J. Hall B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1998; 4: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 5-[3H]uridine-labeled transcripts of tRNAPhe(199 dpm/pmol), tRNACys (1269 dpm/pmol), and tRNA4Leu (454 dpm/pmol) were prepared as described for tRNAPhe (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar) but using pTFMa-ECys (the gift of Ya-Ming Hou, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) as template for tRNACys and pUC19/tRNA4Leu(UAA) for tRNA4Leu. Ribosomal RNA for Î¨ sequencing was prepared according to King and Schlessinger (24King T.C. Schlessinger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12034-12042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with omission of the LiCl precipitation step. Î¨ sequencing of rRNA was performed as described previously (7Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Bakin A. Ofengand J. Martin R. Methods in Molecular Biology: Protein Synthesis: Methods and Protocols. 77. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 297-309Google Scholar). tRNA for Î¨ sequencing was isolated as described (26Deutscher M.P. Hilderman R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 621-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from cells grown to anA 550 of 1.0 in LB medium. Î¨ sequencing of tRNACys was done exactly as for rRNA using a primer complementary to residues 61â76. For the individual exponential phase growth experiments, overnight cultures at 37 Â°C in the medium to be tested were diluted 50-fold (minimal medium) or 100-fold (rich medium) and placed at the testing temperature. Cell density was monitored at 600 nm. Viable cells in the mixed competition experiment were determined by plating on LB, in which both wild-type and mutant grow, and on LB plus kanamycin, in which only rluA âgrows. For the 1:103 dilution series (Fig. 8), the first four cycles were analyzed by first plating aliquots on LB and then direct transfer of individual colonies to LB plus kanamycin (patch analysis). 100 colonies originating from each of four individual flasks (400 colonies total) were analyzed per time point. For the last two cycles, direct plating of three aliquots per each of four flasks to LB with and without kanamycin was used for a total of 12 platings per medium per time point. For the 1:1.6 Ã 106 dilution series, direct plating of two aliquots per each of three flasks (six platings per time point) to LB with and without kanamycin was used for the rluA â cells. Patch analysis using 100 colonies from each of two flasks (200 colonies total) was used for thersuA â and rluC â cells. The fraction of rluA â in the mixture is the number of colonies on LB plus kanamycin divided by the number on LB alone. The number of cell doublings (G) is calculated from the dilution factor (DF) at each cycle using the relation DF =N/N o = 2 G. Thus, to reach the same cell density after a 1:103 dilution requires 9.97 cell doublings, and the 1.6 Ã 106 dilution corresponds to 20.6 cell doublings. Transformants of wild-type, MG1655(rluA â), and MG1655(miaA â rluA â) strains with pTrc99A and pTrc99A/rluA as well as wild-type and BL21/DE3(rluA â) with pET15b and pET15b/rluA were selected on LB plates containing 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin. All subsequent growth media for the transformants also contained 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin to retain the plasmid in the carbenicillin-sensitive host cells. In vitro assays of Î¨ synthase activity were done as described previously (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar).Pfu DNA polymerase was from Promega. All other enzymes and primers were obtained and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (13Raychaudhuri S. Conrad J. Hall B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1998; 4: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Overexpressed and purified RluA converts U746 inE. coli 23 S rRNA transcripts to Î¨746 and U-32 in tRNAPhe transcripts to Î¨32 (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, the enzyme was highly specific for these two sites. Comparison of the sequence surrounding the sites of the two U residues selected for conversion to Î¨ revealed that both possessed the same sequence immediately 3â² to the U in question, thus providing a rationale for the dual specificity exhibited by this enzyme (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments did not, however, show whether additional enzymes existed in the cell that were also capable of Î¨ formation at these sites, nor did they show the effect of deletion of these Î¨ residues. Therefore, the gene was deleted by insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene (18Hamilton C.M. Aldea H. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in strain MC1061. The deletion was confirmed by PCR amplification from the N and C terminii of the rluA gene in the chromosomal DNA of the deletion mutant. The wild-type control had the expected 670-base pair band, whereas the mutant having a kan insert was 1.4 kilobase pairs in size. The presence of the kan gene was further confirmed by amplification from the N and C termini of thekan gene. The mutant produced the expected 1.3-kilobase pair band, whereas no band was obtained from the wild type. To assess the physiological effects of this gene deletion uncomplicated by the other mutant genetic loci present in MC1061 (18Hamilton C.M. Aldea H. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion was transferred by bacteriophage P1 transduction into MG1655 in which the sequenced genome (20Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar) provided a well defined background. Transductants were selected by resistance to kanamycin. PCR amplification confirmed the presence of the kanamycin insert, and Î¨ sequencing analysis of the ribosomal RNA from the mutant strain showed unequivocally that Î¨746 was absent (data not shown). To prove that the loss of Î¨ attendant on the deletion ofrluA was a direct consequence of the deletion and not because of some downstream polarity or other indirect effect, the gene was replaced in trans by transformation of the deletion strain with a rescue plasmid that contained only the rluAgene inserted into pTrc99A. Wild type and MG1655(rluA â) were transformed with both the rescue plasmid and the control vector pTrc99A and selected on carbenicillin plates. Ribosomal RNA was isolated and sequenced for the presence of Î¨ (Fig. 1). Comparing therluA + lanes with therluA â lanes, it is clear that the stop at residue 746 in the + CMC lane of therluA + set is absent in the + CMC laneof the rluA â pair. Recall that in this method of sequencing, reverse transcriptase halts one residue 3â² to the CMC-Î¨ (7Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Bakin A. Ofengand J. Martin R. Methods in Molecular Biology: Protein Synthesis: Methods and Protocols. 77. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 297-309Google Scholar). However, when the rescue plasmid was introduced into the rluA â strain, Î¨746 was again found. The stop seen in all lanes results from m1G745, because all of the RNAs were isolated from cells. We conclude that the loss of Î¨746 is a direct result of deletion of rluA and that RluA is the sole gene product capable of synthesis of Î¨746. Additional sequencing analyses verified that only Î¨746 was absent from therluA â strain (data not shown). Recently, it has been shown that the replacement of Asp-60 in a conserved (G/H)(R/a)(L/t)(D) motif (lowercase identifies a rare event), by Ala, Asn, Glu, Lys, or Ser in the pseudouridine synthase TruA resulted in the loss of catalytic activity while retaining binding ability (4Huang L. Pookanjanatavip M. Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There is an equivalent residue, Asp-64, in a similarly conserved motif, HRLD, in the RluA synthase, and it is the only Asp residue in such a motif in the molecule. To test the possibility that Asp-64 could be an essential residue of this enzyme, we mutated it to Thr and Asn. This was done by megaprimer mutagenesis (23Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The two mutated rluA were cloned in pTrc99A and transformed into MG1655(rluA â) cells to assess the function of these mutant enzymes in vivo. The wild-type rescue plasmid served as a control. Ribosomal RNA was isolated and sequenced for the presence of Î¨ (Fig.2). It is clear that the only strain able to make Î¨746 is the strain carrying the wild-type rescue plasmid. Neither plasmid carrying a mutant rluA was any more effective than the vector alone. Thus, in vivo, the single mutation D64T or D64N is sufficient to block synthesis of an active Î¨746 synthase. One might conclude from this experiment that Asp-64 is an amino acid that actively participates in catalysis, but it could also be that its role is in the maintenance of the correct conformation of the enzyme. In the latter event, the replacement of Asp-64 by another amino acid might make the protein susceptible to protease degradation. To address this question, we turned to the BL21/DE3 strain and pET15b to obtain stable overexpression of the mutant proteins. TherluA â gene was transferred into BL21/DE3 by P1 transduction from MC1061 with selection by kanamycin resistance. PCR amplification confirmed the presence of the kanamycin insert, and Î¨ sequencing analysis of the ribosomal RNA from the mutant strain showed the absence of Î¨746 (data not shown, but see Fig. 4 for an equivalent result). Both the wild-type and mutant rluA constructs were subcloned into pET15b. DNA sequencing analysis (data not shown) confirmed that the desired mutants had been produced in pET15b. The BL21/DE3(rluA â) cells were then transformed with vector alone or with the rluA constructs in pET15b. Transformants were selected on carbenicillin plates. The BL21/DE3 cells carrying either the vector or the various rluA constructs were then induced. After a 3-h induction with isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside, samples from each cultures were taken out for protein analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as well as for ribosomal RNA isolation and Î¨ sequencing analysis. Fig. 3 shows that a strongly overexpressed protein band at about 27 kDa, the expected size, was found in the cells carrying both wild-type and mutant rluAconstructs, whereas there was no such overexpressed protein band in the cells carrying the vector only. Furthermore, induction was required to produce the band. The intensity of the 27-kDa band appeared the same in both wild-type and mutant constructs. Î¨ sequencing analysis of the rRNA showed that, as with the results obtained in Fig. 2, the mutant rescue plasmids were unable to form Î¨746 (Fig.4). We conclude that the two mutantrluA constructs produced stable proteins that had, nevertheless, lost the capability to isomerize U746 to Î¨ as a result of the replacement of Asp-64 by Thr-64 or Asn-64.Figure 3Overexpression of the wild type and mutantrluA gene products in BL21/DE3(rluA â) cells. Cells grown at 37 Â°C were transformed with the various pET15b/rluAconstructs, harvested either before (â) or after (+) induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside, lysed by boiling in SDS, and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Lanes: A, pET15b; B, pET15b/rluA-D64T; C, pET15b/rluA-D64N;D, pET15b/rluA-D64D; S, molecular mass standards of the indicated sizes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Affinity purification of the overexpressed proteins shown in Fig. 3 and assay of in vitro activity using 23 S [3H]RNA transcripts as substrate gave the same result, namely that whereas unit stoichiometry of Î¨ formation could be obtained for the wild-type construct, as reported previously (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar), both the D64T and D64N mutants were totally inactive (Fig. 5). Î¨32 is found in four tRNAs of E. coli, tRNAPhe, tRNACys, tRNA4Leu(UAA), and tRNA5Leu(CAA) (28Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 29Horie N. Yamaizumi Z. Kuchino Y. Takai K. Goldman E. Miyazawa T. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We previously showed that RluA formed Î¨32 on a transcript of tRNAPhe in an in vitro reaction (15Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar), a result that led to the concept of dual specificity for this enzyme. All five of these RNAs, the 23 S RNA and the four tRNAs, share a common sequence surrounding the Î¨ residue, namely (A/G)Î¨UN(A/C)AAA. Therefore, it seemed reasonable that these other tRNAs could also serve as a substrate for RluA. To test this hypothesis, tRNACys and tRNA4Leu transcripts were assayed for their ability to react with RluA (Fig.6). Both transcripts were active. The rate and yield with tRNACys was virtually identical to that with tRNAPhe, whereas tRNA4Leu was somewhat less reactive for unknown reasons. To determine whether RluA is the only protein in E. colicapable of tRNA Î¨32 formation, tRNA from therluA â strain was analyzed. However, before the reverse transcription assay could be used, obstacles created by the presence of other modified nucleosides in the tRNAs that block reverse transcriptase had to be overcome. ms2i6A37, present in all three tRNAs, is a strong inhibitor of reverse transcription. Moreover, tRNAPhe also has acp3U47, another strong blocker, and tRNA4Leu has cmnm5Um34 (29Horie N. Yamaizumi Z. Kuchino Y. Takai K. Goldman E. Miyazawa T. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S.

RARs are activated by both all-trans-retinoic acid (tRA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA), whereas RXRs are activated exclusively by 9cRA. There are three RAR isotypes and three RXR isotypes (Î±, Î², and Î³), encoded by distinct genes, and for each isotype, there are at least two main isoforms, which differ in their NH2-terminal A regions and are generated by differential promoter usage and/or alternative splicing (5Leid M.

As other members of the nuclear steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, RARs and RXRs exhibit a conserved modular structure with six variably conserved functional regions (A to F) (Fig. 1 and Refs. 5Leid M.

Upon ligand binding, there is a major transconformational change of the ligand-binding domain that involves the folding back of helix 12 and the formation of a new surface required for interaction with coactivators that relay the AF-2 activity to the transcriptional machinery and/or to the chromatin template (6Chambon P.

As most members of the nuclear receptor family (22Weigel N.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), RARs have been shown to be phosphoproteins (23Gaub M.P.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In mouse RARÎ±, a phosphorylated serine residue has been identified in region B; it is phosphorylated by Cdk7 associated with the general transcription factor TFIIH, and this phosphorylation has been shown to be crucial for AF-1 activity in transfected COS cells (26Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, mRARÎ± is phosphorylated by protein kinase A at a serine residue located in the ligand-binding domain/AF-2 domain (27Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These serine residues that are conserved among RARs were also found to be phosphorylated in RARÎ³. 2S. Adam-Stitah, L. Penna, P. Chambon, and C. Rochette-Egly, unpublished data. Most interestingly, phosphorylation of residues in the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of both RARÎ± and RARÎ³ has been shown to be indispensable for differentiation of embryonal carcinoma F9 cells upon retinoic acid and cyclic AMP treatment (28Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that RXRÎ± is also a phosphoprotein. As for RARÎ±, phosphorylation sites for proline-directed protein kinases are located in the A/B region of mouse RXRÎ±1 and are constitutively phosphorylated in transfected COS-1 cells. In addition, we demonstrate that under stress conditions such as UV irradiation, mouse RXRÎ±1 is hyperphosphorylated by endogenous and/or overexpressed stress-activated protein kinases, such as the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, JNK1 and JNK2 (29Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 30Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

This hyperphosphorylation involves serines 61 and 75 and threonine 87 that are located in the B region and serine 265 in the E region. However, in contrast to RARÎ±, hyperphosphorylation by JNKs does not appear to modulate the transcriptional properties of RXRÎ± in cultured cells transfected with retinoic acid-responsive reporter genes. The pSG5-based expression vectors for mRARÎ±1 (16Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P.

For the construction of mRXRÎ±1 mutants, mRXRÎ±1 was first subcloned into theXhoI/BglII sites of pSG5-Cas (16Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) after polymerase chain reaction amplification of the A to E regions. The mRXRÎ±1 S22A, S44A, S48A, S54A, S61A, S75A, T87A, S96A, and S101A expression vectors were constructed by double polymerase chain reaction amplification reactions (27Rochette-Egly C.

Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar), generating a XhoI/EcoRV fragment containing the appropriate mutation. The double mutant RXRÎ±S75A/T87A was constructed according to the same protocol by introducing the T87A mutation into the RXRÎ±S75A mutant. Similarly, the RXRÎ±S61A/S75A/T87A expression vector was constructed by introducing the S61A mutation into the RXRÎ±S75A/T87A double mutant. RXRÎ±S265A was also constructed by double polymerase chain reaction amplification reaction, generating anEcoRV/BamHI fragment containing the mutation. The double mutant RXRÎ±S22A/S265A was prepared by subcloning theEcoRI/EcoRV fragment containing the S22A mutation into the same sites of RXRÎ±S265A. The same strategy was followed for constructing the RXRÎ±S61A/S75A/T87A/S265A mutant. All plasmids were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Additional details of constructions and oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. The reporter genes DR1G-tk-CAT and mRARÎ²2-CAT have been previously described (16Nagpal S. Saunders M.

Purified recombinant RARÎ±1WT, RARÎ±ÎAB, RARÎ³1WT, RXRÎ±1WT, and RXRÎ±ÎAB overexpressed in Escherichia coli were gifts from H. Gronemeyer. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the DE regions (monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4RX3A2) of RXRÎ± and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the A (RPRXÎ±(A)) and D (RPRXÎ±(D)) regions of RXRÎ±1 have been described by Rochette-Egly et al. (41Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Pfister V. Heyberger S. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the F region of RARÎ±, mAb 9Î±(F) and RPÎ±(F), respectively, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against the A1 region of RARÎ³1 (mAb 1Î³(A1)) were as described (23Gaub M.P.

Gaub M.P. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Purified mouse anti-human JNK1 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and anti-JNK1 polyclonal antibodies as agarose conjugates were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-ACTIVETM JNK polyclonal antibodies were from Promega. COS-1 cells maintained in Eagle's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (25Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Saunders M. Scheuer I. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to the expression vectors or reporters described in each figure legend, all transfections contained the Î²-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (1 Î¼g) to correct for variations in transfection efficiency and Bluescript DNA as a carrier. After a 20-h incubation with calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA, the cells were washed, maintained for 8 h in the appropriate medium, and incubated for another 20 h in medium containing 0.5% charcoal-treated serum along with the ligand (10â7m 9cRA). Where mentioned, cells were UV-irradiated (40 J/m2) 4 h before harvesting (42Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (CAT ELISA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Results were expressed as pg of CAT/unit of Î²-galactosidase. The F9â1.8 reporter cell line stably transfected with the mRARÎ²2 promoter coupled to the lacZ gene was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7.5% fetal calf serum as described by Maden et al. (43Maden M. Sonneveld E. van der Saag P.T. Gale E. Development. 1998; 125: 4133-4144PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from transfected COS as described (26Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and incubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked with the indicated monoclonal antibodies in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 2 h at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed in IP buffer; resuspended in 100 Î¼l of phosphatase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.8, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2) containing 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the absence or presence of sodium orthovanadate (50 Î¼m) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 3 h. After washing, the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed and lysed as described by Sadowski and Gilman (44Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.125 Î¼m okadaic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 16,000 Ã g for 20 s, supernatants were supplemented with NaCl to 120 mm and clarified (16,000 Ã g for 20 min), and glycerol was added to 10%. In vitrophosphorylation reactions were performed as described by Rochette-Eglyet al. (27Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with purified bacterially expressed RXRÎ±1 (1 Î¼g), using either p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (20 ng) or p34 Cdk1/cyclin B (20 ng) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). In the case of JNKs, activated JNKs were first isolated from cytosols of UV-irradiated COS cells by immunoprecipitation with JNK1 antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of purified RXRÎ±1 to the beads. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by autoradiography and immunoblotting. For in vivo phosphorylation, COS-1 cells were transfected with wild type or mutated mRXRÎ±1 expression vectors (5 Î¼g) and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described (26Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 27Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where mentioned, cells were UV-irradiated (40 J/m2) 1 h before harvesting. Whole cell extracts were prepared, immunoprecipitated, and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and after electrotransfer, the phosphorylated proteins were revealed by autoradiography and immunoprobing (26Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 27Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping were carried out on thin layer cellulose plates using the Hunter thin-layer electrophoresis system as described (27Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Purified glutathioneS-transferase-stress-activated protein kinase Î± (GST-SAPKÎ±) and GST-SAPKÎ² fusion proteins (2.5 Î¼g) (Upstate Biotechnology) were bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with 500 ng of either RARÎ³1WT, RARÎ±1WT, RARÎ±ÎAB, or RXRÎ±1WT proteins for 4 h at 4 Â°C in a 500-Î¼l final volume of binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 5â10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After four washes with the same buffer, the beads were resuspended in 30 Î¼l of Laemmli buffer, and after boiling, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. To determine whether the nuclear RXRÎ± is a phosphoprotein, COS-1 cells were transfected with RXRÎ±WT (33Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.Y. Staub A. Garnier J.M. Mader S. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) expression vector and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. RXRÎ± was phosphorylated irrespective of the addition of 9cRA (10â7m) to the culture medium (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that serine residues were phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B). Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of RXRÎ±WT yielded two main phosphopeptides named a and aâ² and an array of additional peptides, named x, lying on two parallel diagonals (Fig. 2 C, panel 1). It must be stressed that, depending on the experiments, these x phosphopeptides were variably distinct, suggesting that they may be partial digestion products or phosphoisomers (45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Identical phosphopeptide patterns were obtained whether or not COS-1 cells were treated with 9cRA (data not shown). To characterize the phosphorylated regions, COS-1 cells were transfected with RXRÎ±ÎAB and subsequently labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The level of phosphorylation was not significantly affected in RXRÎ±ÎAB (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 3 and 4). However, the phosphopeptides observed in RXRÎ±WT were lacking in RXRÎ±ÎAB (Fig.2 C, panel 2), and two additional phosphopeptides (b and bâ²), which were not detectable in RXRÎ±WT, appeared. These results indicate that RXRÎ± was phosphorylated mainly in the A/B region and also suggest that the A/B region may prevent the phosphorylation of sites located elsewhere in the protein. There are nine potential phosphorylation sites for proline-directed kinases in the RXRÎ±1 A/B region (see Fig.1). The serine and threonine residues of these putative sites (serines 22, 44, 48, 54, 61, 75, 96, and 101 and threonine 87) were individually mutated to alanine, and the corresponding mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells. Their level of phosphorylation and phosphopeptide maps were not significantly different from those of RXRÎ±WT except for RXRÎ±S22A, which lacked phosphopeptides a and aâ² (Fig.2 C, panel 3, and data not shown). The observation that a single mutation (S22A) abrogated two phosphorylated spots (a and aâ²) lying on a diagonal suggests that they may correspond to interdependent phosphorylation of adjacent serines (at positions 17â19), with the slowest migrating peptide toward the anode (peptide a) containing only a single phosphate (45Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Note that a third spot situated on the same diagonal was sometimes observed (see Fig. 3 B,panel 1). The nature of the phosphoresidues present in peptides x, which could be possibly located outside of the A/B region, remains to be identified. Serine 22 belongs to a conserved motif for proline-directed Ser/Thr kinases, such as the CDKs (46Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) and the MAPK family. The latter includes extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), as well as SAPKs, such as the JNKs (29Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 30Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 31Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purified bacterially expressed RXRÎ±1WT was used as a substrate for these kinases in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. RXRÎ± was strongly phosphorylated in vitro by p34 Cdk1/cyclin B, p44 MAPK (also named ERK1 (29Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar)), or activated JNKs (Fig.3 A, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Interestingly, phosphorylation by p34 Cdk1/cyclin B generated tryptic phosphopeptides identical to those of RXRÎ± phosphorylated in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 3 B, panel 1), whereas RXRÎ± phosphorylated with p44 MAPK or JNKs yielded a distinct tryptic phosphopeptide map; all of the phosphopeptides generated from RXRÎ± phosphorylated in transfected COS cells were missing, while novel peptides (y1, y2, and z) were present (Fig. 3 B,panel 2, and data not shown). RXRÎ± deleted for the A/B region was not phosphorylated by p34 Cdk1/cyclin B (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). However, RXRÎ±ÎAB was phosphorylated by p44 MAPK and JNKs (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 6) and yielded only phosphopeptides y1 and y2 (Fig. 3 B,panel 3, and data not shown). Thus, the phosphorylation pattern of RXRÎ±1 overexpressed in COS cells is similar to that observed in vitro with p34 Cdk1/cyclin B, while ERKs and JNKs appear to phosphorylate different residues located both in the A/B region and the remaining protein. The above in vitro results suggest that RXRÎ± could be a target for CDKs. However, overexpression of a dominant active Cdk1 (40Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) or of Cdk7, which was previously shown to increase the phosphorylation of RARÎ± (26Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), had no effect on the level of RXRÎ± phosphorylation and on its phosphopeptide maps (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 4 and 5, and data not shown). Whether CDKs other than those tested here could be implicated in the basal phosphorylation of RXRÎ± in COS-1 cells remains to be investigated. Since RXRÎ± was a substrate for p44 MAPK in vitro, we also examined whether stimulation of the MAPK pathways could affect the phosphorylation of RXRÎ± in transfected COS-1 cells. The ERK pathway is stimulated in response to growth factors through Ras activation, while JNKs are activated by stress stimuli or UV irradiation. Activation of ERKs and JNKs involves their own phosphorylation by other kinases located further upstream in the specific signaling cascade (for reviews, see Refs. 29Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

https://openalex.org/W2089511766,"Synaptogyrins constitute a family of synaptic vesicle proteins of unknown function. With the full-length structure of a new brain synaptogyrin isoform, we now show that the synaptogyrin family in vertebrates includes two neuronal and one ubiquitous isoform. All of these synaptogyrins are composed of a short conserved N-terminal cytoplasmic sequence, four homologous transmembrane regions, and a variable cytoplasmic C-terminal tail that is tyrosine-phosphorylated. The localization, abundance, and conservation of synaptogyrins suggest a function in exocytosis. To test this, we employed a secretion assay in PC12 cells expressing transfected human growth hormone (hGH) as a reporter protein. When Ca2+-dependent hGH secretion from PC12 cells was triggered by high K+ or Î±-latrotoxin, co-transfection of all synaptogyrins with hGH inhibited hGH exocytosis as strongly as co-transfection of tetanus toxin light chain. Synaptophysin I, which is distantly related to synaptogyrins, was also inhibitory but less active. Inhibition was independent of the amount of hGH expressed but correlated with the amount of synaptogyrin transfected. Inhibition of exocytosis was not observed with several other synaptic proteins, suggesting specificity. Analysis of the regions of synaptogyrin required for inhibition revealed that the conserved N-terminal domain of synaptogyrin is essential for inhibition, whereas the long C-terminal cytoplasmic tail is largely dispensable.

Our results suggest that synaptogyrins are conserved components of the exocytotic apparatus, which function as regulators of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. human growth hormone cytomegalovirus In presynaptic nerve terminals, synaptic vesicles accumulate transmitters and release them by exocytosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Zucker R.S.

In addition, a partial human sequence for a possible third synaptogyrin isoform (synaptogyrin III) was recently reported (14Kedra D. Pan H.Q. Seroussi E. Fransson I. Guilbaud C. Collins J.E. Dunham I. Blennow E. Roe B.A. Piehl F. Dumanski J.P. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The recently completed genome sequence of Caenorhabditis elegans contains a single homolog of synaptogyrins but no direct synaptophysin homologs, suggesting that synaptogyrins but not synaptophysins are evolutionarily conserved.The presence of neuronal and ubiquitous isoforms for synaptogyrins and synaptophysins suggests that, similar to other synaptic vesicle proteins (e.g. synaptobrevin/cellubrevin, SCAMPs, rab3), synaptogyrins and synaptophysins may have general functions in exocytosis in all cells. The fact that the synaptic vesicle-specific isoforms are components of all synaptic vesicles, and abundant components at that, indicates a role in neurotransmitter release for these isoforms. However, despite a large number of genetic and biochemical studies, the precise functions of synaptogyrins and synaptophysins are still unknown. Analysis of knockout mice lacking synaptophysin I and synaptogyrin I revealed that these proteins are not essential for exocytosis but may regulate neurotransmitter release (15McMahon H.T. Bolshakov V.Y. Janz R. Hammer R.E. Siegelbaum S.A. SuÌdhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,16Eshkind L.G. Leube R.E. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 282: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).1 Several forms of synaptic plasticity, including post-tetanic potentiation and long term potentiation, were defective in mice that lack both synaptophysin I and synaptogyrin I.1Although this result agrees well with previous studies indicating a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in long term potentiation (17O'Dell T.J.

Brain Res. 1993; 621: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), they do not provide a definitive description of the functions of synaptogyrins and synaptophysins. The effects of the synaptogyrin/synaptophysin deletion are reminiscent of the results obtained with knockouts of rab3A, another highly abundant vesicle protein (20Geppert M. Bolshakov V.

Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Mice lacking rab3A also exhibit selective changes in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, although the types of changes were different from those observed in synaptogyrin/synaptophysin knockouts.Holz and co-workers (22Wick P.W. Sneter R.A. Parsels L.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) developed an assay for protein function in exocytosis in which plasmids encoding human growth hormone (hGH)2 and a second protein of interest are transiently co-transfected into PC12 cells or chromaffin cells. In the transfected cells, hGH is secreted as a function of stimulation and serves as a reporter for exocytosis. A high probability of co-transfection of two distinct plasmids into the same cell makes it possible to investigate the effect of the protein of interest on hGH secretion. In previous studies in PC12 cells, we demonstrated that secretion of transfected hGH is Ca2+-dependent, triggered by membrane depolarization or Î±-latrotoxin, inhibited by tetanus toxin, and dependent on phosphatidylinositol kinase activity (23Sugita S. Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. SuÌdhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32715-32724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using this and similar assays, the effects of several proteins have been examined, including rab3A and rabphilin in bovine chromaffin cells (24Holz R.W. Brondyk W.H. Senter R.A. Kuizon L. Macara I.G.

Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). If a co-transfected protein changes Ca2+-regulated hGH secretion, this is taken as evidence for a direct involvement of the transfected protein in exocytosis. Thus, transiently transfected secretory cells such as PC12 cells may be useful models to study the function of synaptic proteins in exocytosis.In the current study, we first analyzed the size of the synaptogyrin family. We determined the full-length structure of synaptogyrin III, which established it as a genuine member of the synaptogyrin family. We then examined the functions of various synaptogyrins in Ca2+-dependent secretions using transfected PC12 cells and applying a number of controls to validate the effects observed. Our results demonstrate that all synaptogyrins potently inhibit Ca2+-dependent exocytosis when overexpressed. Inhibition was as strong as that produced by tetanus toxin. Synaptophysin I exerted a lesser inhibitory effect, and other unrelated proteins caused no inhibition. Our observations reveal a direct participation of synaptogyrins in exocytosis that correlates with their roles in synaptic plasticity observed in the knockout mice. In presynaptic nerve terminals, synaptic vesicles accumulate transmitters and release them by exocytosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Zucker R.S.

For example, NO has been implicated as a regulator of vasodilation, synaptic plasticity, and immune defense. In each case, however, NO has potentially deleterious effects should its production be disturbed, as occurs in excitotoxicity and ischemia (reviewed in Refs. 1Garthwaite J. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 60-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar, 2Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

To understand the means by which NO achieves its paradoxical effects, and eventually to control its actions, attempts have focused on characterizing the enzymes responsible for NO production (NOS), identifying target molecules that are altered by NO, and specifying the underlying mechanism(s) by which NO alters those targets. One target of NO is the soluble guanylyl cyclase. It is the subsequent increase in cGMP levels that is believed to mediate NO-induced vasodilation. Given that an activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase occurs almost universally in response to NO, changes in cGMP have received primary consideration as the mechanism by which NO acts. However, the multiplicity of NO actions are unlikely to be explained by a common mechanism and a number of laboratories have suggested alternative targets of NO. Generally, cellular components have been implicated as targets of NO based largely on the ability of NO or NO-releasing compounds to alter their activities in vitro. Thus, whether they are altered in intact cells in response to NO, or what the possible physiological consequences may be, remain speculative. Our approach to discerning how NO functions has been to examine its effects on intact cells. We previously demonstrated that NO inhibits the production of cAMP pulses in Dictyostelium discoideum and does so independently of any changes in guanylyl cyclase activity (4Tao Y.-P. Howlett A. Klein C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Tao Y.-P. Howlett A. Klein C. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 27-34Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The sum of the data indicated that NO specifically alters either a regulatory domain of the adenylyl cyclase itself or a distinct regulatory moiety. We have also observed that the addition of NO gas or NO donor compounds to cultures of N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells inhibits Gs-coupled and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). NO-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production is unaltered by pretreating cells with pertussis toxin, implying that the inhibition did not involve Gi (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). Although experiments using intact cells were able to eliminate a number of potential targets that NO could modulate that would inhibit cAMP production, a number of possible targets still remained. In particular, NO has been proposed to inhibit GAPDH and in so doing limit the cellular levels of ATP (7Dimmeler S. Brune B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, NO-stimulated poly-(ADP-ribosylation) has been proposed to limit ATP production as a result of decreased availability of NAD (8Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). If such events were to occur in N18TG2 cells in response to NO, the cell's ability to produce cAMP could be compromised. NO has also been shown to alter the activity of ion channels (9Zufall F. Shepherd G.M. Barnstable C.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because a number of adenylyl cyclase isoforms are regulated by Ca2+ (10Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), this could potentially influence the activity of the activity in N18TG2 cells. For example, the type V and VI isoforms are inhibited by Ca2+ by what appears to be the binding of the cation directly to the enzyme (11Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, to further address the mechanism by which NO regulates cAMP production in N18TG2 cells, and to identify the target of its actions, we have studied the effects of NO on adenylyl cyclase activity in purified plasma membrane preparations. In the present report, we identify the predominant isoform of adenylyl cyclase present in N18TG2 cells and characterize its inhibition by NO in purified plasma membranes. Our findings demonstrate a novel, isoform-specific regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by NO. Sucrose gradient purified plasma membranes (12Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar) were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaHepes, pH 8, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) at 0.5 mg/ml. Protein determinations were done according to Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, membranes were preincubated with 3 mmSNP for 30 min on ice. Other reagents were present as described in the individual experiments. Where indicated, membranes were washed free of any additions by diluting them 10-fold in ice-cold buffer A, centrifuging at 700 Ã g for 10 min, and resuspending them in ice-cold buffer A at 0.5 mg/ml. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed by incubating membranes at 30 Â°C for 20 min and monitoring the conversion of [Î±-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP at 30 Â°C (12Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bidaut-Russell M. Howlett A.C. Neurochem. Int. 1987; 11: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 15Howlett A.C. Qualy J.M. Khachatrian L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm NaHepes, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP containing 106cpm of [Î±-32P]ATP, 0.1 mm cAMP containing 10,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP, 0.1 mm Ro20-1724, 1.5 mm K+ phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 Î¼g/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25 Î¼g of membrane protein in a final volume of 100 Î¼l. Triplicate samples are assayed. Enzyme activity is proportional to the concentration of membranes and the time of incubation (12Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were removed and total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated according to Maniatis et al.(16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 191-193Google Scholar). RNA (30 Î¼g) was fractionated on 1.25% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to Duralon-UV membranes. Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Prime-A-Gene kit. Northerns were analyzed for adenylyl cyclase isoforms and GAPDH. The latter represents a constitutively expressed gene that was monitored to verify loading conditions. Loading was also monitored by ethidium bromide staining of the rRNA bands. Hybridizations were done in BLOTTO (17Siegel L.I. Bresnick E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) overnight at 37 Â°C. Membranes were washed in 2 Ã SSC, 0.5% SDS and then in 1 Ã SSC, 0.1% SSC at 55 Â°C and exposed to x-ray film overnight (GAPDH) or for 1 week (adenylyl cyclase isoforms). 1 Ã SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m trisodium citrate, pH 7. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) andS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. PGE1 and secretin were purchased from Cayman Biochemicals and Bachem, respectively. Duralon was purchased from Statagene and Prime-a-Gene was from Promega. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Plasma membranes were preincubated with increasing concentrations of SNP, after which they were assayed for forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Forskolin stimulated activity was also measured in the presence of GTP and will be discussed in a later section. As seen in Fig. 1, preincubation of membranes for 30 min with SNP attenuated the response of adenylyl cyclase to forskolin and did so in a concentration-dependent manner. Some inhibition was observed when membranes were preincubated with 0.1 mm SNP while maximum inhibition occurred when SNP was present at approximately 3 mm. The maximum inhibition varied between 50 and 75% with different membrane preparations, a range of inhibition similar to that seen with intact cells (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). Basal enzyme activity is indicated for membranes that were not pretreated and for membranes pretreated with 10 mm SNP. Although in some experiments we did observe an inhibition of basal enzyme activity, in most cases this inhibition was minimal (see figure legends for values in different experiments). To confirm that the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity represented the action of NO and not another product of SNP, we preincubated membranes with a chemically distinct NO donor, SNAP. SNAP also inhibited adenylyl cyclase stimulation by forskolin in a concentration-dependent manner. In general, both NO donors were equally effective in their ability to do so (data not shown). Other experiments indicated that the effects of NO donors were unaltered when membranes were preincubated in the presence of Trolox (0.1 mm) or superoxide dismutase (375 units/ml) plus/minus catalase (100 units/ml) (data not shown). It would appear that NO, rather than an oxidative product, is responsible for the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. The finding that the effects of NO in intact cells (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar) can be faithfully reproduced in purified plasma membrane preparations limits the possible targets of NO to components in those preparations. Experiments using intact cells had indicated that changes in cGMP or PDE did not mediate the inhibition of cAMP accumulation in response to hormone or forskolin (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). Although we do not expect soluble guanylyl cyclase to be present in our membrane preparations, we confirmed the lack of involvement of cGMP by adding cGMP to the adenylyl cyclase reaction mixture. No changes in enzyme activity were observed (data not shown). Activation of PDE cannot account for the decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity in response to NO in purified membrane preparations because assays are performed in the presence a PDE inhibitor specific for the low K m cAMP-PDE isoform that is present in N18TG2 cells (18Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 664-670PubMed Google Scholar), and an internal [3H]cAMP] standard is used to normalize for any loss of newly generated [32P]cAMP. To identify the target of NO's actions on adenylyl cyclase activity in plasma membranes, we performed a series of studies examining the effects of NO on the regulation of the enzyme by hormone-receptor complexes, GTP, and divalent cations. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, the ability of SNP to attenuate hormone- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was monitored at increasing concentrations of effectors. SNP did not alter the EC50 for secretin, PGE1, or forskolin. Thus, the apparent binding of hormone to its receptor, or of forskolin to the adenylyl cyclase, was seemingly unaltered by NO. In contrast, none of these effectors were able to elicit maximum enzyme activity. Forskolin stimulates adenylyl cyclase by directly binding to the enzyme, and thus by-passes the hormone receptor-Gs protein signal transduction pathway. Although forskolin stimulation does not require GTP, it has been shown that Gs activation can lead to additional stimulation of the enzyme (19Sutkowski E.M. Tang W.-J. Broome C.W. Robbins J.D. Seamon K.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12852-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The addition of GTP to the assay increased adenylyl cyclase activity above that seen with forskolin alone (Fig. 1). We generally observed a 15â20% increase in enzyme activity. This was true whether or not membranes had been pretreated with SNP. It would appear from this experiment that there is a population of Gs proteins in these membrane preparations that can be activated by the addition of GTP to enhance adenylyl cyclase activity and that SNP does not alter this ability. Divalent cations have been shown to regulate the activation of Gs by effecting the GDP/GTP exchange in the absence of a hormone receptor stimulation (20Iyengar R. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11036-11041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Walz M.A. Holt I.L. Howlett A.C. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 17: 291-297Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Consistent with previously published data (20Iyengar R. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11036-11041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fig. 3 shows that the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity was linear with increasing concentrations of MgCl2, in the range of 3 to 75 mm. Also shown is that this linear enzyme stimulation was not altered in membranes that had been pretreated with SNP, although enzyme activity was significantly reduced. These data would suggest that the divalent cation regulatory site(s) was not modified by NO. In total, the above studies indicate that the ability of Gs to regulate adenylyl cyclase is not altered by treatment with SNP. NO could attenuate adenylyl cyclase activity by targeting the enzyme directly or by altering the action of a distinct regulatory protein. To identify other possible regulatory proteins of the enzyme present in N18TG2 cells and to assess their role in this phenomenon, we identified the isoform present in N18TG2 cells. The likelihood that this would be a type V or VI isoform was already suggested by its biochemical properties. The lack of a CaM regulation of cAMP production in N18TG2 cells (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar) was confirmed when plasma membranes were incubated with calmidazolium and no change in adenylyl cyclase activity, or in the ability of NO to inhibit that activity, was seen. This would indicate that the enzyme is not of the type I, III, or VIII isoform family (10Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The enzyme in N18TG2 cells is regulated by hormone receptors that stimulate via Gs and inhibit via Gi (12Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bidaut-Russell M. Howlett A.C. Neurochem. Int. 1987; 11: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 15Howlett A.C. Qualy J.M. Khachatrian L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar, 22Matsuzawa H. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3472-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), a characteristic of the type V, VI isoform family (10Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the behavior of the types II, IV, and VII isoforms, for which stimulation of Gienhances cAMP production in response to Gs stimulators (10Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,23Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Finally, the adenylyl cyclase in N18TG2 cells is stimulated by forskolin, which distinguishes it from the type IX isoform (24Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). To confirm the biochemical data and to discern which member of the type V and VI adenylyl cyclase family is predominant in N18TG2 cells, we probed Northern blots of N18TG2 RNA with the cDNAs for the type V and VI isoforms. As seen in Fig. 4, a positive signal was observed when the blot was probed with the type VI cDNA (lane 4) but not when the type V cDNA was used (lane 3). As expected, no mRNAs corresponding to the type I and II isoforms were identified (lanes 1 and2). If an isoform other than the type VI is expressed in these cells, it is present at a level that is undetectable biochemically or by Northern blot analyses and thus would not influence the interpretation of our data concerning the regulation by NO. We first preincubated membranes with SNP and determined forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity at increasing concentrations of substrate. The results are depicted in Fig. 5. The kinetic analysis of the rate of substrate utilization indicated that theK m values did not differ between control and SNP-treated enzymes. The values were 0.48 Â± 0.12 and 0.49 Â± 0.091 mm for control and SNP-treated membranes, respectively. This would suggest that the apparent binding of substrate was not affected by the presence of NO. However, theV max value for SNP-treated membranes (622 Â± 44 pmol/min/mg) was reduced relative to that seen in control membranes (932 Â± 87 pmol/min/mg), indicative of a reduced rate of the enzyme conversion of substrate to product. Although SNP inhibited adenylyl cyclase stimulation when membranes were preincubated with the NO donor, no inhibition was observed when SNP was added at the beginning of the assay. Fig.6 shows that the extent to which SNP inhibits enzyme activity was dependent upon the length of the preincubation period. In that experiment, membranes were preincubated with SNP for the indicated times and then assayed for forskolin stimulated activity. Some degree of inhibition could be seen after a 10-min preincubation period while maximum inhibition occurred by 45 min. One conclusion of these observations is that SNP does not inhibit the adenylyl cyclase by altering a reagent in the assay. This was confirmed in other experiments in which SNP-treated membranes were washed free of the NO-donor prior to the assay. The degree of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was unaltered compared with unwashed membranes (also see Figs.Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9).Figure 9Ability of reducing agents to reverse the effects of SNP . Membranes were preincubated with 3 mmSNP for 30 min. Membranes were then washed free of SNP and incubated for 20 min in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of DTT or Cys. Forskolin-stimulated (10â5m) adenylyl cyclase activity was measured. The results are presented relative to the forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity seen in membranes that had not been preincubated with SNP or reducing agent. The data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8Failure of forskolin or PGE 1 to protect adenylyl cyclase from SNP . Membranes were preincubated with or without SNP. Where indicated, either 10â5m forskolin or 10â5mPGE1 was also present. When membranes were preincubated with PGE1, GTP (10â4m) was also present. The absence or presence of GTP did not alter the results. After 30 min membranes were washed and assayed for forskolin or PGE1-stimulated adenylyl cyclase with 10â4m GTP present in the assay. Basal activity was 19 and 21 pmol/min/mg in control and SNP-treated membranes. The data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Protection of adenylyl cyclase activity by occupancy of the substrate-binding site. Membranes were preincubated with or without 3 mm SNP in the absence or presence of the indicated compounds. After the 30-min preincubation, membranes were washed and resuspended in buffer as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Membranes were assayed for forskolin-stimulated (10â5m) adenylyl cyclase activity. 100% was assigned to the value seen when membranes were preincubated in the absence of any additions (132 pmol/min/mg). Basal activities were 11.5 and 12 pmol/min/mg in control and SNP-treated membranes, respectively. The data are representative of five experiments. ANOVA and Tukey's test indicated that the values for control, SNP plus AMP-PNP, and SNP plus ATP-pretreated membranes were not significantly different, but that they were different from the values for SNP and SNP plus GTP-pretreated membranes, and that the values for the latter two were not significantly different from each other.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fact that SNP was ineffective when added at the time of the assay also raised the possibility that a component of the reaction mixture served to modulate the effects of NO. Types III, V, and VI adenylyl cyclases possess the consensus sequence for protein kinase A, and incubation of those isoforms with protein kinase A alters their activities. Added protein kinase C has also been shown to phosphorylate recombinant adenylyl cyclases, altering their activities (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 191-193Google Scholar, 23Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that a phosphorylation mechanism might alter the response to NO, AMP-PNP, which cannot serve as a kinase substrate, replaced ATP as the substrate for adenylyl cyclase. Whether AMP-PNP or ATP served as substrate, SNP-mediated inhibition was observed (data not shown), indicating that a phosphorylation event does not modulate the ability of NO to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. We next addressed the possibility that occupancy of the substrate-binding site offered protection of the enzyme against the effects of NO. To do so, we determined if the presence of ATP during the preincubation period could limit the ability of SNP to inhibit the enzyme. In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, membranes were preincubated with SNP in the absence or presence of the indicated compounds. Membranes were then washed and assayed for forskolin-stimulated activity. In the absence of any additions, SNP pretreatment resulted in a 70% attenuation of enzyme activity. Adenylyl cyclase activity was protected against the effects of SNP when Mg2+/ATP was present during the preincubation period. The effect was specific for ATP because neither Mg2+ alone, nor Mg2+/GTP were effective. In contrast, protection was also afforded to the enzyme when Mg2+/AMP-PNP was present at the time of SNP exposure, indicating that the protective effects of ATP were not related to a phosphorylation event. It would appear that the conformation of the enzyme achieved upon occupancy of the substrate-binding site of the enzyme renders it less susceptible to the effects of NO. Given these results, we examined if the conformation of the enzyme, as elicited by either forskolin or hormonal signaling, could also afford the enzyme some protection against the effects of NO. To do so, membranes were preincubated with SNP in the absence or presence of forskolin or PGE1. When membranes were preincubated with PGE1, Mg2+/GTP was also added to assure maximum activation of Gs. After the 30-min preincubation period, membranes were washed and assayed for their corresponding forskolin or PGE1 stimulated activity. As shown in Fig.8, preincubation of control membranes with either PGE1 or forskolin did not alter their respective effects on adenylyl cyclase activity when added to the enzyme assay. Similarly, the SNP-mediated inhibition of forskolin and PGE1 stimulated activity was unaltered when these effectors were present during the preincubation period in the absence of added ATP. We previously demonstrated, in intact N18TG2 cells, that NO-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation in response to hormone or forskolin is readily reversible. Cells recover full ability to respond to these stimulators when incubated for 20 min in the absence of NO (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, when SNP-treated membranes were washed free of SNP and then incubated for 20 min in buffer, forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity remained inhibited. However, when washed membranes were incubated with DTT, forskolin stimulated activity was recovered in a dose-dependent manner. Similar effects were observed when Cys was added instead of DTT. In contrast, cystine did not allow for recovery of forskolin-stimulated activity but was itself inhibitory to the enzyme. We have verified that neither 10 mm Cys nor DTT alter adenylyl cyclase activity when added directly to the assay. Thus, the NO-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in plasma membranes is reversible if an appropriate reducing agent is present. We also observed that the ability of DTT to reverse the effects of NO are rapid. When SNP-treated membranes were incubated for increasing times with 10 mm DTT prior to the determination of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, maximum recovery was observed at 4 min, the shortest time point examined (data not shown). Nine isoforms of the mammalian enzyme have been cloned, each with distinct regulatory properties, as revealed in reconstitution studies of the recombinant enzyme expressed in Sf9 cell membranes, or in co-transfection experiments (reviewed in Refs. 10Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, and 24Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). With the understanding that each enzyme is uniquely regulated by a variety of factors, the view of a universal mechanism of adenylyl cyclase regulation has been replaced by the recognition that cell/tissue-specific changes in adenylyl cyclase activity require an understanding of the profiles of isoforms present in a particular cell. In the present study, we have identified the predominant isoform present in N18TG2 cells as being a type VI enzyme and have described its novel regulation by NO. We had previously demonstrated that preincubation of intact N18TG2 cells with NO or NO donors attenuates their production of cAMP upon stimulation with PGE1, secretin, or forskolin (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of NO can be faithfully reproduced in purified plasma membrane preparations, limiting its possible targets to components in those preparations. Experiments (Ref. 6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar, and this work) eliminated guanylyl cyclase, PDE, Gs, Gi/o, CaM, and protein kinases as NO targets. In so doing, we have eliminated the known regulators of the type VI isoform as targets of NO. That we are able to demonstrate the NO-mediate attenuation of adenylyl cyclase activity in plasma membranes also eliminates events such as changes in ATP levels or ion fluxes as possible mediators of the effects of NO on the enzyme. We conclude that NO functions either via an as yet unidentified novel regulator of the adenylyl cyclase in N18TG2 cells or that the enzyme itself is the target of NO. It is of interest to note that another isoform of adenylyl cyclase may also be regulated by NO. Duhe et al. (25Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the Ca2+/CaM regulation of recombinant type I adenylyl cyclase in membranes from Sf9 cells is inhibited by NO although basal enzyme activity is unaffected. The authors proposed that NO may function by oxidizing a Cys residue(s) at the CaM-binding site of the adenylyl cyclase. Vorherr et al. (26Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) had identified a region of the type I adenylyl cyclase that possesses CaM binding activity, a region that contains two Cys residues. Currently it is unknown if either, or both, of these residues is modified by NO, or if NO functions to inhibit CaM activation by modifying another region of the protein. Since experiments were restricted to analyses of Sf9 cell membranes, it also remains to be determined if NO regulates type I adenylyl cyclase in either membranes or in intact cells that normally express the enzyme and, if so, if this results in a change in its activation by Ca2+. This contrasts with the effects that we have observed in which NO inhibits the forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, in both intact N18TG2 cells and in purified plasma membranes, and does so in a manner that is independent of any CaM regulation of the enzyme. Recent studies of truncated soluble constructs of adenylyl cyclase have indicated that the enzyme exists in multiple conformational states, elicited by the binding of effectors such as GÎ± subunits, forskolin, or by occupancy of the ATP-binding site (27Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 28Tang W.-J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our kinetic analyses indicated that the inhibition by NO reflects an alteredV max, suggesting that the conformation of the enzyme is altered in a manner that precludes its optimal catalytic activity. The inhibitory effects of NO were not altered when membranes were preincubated with SNP plus either forskolin or GTP. Thus, the conformations of the enzyme that are achieved as a result of forskolin or Gs binding do not alter the ability of NO to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Occupancy of the ATP-binding site, however, did afford the enzyme significant protection from the inhibition by NO. This would suggest that, under those latter conditions, the amino acid(s) targeted by NO is no longer available, either because it is sterically shielded upon ATP binding or because the enzyme conformation induced upon ATP binding now renders it unavailable. Several observations would suggest the latter to be the more reasonable interpretation. If the catalytic site contained the residues targeted by NO, then we would expect that basal cyclase activity would also be inhibited by NO. This was not generally the case. Given the homologies between the putative catalytic sites of the various isoforms, we would also expect other isoforms to be similarly regulated by NO. We note that the basal activity of the type I recombinant enzyme is not altered by NO (25Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that, in their basal states, the type I and VI isoforms share a conformation that precludes susceptibility to NO. In contrast to the type VI isoform, it would appear that the type I isoform of adenylyl cyclase, in which residues that modulate CaM binding are susceptible to NO, exists in a conformation such that NO isnot able to inhibit forskolin stimulation. The finding that occupancy of the substrate-binding site of the enzyme protects it from inactivation by NO would indicate that optimal attenuation of cAMP production will occur when cell exposure to NO precedes stimulation of the enzyme by a Gs modulator. When adenylyl cyclase stimulation precedes, or is simultaneous with that of NO, the inhibitory effects of NO will be diminished. Our data indicate that the effects of NO will be modulated also by the ability of cells to reverse the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. With intact cells, the inhibitory effects of NO on cAMP accumulation are readily reversed when cells are incubated in the absence of NO donors (6Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). In plasma membrane preparations, the removal of NO donor compounds did not alleviate the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, suggesting that a stable modification had occurred. The NO-mediated inhibition, however, was reversed when membranes were washed free of NO donors and incubated in the presence of a reducing agent, either DTT or Cys, a more physiological agent. Such observations strongly implicateS-nitrosylation as the underlying mechanism of adenylyl cyclase inhibition (3Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). They also indicate that the ability of NO to regulate a cell's production of cAMP will depend upon the cell's redox potential. Over recent years, a large body of evidence has amassed to indicate that the cell's redox potential will significantly alter a variety of signal transduction pathways involved in the control of cell growth and death (29Peunova N. Kuzin B. Roberts I. O'Kane C. Enikolopov G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; LXI: 417-426Google Scholar). These data extend such observations to now include signal transduction via cAMP. Given the readily reversible nature of the effects of NO, it is likely that the physiological consequences of NO exposure, with respect to cAMP production, will depend upon the levels of NO and its stability. If the source of NO results from the activity of a constitutive NOS, such levels will be low and transient. The resulting changes in a cell's responses to Gs modulators would also be transient and thus more fitting of a homeostatic response. More chronic exposure, or higher levels of NO as produced by inducible NOS, would result in a longer lasting refractory period to Gs stimulators. In general, high levels of NO are believed to be toxic, contributing to the pathologies resulting from e.g. ischemic injury, heart failure, and a number of neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in Refs.1Garthwaite J. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 60-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar, 2Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

In light of their varied and complex modes of regulation, adenylyl cyclases have been proposed to serve as âco-incidence detectorsâ (30Bourne H.R. Nicoll R. Cell. 1993; 10: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar), where the enzymes are acted upon by varied hormones and then integrate these influences into a change in cAMP. The response to different signals could be synergistic, e.g. type II adenylyl cyclase responds to Gs stimulators in a manner that could be amplified by the simultaneous presence of Î²Î³ generated by Gi stimulators. Alternatively, the response to one signal may be attenuated by the presence of a second signal,e.g. the type V and VI isoforms are stimulated by Gs but inhibited by Ca2+ (10Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the type VI isoform of adenylyl cyclase predominant in N18TG2 cells is a coincidence detector for NO and that both the redox potential of the cell and the order of input signals will influence the ability of NO to regulate cAMP production. We thank Dr. T. Misko (Monsanto) for stimulating conversations throughout the course of these experiments, Drs. R. Iyengar and R. Premont for the adenylyl cyclase cDNA clones, Dr. W. Sly for the cDNA clone for GAPDH, and John McAlpin for typing the manuscript."

Patients produce great amounts of dilute urine and accordingly must drink large volumes of fluid to avoid exsiccosis. Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus most often results from trauma (including brain operations) or infiltrative or metastatic processes that damage the hypothalamus or the neurohypophysis, or it occurs as a primary idiopathic disorder. More rarely, the disease is hereditary and generally transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner (autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, ADNDI) (1Baylis P.H. Robertson G.L. Postgrad. Med. J. 1981; 57: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,2Pedersen E.B. Lamm L.U. Albertsen K. Madsen M. Bruun-Petersen G. Henningsen K. Friedrich U. Magnusson K. Q. J. Med. 1985; 57: 883-896PubMed Google Scholar).1 Various mutations were identified in the coding sequence of the prepro-vasopressin-neurophysin II gene (3Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C. Kovacs L. Gregersen N. Nyborg J. Pedersen E.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1 A, the precursor protein consists of four main segments (4Sausville E. Carney D. Battey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10236-10241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 1) a 19-amino acid signal sequence for targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); 2) the nonapeptide hormone vasopressin; 3) neurophysin II (NPII) consisting of 93 residues, which serves as the vasopressin transport protein in the circulation; and 4) a 39-amino acid glycopeptide of unknown function with a singleN-glycosylation site. The signal sequence is cleaved off by signal peptidase upon translocation of the precursor into the ER lumen. After folding and disulfide bond formation, pro-vasopressin-NPII passes through the Golgi apparatus into secretory granules where the other segments are separated by proteolytic removal of the linker residues. The mutations identified in different kindred of ADNDI are located in the sequences encoding the NPII moiety, the signal peptide, and in one case the vasopressin sequence (3Rittig S. Robertson G.L.

Postmortem studies revealed degeneration of the hypothalamic magnocellular neurons in the nucleus supraventricularis and paraopticus, which synthesize the vasopressin-NPII precursor (14Hanhart E.

Kovacs K. Ezrin C. Mizzen C. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 81: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been postulated that impaired transport and/or processing of the mutant precursor may result in its intracellular accumulation, eventually leading to degeneration of the vasopressinergic neurons and to the gradual manifestation of clinical symptoms. A recent study provided evidence for the toxicity of mutant precursors or their degradation products to cultured neuronal cells (20Ito M. Jameson J.L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have investigated the molecular mechanism of an unusual mutation associated with ADNDI recently identified in a Swiss kindred (21Rutishauser J. BoÌni-Schnetzler M. BoÌni J. Wichmann W. Huisman T. Vallotton M.B. Froesch E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 192-198PubMed Google Scholar). Guanosine 227, the third nucleotide of the translation initiation codon of the vasopressin precursor gene, is deleted on one allele in affected family members. These heterozygous patients are completely vasopressin-deficient and show an abnormal appearance of the neurohypophysis in magnetic resonance imaging. Because loss of expression of one allele is not a plausible cause for the observed dominant phenotype, we hypothesized that a second, in-frame ATG present four codons downstream might serve as an alternative initiation site generating a mutant precursor with a truncated signal sequence (Fig.1 B, Vm). To test this hypothesis and to analyze how a signal sequence truncation might affect the fate of the protein, we transiently transfected mutant or wild-type prepro-vasopressin-NPII cDNA into COS-7 cells and characterized the effects of the guanosine 227 deletion on expression, membrane translocation, signal cleavage, polypeptide folding, and secretion of the precursor. The protein was found to be synthesized and translocated into the ER. However, the truncated signal sequence was not cleaved and interfered specifically with the folding and disulfide bond formation of the vasopressin nonapeptide portion of the precursor, thus causing the formation of disulfide aggregates and retention within the ER. The full-size cDNA of wild-type prepro-vasopressin-NPII was a gift from Dr. M. Ito (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). To construct the full-size cDNA of the guanosine 227 deletion mutant, Vm, the 5â² end of the precursor cDNA up to the SmaI site was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Vent polymerase, the mutagenic primer CAGGATCCTGACACCATGCTGC (the BamHI site produced by the deletion of guanosine 227 is underlined), and a second primer corresponding to a sequence in the plasmid vector. The product was ligated at the SmaI site to the unamplified 3â² portion of the cDNA. The cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. In the process, a separate cDNA clone, VmÎ, was identified with an additional, accidental mutation, deletion of codons 28â36 of pro-vasopressin-NPII (residues 16â24 of NPII). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the precursor cDNA using the mutagenic primer CGCAGATCTACCATGCTGCCCGCCAGCTTCCTCGG in combination with a second primer in the flanking vector sequence was performed to generate the plasmid pVm(Câ11S), which encodes the vasopressin precursor with a truncated signal sequence and with Cysâ11 of the signal peptide mutated to serine. Cysteine 6 was mutated to serine by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 5â² portion of the wild-type precursor cDNA using the mutagenic antisense primer CGGGAGCTCTGTTCTGGAAGTAGCACGC in combination with a second primer in the flanking vector sequence. Separately the 3â² portion was amplified using the primer CAGGATCCTGACACCATGCTGC and a vector primer. The mutagenic primers mutated the codon TGC of cysteine 6 to the sequence AGAGCTC, thus inserting four nucleotides to generate a newSacI site (22Spiess M. Beuret N. Technical Tips Online. 1998; : T01388Google Scholar). The cloned polymerase chain reaction products were ligated at this SacI site. Finally, the four extra nucleotides were deleted by cutting the DNA with SacI, blunting the 3â² protruding ends with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligation, producing the sequence AGC encoding serine. The final cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing. COS-7 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 Â°C with 7.5% CO2. The media were supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Transfection of COS-7 cells using DEAE-dextran and Me2SO was performed according to Cullen (23Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) in 6-well plates. Transfected cells were processed 48 h after transfection. For in vivolabeling, transfected cells were incubated for 30 min in medium lacking methionine and labeled for 30 min at 37 Â°C with 100 Î¼Ci/ml [35S]methionine in starvation medium. Where indicated, cells were chased in complete medium containing excess methionine. Lysed cells and media were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal rabbit anti-NPII antiserum (ICN) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For analysis with endo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), immunoprecipitates were boiled for 2 min in 50 Î¼l of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6, 1% SDS. Aliquots were incubated with 1 milliunit of Endo H for 2 h at 37 Â°C. Finally, samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed, soaked in 1m sodium salicylate containing 1% glycerol, dried, and fluorographed on Kodak BioMax MR films. For quantification, fluorographs were densitometrically scanned. The cDNAs of wild-type and mutant prepro-vasopressin-NPII were subcloned into the plasmid pGEM3 (Promega), in vitro transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase, and translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate with dog pancrease microsomes as described (24Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine for fluorography and with [3H]leucine for sequencing. After translation, the microsomes were pelleted through a sucrose cushion (24Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The region containing the labeled protein was cut out and subjected to automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer. The eluants at each cycle were analyzed by scintillation counting. Inhibition of signal peptidase was accomplished by addition ofN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone (Sigma) in Me2SO at a final concentration of 5 mm. 2M. Nusier and M. O. Lively, personal communication. To assess membrane integration of wild-type and mutant vasopressin precursor, labeled cells were scraped and subjected to alkaline extraction as described by Gilmore and Blobel (25Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1985; 42: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were extracted with 0.1% saponin in PBS at 4 Â°C for 20 min (24Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Extracted and membrane-associated material was separately taken up in lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation. To analyze disulfide formation, labeled transfected cells were treated with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 60 min at 4 Â°C before lysis and immunoprecipitation. Samples were split in two aliquots and boiled with SDS sample buffer with or without 100 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol before SDS gel electrophoresis and fluorography. To assess the folding state of wild-type and mutant vasopressin precursor, labeled protein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-NPII or anti-vasopressin antiserum (ICN), and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were incubated for 10 min at 4 Â°C with 0â5 mg/ml trypsin. The protease was then stopped by the addition of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the resin was washed, and the bound protein was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and fluorography. For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on 14-mm glass coverslips, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBSB). The fixed cells were incubated with anti-neurophysin II primary antibody diluted 1:400 in PBSB for 1 h, washed with PBSB, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBSB for 30 min. After additional washes with PBSB, PBS, and water, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4â88 (Hoechst) containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2, 2, 2)-octane and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. For double immunofluorescence, the fixed cells were incubated simultaneously with anti-neurophysin II and a mouse monoclonal anti-p63 antibody (26Schweizer A. Rohrer J. Hauri H.P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and then Cy3-labeled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies. Deletion of guanosine 227 in the prepro-vasopressin-NPII gene of the Swiss ADNDI kindred eliminates the original translation initiation codon. Expression of a mutant protein would depend upon initiation at an alternative in-frame ATG. There are only two internal ATG sequences in the entire prepro-vasopressin-NPII cDNA, encoding Met14 (the second codon of NPII) and Metâ15 (the fifth codon of the signal sequence; Fig. 1 B). Translation initiation at Met14 would generate a cytosolic polypeptide, whereas a protein beginning with Metâ15 would still contain most of the signal peptide truncated by four residues (Fig. 1 B). The wild-type signal sequence is unusual in that it contains a negatively charged aspartate and no positively charged residues in its N-domain (27von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 28Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In comparison, the truncated signal appears rather more typical, because the negative residue is deleted. To test whether translation of the mutant cDNA initiates at one of the downstream ATGs and whether insertion into the ER occurs, wild-type and mutant cDNAs were transiently expressed in transfected COS-7 cells, labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min, and immunoprecipitated with an antiserum against the NPII portion of the precursor protein (Fig. 2 A). As expected, the wild-type vasopressin precursor was synthesized as a major species of â¼22 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Sensitivity to digestion with Endo H showed it to be glycosylated and thus translocated into the ER lumen (lane 3). Often, a small amount of a â¼19-kDa species was also produced (lane 1). Its insensitivity to Endo H digestion and the electrophoretic mobility, which was identical to that of the deglycosylated major product, suggested it to be an unglycosylated form of the precursor protein. The mutant cDNA with the guanosine 227 deletion was also efficiently expressed (Vm, lanes 2 and 4). The major product, however, migrated with an increased apparent molecular mass of â¼23 kDa that was reduced to â¼20 kDa by deglycosylation. Glycosylation indicates that even in the absence of the original initiator codon a mutant protein with a functional signal sequence was translated. Similar to the wild-type protein, a minor fraction was produced in unglycosylated form. Because there is no other ATG upstream of the coding sequence, initiation must have occurred at codon 5 of the segment encoding the signal sequence. The increased molecular mass suggested that the signal was not cleaved. To experimentally determine the N-terminal sequence of Vm, its cDNA was translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate and dog pancreas microsomes in the presence of radioactive amino acids for subsequent detection after Edman degradation. The mutant precursor labeled with [35S]methionine was efficiently glycosylated in the presence of microsomes (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2). As expected, it migrated slightly more slowly than the wild-type precursor (lane 4) but with the same mobility as the wild-type precursor translated in the presence of a signal peptidase inhibitor (lane 3). For sequencing, Vm was synthesized with [3H]leucine, and the glycosylated products were subjected to automated Edman degradation. [3H]Leucine was released in cycle 2 and in cycles 7â10 (Fig. 3 B). Within the entire prepro-vasopressin-NPII sequence, this pattern corresponds only with the sequence starting with Metâ15, which has leucines at positions 2, 7, 9, and 10 from the N terminus (positions â14, â9, â7, and â6 of the precursor protein). This confirms that translation initiated at Metâ15 and that the truncated signal was not cleaved. To analyze their secretion properties, wild-type and mutant prepro-vasopressin-NPII precursors were expressed in COS-7 cells, pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine, chased for up to 4 h, and then immunoprecipitated from the medium and from the lysed cells (Fig. 4). The wild-type precursor was rapidly secreted into the medium with a half-time of less than 1 h (lanes 1â8). Because COS cells lack a regulated secretory pathway and the corresponding processing proteases, pro-vasopressin-NPII was secreted intact. The secreted protein was resistant to Endo H digestion (lanes 9 and 10), indicative of conversion of the N-linked glycan from high mannose to complex type in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, the mutant precursor was almost completely retained inside the cells in an Endo H-sensitive form (lanes 13â26). Localization of the mutant protein by indirect immunofluorescence showed strong staining with the typical reticular pattern of the ER extending through the entire cell (Fig. 5 A). Double immunofluorescence staining for the ER resident protein p63 (Fig.5 D) (29Schweizer A. Rohrer J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2477-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for mutant vasopressin precursor (Fig.5 C) produced identical patterns in expressing cells. For comparison, the weak staining pattern of cells expressing the wild-type protein reflects the steady state distribution of the precursor in the secretory pathway, i.e. the network of the ER and a perinuclear spot typical of the Golgi apparatus (Fig.5 B).Figure 5Immunofluorescence localization of retained mutant vasopressin precursor. Transfected COS-7 cells were fixed and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The wild-type precursor (B) yielded staining of the secretory pathway,i.e. ER and Golgi, whereas mutant prepro-vasopressin-NPII (A) produced exclusively a strong reticular staining typical of the ER. (Identical exposure times were used for panels Aand B.) Co-immunofluorescence staining for mutant prepro-vasopressin-NPII (C) and the ER marker p63 (D) yielded identical patterns. Bar, 20 Î¼m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An uncleaved, hydrophobic signal peptide could cause ER retention by anchoring the protein in the ER membrane. Membrane integration was tested by alkaline extraction (Fig. 2 B). Microsomes of labeled cells were incubated at pH 11.5 to disrupt organelles and release peripherally associated and soluble proteins. As expected, wild-type vasopressin precursor was recovered in the soluble extract (lanes 1 and 2), whereas subunit H1 of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, a control integral membrane protein, was pelleted with the membranes (lanes 5 and 6). The mutant vasopressin precursor was as almost as efficiently extracted as the wild-type protein (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that it was not anchored in the bilayer of the ER. The uncleaved hydrophobic signal peptide might cause ER retention by interfering with correct folding and disulfide bonding of the precursor. Pro-vasopressin-NPII contains eight intramolecular disulfide bridges. Formation of disulfide bonds is often reflected in the electrophoretic mobility of a protein under reducingversus nonreducing conditions. To address this, transfected COS cells were metabolically labeled and then incubated at 4 Â°C with iodoacetamide to alkylate free sulfhydryl groups to prevent post-lysis oxidation. Vasopressin precursor was immunoprecipitated and split into two samples that were boiled in SDS sample buffer with or without mercaptoethanol. Upon gel electrophoresis, the wild-type precursor migrated slightly faster in its nonreduced, more compact folded state than after reduction of the disulfide bonds (Fig.6, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, the nonreduced mutant precursor was hardly detectable at the corresponding position in the gel but appeared as aggregates that migrated more slowly or did not enter the gel at all (lane 4). Such aggregates are typically observed for misfolded proteins (28Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To more directly assess the folding state of the protein, wild-type and mutant precursors were subjected to a protease sensitivity assay. Labeled protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-NPII antiserum and protein A-Sepharose and was incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin. The Sepharose beads were washed, and bound material was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig.7). From the wild-type precursor (lanes 1â5), a fragment of â¼12 kDa (fragment 3) was generated that was completely resistant to trypsin at up to 5000 Î¼g/ml. Its size corresponds to that of the NPII domain, indicating that the flanking segments (vasopressin and glycopeptide) were cleaved off at the connecting peptides normally hydrolyzed by processing enzymes in secretory granules. Intermediates of â¼21 and â¼13 kDa (fragments 1 and 2) were weakly detectable at the lowest trypsin concentration (lane 2). Their sizes suggest that these intermediates correspond to NPII-glycopeptide and vasopressin-NPII fragments, respectively. This was confirmed by performing the same experiment using an antiserum directed against the vasopressin nonapeptide (data not shown). Only the full-size precursor and the 13-kDa intermediate (fragment 2) were recovered, indicating that they contain the vasopressin sequence. Upon incubation of the mutant precursor with trypsin (Fig. 7,lanes 6â10), the 12-kDa NPII fragment was generated as well, although it was slightly less resistant to the highest protease concentrations. Intermediate fragments of â¼21 kDa (fragment 1) lacking the uncleaved signal and vasopressin, and of â¼14 kDa (fragment 2*) lacking the glycopeptide portion were also produced. The latter intermediate was the only one to be recovered using anti-vasopressin antibody (not shown), supporting the notion that it consists of the uncleaved signal, vasopressin, and NPII. It is more abundant than the corresponding fragment of the wild-type precursor (even considering that it contains an additional methionine in the signal sequence). The uncleaved signal thus appears to affect the accessibility of the peptide connecting vasopressin to NPII. Most importantly, it did not interfere with the folding of NPII itself. In contrast, the precursor VmÎ, a cloning artifact of Vm with an additional small deletion of codons 28â36 of pro-vasopressin-NPII (residues 16â24 of NPII), did not generate specific trypsin-resistant fragments (Fig. 7, lanes 11â15). VmÎ thus serves as a control showing that protease resistance depends on NPII folding. In the wild-type pro-vasopressin-NPII, all cysteines are engaged in disulfide bonds, seven in NPII and one in vasopressin. The mutant precursor, however, contains an additional cysteine, Cysâ11, in the uncleaved signal peptide (Fig.1 B). To test whether this cysteine is responsible for the formation of disulfide aggregates and retention, we constructed the mutant Vm(Câ11S), in which Cysâ11 in the truncated signal sequence of Vm was mutated to serine. As shown in Fig.8, mutation of this cysteine did not significantly affect the properties of the protein. It was synthesized by COS cells as a 23-kDa glycosylated, Endo H-sensitive protein (Fig.8 A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the truncated signal without cysteine was functional and uncleaved. The majority of the protein was retained in an Endo H-sensitive form within the cell (lanes 5â8). After 2 h of chase, â¼7% was recovered from the medium as Endo H-resistant protein, which is slightly more than for Vm. Trypsin resistance of the 12-kDa NPII fragment indicates correct folding of NPII (Fig. 8 B). Most notably, elimination of Cysâ11 did not prevent most of the protein from forming disulfide-linked aggregates (Fig. 8 C), indicating that covalent aggregation is not, or not solely, caused by Cysâ11. The extraordinary protease resistance of the NPII portion in Vm and Vm(Câ11S) argues that its seven disulfide bonds were correctly formed. Thus, the disulfide bond in the vasopressin segment may not be correctly formed in the mutant precursors and cause aggregation. The first residue of vasopressin, Cys1, forms a disulfide bridge with Cys6. It is conceivable that lack of signal cleavage in Vm and Vm(Câ11S) interferes with the formation of this disulfide bond, leaving its thiol groups potentially available for oxidation to form covalent aggregates. To test whether unpaired cysteines of vasopressin might cause ER retention, we constructed the mutant V(C6S). Cys6 was mutated to serine in the context of the wild-type precursor sequence, leaving Cys1 without its normal disulfide partner, even if the signal is removed. Upon expression in COS cells, V(C6S) showed an electrophoretic mobility of 22 kDa like the wild-type precursor (Fig.9 A, lanes 1 and2), indicative of signal cleavage. Nevertheless, it was not secreted from the cells and remained sensitive to Endo H digestion (lanes 6â9). T"

However, it was observed early on that Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases can transferd-tyrosine to tRNATyr (5Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The same extent of tRNATyr aminoacylation could be reached with thel- and the d-enantiomers of the amino acid. Some time later, extracts of E. coli, yeast, rabbit reticulocytes, or rat liver were reported to contain an enzyme activity capable of accelerating the hydrolysis of the ester linkage ofd-Tyr-tRNA in the production of free tRNA andd-tyrosine (7Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Partially purified E. colideacylase could be shown to be distinct from tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (7Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (8KoÌssel H. RajBhandary U.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 539-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It also cleavesd-Phe-tRNAPhe and Gly-tRNAGly, although more slowly than d-Tyr-tRNATyr.l-Aminoacyl-tRNAs (l-Ile-tRNAIle,l-Phe-tRNAPhe, andl-Tyr-tRNATyr) are left intact. These findings suggested that, although tRNATyr might be misaminoacylated with d-tyrosine in vivo, misincorporation of this d-amino acid into proteins was prevented by the detected deacylase. Such a mechanism possibly helps living cells to counterreact against the toxicity of d-amino acids found in diet or produced by endogenous metabolism. It may also be a relic of primitive forms of life when selection between d- andl- amino acid isomers began. In the present report, we describe the isolation and overexpression of yihZ, the gene encoding the E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. The catalytic constants of the d-Tyr-tRNATyrdeacylase reaction are measured. Disruption of the deacylase gene did not modify the generation time of the bacterium under standard laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, a significant decrease in the growth rate of yihZ null mutants could be obtained if minimal medium was supplemented with d-tyrosine. Orthologs of the E. coli deacylase gene occur in the genetic materials of many cells including those of mammals and higher plants. d-[methylene-3H]Tyrosine (211 GBq/mmol) was custom-prepared by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech;l-[14C]tyrosine was from NEN Life Science Products; and unlabeled d-tyrosine was from Sigma. Sephadex DEAE-A50 and Q-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hydroxylapatite was from Bio-Rad and Trisacryl GF05 from IBF. E. coli tRNATyr2 was overexpressed in strain JM101TR from a synthetic gene built according to a published procedure (9Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The resulting bulk tRNA accepted 320 pmol of l-tyrosine perA 260 unit. d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr was directly prepared from the above tRNA extract. The reaction mixture (500 Î¼l) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 7 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 3.5 Î¼md-[3H]tyrosine (18.5 GBq/mmol), 0.1 mm EDTA, 7.5 Î¼m tRNATyr, and 1.2 Î¼m purified E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Reactions conditions (10 min, 28 Â°C) ensured a nearly complete esterification of the d-amino acid to the tRNA. Note that because of the occurrence of contaminating l-tyrosine (2%) inside the d-[3H]tyrosine sample, the reaction was performed with a concentration of tRNATyr in excess over that of d-tyrosine. Under this condition and provided the d-amino acid is fully incorporated in tRNATyr, the proportion ofl-Tyr-tRNATyr (the favored product of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase) in the preparedd-Tyr-tRNATyr sample cannot exceed 2%. The reaction was quenched by 500 Î¼l of 600 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) plus 500 Î¼l of phenol saturated with a 100 mmsodium acetate solution (pH 5.0). The solution was vigorously shaken and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 Ã g. The interphase and the phenol phase were re-extracted with 250 Î¼l of 300 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and centrifuged as above. The two aqueous phases were pooled, precipitated with ethanol, and centrifuged (15 min at 15,000 Ã g). The pellet was resuspended in 100 Î¼l of 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 100 mm KCl and 0.1 mm EDTA. Finally, the sample was chromatographed on a Trisacryl GF05 column (0.25 Ã 16 cm) equilibrated in the same solution. Resultingd-Tyr-tRNATyr (100 pmol of d-amino acid incorporated per A 260 unit of tRNA) was stored frozen at â20 Â°C. l-[14C]Tyr-tRNATyr (80 pmol perA 260 unit) was prepared by the same procedure, except that esterification was performed with 2 Î¼ml-[14C]tyrosine (18.4 GBq/mmol) and 0.5 Î¼m tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. N-Acetylation ofd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr orl-[14C]Tyr-tRNATyr was performed as described earlier for the preparation of diacetyl-lysyl-tRNALys (10Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Fromant M. Plateau P. Blanquet S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was purified from E. coli strain K37 (Table I). All buffers contained 0.1 mm EDTA and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were grown at 37 Â°C in 16 liters of 2Ã TY medium and harvested by centrifugation for 35 min at 3,000 Ãg. The cell pellet was suspended in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8) at a cell density of 0.1 g of wet weight per ml of buffer. Cells were disrupted by sonication (10 min, 0 Â°C), and debris removed by centrifugation (35 min at 3,000 Ãg). Nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of streptomycin (30 g/liter) to the supernatant, which was then centrifuged for 35 min at 3,000 Ã g. The resulting supernatant was brought to 50% ammonium sulfate saturation, left to stand 1 h at 4 Â°C, and centrifuged (35 min, 3,000 Ãg). The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was brought to 80% ammonium sulfate saturation. After centrifugation for 35 min at 3,000 Ã g, the protein sample was dissolved in 250 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and dialyzed against 3 liters of the same buffer. The resulting solution was applied on a column of Sephadex DEAE-A50 (4 Ã 12 cm), equilibrated in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0). Elution was carried out with a 3-liter linear gradient of 40â350 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 100 ml/h. Fractions containing activity were pooled, dialyzed against a 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.75) buffer, and applied on a hydroxylapatite column (3 Ã 13 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Enzyme activity was recovered by using a 2Ã 500 ml linear gradient of 10â400 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.75), at a flow rate of 50 ml/h. Fractions containing activity were pooled, dialyzed against a 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and applied on a Q-Sepharose Hi-Load column (3.2 Ã 10 cm, from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. This column was eluted with a 1.5-liter linear gradient from 10 to 500 mm NaCl in the buffer of the column. One fraction from the Q-Sepharose chromatography, accounting for 1/3 of the total recovered activity, was concentrated batchwise on a Sephadex DEAE-A50 column (0.25 Ã 4 cm). 100 Î¼l of the recovered sample (600 Î¼l) were then loaded on a TSK G3000 SW HPLC column (0.75 Ã 30 cm, from Tosohaas), which was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm KCl.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmidsGenotypeSource (Ref.)StrainsK37galK rpsL35Miller H.I.

After migration, proteins were electrophoretically transferred on a ProBlot membrane (from Applied Biosystems) and stained with Amido Black. About 10 protein bands were visible on the membrane. One of them, the intensity of which was correlated with thed-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity measured in the fractions, was cut and submitted to 10 cycles of Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A Sequencer. E. colityrosyl-tRNA synthetase was overexpressed in strain JM101TR harboring plasmid pBR322 EcoTyrTS (Table I). Cells were grown overnight in 1 liter of 2Ã TY medium containing 100 Î¼g of ampicillin per ml. Crude extract preparation and removal of nucleic acids by streptomycin precipitation were performed as described above for the purification of d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. Then the sample was brought to 70% ammonium sulfate saturation, left to stand 1 h at 4 Â°C, and centrifuged for 20 min at 8,000 Ãg. The protein sample was dissolved in 3 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.75), dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of the same buffer, and applied on an 80-ml Q-Sepharose column (2.8 Ã 13 cm). The column was eluted with a 1200-ml linear gradient of 100â400 mm KCl in the column buffer (flow rate 120 ml/h). Recovered fractions containing activity were immediately applied on a hydroxylapatite column (3.8 Ã 18 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.75). Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase activity was recovered at a flow rate of 100 ml/h by using a 5-liter linear gradient of potassium phosphate (pH 6.75), from 40 to 200 mm. As judged by SDS-PAGE analysis, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was at least 90% pure at this stage. The enzyme solution was concentrated 100-fold by a batchwise chromatography on a Sephadex DEAE column (2 Ã 3.2 cm) and then dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 60% glycerol and stored at â20 Â°C. E. colistrain JM101TR transformed by plasmid pYtH (Table I) was grown at 37 Â°C in 2 liters of 2Ã TY medium containing 200 Î¼g of ampicillin per ml. When the optical density of the culture reached 0.3 at 650 nm, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside was added, and growth was continued overnight. Conditions for crude extract preparation, removal of nucleic acids, and ammonium sulfate precipitation were the same as those used for the purification of the deacylase from the strain K37. Further chromatographies on Q-Sepharose and hydroxylapatite columns were similar to those of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase purification. However, in the case of the deacylase (i) all buffers were supplemented with 0.1 mm EDTA and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, (ii) NaCl rather than KCl was used in the elution buffer of the Q-Sepharose column, and (iii) the potassium phosphate linear gradient for the elution of the hydroxylapatite column was from 10 to 400 mm. Recovered deacylase was concentrated by an ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation). After centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 30 min, the pellet was dialyzed against a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 60% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and stored at â20 Â°C. Unless otherwise stated,d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity was measured for 5 min at 28 Â°C in 100-Î¼l assays containing 50 nmd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and 0.1 mm EDTA. The reaction was quenched by the successive addition of 100 Î¼l of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 20 Î¼l of carrier RNA from yeast (4 mg/ml). The sample was centrifuged (5 min, 15,000 Ã g), and 200 Î¼l of the supernatant were mixed with 6 ml of Picofluor scintillation mixture (from Packard) and counted in a Beckman LS1801 counter. Concentration of d-Tyr-tRNATyrdeacylase was determined using the light-absorption coefficient calculated from the amino acid sequence of the protein (0.571A 280 unitsÂ·mgâ1Â·ml). K m and k cat values were derived from iterative non-linear fits to the theoretical Michaelis equation to the experimental values, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Confidence limits on the fitted values were obtained by 100 Monte Carlo simulations followed by least squares fitting, using the experimental standard deviations on individual measurements (12Dardel F. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 273-275PubMed Google Scholar). The yihZgene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides DTyrFront (CCGAATTCCATGATTGCATTAATTCAACGCGTAAC) and DTyrEnd (CCAGCCAAGCTTTCATACCTGCAACCAGAATGTCACG) and genomic DNA from strain K37. The amplified DNA fragment (460 bp) was purified using the Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit 100, digested by EcoRI andHindIII, and inserted into the corresponding sites of plasmid pKK223-3, to finally give plasmid pYtH. The sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The EcoRI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pYtH containing the yihZ gene was also subcloned between the corresponding sites of plasmid pBluescript(â)KS (pBS). The resulting plasmid, designated pBSKSyihZ, harbored the yihZ gene in the opposite orientation to the lacZ promoter. Disruption of theyihZ gene was achieved by the procedure of Hamilton et al. (13Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using plasmid pMAK705, which contains a thermosensitive replicon and a chloramphenicol resistance gene. A DNA fragment containing the first 190 bp of the yihZ ORF, the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (14Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar), and the last 187 bp of theyihZ ORF was inserted in pMAK705. E. coli strain K37 was transformed by the resulting plasmid (pKK4). The integration of pKK4 into the chromosome was selected by plating transformants at 42 Â°C on LB agar medium containing chloramphenicol. After growth at 30 Â°C in liquid medium for â¼30 generations, cells no longer carrying the plasmid in their chromosome were identified as chloramphenicol-sensitive colonies at 42 Â°C. Approximately 60% of selected cells were also kanamycin-resistant at 42 Â°C, thus suggesting that (i) the ÎyihZ::kanmutation carried by pKK4 was now located on the chromosome and (ii) theyihZ gene was not essential to the growth of E. coli. After subsequent growth at 42 Â°C, the loss of the thermosensitive plasmid was verified by ensuring that the cells had become chloramphenicol-sensitive at 30 Â°C. One of the resulting clones was named K37ÎTyrH and was used in further studies. Disruption of the yihZ gene in this clone was confirmed by PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA using the above oligonucleotides DTyrFront and DTyrEnd. The ÎyihZ::kanmutation could be transferred from strain K37ÎTyrH into strains EC989, FB8, and FB8r (Table I) by P1 transduction. Resulting strains were named EC989ÎTyrH, FB8ÎTyrH, and FB8rÎTyrH, respectively. Strain K37ÎTyrHÎrecA was further obtained by P1 transduction of the ÎrecA938::cat mutation from the strain GW5552 (15Marsh L. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1818-1823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains EC989d and EC989dÎTyrH were constructed by P1 transduction of the dadA + allele, from strain K37 into strain EC989 or EC989ÎTyrH, respectively. In the latter case, selection of transductants was performed on M9 minimal plates containing 20 mml-alanine as carbon source (16Wild J. Klopotowski T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17McFall E. Newman E.B. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 358-379Google Scholar). The presence ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolytic activity in E. coli strain K37 was verified by adding cellular extract tod- or l-Tyr-tRNATyr (Tris 20 mm (pH 7.8), 28 Â°C, final concentration of total protein in the assay: 20â200 Î¼g/ml). The rate of deacylation ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr was at least 100-fold faster than that of l-Tyr-tRNATyr. The activity of the enzyme responsible for the specificd-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolysis was then followed through chromatographies on Sephadex DEAE-A50, hydroxylapatite, Q-Sepharose, and TSK 3000. At each step, a single peak of activity was always recovered. According to the TSK gel filtration, the molecular mass associated to the native d-Tyr-tRNATyrdeacylase activity could be estimated equal to 35 Â± 3 kDa. In this experiment, marker proteins of known M rincluded lysyl-tRNA synthetase (18LeÌveÌque F. Plateau P. Dessen P. Blanquet S.

At the last step of the purification, the recovered enzyme was less than 10% pure, according to SDS-PAGE analysis. However, along the fractions recovered from the TSK column, the activity varied proportionally to the intensity on the gel of one protein band having an apparent mass of 16 Â± 2 kDa. After transfer from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, this protein material was submitted to 10 cycles of Edman degradation. Its N-terminal sequence, MIALIQRVTR, designated an open reading frame (ORF), yihZ, at 87.81 min on the E. coli genetic map. The predictedM r of the yihZ product (15Marsh L. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1818-1823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 950) was in agreement with the M r of the selected protein. To assess whether the yihZ gene actually encoded thed-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in the crude extract, a DNA fragment encompassing this gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into the expression vector pKK223-3. Upon transformation by the resulting plasmid (pYtH), E. coli strain JM101TR overexpressed one protein with the expected mass of â¼16 kDa. In addition, d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in crude extract was increased 1500-fold as compared with cells transformed by the control plasmid pKK223â3 (TableII). We therefore concluded that theyihZ gene encodes the E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase and that, upon TSK chromatography in non-denaturing conditions, this deacylase shows the mass of a dimer.Table IId-Tyr-tRNA Tyr deacylase activity in various E. coli strainsStraind-Tyr-tRNATyr activityaThe initial rate of hydrolysis ofd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 nmd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm EDTA was measured as described under âMaterials and Methods.â One unit corresponds to the enzyme activity capable of hydrolyzing 1 pmol of d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyrper min under standard assay conditions.units/mgJM101TR (pKK223â3)120JM101TR (pYtH)180,000K37120K37ÎTyrH11EC989110EC989ÎTyrH10EC989d105EC989dÎTyrH10Cells were grown overnight in LB medium.

The yiiD product has no significant homology with any other protein stored in the data bases. d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was purified from strain JM101TR transformed by plasmid pYtH. After successive chromatographies on Q-Sepharose and hydroxylapatite columns, the enzyme was recovered homogeneous, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. The initial rate of d-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolysis, in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, was increased 3â4-fold upon the addition of either 50 mm KCl or 10 mm MgCl2(Table III). Higher concentrations of these salts inhibited the enzyme, and the simultaneous addition of both MgCl2 and KCl showed no effect. These results suggest that ionic strength improves the rate of the reaction through the folding of the tRNA structure. Accordingly, addition of 1 mmspermidine also stimulated 3-fold the hydrolysis ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr (Table III). However, specific features in the tRNA nucleotide sequence may also be involved in substrate recognition, as indicated by the capacity of the deacylase to hydrolyze d-tyrosyl oligonucleotides (7Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Table IIIActivity of d-Tyr-tRNA Tyr deacylase under various ionic conditionsComponent addedInitial rateaThe initial rate of hydrolysis ofd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr catalyzed byd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was measured in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 nmd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr, 0.1 mmEDTA, and the indicated components, as described under âMaterials and Methods.âs â1None0.095 mmMgCl20.2910 mm MgCl20.3620 mm MgCl20.3050 mmKCl0.22200 mm KCl0.14400 mmKCl0.085 mm MgCl2 + 50 mmKCl0.205 mm MgCl2 + 0.1 mmZnCl20.431 mm spermidine0.305 mm spermidine0.3310 mmspermidine0.29a The initial rate of hydrolysis ofd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr catalyzed byd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was measured in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 nmd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr, 0.1 mmEDTA, and the indicated components, as described under âMaterials and Methods.â Open table in a new tab The activity of the deacylase in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2 was insensitive to the further addition of 0.1 mm various metal ions like CaCl2, CoCl2, MnCl2, or NiCl2. Only ZnCl2 showed a slight stimulatory effect (Table III). The initial rate of hydrolysis by the deacylase was measured at 5 mm MgCl2 as a function ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr concentration. The kinetics were Michaelian, with a K m value of 1.0 Â± 0.15 Î¼m and a maximal rate of 6.0 Â± 0.5 sâ1. Under the same assay conditions, the spontaneous chemical hydrolysis of d-Tyr-tRNATyr occurred at a rate of 2.2 Ã 10â4 sâ1. Addition of uncharged tRNA (K I >20 Î¼m) or of free d-tyrosine (K I >2 mm) had no effect on the enzyme activity. Because several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can hydrolyze aminoacyl-tRNAs (24Schreier A.A. Schimmel P.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Bonnet J.

Biochem. 1974; 46: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the AMP-independent deacylation ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase deserved attention. Nevertheless, this reaction was so slow that, in order to measure initial rates of hydrolysis, synthetase concentrations (0.2â2.5 Î¼m) much higher than thed-Tyr-tRNATyr substrate concentration (50 nm) had to be used in the assay. Michaelis constants of the reaction could be estimated, however, by varying the enzyme concentration in the assay. k cat andK m values of 1.5 Ã 10â3sâ1 and 0.2 Î¼m, respectively, were deduced. Therefore, although d-Tyr-tRNATyr strongly interacts with tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, its rate of deacylation by this enzyme remains slow, being only 7-fold faster than that of spontaneous chemical hydrolysis. d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase recognize an ester linkage between the 3â²-terminal adenosine of tRNA and the carboxyl group of an amino acid. Nevertheless, d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase does not hydrolyze l-aminoacyl-tRNAs, on the one hand (7Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase is specific forN-blocked-l-amino acids, on the other hand (8KoÌssel H. RajBhandary U.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 539-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By using d-Tyr-tRNATyr,l-Tyr-tRNATyr,N-acetyl-d-Tyr-tRNATyr, orN-acetyl-l-Tyr-tRNATyr as substrates, these specificities could be confirmed (TableIV). In particular, N-blockedd- or l-aminoacylated tRNAs fully resisted the action of d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase (TableIV).Table IVSubstrate specificities of E. coli d-Tyr-tRNA Tyrdeacylase and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolaseSubstrateCatalytic efficiencyaInitial rates of hydrolysis were measured in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 nmd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 nm of the substrate under study (see âMaterials and Methodsâ).d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylasePeptidyl-tRNA hydrolaseÎ¼m â1 s â1d-Tyr-tRNATyr60.016l-Tyr-tRNATyr<10â30.006N-Acetyl-d-Tyr-tRNATyr<10â30.003N-Acetyl-l-Tyr-tRNATyr<10â30.47a Initial rates"

The membrane domain is composed of the 110 C-terminal residues of the Î±-subunit and the 260 N-terminal residues of the Î²-subunit and was shown to be directly involved in proton translocation via the only essential conserved protonatable residue within the membrane, His-Î²91, located in the middle of a highly conserved transmembrane segment (8Holmberg E.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The membrane topology of transhydrogenases has previously been studied by predictions and experimental approaches resulting in different models. Early models were based on simple hydropathy analyses and suggested 14 transmembrane segments for the bovine enzyme and 11 transmembrane segments for the E. coli transhydrogenase (10Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Trach K. Hoch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2761-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Gillam S. Bragg P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The E. coli enzyme was later refined to 12 helices (6Tong R.C.W. Glavas N. Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 19-28Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and a similar model was also suggested for the Rhodospirillum rubrum enzyme (12Williams R. Cotton N.P. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Microbiology (Engl. Transl. Mikrobiologiya). 1994; 140: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In more recent studies, two different models for E. coli have evolved. After applying several prediction methods to the bovine and E. coli sequences, Holmberg et al. (8Holmberg E. Olausson T. Hultman T. RydstroÌm J. Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7691-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested a 10-helix model. On the basis of sulfhydryl labeling of native and engineered cysteines, Bragg and co-workers (14Glavas N.A. Hou C. Bragg P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggested a slightly changed and refined 12-helix model. Due to incomplete or ambiguous results, various biochemical data such as proteolytic cleavage, antibody reactivity, and sulfhydryl labeling of the wild-type enzyme have not provided a generally accepted topology model, although they support each model to different extents. The models have proposed four Î±-helices in the Î±-subunit and six to eight helices in the Î²-subunit for the E. coli enzyme and 14 helices for the bovine enzyme, thus differing not only in number of Î±-helices, but also with respect to the relative positions and orientations of certain helices. To further investigate the mechanism of proton pumping by transhydrogenases, it is essential that a better knowledge of the structure of the membrane domain is achieved. To clarify the topological ambiguities, the transmembrane segments and their topology were determined experimentally. A prediction of transhydrogenase membrane topology was made using information from the 10 known sequences for membrane-spanning transhydrogenases. The different models were tested by an experimental approach in which unique cysteines were introduced into potential loops of a cysteine-free E. coli transhydrogenase and reacted with membrane-impermeable thiol-specific reagents in oppositely oriented membrane preparations. By this procedure, it was possible to unambiguously determine the number of helices, their orientation, and also the beginning and end of some of the more conserved transmembrane segments. The proposed model differs from previous models and provides an explanation for the different topologies of the E. coliand mitochondrial transhydrogenases. The pnt gene was introduced into the pGEM-7Zf(+) plasmid, resulting in the construct denoted pSA2 (15Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the pnt gene was introduced into the pUC13 plasmid, resulting in the construct pDC21 (16Clarke D.M. Bragg P.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 367-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression was carried out with the E. coli K12 strain JM109 transformed with pSA2, or mutants thereof. An N-terminal histidine hexamer tag was introduced into transhydrogenase by insertion of 21 bases, (CACCAT)3GGT, into the pDC21 construct by overlapping polymerase chain reaction as described (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The resulting construct, pNHis, contained six histidines and a glycine introduced between the first Met codon and the second Arg codon of the Î±-subunit. The Arg codon was changed to the more commonly used E. coli codon CGT (18Ikemura T. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and a spontaneous T-to-G substitution occurred 38 bases upstream of the start codon. The His tag was transferred to pSA2 by replacing the HindIII/BstEII fragment of pSA2 with the corresponding fragment from pNHis, giving the construct pNH. The His tag was then transferred to a cysteine-free transhydrogenase construct, pCL (2Meuller J. Zhang J. Hou C. Bragg P.D. RydstroÌm J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), by replacing the ApaI/SalI fragment of pCL with the corresponding fragment from pNH, giving the His-tagged and Cys-free construct pCLNH, which was used for mutagenesis in this work. Mutagenesis of the cysteine mutants were performed with a two-step megaprimer polymerase chain reaction technique according to Landtet al. (19Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by sequencing of the DNA fragments that had been manipulated by polymerase chain reaction and/or restriction digests. All DNA techniques used were standard procedures (20Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Modre D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 16 h at 37 Â°C and 185 rpm in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and harvested by centrifugation at 3300 Ã g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in one-half the original volume of ice-cold 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 m sucrose, and 1 mmÎ²-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.8) and incubated for 20 min on ice. After washing the cells once with buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 msucrose (pH 7.5), they were resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor mixture, EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to an approximate concentration of A 600 nm = 50. One-half of the permeabilized cells were labeled directly, and the second half were sonicated to produce inside-out vesicles (Branson microtip sonicator; 60 watts, 90 s of sonication time distributed as 5-s pulses during a total of 5 min). Unbroken cells and debris were removed after sonication by centrifugation at 3300 Ã g for 5 min. Normally, >75% of the cells were transformed into vesicles. Fluorescein 5-maleimide (from an 8 mm stock solution freshly prepared by diluting an 80 mm N,N-dimethylformamide stock solution with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8)) was added to cells and vesicles to a final concentration of 160 Î¼m, gently mixed, and incubated for 45 min on ice. 2-[(4â²-Maleimidyl)anilino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS)1 (from a 100 mm stock solution inN,N-dimethylformamide) was added to cells and vesicles to a final concentration of 1 mm, gently mixed, and incubated on ice for 2 h. Unreacted reagents were quenched by the addition of a 50â100-fold molar excess of cysteine. To 325 Î¼l of labeled sample, 175 Î¼l of solubilization buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 2 m KCl, 64 mm imidazole, and 2 mg/ml lysozyme (pH 7.8)) was added. To avoid viscosity problems due to genomic DNA that interfered with the chromatographic procedure, DNase I was added to the whole-cell samples, which were also sonicated briefly (two to three pulses) to help to disrupt the cells. Triton X-100 was then added to 2% (w/v), and the membranes were solubilized by incubation for 20 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. Solubilized samples were spun at 38,000 Ã g for 5 min to remove insoluble material. 25 Î¼l of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, equilibrated with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m KCl, 25 mm imidazole, and 0.1% (w/v) Brij 35 (pH 7.8)), was mixed with the supernatant (e.g. 450 Î¼l) in a filter spin tube (0.45 Î¼m; Millipore Corp.). After 20 min of gentle mixing at room temperature, the tubes were spun at 1000 Ã g for 1 min and thereafter washed with 2 Ã 250 Î¼l of wash buffer. Labeled transhydrogenase was eluted by incubating the resin in elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, and 300 mm imidazole (pH 7.2)) for 5 min before collecting the eluate by centrifugation. Purified samples were dissolved in sample buffer at room temperature and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 8% Tris/glycine gels (ready-made; Novex) according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were detected by illuminating the gels with UV light, and the fluorescence was recorded with a CCD camera equipped with appropriate filters. To achieve maximal fluorescence intensities, signals from fluorescein 5-maleimide-labeled samples were recorded before fixing the gel in 50% MeOH and 10% acetic acid; MIANS-labeled samples were recorded afterward. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and recorded with a CCD camera. The amount of protein and fluorescence intensities were analyzed with NIH Image1.62b7 (Freeware from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cytoplasmic inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared essentially as described before (2Meuller J. Zhang J. Hou C. Bragg P.D. RydstroÌm J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but with 50 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.8) as sonication and resuspension buffer. The activities of the mutant proteins were assayed by measuring the rate of reduction of 3-acetylpyridine NAD+ by NADPH catalyzed by the vesicle preparations as described previously (22Olausson T. Hultman T. Holmberg E. RydstroÌm J. Ahmad S. Glavas N. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13237-13244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in the membrane vesicles was determined by the method of Peterson (23Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The bovine, mouse, human, E. coli, R. rubrum, Entamoeba histolytica, Eimeria tenella, and Hemophilus influenzae transhydrogenase sequences were aligned (PileUp, GCG package, Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) and used as input in the programs TMAP (24Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and PredictProtein (25Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sc. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), which predicts transmembrane Î±-helices based on multiple alignments. The above sequences, together with the sequences for Caenorhabditis elegans and Cyanobacterium synechocystis, were also analyzed with TopPredConsensus, which is based on the program TopPredII (26von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar), but uses multiple sequences to improve the accuracy of transmembrane Î±-helix predictions. 2G. von Heijne and E. Wallin, personal communication. All programs were used with default settings. Fluorescein 5-maleimide and 2-[(4â²-maleimidyl)anilino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was obtained from QIAGEN Inc. All other chemicals were, unless otherwise specified, of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. Transhydrogenases from different sources were aligned and used to make consensus predictions of helical transmembrane segments by three different methods. The assumption that all transmembrane segments are Î±-helical was justified by the low number of predicted Î²-sheets that are too few to make a Î²-barrel structure (8Holmberg E. Olausson T. Hultman T. RydstroÌm J. Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7691-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results from the consensus predictions are presented in Table Iusing helix numbering based on the original 14-Î±-helix model of Yamaguchi et al. (10Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Trach K. Hoch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2761-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and amino acid numbering corresponding to the E. coli sequence, which will be used throughout this paper. The output from TMAP and TopPredConsensus included both predictions of individual sequences as well as consensus predictions based on the multiple alignments. The differences between the predicted transmembrane Î±-helices of individual sequences when compared with the consensus prediction based on the multiple aligned sequences were generally small, i.e. minor displacements of some helices due to charged or polar amino acids and occasionally small gaps arising from the alignments. However, one exception was helix 5, which was not predicted in any of the consensus predictions, although it was found in the individual predictions of the mitochondrial (e.g. human, bovine, mouse, and C. elegans) transhydrogenases. Since only 4 of the 10 sequences contain the amino acids corresponding to this helix, it was given too low of a score in the consensus predictions and was therefore not assigned as a transmembrane Î±-helix. It is likely, though, that the mitochondrial transhydrogenases do contain helix 5 (see âDiscussionâ). Averaging the information derived from the different transhydrogenase sequences apparently did not conceal any information of the individual sequences, with the exception mentioned, but rather emphasized the common structural elements.Table IPrediction of transmembrane helices in transhydrogenaseHelixTMAPPredictProtTopPredConsensusThis paper1Î±402â417Î±405â418Î±403â421Î±403â4212Î±421â437Î±429â445Î±423â443Î±424â4453Î±457â475Î±456â467Î±451â471Î±452â4724Î±479â495Î±480â499Î±480â500Î±478â4985NAaNA, not applicable with E. coli numbering since this segment corresponds to the gap between the Î±- and Î²-subunits.NANAbThis helix is proposed to be present in mitochondrial transhydrogenases (see âDiscussionâ).6Î²8â27Î²9â20Î²5â25Î²4â257Î²31â49(Î²40â45)Î²33â53Î²32â528Î²59â74Î²56â75Î²56â759Î²83â109Î²89â104Î²85â105Î²84â10410Î²118â147Î²121â142Î²124â144Î²125â14411Î²161â188Î²165â180Î²162â182Î²162â18112Î²189â212Î²188â208Î²186â20713Î²194â222(Î²218â221)Î²214â234Î²216â23614Î²229â257Î²234â263Î²240â260Î²240â260Helix numbering corresponds to the helix numbering of bovine transhydrogenase in Ref.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2761-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and residue numbering corresponds to theE. coli sequence. As shown in Fig. 1, the three programs gave the same helical arrangement for the Î±-subunit, but three different arrangements for the Î²-subunit, differing not only with regard to number of helices, but also with regard to orientation and position of individual helices. In the Î±-subunit, five transmembrane segments were predicted by all methods with rather small differences. The first of these helices belongs to the Î²Î±Î²-nucleotide-binding fold in the hydrophilic domain and was therefore not included in the work or discussion of this paper. The remaining four helices corresponded to those previously predicted, approximately spanning amino acid sequences 402â421, 423â443, 451â471, and 480â500 (TableI), thus placing both termini on the cytosolic side. The Î²-subunit, on the other hand, gave more ambiguous results. The prediction program PredictProtein assigned helices 6â14 as transmembranous. However, considering the low scores of helices 7 and 13 (Table I), i.e. the lengths of the proposed transmembrane segments were too short to form transmembrane Î±-helices, these helices were excluded, and a model with only seven transmembrane segments for the Î²-subunit was suggested (Fig. 1). TMAP predicted seven helices for the Î²-subunit, excluding helix 8 and making one helix composed of parts of both helices 12 and 13 (Table I). TopPredConsensus, on the other hand, predicted nine helices, 6â14, as transmembranous for the Î²-subunit (Table I). On the basis of the predictions and previous topological work, potential cytosolic and extracellular loops were identified. Using the cysteine-free construct pCLNH, individual residues in these loops were mutated to cysteines to give single cysteine mutants. The locations of selected positions are shown in Table II(cf. also Fig. 5). Topological studies of mutant proteins can be considered valid only if it can be shown that the mutants retain their native structure. An appropriate assay for native structure is retention of function. Thus, the ability of the single cysteine mutants to catalyze the reduction of 3-acetylpyrimidine NAD+ by NADPH was assayed. Activities of membrane vesicles from cells expressing the His-tagged single cysteine mutants were compared with those of the His-tagged cysteine-free transhydrogenase (CLNH transhydrogenase), which, in itself, retains â¼50% activity compared with wild-type transhydrogenase. The properties of CLNH transhydrogenase have not been analyzed as thoroughly as those of the cysteine-free enzyme, previously shown to behave as the wild type, although with a somewhat lower catalytic rate (2Meuller J. Zhang J. Hou C. Bragg P.D. RydstroÌm J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, since His-tagged transhydrogenase exhibited approximately the same catalytic properties as the wild type, 3J. Meuller, unpublished data. it was assumed that the addition of a His tag to the cysteine-free enzyme did not alter its topological characteristics.Table IITranshydrogenase activities of membrane vesicles containing single cysteine mutantsMutantActivityMutantActivity%%CLNH100Î²A142C>75Î±E423C>75Î²L157C>75Î±A448C50â75Î²L173C50â75Î±Q474C>75Î²S183C>75Î±T498C>75Î²I193CNDaND, not determined.Î±Q501C>75Î²S208C>75Î²S2C>75Î²M214C50â75Î²L24Câ15Î²V216C50â75Î²S30C>75Î²S219C50â75Î²T54C>75Î²S225Câ30Î²T81C50â75Î²S237C>75Î²E85C50â75Î²D239C50â75Î²S92C>75Î²S250C>75Î²S105C>75Î²C260CbÎ²C260C was analyzed by Meuller et al.

Open table in a new tab Activities are expressed as percentage relative to the His-tagged cysteine-free transhydrogenase in which the mutants were made (100% = 1.4 Î¼mol/min/mg). Activities are averages of at least two preparations with a deviation of <15%. Table II shows the activities of the single cysteine mutants. As was anticipated from the choice of mainly nonconserved residues for substitutions, most mutations had no or only a slight effect on the catalytic activities, i.e. the activities were at least 50% of the activity of the His-tagged cysteine-free transhydrogenase, and the mutants were thus considered as native in their fold. A substantially decreased activity was found only for the mutants Î²L24C, Î²A114C, and Î²S225C. However, it should be stressed that activities were not related to the amount of transhydrogenase, but to the total protein content of the vesicles in which transhydrogenase presumably represents a relatively constant fraction. A low activity may therefore be a consequence of a lowered amount of membrane-incorporated mutant protein due to decreased expression and/or decreased incorporation in the membrane due to erroneous folding. Proper incorporation was considered normal if the yields of the purified transhydrogenase mutants were >50% of the His-tagged cysteine-free transhydrogenase. If this was not the case, incorporation was estimated directly by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cytoplasmic vesicles. A deceased incorporation was indeed found with the Î²A114C mutant, which had a significantly lower incorporation (data not shown); the reason(s) for this effect was not analyzed further. In contrast, Î²L24C and Î²S225C also showed a lowered activity, but this was not due to decreased membrane incorporation (data not shown), but rather reflected the structural and/or functional importance of these fully conserved residues. However, the residual activity, although low, was taken as an indication of a correct overall topology of these mutants as well. Expression and purification of single cysteine mutants were performed as described under âExperimental Procedures.â A histidine hexamer was fused to the N terminus of the Î±-subunit of transhydrogenase to facilitate purification. The His tag was inserted by polymerase chain reaction/mutagenesis into the pSA2 construct instead of using commercial His tag vectors to perturb the high expression level as little as possible. The fusion construct was readily expressed, and the His tag was accessible as shown by binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. This system allowed us, starting from crude cell lysates, to purify â¼4 mg of mutant protein/liter of culture with a purity of >75% as judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2). The high degree of purity achieved with this simple purification method enabled us to detect even minor amounts of labeled transhydrogenase that otherwise would have been obscured by the presence of impurities. Solubilization of membrane proteins was performed with Triton X-100 instead of the previously used cholate/deoxycholate (27Hu X. Zhang J. Persson A. RydstroÌm J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This gave a yield of solubilized transhydrogenase that was higher, although it also resulted in a slightly less active state after purification (data not shown). As the purification only served to clean up already assayed samples, this was not considered a problem for this study and was therefore not analyzed further. Single cysteine mutants were labeled with membrane-impermeable thiol-reacting fluorescent reagents in intact membranes of opposite orientations. Two different reagents were used: fluorescein 5-maleimide, which at neutral pH is a dianion and membrane-impermeable, and the monoanionic and more hydrophobic reagent MIANS, which, although still membrane-impermeable, should be able to penetrate farther into hydrophobic environments (28Haugland R.P.

https://openalex.org/W2114465292,"Ca2+-activated Clâ channels are inhibited by inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4) (Xie, W., Kaetzel, M. A., Bruzik, K. S., Dedman, J. R., Shears, S. B., and Nelson, D. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 14092â14097), a novel second messenger that is formed after stimulus-dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In this study, we show that inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) is the specific signal that ties increased cellular levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 to changes in PLC activity. We first demonstrated that Ins(1,3,4)P3 inhibited Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase activity that was either (i) in lysates of AR4â2J pancreatoma cells or (ii) purified 22,500-fold (yield = 13%) from bovine aorta. Next, we incubated [3H]inositol-labeled AR4â2J cells with cell permeant and non-radiolabeled 2,5,6-tri-O-butyryl-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate-hexakis(acetoxymethyl) ester. This treatment increased cellular levels of Ins(1,3,4)P3 2.7-fold, while [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels increased 2-fold; there were no changes to levels of other 3H-labeled inositol phosphates. This experiment provides the first direct evidence that levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 are regulated by Ins(1,3,4)P3 in vivo, independently of Ins(1,3,4)P3 being metabolized to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. In addition, we found that the Ins(1,3,4)P3 metabolites, namely Ins(1,3)P2 and Ins(3,4)P2, were >100-fold weaker inhibitors of the 1-kinase compared with Ins(1,3,4)P3 itself (IC50 = 0.17 Î¼m). This result shows that dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 in vivo is an efficient mechanism to âswitch-offâ the cellular regulation of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels that comes from Ins(1,3,4)P3-mediated inhibition of the 1-kinase. We also found that Ins(1,3,6)P3 and Ins(1,4,6)P3 were poor inhibitors of the 1-kinase (IC50 = 17 and >30 Î¼m, respectively). The non-physiological trisphosphates,d/l-Ins(1,2,4)P3, inhibited 1-kinase relatively potently (IC50 = 0.7 Î¼m), thereby suggesting a new strategy for the rational design of therapeutically useful kinase inhibitors. Overall, our data provide new information to support the idea that Ins(1,3,4)P3 acts in an important signaling cascade. Ca2+-activated Clâ channels are inhibited by inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4) (Xie, W., Kaetzel, M. A., Bruzik, K. S., Dedman, J. R., Shears, S. B., and Nelson, D. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 14092â14097), a novel second messenger that is formed after stimulus-dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In this study, we show that inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) is the specific signal that ties increased cellular levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 to changes in PLC activity. We first demonstrated that Ins(1,3,4)P3 inhibited Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase activity that was either (i) in lysates of AR4â2J pancreatoma cells or (ii) purified 22,500-fold (yield = 13%) from bovine aorta. Next, we incubated [3H]inositol-labeled AR4â2J cells with cell permeant and non-radiolabeled 2,5,6-tri-O-butyryl-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate-hexakis(acetoxymethyl) ester. This treatment increased cellular levels of Ins(1,3,4)P3 2.7-fold, while [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels increased 2-fold; there were no changes to levels of other 3H-labeled inositol phosphates. This experiment provides the first direct evidence that levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 are regulated by Ins(1,3,4)P3 in vivo, independently of Ins(1,3,4)P3 being metabolized to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. In addition, we found that the Ins(1,3,4)P3 metabolites, namely Ins(1,3)P2 and Ins(3,4)P2, were >100-fold weaker inhibitors of the 1-kinase compared with Ins(1,3,4)P3 itself (IC50 = 0.17 Î¼m). This result shows that dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 in vivo is an efficient mechanism to âswitch-offâ the cellular regulation of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels that comes from Ins(1,3,4)P3-mediated inhibition of the 1-kinase. We also found that Ins(1,3,6)P3 and Ins(1,4,6)P3 were poor inhibitors of the 1-kinase (IC50 = 17 and >30 Î¼m, respectively). The non-physiological trisphosphates,d/l-Ins(1,2,4)P3, inhibited 1-kinase relatively potently (IC50 = 0.7 Î¼m), thereby suggesting a new strategy for the rational design of therapeutically useful kinase inhibitors. Overall, our data provide new information to support the idea that Ins(1,3,4)P3 acts in an important signaling cascade. inositol polyphosphate, wheren is the number of phosphates (e.g. InsP3) polyethylene glycol phospholipase C high pressure liquid chromatography 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2,5,6-tri-O-butyryl-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate hexakis (acetoxymethyl) ester There is considerable interest in the idea that Ins(1,4,5)P31and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (Fig. 1) act in a co-ordinated manner as mediators of stimulus-dependent Ca2+mobilization (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar, 2Irvine R.F. Putney Jr., J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and P hosphoprotein Research. Raven Press, New York1992: 161-185Google Scholar). This has naturally led us to consider that the 5-phosphatases that degrade Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (3Hansen C.A. Johanson R.A. Williamson M.T. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17319-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are signaling âoff-switches.â This in turn has created the impression that the pathway by which these two inositol phosphates are dephosphorylated serves only as a conduit that replenishes the free inositol pool. In contrast, we have recently suggested that one of these downstream products, namely Ins(1,3,4)P3, should be viewed in an important cell-signaling context (4Tan Z. Bruzik K.S. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2285-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This new hypothesis comes from the observation that a rat hepatic Ins(3,4,5,6)P41-kinase was inhibited in vitro by Ins(1,3,4)P3(4Tan Z. Bruzik K.S. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

The reason that this effect of Ins(1,3,4)P3 upon Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 metabolism is of such interest is that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is an inhibitor of the conductance of the calcium-activated Clâ channels in the plasma membrane (6Ho M.W.Y.

These ion channels make important contributions to salt and fluid secretion, and in addition they may participate in osmoregulation, pH balance, and smooth muscle excitability (10Nauntofte B. Am. J.

The cellular accumulation of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is known to correlate well with receptor-dependent changes in PLC activity, but the molecular mechanisms that link these two events have not been fully elucidated (14Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our current hypothesis (15Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21528-21534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that cellular levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 depend upon a dynamic balance between two competing enzyme activities acting in a closed substrate cycle: Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 1-phosphatase and Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase (Fig. 1). The poise of this cycle is proposed to be regulated in such a manner that it can shift in favor of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 accumulation whenever PLC is activated, perhaps through inhibition of the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase by Ins(1,3,4)P3 (Fig. 1). However, to date such inhibition has only been observed in studies with the purified rat hepatic kinase (4Tan Z. Bruzik K.S. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2285-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Craxton A. Erneux C. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4337-4342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No direct evidence has previously been published that indicates Ins(1,3,4)P3 can regulate Ins(3,4,5,6)P41-kinase activity in intact cells; it was a goal of the current study to explore this issue. In order to investigate if Ins(1,3,4)P3 can regulate Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels in intact cells, it was necessary to increase cellular levels of Ins(1,3,4)P3 specifically, under conditions where PLC activity was not activated. In this way, we could avoid the possibility of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 metabolism also being regulated by the many additional signal transduction processes that are activated downstream of PLC. To this end, the development of cell-permeant, bioactivatable analogues of inositol phosphates (7Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y.

Chem. 1998; 41: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) has provided us with new opportunities to examine the functions of inositol polyphosphates in intact cells. The charge-masking groups that enable these derivatives to permeate into cells are hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases, releasing the native isomer (7Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Li W. Schultz C. Llopis J. Tsien R.Y. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 12017-12040Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study we used a new cell-permeant analogue, 2,5,6-tri-O-butyryl-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate hexakis(acetoxymethyl) ester (Bt3Ins(1,3,4)P3/AM; Ref. 19Rudolf M.T. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Schultz C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 1857-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), to elevate the cellular concentration of Ins(1,3,4)P3 inside rat pancreatoma (AR4â2J) cells. This experimental approach was important for another reason. Rather than Ins(1,3,4)P3 regulating an enzyme of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 metabolism (Fig.1), in principle, Ins(1,3,4)P3 could instead elevate Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 concentration simply by being metabolized to it (i.e. a mass action effect). For example, Ins(1,3,4)P3 can be converted to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4by the sequential actions of Ins(1,3,4)P3 6-kinase, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase, and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P51-phosphatase (15Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G.

Others have proposed an alternative pathway for de novo Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 synthesis, which requires the sequential actions of Ins(1,3,4)P3 6-kinase, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 1-phosphatase, and Ins(3,4,6)P35-kinase (21Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Stephens L.R. Berrie C.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem.

We have now used AR4â2J cells to examine whether Ins(1,3,4)P3 alters Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels by mass action effects. Our strategy was based upon first prelabeling the metabolic pool of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 to steady-state with [3H]inositol. These cells were then treated with non-radiolabeled Bt3Ins(1,3,4)P3/AM. We investigated if there was any significant metabolic flux from Ins(1,3,4)P3 to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, which would have revealed itself by tending to decrease the amount of3H label in the [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 pool, due to a pulse-chase effect (15Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another feature of an effective signal transduction process relates to its specificity. If the biological effects of a signaling compound cannot be imitated by its products and precursors, this provides sensitivity in the signaling âonâ and âoffâ switches. In the case of signaling by Ins(1,3,4)P3, the âon-switchâ is dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (3Hansen C.A. Johanson R.A. Williamson M.T. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17319-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process is particularly sensitive, as Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is a 290-fold weaker inhibitor of the 1-kinase than is Ins(1,3,4)P3 (4Tan Z. Bruzik K.S. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2285-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have now turned our attention to considering how effective is the dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 as a signaling off-switch. In vivo, both 4- and 1-phosphatases actively degrade Ins(1,3,4)P3 to Ins(1,3)P2 and Ins(3,4)P2, respectively (24Bansal V.S. Inhorn R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9444-9447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Inhorn R.C. Bansal V.S. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have therefore determined the potency with which these bisphosphate degradation products inhibit the 1-kinase. There was one further aspect to this study that is relevant to the development of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 agonists and antagonists for pharmacological intervention in the signaling actions of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (18Rudolf M.T. Li W. Wolfson N. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Schultz C. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Schultz C. Roemer S. Stadler C. Rudolf M.T. Wolfson E. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A401Google Scholar). This goal is directed at diseases that might be treated by either up-regulating or down-regulating Ca2+-activated Clâ secretion (18Rudolf M.T. Li W. Wolfson N. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Schultz C. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Schultz C. Roemer S. Stadler C. Rudolf M.T. Wolfson E. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A401Google Scholar). A major challenge to pharmacological intervention at the effector site for Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 comes from the exquisite specificity with which it blocks Clâ channel conductance; Ins(1,3,4)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 are all ineffective (6Ho M.W.Y.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, at least one, and possibly both of the OH groups on Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, are also critical determinants of substrate specificity (18Rudolf M.T. Li W. Wolfson N. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Schultz C. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Xie W. Solomons K.R.H. Freeman S. Kaetzel M.A. Bruzik K.S. Nelson D.J. Shears S.B. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This tight specificity may make it difficult to rationally design a functional analogue of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. A possible alternative therapeutic strategy might be to target Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 synthesis, rather than its site of action. To this end, we examined the impact on the 1-kinase of some analogues of Ins(1,3,4)P3 that contain a phosphate group in the 2-position. [3H]Inositol was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. or NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 was prepared by dephosphorylating [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (20 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) with recombinant Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase, which was kindly provided by Dr. C.

Alkylation of the hydroxy group with benzyl bromide in dimethyl formamide at 50 Â°C for 20 h and in the presence of an excess of sodium hydride and tetrabutyl ammonium iodide afforded 3,4-di-O-benzyl-1,2:5,6-di-O-cyclohexylidene-myo-inositol. Purification by preparative HPLC (92% MeOH, RP-18, 10 Î¼m, 50 Ã 250 mm, 40 ml/min) gave 55% yield as an oil [Î±]D20 was +23Â°; c = 0.75, chloroform). The more labile ketal was removed by a 2-h treatment with acetyl chloride (5%) in a mixture of acetonitrile and methanol (4:5, v/v). The solution was neutralized with triethylamine and evaporated to dryness. The crude material was purified by preparative HPLC (90% MeOH, RP-18, 10 Î¼m, 50 Ã 250 mm, 40 ml/min) to give 3,4-di-O-benzyl-1,2-O-cyclohexylidene-myo-inositol in 58% yield as a clear oil [Î±]D20was â11.1Â°; c = 0.72, chloroform).

For some assays, the 1-kinase was preincubated at 30 Â°C for 10 min with (a) 125 units of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, (b) 0.2 unit of protein kinase C, (c) 600 units of calmodulin, or (d) 500 units of CaM KII, preactivated with calmodulin/Ca2+ (New England Biolabs). The protein kinases used in these experiments were all shown to be active in control experiments (assay kits for protein kinases A and C were supplied by Pierce; the CaM KII was checked using a kit purchased from Upstate Biochemicals). The 1-kinase was also used as a diagnostic tool to verify the nature of HPLC-purified [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. In these incubations, 45 Î¼l of purified 1-kinase was added to 225 Î¼l of medium containing 67 mm HEPES (pH 8.0 with KOH), 0.7 mm EDTA, 8.7 mm MgSO4, 6.7 mm ATP, 13.3 mm phosphocreatine, 1.33 Î¼m InsP6, and 6 Sigma units of phosphocreatine kinase. Then, 30 Î¼l of the appropriate HPLC fraction was added (which brought the final pH to approximately 6.5). Reactions (at 37 Â°C) were allowed to proceed to completion (over a 3-h period), and then the amount of [3H]InsP5formed was determined using gravity-fed ion-exchange columns, as described above. Frozen bovine aortas were thawed on ice, the attached fat was removed, and then the aorta were pulverized in a meat grinder. In a typical preparation, 300â350 g of ground aortas were homogenized in two volumes of 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a tissue blender. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, and a 10â30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 precipitate was prepared. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A containing 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A. The suspension was filtered and loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a heparin-agarose type II column (3.2 Ã 24 cm). After washing with 300 ml of Buffer A at flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0â30 mm of sodium pyrophosphate in Buffer A. The peak fractions of enzyme activity eluted from the heparin column were pooled, then frozen and stored at â70 Â°C. Either two or three preparations were subsequently thawed and combined, dialyzed against 2 liters of 25 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0) at 4 Â°C for 3 h, and loaded onto a UNO Q12 anion exchange column (1.5 Ã 6.8 cm), which was pre-equilibrated with 100 ml of Buffer A. A constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was maintained throughout the chromatography. After washing with 60 ml of Buffer A, the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer A plus 0â300 mm NaCl, followed by 60 ml of Buffer A plus1 m NaCl. Peak fractions of enzyme activity eluted from the UNO Q12 column were pooled, dialyzed against 2 liters of 25 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0) at 4 Â°C for 3 h, and loaded on to heparin-agarose type IIIs (1.1 Ã 13.5 cm), which was pre-equilibrated with 50 ml of Buffer A. A constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was maintained throughout. After washing with 60 ml of Buffer A, the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0â300 mm NaCl in Buffer A, followed by 60 ml of 1 m NaCl in Buffer A. The protein concentration of the 1-kinase preparation was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard. Final enzyme preparations were stored in 10% glycerol plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at â70 Â°C. A 1-ml aliquot of a resuspension of a 10â30% PEG precipitation was loaded at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min to Sephacryl S100 column (2.0 Ã 86 cm), which was pre-equilibrated with 600 ml of bis-Tris buffer containing 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A, and 100 mm NaCl. The protein was then chromatographed using the same buffer at a constant 0.25 ml/min flow rate. Fractions (5ml) were collected and assayed for enzyme activity. The column was calibrated under the exactly same conditions using bovine serum albumin, chicken ovalbumin, equine myoglobin, and vitamin B-12. The AR4â2J pancreatoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 500 units/ml penicillin, and 500 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, with 10% conditioned medium, and harvested by brief trypsinization. Either 2.0 Ã 105 or 1.2 Ã 106 cells were seeded in 24-well or 6-well tissue culture plates, respectively. Cells were labeled with 75â150 Î¼Ci/ml [3H]myo-inositol for 4 days (medium was replaced on the 3rd day) in 700 Î¼l (for 24-well plates) or 3 ml (for 6-well plates) of the above culture medium. After completion of the labeling protocol, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were washed twice with Krebs/Ringer/HEPES solution (15Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated in 300 Î¼l (for 24-well) or 1 ml (for 6-well) of Krebs/Ringer/HEPES solution for 2 h. Then 20 mm LiCl was added, and 20 min later cells were treated for the indicated time with (i) a cell-permeant inositol phosphate, (ii) vehicle, or (iii) bombesin. Cells were quenched and neutralized, and the inositol phosphates were separated by HPLC as described elsewhere (36Shears S.B. Shears S.B. Signalling by Inositides: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 33-52Google Scholar). Radioactivity was either counted on-line, using a Radiomatic Flo-1, or recovered in 1-ml fractions. The levels of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates were normalized as a ratio to cellular levels of [3H]InsP6; the latter were unaffected by any of the experimental protocols performed in this study. For some experiments, after the AR4-2J cells were harvested, cells were collected by centrifugation in serum-containing culture medium. The pellet was washed in HEPES-buffered saline, and then a lysate was prepared by resuspending the packed cells in an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer comprising: 50 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmATP, 4 mm CHAPS, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 Î¼m E-64, 10 Î¼m leupeptin, 3 Î¼m pepstatin. Following the HPLC fractionation of extracts of [3H]inositol-labeled cells (see above), 1-ml fractions were saved, from which 25-Î¼l aliquots were counted for radioactivity so as to identify the Ins(1,3,4)P3 peak (because of the low levels of endogenous [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3, samples were âspikedâ with 4000 dpm [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 (20 Ci/mmol) before they were applied to the HPLC column). The Ins(1,3,4)P3 peak was then desalted (37Maslanski J.A. Busa W.B. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 109-122Google Scholar) and resuspended in 60 Î¼l Ins(1,3,4)P36-kinase assay buffer: 50 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 6 mm ATP, 8 mm MgSO4, 25 Sigma units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Recovery of [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 from the cell extract was typically 70â75%. Each Ins(1,3,4)P3 sample was then divided into two equal portions, named A and B. The Ins(1,3,4)P3 was depleted from portion B by its incubation for 60 min at 37 Â°C with 0.1 Î¼g of recombinant Ins("

Interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) binds to GAG; however, the relevance of this interaction for the biological activity of IFN-Î³ on human cells remains to be established. Human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMC), the main cells synthesizing PG in the vascular wall, respond markedly to IFN-Î³. We found that treatment of HASMC with chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme that degrades chondroitin sulfate GAG, reduced IFN-Î³ binding by more than 50%. This treatment increased the affinity of 125I-IFN-Î³ for cells from a K d value of about 93 nm to aK d value of about 33 nm. However, the total binding was reduced from 9.3 Â± 0.77 pmol/Î¼g to 3.0 Â± 0.23 pmol/mg (n = 4). Interestingly, pretreatment with chondroitinase ABC reduced significantly the cellular response toward IFN-Î³. The interaction of IFN-Î³ with chondroitin sulfate GAG was confirmed by affinity chromatography of isolated cell-associated35S-, 3H-labeled PG on a column with immobilized IFN-Î³. The cell-associated PG that binds to IFN-Î³ was a chondroitin sulfate PG (CSPG). This CSPG had a core protein of approximately 110 kDa that was recognized by anti-CD44 antibodies on Western blots. High molecular weight complexes between IFN-Î³ and chondroitin 6-sulfate were observed in gel exclusion chromatography. Additions of chondroitin 6-sulfate to cultured HASMC antagonized the antiproliferative effect and expression of major histocompatibility complex II antigens induced by IFN-Î³. These results indicate that IFN-Î³ binds with low affinity to the chondroitin sulfate GAG moiety of the cell surface CSPG receptor CD44. This interaction may increase the local concentration of IFN-Î³ at the cell surface, thus facilitating its binding to high affinity receptors and modulating the ability of IFN-Î³ to signal a cellular response.

IFN-Î³ causes its pleiotropic effects partially through interaction with a specific plasma membrane receptor (6Valente G. Ozmen L. Novelli F. Geuna M. Palestro G. Forni G. Garotta G. Eur. J.

In addition, the biologically active IFN-Î³-receptor complex requires the species-matched interaction of the complex with at least one additional accessory factor that conveys different cellular responses (8Hemmi S. BoÌhni R. Stark G. Marco F.D. Aguet M. Cell. 1994; 76: 803-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Kotenko S. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Wang N. Emanuel S.

Proteoglycans (PGs) are ubiquitous components of cell membranes. They consist of a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are covalently attached. GAGs are linear, sulfate-substituted carbohydrates. The main GAG types in PG are as follows: chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and heparin. This last one is restricted to mast cell granules (10Wight T.N. HeinegÃ¥rd D.K. Hascall V.C. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 45-78Crossref Google Scholar, 11Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 12Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 252-261Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Because of the high sulfate and carboxyl group content in their GAG moieties, PGs are the most negatively charged polymers in living tissues. This property allows them to interact with proteins with clusters of positively charged amino acids (13Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 9: 21-31Crossref Google Scholar, 14Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, apart from being structural elements for extracellular matrix and basement membrane assembly, PGs/GAGs also serve as cell surface receptors for a wide range of proteins, including growth factors, enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, lipoproteins, and viruses (11Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 12Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 252-261Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 15Lustig F.

Human recombinant IFN-Î³ is a 146-amino acid polypeptide where three positive charged clusters of basic amino acids are localized in the carboxyl terminus: 1) SNKKKRDDF, residues 87â96, total charge +2; 2)AKTGKRKRS, residues 127â135, total charge +5; and 3) LFRGRRAS, residues 138â145, total charge +3. These sequences do not correspond completely to the consensus GAG binding sequences reported for other proteins (13Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 9: 21-31Crossref Google Scholar). However, experimental data indicate that these regions may provide IFN-Î³ with the capacity to interact with negative charged GAG (18Hurt-Camejo E. Rosengren B. Camejo G. Sartipy P. Fager G. Bondjers G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1456-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.-A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of human IFN-Î³ indicates that these sequences of basic amino acids are exposed on the surface of the protein (24Ealick S.E. Cook W.J. Vijay-Kumar S. Carson M. Nagabhushan T.L. Trotta P.P. Bugg C.E. Science. 1991; 252: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 25Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L. Lundell D.J. Lunn C.A. Zauodny P.J. Narula S.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these sequences are similar to the nuclear localization signal, a consensus of basic amino acids required for efficient transport of proteins, including IFN-Î³, from the cytosol to the nucleus (26Bader T. Wietzerbin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11831-11835Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our previous experiments with synthetic peptides suggested that the cluster of basic amino acid residues 127â135 (AKTGKRKRS) of human IFN-Î³ is involved in the binding with chondroitin-sulfate PGs from the extracellular matrix of human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMC) (18Hurt-Camejo E. Rosengren B. Camejo G. Sartipy P. Fager G. Bondjers G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1456-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, results have shown that IFN-Î³ immobilized in CSPG generates a higher response than soluble IFN-Î³ from HASMC in culture. Sadir et al. (27Sadir R. Forest E. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10919-10925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) recently showed that this basic cluster of amino acids was involved both in heparin and IFN-Î³-receptor recognition. Furthermore, results from studies with site-directed mutagenesis and controlled proteolysis suggest that part of this region (residues 131â135, KRKRS) is critical for receptor binding and biological activity (28DoÌbeli H. Gentz R. Jucker W. Garotta G. Hartmann D.W. Hochuli E. J. Biotechnol. 1988; 7: 199-216Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Seelig G.F. Wijdenes J. Nagabhushan T.L. Trotta P.P.

Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that the basic clusters in IFN-Î³ carboxyl-terminal structure are important for the biological activity of IFN-Î³. Arterial smooth muscle cells in culture respond markedly to IFN-Î³ by expressing class II MHC such as HLA-DR (32Hansson G.K. Jonasson L. Holm J. Clowes M.M. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These genes are up-regulated by smooth muscle cells in experimentally injured arteries and human atherosclerotic plaques, probably induced by secretion of IFN-Î³ by a subset of T-cells present in the arterial wall (33Jonasson L. Holm J. Hansson G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). IFN-Î³ is present in human atherosclerotic plaque (34Zhou X. Paulsson G. Stemme S. Hansson G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This cytokine is also a potent inhibitor of both cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in HASMC (35Warner S.J.C. Friedman G.B. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36Amento E.P. Ehsani N. Palmer H. Libby P. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Based on these in vitroeffects, Libby et al. (37Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar) suggested that chronic activation of these cells by IFN-Î³ might contribute to mechanic instability of atherosclerotic plaques. Such a hypothesis is supported by results from double knockout mice lacking the IFN-Î³ receptor and apoE that develop much less atherosclerosis than the apoE single knockout mice do (38Gupta S. Pablo A.M. Jiang X.-C. Wang N. Tall A.R. Schindler C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results imply that IFN-Î³ signaling may promote atherogenesis and plaque disruption. Therefore, inhibition of IFN-Î³ signaling in arterial cells may be a possible therapy against acute coronary syndromes. This hypothesis, however, requires more knowledge about mechanisms involved in signaling the presence of IFN-Î³ in human cells. The interaction between IFN-Î³ and GAG has been reported previously (18Hurt-Camejo E. Rosengren B. Camejo G. Sartipy P. Fager G. Bondjers G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1456-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.-A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 37: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar). However, characterization of the interaction and its relevance for the biological activity of IFN-Î³ on human cells is not completely understood. In the present study, we explored whether cell surface GAG in HASMC may have a function in binding IFN-Î³ and if this interaction may modulate the ability of IFN-Î³ to induce a biological response. Hepes, Triton X-100, N-ethylmaleimide, Îµ-amino caproic acid, benzamidine HCl, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, heparan sulfate (7,500 kDa), cetylpyridinium bromide, and ethylaminohexanoic acid were purchased from Sigma.

Monoclonal mouse anti-human HLA-DR, CR3/43, negative control mouse IgG1, biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins, normal rabbit serum, and ABComplex/AP for determination of HLA-DR expression in human cells were purchased from Dako (Dakopatts AB, Sweden). Mitochondrial activity kit (XTT) and BrdU ELISA kit for nonradioactive quantification of cell activation and proliferation, respectively, were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Bromma, Sweden). Salts, buffer substances, and detergents used in this work were of analytical grade and were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and Bio-Rad. Primary cultures of HASMC from inner media of human uterine arteries were established using a previously described explantation technique (40Fager G. Hansson G.K. Ottosson P. DahlloÌf B. Bondjers G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by trypsinization and cultured at a cell density of 5 Ã 103cells/cm2 in 6-, 12-, 24-, and 96-well plates for binding experiments and biological assays of IFN-Î³ activity and in 80-cm2 bottles for the isolation of PGs synthesized by the cells. HASMC were cultured in bottles coated with a film of collagen-I (41Thyberg J. Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Piper H.M. Cell Culture Techniques in Heart and Vessel Research.

The cells were allowed to proliferate in Waymouth's medium plus 10% (v/v) FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, 4 mmol/liter glutamine, and nonessential amino acids (growing medium). After 2 days, the medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with DPBS and then cultured in Waymouth's medium containing the supplements indicated above but only 0.5% FCS (sera-poor medium) in order to synchronize the cells by stopping proliferation. After 3 days, the medium was removed, and cells were washed 3 times with DPBS and cultured in growing medium for 3â4 days until the cells were confluent. The experiments were carried out with cells between passages 3 and 12. HASMC were tested for mycoplasma contamination during each passage by using a mycoplasma test kit from Gen-Probe Inc. Endotoxin levels were regularly tested in cell culture media and cell culture reagents with Coatest/endotoxin (Chromogenix AB). Levels detected were 0.01 enzyme units/ml. The ability of 125I-IFN-Î³ to bind to HASMC was measured in binding assays carried out in 12-, 24-, or 96-well plates. The plates were washed three times with ice-cold DPBS, 0.2% BSA and incubated for 10 min at 4 Â°C with ice-cold bicarbonate-free Waymouth's medium, 0.2% BSA. The cells were incubated with 125I-IFN-Î³ (100â1000 cpm/pg) at concentrations indicated in the figures at 4 Â°C for 4 h. The plates were then placed over ice and washed three times with ice-cold Waymouth's medium, 0.2% BSA and three times with ice-cold DPBS. The cells were then washed three times with DPBS and then two times with 2 mol/liter NaCl in 20 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.4) to induce a maximal release of 125I-IFN-Î³ bound to GAGs (42Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). These washes were collected. The cells were next dissolved with 2 Ã 0.2 mol/liter NaOH, and their protein was measured. The radioactivity measured in the 2 mol/liter NaCl, pH 7.4, wash represented the fraction of 125I-IFN-Î³ bound extracellularly to sulfated GAGs through ionic interactions. The radioactivity measured in cells dissolved with 0.2 mol/liter NaOH represented the fraction of125I-IFN-Î³ bound through nonionic interactions to cell membrane, probably to the receptor and 125I-IFN-Î³ internalized by the cells. The amount of radioactivity was counted in a Compugamma counter (LKB, Wallac, Sweden), and aliquots were used for protein determination (43Markwell M.A.K. Hass S.N. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). The data from binding experiments were analyzed to determine maximum binding (B max) and apparent dissociation constant (K d) by nonlinear regression analysis (44Epps D.E. Raub T.J. KeÌzdy F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using the program GraphPad PRISM Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA). HASMC were treated with chondroitinase ABC (chABC) and heparitinase I (Hep I) in order to digest cell surface chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, respectively. Cell media were removed, and the HASMC were washed three times with DPBS, 0.2% BSA and incubated for 2 h at 37 Â°C with or without 0.01 unit/ml of the enzymes in DPBS, 0.2% BSA. Cell viability in the DPBS and glycosidase-treated cells was greater than 90%, as judged by trypan blue exclusion and cell morphology. Dishes without cells were run in parallel as control. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with DPBS, 0.2% BSA. The cells were then incubated with125I-labeled IFN-Î³ to perform binding experiments or with unlabeled IFN-Î³ to study cellular response toward IFN-Î³ as described below. In order to keep cells depleted from pericellular GAGs, the incubation with IFN-Î³ were done in the presence of chABC and/or Hep I (0.01 U/ml). Control cells were treated and incubated in similar conditions but without enzyme(s). HASMC (5,000 cells/cm2) were cultured as described above in Waymouth's medium plus 10% (v/v) FCS (complete medium) for 2 days. After this period, the medium was changed to sera-poor formulation. After 2 days, medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with DPBS and then cultured in diploid medium (sulfate-free) supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids (diploid medium A). After 1 day, the medium was removed, and fresh diploid medium A was added plus 33 Î¼Ci/ml [35S]sulfate (40â50 Î¼Ci/mol) and 17 Î¼Ci/ml [3H]leucine (120 mCi/mmol). The cells remained in this medium for 3 days. After this period, the cell culture medium was harvested. The cells were washed three times with DPBS and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with sera-free culture medium containing 50 Î¼g/ml heparin. This step was included in order to remove peripheral, extrinsically associated PG (45Faassen A.E. Achrager J.A. Klein D.J. Oegema T.R. Couchman J.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Heparin-containing medium was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with DPBS. Cell-associated proteoglycans were isolated by incubating HASMC with 15 ml of extraction buffer for 30 min with gentle shaking. The extraction buffer contained 0.15 mol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.255 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/liter Î±-aminocaproic acid, 5 mmol/liter N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mmol/liter benzamidine HCl, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The cell extracts were then dialyzed against ion exchange chromatography buffer (8 mol/liter urea, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors) for 2 days with two changes per day (M r 3500 cut-off). After dialysis, the samples were passed through Hi-trap Q ion exchange columns equilibrated in binding buffer. After the samples were loaded, the columns were washed with binding buffer containing 0.25 mol/liter NaCl to remove glycoproteins. The bound material was finally eluted with a gradient from 0.25 mol/liter to 3 mol/liter NaCl in binding buffer, and the radioactivity in each collected fraction was measured. The fractions rich in 35S-labeled PGs eluted around 1.5 mol/liter NaCl. These PG-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. These samples were used for IFN-Î³ affinity chromatography as described below. GAG composition was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (46Camejo G. Hurt-Camejo E. Olsson U. Bondjers G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 385-391Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 35S-,3H-labeled PG samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 4â12% linear gradient gel. The positions of the radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography of dried gels.14C-methylated protein molecular weight standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to estimate the average sizes of35S-, 3H-labeled cell PGs. A Sepharose-IFN-Î³ column (5 Ã 1-cm diameter) was prepared from IFN-Î³ bound to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's procedure. The column was equilibrated in binding buffer: 5 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 2 mmol/liter MgCl2. A similar column containing no IFN-Î³ and blocked with ethanolamine served as a control column for unspecific binding. The cell extract containing the [35S]sulfate- and [3H]leucine-labeled PGs synthesized by HASMC were equilibrated in binding buffer and passed, half through the IFN-Î³ column and half through the control column. The columns were washed with 25 ml of the same buffer. Bound material was eluted with a gradient from 20 mmol/liter to 500 mmol/liter NaCl, and fractions of 1 ml were collected. The peaks containing the cell PGs retained by the immobilized IFN-Î³ were dialyzed and lyophilized. Thereafter, the samples were dissolved in 1.5 ml of 20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.5, and divided in three aliquots. One aliquot was treated with chondroitinase ABC (20 units/ml), the second aliquot with heparitinase I (20 units/ml), and the third without enzyme (control). The samples were incubated overnight at 37 Â°C. The reaction was stopped by rapidly freezing the samples at â20 Â°C. The aliquots were equilibrated in binding buffer and passed again through the IFN-Î³ affinity column as described above. Total and cell-associated proteoglycans with affinity for IFN-Î³ were isolated as described above. These preparations of cell-associated proteoglycans were incubated with or without 0.10 units/ml chondroitinase ABC overnight at 37 Â°C. The samples were mixed with electrophoresis sample buffer and run in a 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (47SchaÌgger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Gel transfer and blotting was performed as described by Hurt-Camejo et al. (48Hurt-Camejo E. Anderssen S. Standal R. Rosengren B. Sartipy P. Stadberg E. Johansen B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 17: 300-309Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated (1.5 h at room temperature) with monoclonal anti-CD44 (MA-4410, Endogen) diluted 1:1000 or with rabbit antibody LF-51 anti-biglycan (from Dr. Larry Fisher) (49Fisher L.W. Stubbs J.T.I. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar) diluted 1:5000 with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk). After three washes with PBS-T (5 min each, room temperature), the blots were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with goat anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody (P0447, DAKO) or with swine anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibody (P0217, DAKO). These secondary antibodies were diluted 1:25,000 with PBS-T. After washing three times with PBS-T, the blots were developed with the ECL Plus Western blot detection system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Total cellular RNA was isolated from HASMC in culture and from human arterial tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen. RT-PCR with 0.1 or 0.5 Î¼g of total RNA was performed with the GeneAmp single reaction tube RNA-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). The oligonucleotides used as PCR primers were CD44E3-FP (GGGGTGTACATCCTCACATC) and CD44E16-RP (ACTCCAACCTTCTTGACTCC) (50Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These primers represent common exons shared by all C44D isoforms. The RT-PCR program was as follows: 70 Â°C for 15 min (reverse transcription) and 95 Â°C for 5 min; 35 cycles carried out at 95 Â°C at 30 s, 60 Â°C at 1 min; and a final step of 60 Â°C for 7 min. RT-PCR products were run in a 0.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. To study the formation of complexes between chondroitin sulfate and IFN-Î³, we evaluated the elution behavior of the IFN-Î³ in a Superose 6 PC, 3.2/3.0 column in the presence and absence of chondroitin 6-sulfate GAG in the elution buffer. The column was operated with an automated SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Flow was 0.032 ml/min. In control experiments, the column was equilibrated in PBS, and 20 Î¼l of the IFN-Î³ (17,000 kDa) at 5 Î¼mol/liter, dissolved in the same buffer, was injected. In other runs, the column and the solution of IFN-Î³ were equilibrated in PBS containing 1 mg/ml C6S (40â80 kDa). The absorbance of the fractions eluted was followed at 254 nm. The same column was calibrated with standard proteins indicated in the legend to Fig. 8. HASMC were cultured in 96-well plates as described above. Cells were incubated with IFN-Î³ (0, 10, and 1,000 ng/ml) with or without C6S (11 and 110 Î¼g/ml). After 3-day incubations, the cellular response toward IFN-Î³ was studied by measuring cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex II or HLA-DR, cell proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and mitochondrial dehydrogenase function in cells. HLA-DR expression was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay with monoclonal antibody HLA-DR, CR3/43, and mouse IgG1-negative control antibody as described (18Hurt-Camejo E. Rosengren B. Camejo G"

In contrast, the binding affinities for MgATP and MgADP at sites 2 and 3 were similar in the Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete enzymes, as were the affinities at all three sites for free ATP and ADP. Comparison of MgATP binding and hydrolysis parameters showed that in the presence as well as the absence of Îµ, K m equalsK d3. Thus, in both cases, all three catalytic binding sites have to be occupied to obtain rapid (V max) MgATP hydrolysis rates.

Mg-2â²(3â²)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5â²-triphosphate Mg-5â²-adenylyl imidodiphosphate F1 is the catalytic sector of F1F0-ATP synthase, the enzyme responsible for ATP synthesis in the last step of oxidative phosphorylation. F1 may be isolated in soluble form and is an active ATPase (âF1-ATPaseâ) with a subunit stoichiometry of Î±3Î²3Î³Î´Îµ. The three catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are located on the three Î²-subunits (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar, 2Nakamoto R.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). For Escherichia coli F1, the minimal subunit composition able to achieve significant ATP hydrolysis rates is Î±3Î²3Î³. The small subunits Î´ and Îµ are required for functionally competent binding of F1 to F0 (4Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

The Îµ-subunit is part of the central stalk connecting F1to F0, the membrane sector of the ATP synthase complex. Îµ is tightly associated with the Î³-subunit (8Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

It appears to interact also with (one of) the c subunits of F0, and it can be cross-linked to the C-terminal domains of Î± and Î² (10Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

High-resolution structural models of isolated Îµ have been obtained based on NMR spectroscopy as well as x-ray crystallography (14Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M.

F1 containing Îµ has â¼10% of the ATPase activity of the Îµ-depleted form of the enzyme (5Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). How this inhibition is brought about is an interesting question, especially considering that Îµ is at least 35 â« away from the phosphate-binding pocket of the catalytic site. To gain more insight into the effects of Îµ on the function of F1, we determined in this study the nucleotide binding affinities of the three catalytic sites in the absence and presence of the Îµ-subunit. The enzyme we used for this purpose was E. coli Î²Y331W mutant F1. This enzyme, which shows normal functional properties, has a Trp genetically engineered into the adenine-binding domain of the catalytic site. The fluorescence response upon nucleotide binding makes this residue, Î²-Trp-331, a very sensitive probe for the occupancy of the catalytic site and allows the determination of thermodynamic and kinetic ligand binding parameters (18Weber J.

Wild-type F1was from strain SWM1 (21Rao R. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5569-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Î²Y331W mutant F1 was from strain SWM4 (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of F1 was as described (22Weber J. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Wise J.G Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Î²Y331W mutant F1 was depleted of the Îµ-subunit by immunoaffinity chromatography (23Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Western blots (24Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) confirmed that the preparation was â¼99% depleted of Îµ. The Îµ-subunit was prepared as described (25Patel A.M. Dallmann H.G. Skakoon S.E. Kapala T.D. Dunn S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The concentration of F1 was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211821) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The concentration of Îµ was measured by either the Bio-Rad protein assay or the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which gave similar results. Before use in ATPase and nucleotide binding assays, F1 was transferred into a buffer containing 50 mmTris/H2SO4, pH 8.0, by passage through two consecutive 1-ml Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns. Îµ-Replete Î²Y331W mutant F1 was generated by preincubating the Îµ-depleted enzyme (30â50 nm) for 15 min with a 4â5-fold concentration of the Îµ-subunit (120â200 nm). Dilution during the assays was <10%. The dependence of ATPase activity on the concentration of Îµ was determined after preincubation of F1 (40 nm) with varied concentrations of Îµ in 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, pH 8.0, for a minimum of 15 min at room temperature. The ATPase assay was started by adding 0.1 volume of a MgATP solution containing 50 mmTris/H2SO4, 40 mmMgSO4, and 100 mm NaATP, pH 8.0. After a 1-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS (5% final concentration). Released Pi was determined colorimetrically (28Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dependence of ATPase activity on MgATP concentration (see Fig. 1) was measured in 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, pH 8.0, at room temperature. F1 concentrations were 30 nm in the presence of Îµ and 2.5 nm in its absence. The concentration of Îµ, when present, was 120 nm. The reaction was started by simultaneous addition of NaATP and MgSO4 in a ratio of 2.5:1. Samples were withdrawn at 10- or 20-s intervals for a total time of 1 or 2 min. Released Pi was determined colorimetrically (29van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Hydrolytic activities were determined from initial linear rates. MgATP concentrations were determined as described (30Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were performed in a buffer containing 50 mmTris/H2SO4, pH 8.0, at room temperature. The spectrofluorometers used were Spex Fluorolog 2, Aminco-Bowman Series 2, and SLM 4800. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. F1concentration was 30â50 nm. For MgATP titration, two different conditions were used. To make the results directly comparable to those obtained in the hydrolysis assay, NaATP and MgSO4were added in a constant ratio of 2.5:1 to a solution of protein in buffer (see Fig. 3). Alternatively, the cuvette contained protein in buffer plus 2.5 mm MgSO4, and NaATP was added (see Fig. 5). In both cases, maximally two data points were acquired in a single experiment to avoid interference by the hydrolysis product MgADP. For MgADP titration, the buffer contained 2.5 mmMgSO4, and NaADP was added. For titration with free (uncomplexed) ATP or ADP, buffer plus 0.5 mm EDTA was used, and NaATP or NaADP was added. Background signals were subtracted, and inner filter and volume effects were corrected for by performing parallel titrations with wild-type F1. Nucleotide binding stoichiometries were determined from the decrease in Î²-Trp-331 fluorescence at 360 nm (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Based on these results, we calculated that for the experiments described below, incubation of 30 nmÎµ-depleted F1 with 120 nm Îµ would give an enzyme that was â¼99% Îµ-replete. The ATPase activities of Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete Î²Y331W F1 as a function of MgATP concentration are shown in Fig.1. Ignoring the â¼10-fold difference inV max, the curves look remarkably similar. In both cases, the substrate concentration dependence followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a single K m value of 27 Î¼m in the absence of Îµ and 21 Î¼m in its presence. Îµ-Depleted Î²Y331W F1has a Trp fluorescence maximum at 335 nm, and the Îµ-replete enzyme has one at 339 nm; both spectra are red-shifted as compared with wild-type F1 (Fig.2 A). Îµ itself contains no Trp and has no significant Trp fluorescence (Fig. 2 A). As described previously (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), saturation with nucleotide virtually completely quenches the fluorescence of the three introduced Î²-Trp-331 residues in Î²Y331W F1 prepared by standard procedures. The same result was obtained here with both Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete Î²Y331W F1. After saturation with nucleotide, the spectra of both enzyme forms were indistinguishable from the one for wild-type F1 shown in Fig. 2 A, indicating that the spectral differences between Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete Î²Y331W F1 are due to an effect of Îµ on the fluorescence of the introduced Î²-Trp-331 residues. 1In Ref. 8Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, quenching (by 16%) of the Trp fluorescence of the Î³-subunit by Îµ was reported. The apparent absence of influence of Îµ on the fluorescence of wild-type F1 suggested by the data reported here indicates that either (a) the Trp residue(s) in Î³ that responds to Îµ does not contribute significantly to the fluorescence of F1or (b) once Î³ is incorporated into F1, its fluorescence is no longer effected by Îµ. Fig. 2 Bshows the Trp fluorescence spectra of Î²-Trp-331 in the absence and presence of Îµ. In the absence and presence of Îµ, the maxima are at 345 and 350 nm, respectively. Thus, in an empty catalytic site, the environment of Î²-Trp-331 is highly polar, especially in the Îµ-containing enzyme. Analysis of spectra generated in an MgADP binding experiment with both types of enzyme showed no significant shift of the respective Î²-Trp-331 spectrum during the titration (data not shown). Thus, the influence of Îµ on Î²-Trp-331 fluorescence is similar in each of the three catalytic sites. Catalytic site occupancy in Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete Î²Y331W F1 is plotted in Fig.3 as a function of substrate MgATP concentration. The conditions in this experiment were the same as those under which the hydrolysis data in Fig. 1 were obtained,i.e. ATP and Mg2+ were present in a constant ratio of 2.5:1. Under these conditions, maximal hydrolysis rates are reached (32Wise J.G. Duncan T.M. Latchney L.R. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In both cases, a binding model assuming three sites of different affinity gave a good fit, withK d1 = 0.02 Î¼m,K d2 = 0.7 Î¼m, andK d3 = 21 Î¼m for Îµ-depleted Î²Y331W F1 andK d1 < 0.01 Î¼m,K d2 = 0.4 Î¼m, andK d3 = 21 Î¼m for the Îµ-replete enzyme. For both enzyme forms,K d3 correlates well withK m(MgATP), demonstrating that all three catalytic sites have to be occupied to obtain rapid (V max) hydrolysis rates. Fig. 4 (symbols) shows relative specific ATPase activity plotted as a function of the fraction of catalytic sites occupied, using the data from Figs. 1 and 3. Of course, the occupancy data on the abscissa are the average over all enzyme molecules. The lines are theoretical curves assuming that only enzyme molecules with all three catalytic sites filled achieve measurable hydrolysis rates (i.e. the catalysis rate of enzyme molecules with only one or two sites filled is zero). These theoretical curves clearly provide very good fits to the actual behavior of both Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete enzymes. A fit of theoretical curves to the measured data points assuming a non-zero activity for enzyme molecules with two filled catalytic sites resulted in nearly identical curves, with a âbi-siteâ activity of 0% ofV max in the absence of Îµ and 1.2% in its presence. As described above, Îµ appears to have little effect on the MgATP affinities of catalytic sites 2 and 3. Under the conditions used in Fig. 3 (a constant ATP/Mg2+ ratio of 2.5:1 to achieve maximal activity), the exact calculation of submicromolar MgATP concentrations is difficult because of uncertainty in assessing the true Mg2+ concentration and dependence on the value ofK d for the Mg2+Â·ATP complex. To overcome this, we repeated the MgATP binding experiments using a constant 2.5 mm Mg2+ concentration, where virtually all ATP is in the metal-complexed form. Fig.5 shows that at low MgATP concentrations, Îµ-replete Î²Y331W F1 has significantly higher affinity for MgATP than the Îµ-depleted enzyme. The K dvalues derived from Fig. 5 indicate that Îµ increases the affinity of site 1 for MgATP by a factor of 6 (K d1 = 0.12 and 0.02 Î¼m in the absence and presence of Îµ, respectively), whereas there is only a small effect on site 2 (K d2 = 2.8 and 1.4 Î¼m, respectively) and no effect on site 3 (K d3 = 23 Î¼m in both cases). The influence of the Îµ-subunit on the affinities for MgADP is shown in Fig. 6. Again, at low ligand concentrations, the Îµ-replete enzyme has a higher affinity for MgADP than the Îµ-depleted form. The data were fitted well using a model with two classes of binding sites. The calculated K dvalues for the Îµ-replete enzyme wereK d1 = 0.06 Î¼m andK d2 = 19 Î¼m, with 1.0 sites of class 1 and 1.7 sites of class 2. The respective values for Îµ-depleted F1 were K d1 = 0.7 Î¼m (0.9 sites) and K d2= 25 Î¼m (1.9 sites). Thus, Îµ increases the MgADP binding affinity of catalytic site 1 by â¼10-fold, whereas the affinities of sites 2 and 3 are not significantly affected. No significant effect of Îµ on the binding affinities for free ATP and ADP was detected. In all cases, a model with a single type of binding site gave a satisfactory fit. For ATP, K d was 41 Î¼m (2.7 sites) in the absence of Îµ and 53 Î¼m (2.8 sites) in its presence. For ADP, the respective values were 63 Î¼m (2.5 sites) and 85 Î¼m(2.9 sites). The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of Îµ on the nucleotide binding affinities of the catalytic sites of F1-ATPase, using a specific fluorescence probe for catalytic site occupancy, Î²-Trp-331. Previously, we had shown that the Î²Y331W mutation did not affect the enzymatic properties; Î²Y331W F1 and F1F0 are fully competent in ATP hydrolysis and synthesis (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20LoÌbau S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10846-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we first demonstrated that the interaction between Î²Y331W F1 and the Îµ-subunit, with K d â¼ 1 nm, is very similar to that found in the wild-type enzyme (8Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tuttas-DoÌrschug R. Hanstein W.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5107-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and that, as in wild-type F1 (8Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Îµ reduced the ATPase activity of Î²Y331W F1 by â¼90%. Îµ did not affect the binding of free ATP or ADP to any of the catalytic sites. For magnesium-nucleotide binding, the only pronounced effects were at the high-affinity catalytic site 1, where the affinity for MgADP and MgATP was â¼10-fold higher in the Îµ-replete than in the Îµ-depleted form of the enzyme (Figs. 5 and 6). One reason for this difference could be a reduced off-rate for the magnesium-nucleotide complex in the presence of Îµ. Interestingly, previous work from one of our laboratories (34Dunn S.D. Zadorozny V.D. Tozer R.G. Orr L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that release of product Pifrom Îµ-replete F1 in âuni-site catalysisâ,i.e. under conditions where only the high-affinity site is filled with substrate, was reduced by a similar factor compared with that from the Îµ-depleted enzyme. The results presented here support the conclusion that the Îµ-subunit decelerates a conformational change step that is necessary to release ligands from the high-affinity binding site. In Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete Î²Y331W F1, a single K m value of 20â30 Î¼m was sufficient to describe the substrate concentration dependence of enzymatic activity (Fig. 1), and in both cases,K m clearly corresponded toK d3, i.e. theK d for MgATP at the low-affinity site 3. A re-plot of the data (Fig. 4) confirmed that in both Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete Î²Y331W F1, only enzyme molecules that have all three catalytic sites filled contribute significantly to the measured hydrolytic activity (âtri-site catalysisâ). In earlier reports using wild-type E. coli F1, a second, lower K m was found (34Dunn S.D. Zadorozny V.D. Tozer R.G. Orr L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Al-Shawi M.K. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19633-19639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was ascribed to turnover due to enzyme molecules with two filled catalytic sites. However, neither the higher nor the lower K mwas significantly affected by the presence or absence of Îµ (34Dunn S.D. Zadorozny V.D. Tozer R.G. Orr L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), consistent with the findings here thatK d3 andK d2 for MgATP are similar in the Îµ-depleted and Îµ-replete enzymes. The fact that substantial bi-site activity was not detected in the current work or in a previous study (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is likely due to differences in experimental protocol. Bi-site catalysis was evident when we investigated the hydrolysis of MgTNP-ATP2 by Î²Y331W F1. For this substrate, two K m values were required to describe the enzymatic activity adequately, and the lower K m corresponded extremely well toK d2 (36Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). What should be emphasized, however, is that even in the cases where bi-site activity is described, tri-site activity is clearly the physiologically relevant working mode of the enzyme in the Îµ-replete or Îµ-depleted enzyme. It is intriguing that the Îµ-induced increase in affinity and the reduction of the product release rate from the high-affinity site are by a factor (â¼10-fold) similar to that for the decrease in the multi-site hydrolysis rate in the presence of Îµ, suggesting that the two events might be closely connected. According to the model for multi-site hydrolysis recently proposed by two of us (3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 37Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33210-33215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), MgADP release from the low-affinity site 3 is rate-limiting. The fact that the Îµ-subunit influences the fluorescence spectrum of the Î²-Trp-331 residues in all three catalytic sites in a similar manner (Fig. 2) shows that the long-range interactions between Îµ and the catalytic sites are not restricted to any single site, but are of a more global nature. Also, it may be noted in this context that according to GruÌber and Capaldi (38GruÌber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the Î²-subunit to which Îµ can be cross-linked is neither the one that carries catalytic site 1 nor the one that carries site 3, but the one containing the medium-affinity site 2. Thus, Îµ may affect product release from the low-affinity site 3 by a mechanism similar to that responsible for reduction of uni-site product release. As K d3(MgADP) is essentially identical in the absence and presence of Îµ, fromK d =k off/k on it follows that a 10-fold increase in the product off-rate in the absence of Îµ would have to be accompanied by a similar increase in the on-rate. Such parallel changes in kinetic constants are not unprecedented in F1. K d1 for binding of MgADP and MgAMP-PNP is â¼0.1 Î¼m; however,k on (and consequently,k off) for MgAMP-PNP is â¼2 orders of magnitude less that that for MgADP (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further experiments will be necessary to determine the kinetics of each of the individual reaction steps in multi-site catalysis and the detailed inhibitory mechanism of Îµ. Finally, it is worthwhile to reexamine previous experimental data obtained with Î²Y331W F1 (reviewed in Ref. 3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) in light of the results of the present study. As judged from the specific activities (5.9 units/mg at 23 Â°C and 13 units/mg at 30 Â°C) (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), from the MgATP and MgADP binding affinities at site 1 (0.028 and 0.08 Î¼m at 2.5 mm Mg2+) (39Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7052-7058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as well as from the wavelength position of the Î²-Trp-331 fluorescence spectrum (Î»max = 349 nm) (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme prepared by the standard procedure in our laboratory is largely (>90%) Îµ-replete, and due to the relatively high concentration of enzyme used (â¥50 nm), it remains Îµ-replete in both hydrolysis and nucleotide binding assays. On the other hand, it appears that some degree of Îµ-depletion can occur as a result of the nucleotide depletion procedure involving Sephadex G-50 gel filtration in 50% (v/v) glycerol-containing buffer. Such nucleotide-depleted Î²Y331W F1 has a specific activity of 9.4 units/mg (at room temperature) andK d1(MgADP) = 0.14 Î¼m (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that up to 20% of the enzyme molecules may not contain Îµ."

Among the mutant strains that contained PSI proteins, the H595C/L596I, Q627H/L628C/I629S, and N638C/N639S mutants showed similar levels of PSI-mediated electron transfer activity when either cytochrome c 6 or an artificial electron donor was used. In contrast, cytochromec 6 could not function as an electron donor to the W622C/A623R mutant, even though the PSI activity mediated by an artificial electron donor was detected in this mutant. Thus, the W622C/A623R mutation affected the interaction of the PSI complex with cytochrome c 6.

The PsaA and PsaB subunits form the heterodimeric core that harbors most of the antenna chlorophyll a molecules, Î²-carotenes, the primary electron donor P700, and a chain of electron acceptors (A0, A1, and FX). In addition to the core proteins, the cyanobacterial PSI complex contains three peripheral proteins (PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE) and six integral membrane proteins (PsaF, PsaI, PsaJ, PsaK, PsaL, and PsaM) (1Chitnis P.R.

The interaction of plastocyanin with plant and algal PSI complexes shows a fast kinetic step, which can be attributed to a multistep reaction mechanism of electron transfer (18Haehnel W. Propper A. Krause H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 384-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Bottin H. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6453-6460Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some cyanobacteria have a simpler one-step bimolecular collision mechanism (20Hervas M. Navarro J.A. Diaz A. Bottin H.

Cross-linking studies have indicated that plastocyanin can be cross-linked to the N-terminal lysine-rich region of chloroplast PsaF, which is not found in cyanobacterial PsaF (22Hippler M.

Thus, the interaction between plastocyanin and plant PSI includes initial electrostatic interactions between the N-terminal domain of PsaF and the conserved negative patches of plastocyanin. However, the PsaF subunit of PSI is not required in the interaction with plastocyanin in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (13Chitnis P.R. Purvis D. Nelson N. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1141: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The deletion of PsaF in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii did not abolish the electron transfer from plastocyanin to P700 (25Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6contact the PsaA and PsaB core proteins directly. The luminal extramembrane loops of PsaA and PsaB are likely candidates for interaction with plastocyanin during electron transfer. In the crystal structure of PSI, the luminal side of PSI is flat with a 10-â« protrusion beyond the membrane boundary (8KrauÃ N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. KrauÃ N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). There is a 3-nm deep indentation in the center, perhaps caused by a partial separation between PsaA and PsaB. In the structural modeling, the dimensions of plastocyanin matched well inside this cavity (26Fromme P. Schubert W.-D. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Boekema E.J. Boonstra A.F. Dekker J.P. RoÌgner M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Near the luminal indentation, the two surface Î±-helices l and lâ² are parallel to the membrane plane and are located near the P700 chlorophyll a dimer (8KrauÃ N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. KrauÃ N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The l andlâ² helices are analogous to similar surface helices in the purple bacterial reaction center (26Fromme P. Schubert W.-D. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Deisenhofer J. Michel H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The l andlâ² helices are in the extramembrane J loops that are located between the transmembrane k and m helices of the core proteins (see Ref. 29Sun J. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Jin P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21793-21802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar for the topology of PSI core proteins and nomenclature of loops). We postulate that these helices interact with plastocyanin during electron transfer. To investigate the role of the J loops in the assembly and function of the PSI complex and in the interaction with the electron donors, we generated cysteine-scanning multipoint mutations in conserved amino acids in the J loop of the PsaB protein. A residue was changed to a cysteinyl residue in each of the mutations. Such an approach has been used to study the topographical features of membrane proteins (30Altenbach C. Flitsch S.L. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7806-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 31He M.M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12909-12914Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced into a psaB deletion strain ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Here we present the biochemical characterization of the mutant strains. Strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were cultured in BG-11 medium with appropriate antibiotics (30 mg/liter chloramphenicol or 40 mg/liter kanamycin) at 30 Â°C. For autotrophic growth, cells were grown in BG-11 medium under medium light intensity of 40 Î¼molÂ·mâ2Â·sâ1. For heterotrophic growth, cells were grown in BG-11 supplemented with 5 mmglucose under low light intensity of 5 Î¼molÂ·mâ2Â·sâ1. Cells were harvested at the late exponential growth phase. Previously published methods were used for isolation of thylakoid membranes and purification of trimeric PSI complexes with DM (32Sun J. Ke A. Jin P. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll a concentration (33Arnon D. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1949; 24: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the carotene concentration (34Furr H.C. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. Leenheer A.P.D. Lambert W.E. Nelis H.J. Modern Chromatographic Analysis of Vitamins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 1-71Google Scholar) were estimated according to previously published methods. For mutagenesis in the C-terminal region of the PsaB protein of Synechocystissp. PCC 6803, a PSI-less recipient strain (LKC) was generated by replacing a 1187-base pair 3â²-coding region of the psaB gene (the HindIIIâEcoRI fragment) with a cassette for kanamycin resistance (Fig. 1). For this purpose, we constructed a plasmid that contained the kanamycin resistance gene cassette and an 843-base pair 3â²-flanking region downstream of the psaB gene. Upstream from the resistance cartridge, the plasmid contained a 2703-base pairAccIâHindIII fragment that includes most of thepsaA gene, the 5â²-region of the psaB gene, and the untranslated region between the psaA and psaBgenes. The plasmid was introduced into a PSI-less strain, which has a partial deletion of psaA and psaB genes and is capable of heterotrophic growth under low light intensity (35Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F.J. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 429-432Google Scholar, 36Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The resulting kanamycin-resistant recipient strain is capable of heterotrophic growth under low light intensity. To introduce the WT and mutant psaB genes into the recipient strain, we constructed the p3C+ recombinant plasmid. In this plasmid, a 1587-base pair SmaIâEcoRI fragment of the psaBgene (including the 3â²-coding region of psaB), a chloramphenicol resistance gene, and the 3â²-flanking region were cloned into the polylinker of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) (Fig. 1). All PsaB mutants were generated by a polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutation technique (37Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers contained a PstI or an NsiI restriction endonuclease recognition site. The mutated recombinant plasmids were sequenced completely to ensure the presence of desired changes and the absence of errors by Taq DNA polymerase. The DNAs were used to transform the recipient strain LKC. The p3C+ plasmid with the WT gene was introduced back into the LKC strain to yield the recovered wild-type (RWT) strain that was used as the positive control in these studies. The transformation was performed at 30 Â°C under heterotrophic growth conditions as described (38Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were selected, segregated for three generations, and replica-plated to confirm the absence of the kanamycin resistance gene. After segregation, the chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were cultured in liquid BG-11 medium, and the genomic DNA was isolated. Integration of the chloramphenicol resistance gene into the genome of the mutant strains was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of appropriate fragments using genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the corresponding polymerase chain reaction fragments was determined to confirm mutations. Cell counting showed that number of cells perA 730 nm is the same (5.5 Ã 107cellsÂ·A 730 nmâ1Â·mlâ1) for both the RWT and LKC cultures. A 730 nm was measured using a UV-160U spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and was used as a measure of cell count to monitor the growth of the mutant strains and in normalizing other characteristics of the mutant strains. Accumulation of PSI proteins was examined by analytical SDS-PAGE and immunodetection (29Sun J. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Jin P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21793-21802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The antibodies that were used for immunodetection have been described previously (32Sun J. Ke A. Jin P. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The P700 content was estimated by the measurement of photoinduced absorbance changes at 820 nm (20Hervas M. Navarro J.A. Diaz A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 39Mathis P. Setif P. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 316-320Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mutant PSI complexes were modified by biotin-maleimide according to a previously published method (32Sun J. Ke A. Jin P. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The PSII activity of Synechocystis cells was measured as light-driven oxygen evolution in which electrons are transferred from water to p-benzoquinone via the PSII complex. The PSI activity was monitored by oxygen uptake with the Mehler reaction (40Mehler A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1951; 33: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar,41Mehler A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1951; 34: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) using the artificial electron carriers DAD and MV (32Sun J. Ke A. Jin P. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this reaction, ascorbate reduces DAD, which in turn donates electrons to P700. Light-driven PSI electron transfer reduces MV. The oxidation of the reduced MV consumes oxygen. Alternatively, the PSI activity in the membrane can be measured by oxygen uptake with 15 Î¼mcytochrome c 6 replacing DAD as the electron donor. The PSI activity in the membrane was also determined from NADP+ photoreduction assays using cytochromec 6 and ferredoxin as the electron donor and acceptor of the PSI complex, respectively (32Sun J. Ke A. Jin P. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These activities were normalized on an equal cell basis. In the crystal structure of the PSI complex, a pair of surface helices (land lâ²) are present in the extramembrane J loops. The secondary structure prediction using the Garnier algorithm (42Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar) indicated a putative Î±-helix in the J loop of PsaB from Met-614 to Tyr-632 (Fig. 2). This peptide fragment is highly conserved among the PsaB proteins from higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. This region also shows high homology between the PsaA and PsaB proteins. Besides the putative helix, several other amino acid residues in the J loop are also conserved among PsaB proteins from different sources and between the PsaA and PsaB proteins. We targeted these conserved residues in the mutagenesis experiments and generated eight multipoint mutations in the J loop of the PsaB protein (Fig.2). The PSI-less LKC cells were more blue than the WT cells due to the reduced level of chlorophyll while retaining phycobilisomes (36Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). During segregation, the RWT strain as well as the SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, SJ6, and SJ8 mutant strains formed green colonies, whereas the SJ3, SJ5, and SJ7 mutant strains formed bluish colonies that resembled the recipient LKC strain. The RWT, LKC, and mutant strains were cultured under photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions, and the increase in cell density was measured (Table I). All strains grew heterotrophically with similar doubling time, ranging from 27 to 30 h, indicating their similar abilities to utilize externally supplied glucose under low light intensity. Therefore, the respiratory system was not affected in the mutant strains. Under photoautotrophic growth conditions, cells of the LKC, SJ3, SJ5, SJ7, and SJ8 strains either died or did not grow. The RWT and SJ6 cells had the fastest growth, whereas the SJ1, SJ2, and SJ4 cells grew slower than the RWT cells. Therefore, all mutations, except for the amino acid replacements in SJ6, affected the autotrophic growth of the mutant strain. These differences in the autotrophic growth rates could result from the effects of mutations on the photosynthetic activity.Table ICharacterization of the mutant cellsStrainsDoubling timePigment contentPhotosynthetic activityHeterotrophicAutotrophicChlorophyllCarotenePSIIPSIhÎ¼g Â· A730 nm â1 Â· ml â1nmol O2 Â· A730 nm â1 Â· h â1LKC30âaâ, these strains died or did not grow.0.730.325760RWT27541.290.83688â237SJ127701.190.79685â260SJ227810.990.63743â89SJ328â0.850.45668â4SJ4271721.020.72787â62SJ528â0.750.396920SJ627541.040.70686â124SJ728â0.880.44727â5SJ828â0.890.55730â19a â, these strains died or did not grow. Open table in a new tab The chlorophyll and carotene contents of these strains were measured using the cells that had been grown under heterotrophic conditions (Table I). The LKC cells had the lowest content, whereas the RWT cells contained the highest content of these pigments. Among the mutant strains, the bluish SJ3, SJ5, and SJ7 strains had relatively low chlorophyll and carotene content, whereas the other strains showed higher chlorophyll/cell and carotene/cell ratios. Therefore, the color of the mutant cells correlates to their pigment content, which in turn may reflect the change of the abundance of the pigment-binding proteins. The strains that were able to grow photoautotrophically were green strains containing relatively high pigment content. Thus, the mutations might affect the photosystem complexes, which are the major pigment-binding proteins. The impact of mutations on the photosystem activity in the mutant strains was studied by oxygen measurement. The PSII and PSI activities in the intact cells were measured by oxygen evolution and uptake with the artificial electron carriers, respectively (Table I). The photosynthetic activities were normalized on an equal cell basis. The PSII activity of the 10 strains ranged from 576 to 787 nmol of O2Â·A 730 nmâ1Â·hâ1, which was 84â114% of the RWT level. Therefore, the PSII activity was not affected substantially by the mutations in the PsaB protein. As expected, the PSI-less LKC strain contained no PSI activity, whereas the RWT cells had an activity of â237 nmol of O2Â·A 730 nmâ1Â·hâ1. The lack of PSI activity in the SJ3, SJ5, and SJ7 mutant strains was consistent with their inability to grow autotrophically. The SJ8 mutant strain contained only 8% of the RWT activity, which might not be sufficient for autotrophic growth. The SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, and SJ6 mutant strains showed different levels of PSI activity with various autotrophic growth rates. The changes of PSI activity in the mutant strains may result from the effect of the mutations on the assembly and/or function of PSI. To test these possibilities, we examined the accumulation and function of the PSI complexes in the thylakoid membranes. PsaB is an integral membrane protein with 11 transmembrane helices. Mutations in the PsaB protein could disturb protein folding and affect the assembly of the PSI complex. We performed Western blotting to estimate the steady-state levels of PSI proteins in the membranes. Thylakoid membranes were isolated from mutant strains, and their proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection was performed with polyclonal antibodies against PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaF, PsaI, PsaK, or PsaL (Fig.3). The results were consistent on all seven Western blots. As expected, no PSI protein was detected in the LKC membranes, whereas the RWT membranes contained PSI proteins. PSI proteins were not detected in SJ3, SJ5, and SJ7 membranes, consistent with the lack of PSI activity in these cells. Therefore, the SJ3, SJ5, and SJ7 mutations abolished the accumulation of PSI proteins in the membrane. The absence of PSI proteins in the SJ3, SJ5, and SJ7 mutants resulted in their inability to grow autotrophically and the blue color of the cells. PSI proteins were detected in the SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, SJ6, and SJ8 mutants at varying levels that were less than the RWT level. Therefore, the mutations in the SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, SJ6, and SJ8 strains allowed some accumulation of PSI proteins in the membrane. To study the effect of mutations on the photosynthetic function of the accumulated PSI complexes, the SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, SJ6, and SJ8 mutant membranes were subjected to functional analysis. The active P700 reaction centers in the intact thylakoid membranes were measured by laser-induced changes in the absorbance at 820 nm and were normalized on an equal cell basis (TableII). The active P700 reaction centers in the DM extracts were also measured to investigate the stability of the reaction centers (Table II). The PSI photosynthetic activity was determined with different sets of electron donors and acceptors: DAD/MV, cytochrome c 6/MV, and cytochromec 6/ferredoxin. The DAD/MV PSI activity, which was measured by oxygen uptake with an excess of the artificial electron donor (DAD) and acceptor (MV), excludes the limitation by interprotein recognition and docking on both sides of the membrane and therefore indicates the efficiency of electron transfer within the PSI complex. When cytochrome c 6 replaces DAD as the electron donor of PSI in the oxygen uptake measurements, the cytochromec 6/MV PSI activity reflects both the electron transfer rate within the PSI complex and the interaction between cytochrome c 6 and the PSI complex. The PSI-mediated NADP+ photoreduction uses cytochromec 6 and ferredoxin as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Thus, the cytochromec 6/ferredoxin PSI activity includes the electron transfer activity and the interaction between the PSI complex and the soluble proteins on both sides of the membrane. The difference between the DAD/MV and the cytochrome c 6/MV PSI activities indicates an impact on the interaction between the PSI complex and cytochrome c 6. Similarly, the difference between the cytochrome c 6/MV and the cytochrome c 6/ferredoxin PSI activities indicates the effect on the interaction between the PSI complex and ferredoxin. In all mutant membranes, the cytochromec 6/MV and the cytochromec 6/ferredoxin PSI activities were at a similar percentage of the RWT level. Thus, the mutations on the luminal loop did not affect the interaction between the PSI complex and ferredoxin on the cytoplasmic side.Table IICharacterization of the mutant photosynthetic membranesStrainsLevel of active P700PSI photosynthetic activityMembraneDM extractDAD/MVCytochromec 6/MVCytochrome c 6/ferredoxinnmol Â· A730 nm â1 Â· h â1RWT10095100100100(6.91 Ã 104P700/cell)(â237)(â326)(49)SJ144261104458SJ229293800SJ42326262328SJ64535524456SJ8108800The results were normalized on an equal cell basis and are expressed as a percentage of the RWT level that is shown in parentheses. The level of P700 in the DM extract is expressed as a percentage of the RWT level in the membrane. Open table in a new tab The results were normalized on an equal cell basis and are expressed as a percentage of the RWT level that is shown in parentheses. The level of P700 in the DM extract is expressed as a percentage of the RWT level in the membrane. The SJ1 and SJ6 mutations were located in the two ends of the J loop. These two mutants had higher autotrophic growth rates than the other mutants. They both contained active P700 and cytochromec 6/MV PSI activity at the same percentage of the RWT level. However, 41% active P700 in the intact membrane of the SJ1 mutant was lost after DM extraction. Therefore, the P700 reaction centers of the SJ1 mutant were labile to detergent extraction, suggesting an impact of the mutation on the packing of helices in the membrane. We reported earlier that proteolysis of the extramembrane loops facilitates the access of the small artificial electron carriers to the electron transfer centers in the PSI complex, resulting in an increase in the DAD/MV PSI activity (29Sun J. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Jin P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21793-21802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The SJ1 mutation might change the packing of the transmembrane k helix that is adjacent to the P700 reaction center, which may favor the access of small DAD molecules to the P700 reaction center. Consistent with this postulate, we observed high DAD/MV PSI activity in the SJ1 mutant. Similarly, the SJ6 mutant also lost 22% active P700 reaction centers upon DM extraction. With less loss of active P700, the SJ6 mutant did not show such a dramatic increase in the DAD/MV PSI activity as the SJ1 mutant. The SJ6 mutation may have less impact on the packing of transmembrane helices than the SJ1 mutation. In summary, the SJ1 and SJ6 mutations affected the accumulation of PSI proteins in the membrane and the packing of helices around P700, but did not interrupt the interaction between the PSI complex and cytochromec 6. The SJ2, SJ4, and SJ8 mutations were located in the middle of the J loop. These mutants grew slowly or did not grow under autotrophic growth conditions. Upon extraction by DM, the SJ2, SJ4, and SJ8 extracts maintained a similar level of active P700 reaction centers as in their intact membranes. Therefore, the SJ2, SJ4, and SJ8 mutations did not affect the conformation around the P700 reaction center. Among them, the SJ4 mutant contained similar levels of active P700, DAD/MV PSI activity, and cytochrome c 6/MV PSI activity, which were about one-fourth of the RWT level. Therefore, the SJ4 mutation decreased greatly the accumulation of PSI proteins in the membrane, but did not affect the interaction of the PSI complex with cytochrome c 6. In contrast, the SJ2 mutant contained 29% active P700 and 38% DAD/MV PSI activity of the RWT level, but neither cytochrome c 6/MV nor cytochrome c 6/ferredoxin electron transfer activity was detected in the SJ2 mutant membranes. Therefore, the SJ2 mutation affected the interaction between the PSI complex and cytochrome c 6. It reduced the accumulation of PSI complexes, but did not affect the conformation around P700. The slow autotrophic growth of the SJ2 mutant in the absence of cytochromec 6-mediated PSI activity may be due to the electron transfer from plastocyanin or a third electron donor as indicated in an earlier study (43Zhang L. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5036-5042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the SJ2 mutant, the SJ8 mutant membrane contained no cytochrome c 6/MV PSI activity, even though active P700 and the DAD/MV PSI activity were detected in the SJ8 mutant. Therefore, the SJ8 mutation greatly decreased the accumulation of the PSI complexes and might have interrupted the interaction of the PSI complex with cytochromec 6. The PsaA and PsaB proteins in the WT complexes could not be modified by biotin-maleimide (Fig. 4), which specifically reacts with the sulfhydryl group of cysteinyl residues. Therefore, the cysteinyl residues of the WT PsaA and PsaB proteins were not exposed on the surface of PSI complexes. To study the topology of the J loop, we changed one amino acid to a cysteinyl residue in each of the eight mutations. PSI complexes from the SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, SJ6, SJ8, and RWT strains were purified and treated with biotin-maleimide. The biotin-maleimide-treated PSI complexes were resolved by Tricine/urea/SDS-PAGE, probed with peroxidase-conjugated avidin, and then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Fig. 4). WT PsaAB could not be modified by biotin-maleimide. When the WT PSI complexes were incubated with SDS to denature the proteins, we could detect modification of the PsaAB proteins by biotin-maleimide. A small amount of RWT PsaAB proteins was labeled by biotin-maleimide, which might be due to partial unfolding in a small fraction of the PSI complexes during the preparation. The SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, SJ6, and SJ8 PSI complexes were modified by biotin-maleimide. Therefore, the cysteinyl residues introduced in these strains were exposed on the surface, suggesting that the corresponding residues in the WT PsaB protein (His-595, Trp-622, Leu-628, Tyr-632, and Asn-638) may be exposed on the surface of the PSI complex. To study the effect of the biotin-maleimide modification on PSI function, the cytochrome c 6/ferredoxin PSI activity was measured after the modification and expressed as a percentage of the RWT level. The cytochromec 6/ferredoxin activities of modified PSI complexes from mutant strains were reduced substantially from their levels before modification. SJ1 was reduced from 58 to 34%, SJ4 was reduced from 28 to 11%, and SJ6 was reduced from 56 to 26% of the activity of the modified RWT membranes. Therefore, the modification of residues in the J loop by biotin-maleimide may interfere with the interaction of the PSI complex with the electron donor cytochromec 6, providing further support for an interaction between the exposed surface of the J loop and cytochromec 6. The PSI complex accepts electrons from plastocyanin or cytochromec 6 on the luminal side of the thylakoid membrane. Examination of the structures of plastocyanin and cytochromec 6 revealed the presence of a flat hydrophobic surface around the redox center in both proteins (44Navarro J.A. Hervas M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 11-12Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Frazao C. Soares C.M. Carrondo M.A. Pohl E. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hervas M. Navarroo J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Sheldrick G.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These flat hydrophobic surfaces are essential for the electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome c 6 to PSI (12Haehnel W. Jansen T. Gause K. Klosgen R.B. Stahl B. Michl D. Huvermann B. Karas M. Herrmann R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 46Sigfridsson K. Young S. Hansson O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Correct hydrophobic interactions are expected to ensure the accurate orientation of plastocyanin or cytochrome c 6 on the PSI complex. Therefore, the two surface Î±-helices land lâ² and other amino acid residues in the J loops of the core proteins might provide the site for interaction with plastocyanin or cytochrome c 6. We tested this hypothesis by generating mutations in the J loop of PsaB. Replacement of conserved residues in the J loop affected levels of PSI proteins in the membranes to varying degrees. The decreased accumulation of PSI proteins in the mutant membranes could result from several factors. A mutation might disturb the assembly of the mutant PsaB protein into the thylakoid membrane or cause a rapid turnover of the mutant PsaB protein. The mutation might affect the interaction between PsaB and other PSI subunits and result in fast degradation of PSI complexes. Since the deletion of PsaF, PsaL, PsaI, and PsaJ subunits did not affect the accumulation of PsaA and PsaB proteins (14Xu Q. Yu L. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Xu Q. Hoppe D. Chitnis V.P. Odom W.R. Guikema J.A. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11678-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the decreased accumulation of PSI proteins in the mutant strains is likely due to the decreased accumulation of the PsaB protein. The SJ3, SJ5, and SJ7 mutants did not allow accumulation of detectable levels of PSI proteins in the membranes. These mutations are located in the region between Ser-600 and Trp-616. Therefore, this peptide fragment is important for the stability of the PsaB protein in the membrane. Biotin-maleimide modification of the SJ1, SJ2, SJ4, SJ6, and SJ8 PSI complexes indicated that His-595, Trp-622, Leu-628, Tyr-632, and Asn-638 in WT PsaB might be exposed on the surface of the PSI complex. Mutations of the surface-exposed residues had a less destabilizing effect on the PsaB protein than the changes in the buried residues. For this reason, we propose that the l helix is exposed on the surface of the J loop, whereas the peptide fragment from Ser-600 to Trp-616 may fold underneath the helix. Upon extraction by DM, the SJ1 and SJ6 mutants lost some active P700 reaction centers, suggesting an impact of mutations on the packing of transmembrane helices around P700. Other mutants maintained their active P700 after detergent extraction. The SJ1 and SJ6 mutations are located in the ends of J loop and close to the ends of the transmembrane k and m helices. Therefore, the amino acid residues at the junction of the transmembrane helix and extramembrane loop might be important for the packing of transmembrane helices. The SJ2, SJ4, and SJ8 mutations were predicted to be located in thel helix. When we viewed the l helix as a wheel diagram, Trp-622, Leu-628, and Tyr-632 were aligned on one side of the helical wheel that is largely hydrophobic. These residues were determined exposed to solvent in the WT PSI complex (Fig. 4). This hydrophobic side of the l helix, containing Trp-622, Leu-628, and Tyr-632, may provide a surface for the hydrophobic interaction with plastocyanin/cytochrome c 6. The SJ2 and SJ8 membranes contained no cytochromec 6/MV and cytochromec 6/ferredoxin PSI activities, but maintained DAD/MV PSI activity. Therefore, the SJ2 and SJ8 mutations maintained electron transfer activity, but failed in interacting with cytochromec 6. The SJ2 and SJ8 mutants maintained their active P700 reaction centers upon detergent extraction, indicating no impact on the conformation around P700 by the mutations. Therefore, the observed interruption of the PSI interaction with cytochromec 6 in the SJ2 and SJ8 mutants is likely due to the amino acid replacement. In each of these two mutants, a large aromatic residue was replaced with the smaller cysteinyl residue. In contrast, the SJ4 membrane maintained similar levels of PSI proteins, active P700, and PSI activities and did not interrupt the interaction between the PSI complex and cytochrome c 6. In the SJ4 mutation, a leucinyl residue was changed to a cysteinyl residue. However, when the SJ4 PSI complexes were modified by biotin-maleimide with dramatic structural change, the PSI NADP+ photoreduction activity was reduced substantially. The physical structure of the hydrophobic side of the lhelix is important for the interaction of the PSI complex with cytochrome c 6. Therefore, our results show that the hydrophobic side of the l helix of the PsaB protein that contains Trp-622, Leu-628, and Tyr-632 provides the site of interaction with cytochrome c 6.

https://openalex.org/W2016226807,"Recent work suggests that the masking of the activation domain (AD) of yeast transactivator Leu3p, observed in the absence of the metabolic signal Î±-isopropylmalate, is an intramolecular event. Much of the evidence came from the construction and analysis of a mutant form of Leu3p (Leu3-dd) whose AD is permanently masked (Wang, D., Hu, Y., Zheng, F., Zhou, K., and Kohlhaw, G. B. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19383â19392). In a modified two-hybrid experiment, the ADs of both wild type Leu3p and Leu3-dd were shown to interact with the remainder of the Leu3 protein, in an Î±-isopropylmalate-dependent manner. The finding that masking and unmasking proceed apparently normally when full-length Leu3p is expressed in mammalian cells is also consistent with the notion of intramolecular masking. Here we report on the identification of nine missense mutations (all of them suppressors of the Leu3-dd phenotype) that cause permanent unmasking of Leu3p. The nine mutations map to three short segments located within a 140-residue-long region of the C-terminal part of the middle region of Leu3p. These segments may be part of a spatial trap for the AD. We also performed âdomain swapsâ between Leu3p and Cha4p, a serine/threonine-responsive activator that, like Leu3p, belongs to the family of Zn(II)2Cys6 proteins. We show that AD masking and response to the appropriate metabolic signal only occur when a given AD remains attached to its own middle region; middle region swapping results in constitutively active proteins. Finally, we show that the extent to which Leu3p regulates reporter gene expression depends on the intracellular concentration of Leu3p. The possible physiological significance of this observation is discussed in light of the known regulation of Leu3p by Gcn4p.

DNA binding domain activation domain middle region isopropylmalate upstream activating sequence in the promoters of Leu3p-regulated genes wild type polymerase chain reaction base pair heme regulatory domains Transcriptional regulation of polymerase II-transcribed genes often depends on the intracellular concentration of signal molecules such as hormones or metabolites. Accordingly, transactivators serving as signal transducers need to be equipped not only with DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains but need to also have sites that interact with ligands (either directly or through auxiliary proteins) and structural features that allow appropriate conformational changes to take place in response to ligand binding and ligand dissociation. A prominent example is the nuclear receptor superfamily whose members regulate gene expression in response to steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoids, and vitamin D (1Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 2Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not produce such receptors, many of its transactivators also display the modular construction (domains arranged along the primary structure) seen with the nuclear receptors. Leu3p is a case in point. It belongs to a family of proteins characterized by an N-terminal DNA binding domain (DB)1 of the Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear cluster type. This family encompasses at least 79 fungal proteins, including at least a dozen transactivators (3Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encoding Leu3p indicates a monomer length of 886 residues (4Zhou K. Brisco P.R.G.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2708-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Leu3p exists as a dimer, both in the presence and absence of DNA (6Sze J.-Y. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2505-2512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Remboutsika E. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5547-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It recognizes the sequence 5â²-CCGN4CGG-3â² (8Hellauer K. Rochon M.H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Binding of full-length Leu3p causes the target DNA to bend, with an apparent flexure angle of 46o. 2H. Guo and G. B. Kohlhaw, unpublished results. The Zn(II)2Cys6 cluster extends from residue 37 to 67. Heptad repeats, thought to be essential for dimerization, are located between residues 85 and 102. The AD had early on been found to be located within the C-terminal 30 residues and to function when fused directly to a DNA binding domain (9Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17409-17412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study showed that as few as 9 of the 30 C-terminal residues suffice to allow substantial transcriptional activation (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This core AD contains three acidic and four hydrophobic residues. In agreement with the functional mapping that placed the DB close to the N terminus and the AD close to the C terminus of Leu3p, large portions of the middle region could be deleted with only minor effects on DNA binding or transcriptional activation (11Zhou K. Bai Y. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Friden P. Reynolds C. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such deletions did, however, create constitutive molecules,i.e. eliminated the response of Leu3p to Î±-IPM, thereby suggesting that the middle region was essential for the modulation process. The finding that Leu3p exhibited perfectly normal regulatory behavior when expressed in mammalian cells (13Guo H. Kohlhaw G.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was consistent with the notion that masking of the activation domain in the absence of Î±-IPM and its unmasking in the presence of Î±-IPM did not require extraneous factors but were intramolecular events. This idea was supported by a recent analysis of the mechanism of masking (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Permutation of the AD revealed the presence of two types of residues as follows: those that, when mutated, appear to loosen the masking interactions (e.g. W864A, S866P, V869F, F882Y, and P884A), and those that tighten the interactions when mutated (e.g. D872N and D874N). When the latter two aspartates were simultaneously changed to asparagines, the resulting mutant (designated Leu3-dd) was permanently masked (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Leu3-dd, like all Leu3p mutants with an impaired AD, caused repression of LEU2 expression and severely reduced cell growth in the absence of leucine. A selection for intragenic suppressors of the Leu3-dd phenotype yielded a number of mutations, all of which mapped to the C-terminal half of the middle region of Leu3p. Transfer of the suppressor mutations to wild type Leu3p caused constitutivity, i.e. such mutants were active irrespective of the presence or absence of Î±-IPM, a result consistent with an involvement of the affected residues in masking (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present work, nine individual constitutivity-causing residues are identified. Remarkably, they map to three very short regions between positions 604 and 741 and may form the spatial backbone for AD masking. These results leave a large segment of Leu3p (encompassing residues 174â603) unaccounted for as far as function is concerned. It is not clear at this point whether this segment is involved in Î±-IPM binding or signal transmission or represents a âspacerâ that improves stability and/or efficiency of the protein, as has been suggested for Gal4p where a similarly large deletion was shown to have little effect on the regulatory properties of the protein (14Ding W.V. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2538-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The âdispensableâ segment of Gal4p and the corresponding segment of Leu3p contain a region of weak homology that is present in most Zn(II)2Cys6 cluster proteins (3Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). There has been no unambiguous assignment of function to this region, either. In addition to identifying residues potentially involved in AD masking, we show here that the modulation function of Leu3p is activator-specific and that the degree of activation by Leu3p is Leu3p concentration-dependent. The latter observation is of special interest since the intracellular level of Leu3p is, at least in part, controlled by Gcn4p, a major regulator of amino acid metabolism in S. cerevisiae (4Zhou K. Brisco P.R.G. Hinkkanen A.E. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5261-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The yeast strains used in this work were XK157-3C (MATÎ±leu3-Î2::HIS3 ura3-52trp1-289 his3-Î1), XK82-49 (MATaleu4 leu5 ura3-52 trp1-289), DK1 (MATÎ± leu3-Î::LEU2 leu2-3 leu2-112 ura3-52 trp1-289his3-Î1), TG494 (MATÎ±leu3Î2::HIS3 ura3-52trp1-289 cha4-Î), XK122-6B (MATaura3-52 his3-Î1), and XK41-7 (MATÎ±ura3 trp1).

A previous effort to identify suppressors of the Leu3-dd phenotype had yielded multiple site suppressors that mapped to a region bordered by residues 472 and 765 (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To find out which, if any, particular residue was responsible for suppression, PCR methodology (18Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was used to generate all of the single mutations that made up a given multiple mutation suppressor. Two sets of three universal primers were used, plus one specific primer for each individual mutation. The universal primers were 5â²-AAGTCAATTGGAGATTAGTC-3â² or 5â²-GACGTTTAATGCCTCAGTT-3â² (for the 5â² ends of two subregions); 5â²-TACCTCCACCTTCCTTTG-3â² or 5â²-GTGTCCTTGATGTCTGTAG-3â² (for the 3â² ends of two subregions); and 5â²-TCGAGCTCATCATACATATTAGCAA-3â² or 5â²-TCCGAGCTCTTAAGGTGACATTTTATTGAGGA-3â² (as the mismatched primers; mismatched sequence is underlined). The PCR products containing single mutations were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). They were then digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into vector pPC62-H/86T-LEU3dd (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that had been cut with either SpeI and NdeI orNdeI and AvrII. The ligation solutions were used to transform XL1-blue cells. After overnight incubation at 37 Â°C, single colonies were picked, and DNA was isolated using QIAprep spin columns (Qiagen), and sequences were determined using a DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids containing the desired mutations were used to transform XK157-3C cells that already contained the pYB1 plasmid. The transformed cells were grown on SD medium. Cell-free extracts were prepared and Î²-galactosidase activities measured (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Single mutations that caused phenotypes similar to the corresponding multiple mutation suppressors were transferred to wild type LEU3 by performing cassette exchanges from pPC62-H/86T-LEU3dd to pPC62-H/86T-LEU3, as described (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To transfer theCHA4 gene from pTK327 to pPC62-H/86T (see above for plasmid details), two oligonucleotides, 5â²-CTCGAAGCTCTGCAGAATCGCAGCAATGAT-3â² (5â² end) and 5â²-GATAAGTTCCGCGGTGGGAAAGGATAGCGG-3â² (3â² end) (PstI and SacII restriction sites underlined), were used as primers to synthesize the full-length CHA4 gene with desired restriction sites on each side by PCR methodology. In all the experiments where PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes, the restriction sites either existed in the DNA fragments to be amplified by PCR or were introduced by the primers. The PCR-synthesized CHA4 gene was digested with PstI and SacII and then inserted into pPC62-H/86T that had been cut with the same enzymes. In the resulting plasmid, pPC62-H/86T-CHA4, the CHA4 gene was expressed from an ADC1promoter. To make L-L, a fragment encoding the AD of Leu3p was synthesized using oligonucleotides 5â²-CTACAATCAAAGAGTCGACCAATTCCATCATGGC-3â² (SalI site underlined) and 5â²-CGCCGTGGCCGCCGCTCTAGAACT-3â². The PCR product was digested with SalI and SpeI and inserted into pPC62-H/86T-LEU3 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pPC62-H/86T-L-L, encoded a truncated Leu3p molecule containing residues 1â173 (the DB) fused to residues 855â886 (the AD). To construct pPC62-H/86T-L-C, two DNA fragments encoding the DB of Leu3p and the AD of Cha4p, respectively, were synthesized by PCR with the following two pairs of oligonucleotides: 5â²-AAGCTTGATATCGAATTCCTGCAG-3â² (PstI site underlined)/ 5â²-ACAGGGTCGGAATTCGTCGACGAGCTTAAG-3â² (EcoRI site underlined) and 5â²-TCTCAGAATTCCGATTTTGCCTTAGAGTAC-3â² (EcoRI site underlined)/5â²-GATAAGTTCCGCGGTGGGAAAGGATAGCGG-3â² (SacII site underlined). The PCR product encoding the DB of Leu3p was digested with PstI and EcoRI and that encoding the AD of Cha4p was digested with EcoRI andSacII. The two digested fragments were simultaneously inserted into plasmid pPC62-H/86T-LEU3 that had been digested withPstI and SacII, resulting in pPC62-H/86T-L-C. The DNA manipulations caused the introduction of a foreign serine residue between the Leu3p and the Cha4p moieties. To construct LCL, two DNA fragments encoding the MR of Cha4p and the AD of Leu3p, respectively, were synthesized by PCR with the following two pairs of oligonucleotides: 5â²-CAGTTGGCACAAAGTCGACATATCCATCAAATTCCTTGTC-3â² (SalI site underlined)/5â²-GGCAAAAGAATTCCCGTGAGATAGAGTCCC-3â² (EcoRI site underlined) and 5â²-GAATCACCGAATTCCATCATGGCAGGTTGG-3â² (EcoRI site underlined)/5â²-CGCCGTGGCCGCCGCTCTAGAACT-3â². The PCR product coding for the MR of Cha4p was digested with SalI andEcoRI and that coding for the AD of Leu3p was digested withEcoRI and SpeI. The digested fragments were then simultaneously ligated with SalI- andSpeI-digested pPC62-H/86T-LEU3 which contained the DNA encoding the DB of Leu3p. The resulting plasmid was named pPC62-H/86T-LCL. Plasmid pPC62-H/86T-CLC had earlier been constructed in a similar way and was used to make pPC62-H/86T-LLC. The latter was constructed by insertion of the SalI/SacII fragment of pPC62-H/86T-CLC that coded for the MR of Leu3p and the AD of Cha4p (the âLCâ portion), into pPC62-H/86T-LEU3 which had been digested with the same enzymes and provided the DNA encoding the DB of Leu3p. Construct LCC was made by first synthesizing, by PCR, a DNA fragment encoding the MR and AD of Cha4p, using the following oligonucleotides: 5â²-CAGTTGGCACAAAGTCGACATATCCATCAAATTCCTTGTC-3â² (SalI site underlined) and 5â²-GATAAGTTCCGCGGTGGGAAAGGATAGCGG-3â² (SacII site underlined). The PCR product was digested with SalI and SacII and inserted into pPC62-H/86T-LEU3 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pPC62-H/86T-LCC. To make plasmid pPC62-H/86T-CLL, a DNA fragment encoding the DB of Cha4p was synthesized by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5â²-CTCGAAGCTCTGCAGAATCGCAGCAATGAT-3â² (PstI site underlined) and 5â²-AGGAATTTGATGGAGTCGACGAATTTGTGCCAACTGGTGG-3â² (SalI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with PstI and SalI and inserted into pPC62-H/86T-LEU3 that had been digested with the same enzymes. All junction regions of the LEU3-CHA4 chimeric constructs were verified by restriction digestion analysis and those of constructs L-L, L-C, LCC, and CLL were further confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using the SequenaseTM version 2.0 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unless otherwise stated, the above Leu3-Cha4 fusion proteins did not contain any foreign amino acid residues. Plasmid pBTM117, which contained the full-length LexA gene, was used to make the LexA-containing constructs. First, a working plasmid called pPC62-H/86T-LexA was constructed as follows. Plasmid pPC62-H/86T was partially digested with HindIII and then digested to completion with PstI. A 6.7-kilobase pairHindIII/PstI fragment was isolated by electrophoresis and saved. Then, pBTM117 was digested to completion with HindIII and PstI. A 655-bp fragment (which contained the LexA gene) was isolated by electrophoresis. Insertion of this fragment into theHindIII/PstI-digested vector pPC62-H/86T resulted in pPC62-H/86T-LexA. Since this version of the LexA gene did not contain a stop codon at its end, one such codon was incorporated by replacing the 3â² end portion of the gene with a PCR-synthesized copy of the same region containing a TAA codon. The oligonucleotides used were 5â²-CCGTGATCACATCAGCCAG-3â² and 5â²-ATAGAATTCTTACAGCCAGTCGCCGTTGCG-3â² (EcoRI site and stop codon underlined). The PCR product and pPC62-H/86T-LexA were both digested with MluI and EcoRI, and the replacement of the LexA sequence was performed by cassette exchange. The resulting plasmid, named pPC62-H/86T-A, encoded a full-length LexA protein. Plasmid pPC62-H/86T-AL172â886 was constructed by inserting a SalI/NotI fragment from pPC62-H/86T-LEU3 into plasmid pPC62-H/86T-LexA digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids pPC62-H/86T-AL1-886, pPC62-H/86T-AL70-886, and pPC62-H/86T-AL100-886 were made in a similar way. Three DNA fragments were synthesized by PCR, one for each construct. The oligonucleotide pairs for synthesizing the DNA fragments were 5â²-TTTGAATTCATGGAAGGAAGATCAGATT-3â²/5â²-ACAGGGTCGGAATTCGTCGACGAGCTTAAG-3â² (for AL1-886), 5â²-TGCGAATTCAAACGAGATTTCAGAAGAA-3â²/second oligonucleotide as above (for AL70-86), and 5â²-ACAGAATTCACTTCGGATGAAATTTTGA-3â²/second nucleotide as above (for AL100-886) (SalI site and EcoRI sites underlined). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SalI and inserted separately into pPC62-H/86T-AL172-886 that had been digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids pPC62-H/86T-AL1-856C, pPC62-H/86T-AL70-856C, pPC62-H/86T-AL100-856C, and pPC62-H/86T-AL172-856C were constructed as follows. First, plasmid pPC62-H/86T-LLC (see above) was digested with SalI andSacII, and a 2250-bp fragment encoding the MR of Leu3p and the AD of Cha4p (the LC portion) was isolated and saved. Second, plasmids pPC62-H/86T-AL1-886, pPC62-H/86T-AL70-886, pPC62-H/86T-AL100-886, and pPC62-H/86T-AL172-886 were all digested withSalI and SacII, and the vectors (the larger fragments) were isolated. Insertion of the isolated 2250-bpSalI/SacII fragment into each of these vectors resulted in the desired plasmids containing theLexA-LEU3-CHA4 chimeric constructs. All of the LexA fusion proteins contain a Glu-Phe dipeptide between the LexA and the Leu3p moieties, which was introduced by DNA manipulations. The DNA sequence of all junction regions of the fusion constructs, including that around the MluI site within theLexA gene on plasmid pPC62-H/86T-A, were verified by DNA sequence analysis. All LexA-containing constructs were expressed from an ADC1 promoter. Plasmids pPC62-H/86T-LLC (see above) and pVP-LEU3-WT-AD (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were used as starting material. Plasmid pVP-LEU3-WT-AD was digested with PstI and AvrII. A 260-bp fragment that contained the DNA coding for the VP16 AD was isolated and inserted into pPC62-H/86T-LLC that had been cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was designated pPC62-H/86T-VP-CHA4-AD. To transfer the VP-CHA4-AD fragment from the pPC62-H/86T vector to a pRS423 vector, the pPC62-H/86T-VP-CHA4-AD was digested with ApaI and PvuII. A 2.7-kilobase pair fragment was isolated and inserted into pRS423 cut with ApaI and SmaI (note that the PvuII and SmaI both result in blunt ends that are compatible). The resulting plasmid pVP-CHA4-AD contained sequences coding for the VP16 AD fused to a nonessential region of Leu3p (residues 773â854; Ref. 9Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17409-17412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that in turn was fused to the AD of Cha4p. The nonessential region of Leu3p was retained to make this construct consistent with the previously made VP-LEU3-AD constructs (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Plasmid pVP-CHA4-AD contained a 2-Î¼m replication origin, and the chimeric gene was expressed from anADC1 promoter. The intactness of the DNA of the junction regions of the chimeric construct was verified by sequence analysis. Yeast cell transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method (19Ito H. Fukaka Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except that the total reaction volume was 30 Î¼l. Western blotting was performed as described previously (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a previous paper, we initiated an analysis aimed at identifying residues of Leu3p that were important for AD masking (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since available evidence indicated that neither the extended DNA binding domain (DB, residues 1â173) nor a region adjacent to the AD (residues 774â854) were required for modulation of Leu3p, whereas deletion of residues 174â773 abolished modulation (9, 11, 20, and this paper), the analysis focused on the âmiddle regionâ (MR, residues 174â773). Starting with a slow growing strain that contained a mutant Leu3p whose AD was permanently masked (Leu3p (D872N/D874N), designated Leu3-dd), faster growing suppressors were isolated following mutagenic PCR of the entire MR. The suppressor mutations were by design intragenic, restoring to varying degrees activation potential and modulation to Leu3-dd. When transferred to wild type LEU3 by cassette exchange, the same mutations caused the Leu3 protein to become constitutively active. As it turned out, however, all but one of the suppressor mutants contained multiple (double to quadruple) mutations in the MR, allowing only a general delimitation of an area potentially involved in masking (10Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19383-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore undertook to find out whether any one of the multiple mutations of a given suppressor might be responsible for the phenotype of that suppressor. By using PCR methodology, we created Leu3-dd proteins containing separately each of the multiple mutations found in a given suppressor. For example, one of the suppressors carried mutations that altered amino acid residues in four places as follows: A472V, E505K, H536Q, and I604K. We determined that the activation-modulation behavior of Leu3-dd(A472V), Leu3-dd(E505K), and Leu3-dd(H536Q) was very similar to that of Leu3-dd itself, whereas Leu3-dd(I604K) behaved very much like the original four-mutation suppressor molecule. The I604K mutation was therefore considered to be the actual suppressor. With this approach, we identified eight separate single suppressor mutations. Each mutation was subsequently transferred to wild type LEU3 by cassette exchange. As shown in TableI, each of these mutations will turn an otherwise wild type Leu3p molecule into an essentially Î±-IPM-independent, âconstitutiveâ activator. Moreover, all eight mutant proteins display significantly stronger activation capacities than wild type Leu3p, suggesting that they are stable molecules that approach their maximal innate activation potential. Remarkably, all eight mutations map to three small areas of the MR that cover residues 604â611, 643â664, and 738â741 (Fig.1). (A ninth mutation that maps to position 609 was identified by default, see legend to Fig. 1.) Of these mutations, two are especially noteworthy. One is the seemingly minor replacement of the leucine residue in position 611 with isoleucine, which nevertheless caused essentially full and permanent unmasking of the AD (Table I). The other is the chemically much more drastic switch from isoleucine to lysine in position 604 which also had a more drastic effect on masking; it caused constitutivity not only in an otherwise wild type Leu3p molecule (Table I) but also in Leu3-dd (data not shown), a result not seen with the other mutations.Table ISingle amino acid mutations in the middle region of Leu3p that essentially abolish the masking of the activation domainLeu3 proteinaThe host strain, XK157â3C, contained a total deletion of the LEU3 gene. It was first transformed with plasmid pYB1 that contained the reporter gene (see Footnote b) and then with plasmid pPC62-H/86T containing either no LEU3 gene, or wild type LEU3, or a mutant LEU3 encoding a protein with the indicated single mutation. All LEU3 genes were under the control of the ADC1 promoter.Reporter gene activitybSpecific activity of Î²-galactosidase in Miller units.

Therefore, RXR is supposed to play a key role in a ligand-dependent regulation of gene transcription by nuclear receptors. In this study, we have identified the octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) as a novel interaction factor of RXR. In vitro pull-down assays using RXR deletion mutants showed that the interaction surfaces were located in the region encompassing the DNA binding domain (C domain) and the hinge domain (D domain) of RXR. We also showed that RXR interacted with the POU homeodomain but not with the POU-specific domain of Oct-1. Gel shift analysis revealed that Oct-1 reduced the binding of TR/RXR heterodimers to the thyroid hormone response element (TRE). In transient transfection assays using COS1 cells, Oct-1 repressed the T3-dependent transcriptional activity of TR/RXR heterodimers, consistent with in vitro DNA binding data; however, transcriptional activation by Gal4-TR(LBD) (LBD, ligand binding domain), which lacks its own DNA binding domain but retains responsiveness to T3, was not influenced by Oct-1. These results suggest that Oct-1 functionally interacts with RXR and negatively regulates the nuclear receptor signaling pathway by altering the DNA binding ability of the receptors.

This superfamily includes receptors for steroids, thyroid, vitamin D3, retinoids, and a large number of orphan receptors whose cognate ligands are still unknown (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Members of the superfamily are characterized by a highly conserved cysteine-rich DNA binding domain containing two zinc finger structures necessary for sequence-specific DNA interaction (4Evans R.M. Hollenberg S.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The complex carboxyl-terminal region of the receptors contains ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and putative transcriptional activation function (5Carson J.M. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Members of the superfamily regulate transcription by binding to response elements containing two or more copies (often degenerate) of the consensus motif AGGTCA (6Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y.

Thus, RXRs are supposed to play a key role in ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors. The mechanisms by which nuclear hormone receptors regulate target gene transcription are currently under intensive investigation. The ligand-activated nuclear receptors may promote formation of preinitiation complex of the basal transcriptional apparatus and facilitate transcription by RNA polymerase II. Recently, a number of nuclear receptor-associated proteins have been identified that interact with receptors and regulate their transcriptional activities. A nuclear receptor co-repressor, N-CoR or a related factor SMRT, binds to unliganded receptors and acts as a transcriptional silencer of nuclear receptors (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 12Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M.

It has been shown that N-CoR and SMRT recruit mSin3 and mRPD3 that possess histone deacetylase activity and make the chromatin transcriptionally inactive (14Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M.

Although recent extensive studies have depicted a model of nuclear receptor action, it is still not enough to explain the divergent biological effect of nuclear hormone receptors in development, differentiation, and cell cycle regulation. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that a large number of novel factors may associate with nuclear receptors. By using a biochemical technique, we have identified the octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) as a novel interaction factor of RXR. Oct-1 is ubiquitously expressed and activates the octamer motif containing promoters which has been shown to be related to cell cycle regulation of the human histoneH2B gene and the constitutive expression of small nuclear RNA genes (25Fletcher C. Heintz N. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 51: 773-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Oct-1 is a member of a family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of a bipartite DNA binding domain, the POU domain (28Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D.

Nature. 1988; 336: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This POU domain consists of two conserved regions, a POU-specific domain and a POU homeodomain. Both subdomains have a helix-turn-helix motif and act as the DNA binding domain but are also involved in protein-protein interactions. A number of transcription factors have been identified to interact with the POU domains of Oct-1 and/or Oct-2, e.g. TBP, TFIIB, HMG2, and the lymphoid-specific transcriptional co-activator OBF-1 (30Zwilling S.

Oct-2 has a highly similar POU domain to Oct-1 and is expressed in a B cell-specific pattern and has a distinct transcriptional regulatory potential (35Wirth T. Staudt L. Baltimore D.

In this study we have demonstrated a novel interaction of RXR with Oct-1/2 through their DNA binding domains. The POU domain of Oct-1/2 has influenced the RXR/TR heterodimers binding to thyroid hormone response element (TRE). Furthermore, these interactions negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of the TRE-containing promoter.

Isolated clones were subcloned into pGEM 3 and sequenced by Applied Biosystems 3300 autosequencer.

Endocrinol. 1994; 102: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and quantitated by PhosphorImager. Each transfection was conducted in triplicate, and data represent the mean Â± S.D. of more than three individual experiments. Coupled transcription and translation of Oct-1/2 RXR were carried out using a T7 TNT in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 carrying the recombinant GST-RXRÎ± and GST control plasmids were diluted 100-fold, cultured for 5â6 h, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After another 3 h, bacteria were collected and then washed with PBS. Pellets were suspended in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and were then sonicated. Debris was removed by centrifugation. The fusion protein or the GST control protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and extensively washed with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Matrix-bound proteins were used for interaction experiments. 10 Î¼l of GST-Sepharose beads containing 2â5 Î¼g of GST recombinant proteins were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled proteins for 1 h at 4 Â°C. Complexes were then centrifuged, washed three times in gel shift buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled signals were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fuji BAS 1500). DNase I (5 units/ml) was added to the reaction in experiments shown in Fig. 1 B. Synthetic oligonucleotides representing each strand of the sequences were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted, and annealed. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with dCTP (>3300 Ci/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) by fill in reactions using Klenow large fragment DNA polymerase. Radiolabeled probes (10 fmol, 20,000â30,000 cpm) were then incubated with binding proteins in 30 ml of reaction mixture containing 10 mm KPO4, pH 8.0 buffer, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm KCl, 1 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 Î¼g of bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmleupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin. These reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 200 V at 4 Â°C in the same buffer. To express the fusion proteins with GST, PCR-amplified full-length RXRÎ± cDNA or truncated fragments were inserted in frame into BamHI- andEcoRI-cloning sites of the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 carrying the recombinant GST fusions or GST control plasmid were diluted 100-fold, cultured for 5â6 h, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After another 3 h, bacteria were collected and washed with PBS. Pellets were suspended in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and sonicated. Debris was removed by centrifugation. The fusion protein or the GST control protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and extensively washed with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Matrix-bound proteins were used for interaction experiments. In vitro translated35S-labeled proteins (1â2 Î¼l) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with glutathione-Sepharose (10 Î¼l) preloaded with GST fusion or GST control protein in 250 Î¼l of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin) in the presence or absence of 10-6m of T3. After extensive washing with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted in 25 Î¼l of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) followed by autoradiography. The results of the in vitroreactions and the amount of 35S-labeled protein bound by GST fusions were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fuji BAS 1500). In order to identify the interacting protein with RXR, we used biochemical methods. Rat GH3 cell cDNA library was screened with GST fusion containing full-length human RXRÎ± as a probe. Positive clones were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase, translated into35S-labeled peptides using [35S]methionine, and used for pull-down experiments with GST-RXRÎ± to confirm the interactions. One positive clone was identified, and the nucleotide sequences were determined. Sequence homology searches in GenBankTM revealed that the isolated clone contained the POU homeodomain of rat Oct-1 cDNA, which was highly homologous to the human Oct-1 amino acid residues 371â438. To examine the interaction between Oct-1 and RXR, we used the matrix-bound fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase with RXR (GST-RXR) forin vitro pull-down assay. As shown in Fig.1 A, [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated Oct-1 interacted with GST-RXR but not GST alone, and GST-RXR did not retain any of the in vitro translated control luciferase protein. As shown in Fig. 1 B, addition of DNase I in the binding mixture did not alter the association of Oct-1 to matrix-bound RXR, indicating that the protein-protein interaction was not due to the presence of contaminating DNA. Reciprocal pull-down experiment was performed to confirm the interaction between RXR and Oct-1. As shown in Fig. 1 C, matrix-bound GST-POU domain (3rd lane) and POU homeodomain (5th lane) specifically retains [35S]methionine-labeled RXR, whereas GST alone (lane 2) or GST-POU-specific domain (4th lane) did not. We next examined the specific domains in RXR that interact with Oct-1. A series of deletion mutants of GST fusion proteins representing overlapping portions of RXR (Fig.2 A) were expressed in bacteria, purified, and used to bind 35S-labeled full-length Oct-1. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the DNA binding domain (C domain) and hinge domain (D domain) of RXR were required for the interaction. The C domain itself possessed only weak binding activity to the Oct-1 (lane 5), and an additional hinge domain (D domain) was necessary for full interaction (lane 6), although the D domain itself had no binding activity (lane 7). It was not surprising that the highly conserved DNA binding domain of nuclear receptors could also serve as a site for binding of co-regulator proteins. We identified the nuclear protein Oct-1 as a binding protein for the CD regions of RXR. The above results were of interest because the DNA binding domain of RXR has been reported to be involved in the formation of TR/RXR heterodimers on direct repeat DNA element. To characterize further interaction between Oct-1 and receptor heterodimers, we performed gel mobility shift assays using bacterially expressed and purified TR and RXR. The results shown in Fig.3 indicated that addition of increasing amounts of bacterially expressed and purified GST-Oct-1 POU domain attenuated the binding of RXR/TR heterodimers to TRE (lanes 4 and 5), whereas addition of GST alone did not alter the binding (lane 3). The DNA binding activity of TR/RXR heterodimers was decreased by addition of GST-Oct-1 POU domain. These results showed that association of Oct-1 to RXR inhibited the RXR/TR heterodimers from binding to DNA elements. To test the possible role of Oct-1 and Oct-2 in T3-dependent transcriptional activation, we performed transient transfection experiments in COS1 cells. Full length Oct-1 or Oct-2 expression vectors or empty expression vectors were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing two copies of the TR response element into COS1 cells. After 12 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were determined. As shown in Fig.4, both Oct-1 and Oct-2 repressed the T3-dependent transcriptional activity. In the presence of T3, co-expression of Oct-1 decreased the TR activity by approximately 40% and Oct-2 by approximately 30%. Co-expression of Oct-1/2 did not influence the amount of expression of TR when determined by T3 binding assay. Furthermore, Oct-1/2 had little effect on cytomegalovirus promoter (data not shown). These data suggest that Oct-1 can function as a co-repressor for the T3-dependent transcriptional activity of the TR/RXR heterodimers. We next examined the effect of Oct-1 expression on naturally occurring T3-responsive promoter. As shown in Fig. 4 B, rat growth hormone promoter, which was one of a well characterized T3-responsive promoter, was inhibited in a similar manner, suggesting the physiological relevance of the inhibitory role of Oct-1 in T3-dependent transcription. Because highly conserved DNA binding domain of RXR was involved in the interaction, it is likely that other nuclear receptors could also interact with Oct-1. We next examined the interaction of other nuclear receptor family members with Oct-1 and Oct-2. As we expected, both35S-labeled Oct-1 and Oct-2 associated to matrix-bound TR and VDR as well as RXR (Fig.5 A). In order to confirm the heterodimerization ability of GST fusion proteins with RXR,35S-labeled RXR was incubated with matrix-bound GST fusions (lanes 11â15). Significant associations were detected with GST-TR and GST-VDR, whereas only weak association was detected with GST-RXR, consistent with previous data showing preference of heterodimerization of RXR. We next tested whether Oct-1 can interact with irrelevant DNA-binding transcription factor AP-2. As shown in Fig.5 B, 35S-labeled Oct-1 did not bind to the GST-AP-2, whereas significant amounts of 35S-labeled Oct-1 associated with GST-RXR, suggesting the specific interaction of Oct-1 with nuclear receptors. We further investigated the effect of Oct-1 on transcriptional activation by Gal4-TR(LBD) which lacks its own DNA binding domain but retains responsiveness to T3. As shown in Fig.6, Oct-1 did not influence the transcriptional activation by Gal4-TRÎ±(LBD) fusion protein on upstream activating sequence luciferase reporter. These data are consistent with in vitro results showing that Oct-1 interacted with nuclear receptors via their DNA binding domain and inhibited their DNA binding activity. The DNA binding domain of nuclear receptor was required for the inhibitory effect of Oct-1. In this study, we have examined the interaction between RXR and POU domain of Oct-1. Our results indicated that Oct-1 interacted with nuclear receptors by direct protein-protein interaction and influenced the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors. Recent data show that nuclear receptor co-activators such as SRC-1 and CBP/p300 recruit histone acetyltransferase, p/CAF, and pCIP to DNA-bound nuclear receptors and lead to the unfolding of the DNA-core histone complex (22Bannister A.J.

In addition to co-activators, nuclear receptor co-repressor N-CoR and related factor SMRT, which were initially discovered through their ability to bind to unliganded nuclear receptors, recruit histone deacetylase (mSin3 and mRPD3) and result in the condensation of the chromatin structure to repress the basal transcription (14Heinzel T.

Co-activator and co-repressor interact with the ligand binding domain and hinge domain of nuclear receptors, respectively. So far, little is known about potential role of the DNA binding region of nuclear receptors on transcriptional regulation. We report here the identification of the transcription factor Oct-1/2 as a binding protein for the DNA binding domain (DBD) of RXR and influence on ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors. The highly conserved DBD of nuclear receptors could also serve as a site of interaction for co-regulator proteins, suggesting that Oct-1/2 function is analogous among the members of the nuclear receptors. Our results demonstrated that the POU homeodomain of Oct-1, which is known to form a complex with the herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16 (53Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Nature. 1989; 341: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), was involved in the interaction with RXR. POU homeodomains have been shown to be involved in protein-protein interaction as well as sequence-specific DNA binding. A number of transcription factors have been identified to interact with the POU domains of Oct-1 and/or Oct-2, e.g. TBP, TFIIB, HMG2, the lymphoid-specific transcriptional co-activator OBF-1 (30Zwilling S.

Recently, it has been reported that glucocorticoid receptor interacts with the POU domain of Oct-1 and modulates the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid receptor (54Kutoh E.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also reported that the POU domains of Brn-3a and Brn-3b, which belong to the POU family of transcription factors, interact with estrogen receptor (ER) and regulate transcriptional activity of ER. It also has been demonstrated that POU transcription factor Pit-1 interacts with TR to activate growth hormone gene transcription (57Chang W. Zhou W. Theill L.E. Baxter J.D. Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17733-17738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and with ER to modulate expression of the prolactin promoter in pituitary cells (58Day R.N. Koike S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Herein, our results showed that the Oct-1 POU domain interacted with DBD of RXR and prevented TR/RXR heterodimers from binding to TRE. These results were consistent with transient transfection experiments showing that co-transfection of Oct-1 expression vector significantly inhibited the ligand-dependent activation by nuclear receptors. An inhibiting effect of Oct-1 could not be observed on thyroid hormone responsiveness mediated by Gal4-TR(LBD) fusion that lacks its DNA binding domain but retains its T3 responsiveness. We concluded that Oct-1 negatively regulates nuclear receptor transcriptional activity by competitive binding to DBD of receptors with DNA elements. Since Segil et al. (60Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 254: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of the POU homeodomain of Oct-1 correlates with DNA binding and cell cycle regulation of gene transcription, it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of POU domain of Oct-1 may regulate the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors via altering the interaction with RXR. As expression and activity of Oct-1 are differentially regulated in development, differentiation, and cell cycle regulation, nuclear receptor signaling is also controlled via the Oct-1 pathway at these physiological conditions. Furthermore, recent data showed that transcriptional activity of Pit-1 is determined by a regulated balance between a co-repressor complex that contains N-CoR/SMRT, mSin3, and histone deacetylase and a co-activator complex that contains the CBP and p/CAF (61Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Since these co-repressors and co-activators also interact with nuclear receptors, complex and promiscuous cross-talk between POU transcription factors and nuclear receptors can be expected. It would also be of interest to examine the role of nuclear receptors in the transcriptional activity of Oct-1 on the octamer-binding site. We thank Dr. R. M.

Dense, or secondary, lysosomes receive their structural and functional components from other organelles involved in the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways and, therefore, share some but not all characteristics with pre-lysosomal compartments. Lysosomes have been originally defined as terminal degradative compartments, since macromolecules, once transferred into these organelles, are usually not released in the intact state (1Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). However, it has been recently questioned whether lysosomes really act as final traps in the endocytic pathway, since some substances apparently escape from this location via retrograde transport systems (2Jahraus A. Storrie B. Griffiths G. Desjardins M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 145-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bright N.A. Reaves B.J. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2027-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, degradative processes are at least initiated already in endosomes that have been shown to contain substantial amounts of some lysosomal hydrolases (4Roederer M. Bowser R. Murphy R.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, current studies suggest that proteolytic digestion of endocytosed substances occurs in endosomes rather than in secondary lysosomes (5Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar). The biogenesis of lysosomes involves the biosynthesis and the transport of acidic hydrolases to these organelles as well as the formation of the lysosomal membranes. Intracellular trafficking of soluble lysosomal enzymes, which constitute the majority of hydrolases within these compartments, is mediated by mannose 6-phosphate receptors (1Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Lysosomal membrane glycoproteins are retrieved from thetrans-Golgi network (TGN)1 or the plasma membrane by mechanisms involving the interaction of a polypeptide motif in their cytoplasmic domains with cytosolic receptors (6Peters C. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the transport of membrane proteins and soluble enzymes implies some membrane flow from the TGN to lysosomes, an important portion of the lysosomal membrane originates from the plasma membrane after endocytosis. Two different models have been proposed to explain the delivery of endocytosed ligands and membrane components from the plasma membrane to late locations in the endocytic pathway. Experimental support has been provided for vesicular transport events between pre-existing endocytic compartments (7Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 5-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) as well as for the maturation hypothesis, which postulates that plasma membrane-derived vesicles gradually convert into late endosomes (11Murphy R.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Salzman N.H. Maxfield F.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Many of the conflicts on the relative contribution of the two concepts for transport from the plasma membrane to late endosomes have now been resolved, and it is generally accepted that the mode of endocytic membrane traffic may vary between individual cell types (16Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Remarkably less knowledge is available on the molecular mechanisms underlying the transfer of internalized substances from late endosomes to lysosomes. As in the case of the passage from early to late endosomes, this process could be either mediated by maturation and/or fusion events. Initially, any involvement of fusion processes appeared unlikely since dense lysosomes and late endosomes display quite substantial differences in the composition of their membranes. However, content mixing by fusion between endosomes and lysosomes has now been demonstrated both in vitro (17Mullock B.M. Perez J.H. Kuwana T. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in vivo (15Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These findings would be in good agreement with a recently postulated model, where lysosomes transiently fuse with endosomes thereby transferring lumenal molecules without significant mixing of the surrounding membranes (âkiss and run modelâ (18Storrie B. Desjardins M. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)). Nevertheless, we still lack information on important aspects of the formation of dense lysosomes such as the mechanism(s) leading to their inherent high buoyant density. It has been suggested that this unique feature is due to osmotic shrinking and depends on aggregation of the lumenal contents upon acidification (19Buckmaster M.J. Ferris A.L. Storrie B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Inversely, internalization of indigestible small compounds induces osmotic swelling of lysosomes (20DeCourcy K. Storrie B. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have now addressed the impact of an altered endocytic environment on the function and the biogenesis of these organelles in fibroblasts from patients suffering from sialic acid storage disease (SASD). This inherited disorder is characterized by an accumulation of free sialic acid in compartments of the lysosomal pathway. It occurs in a mild form called Salla disease (21Aula P. Autio S. Raivio K.O. Rapola J. Thoden C.J. Koskela S.L. Yamashina I. Arch. Neurol. 1979; 36: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and a more severe variant termed infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD; see Ref. 22Tondeur M. Libert J. Vamos E. Van Hoof F. Thomas G.H. Strecker G. Eur. J. Pediat. 1982; 139: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with a close correlation between the intracellular sialic acid concentration and the severity of the disease. SASD is caused by negligible egress of sialic acid and other acidic monosaccharides from (pre)lysosomal compartments due to a defective carrier protein, with a concomitant decrease in the buoyant density of the affected organelles (23Renlund M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 15247-15254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established as to how this phenotype results in impaired lysosomal functions in SASD cells. The proteolytic maturation of the lysosomal marker enzyme Î²-N-acetylhexosaminidase is incomplete in SASD fibroblasts, although this particular hydrolase does not depend on processing to exhibit its enzymatic activity (26Hancock L.W. Ricketts J.P. Hildreth IV, J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the biosynthesis of the cysteine proteinase cathepsin B in SASD cells, since this lysosomal enzyme undergoes a series of well established proteolytic processing steps during maturation that are required to generate its proteolytic activity (27Mach L. Mort J.S. GloÌssl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that C-terminal processing of cathepsin B is prevented in SASD fibroblasts, apparently due to inhibition of the exopeptidase activity of the enzyme itself. Inhibition of C-terminal cathepsin B processing can be induced in normal fibroblasts by loading with the non-degradable disaccharide sucrose, which inhibits the delivery of internalized substances from late endosomes to lysosomes. Since the terminal endocytic compartments of SASD cells exhibit some characteristics of endosomes, we propose that in general the accumulation of small non-diffusible molecules in endocytic compartments prevents the formation of mature dense lysosomes and hence impairs the functions of the lysosomal system. The human skin fibroblast lines GM 5520 (ISSD-1), GM 8496 (Salla-1), GM 5521, and GM 5522 (from the unaffected parents of GM 5520, controls 1 and 2, respectively) were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). The cell lines B.B. (ISSD-2) and F 8471 (Salla-2) as well as normal fibroblasts Ko (control 3) and Kl (control 4) were established at the Children's Hospital, Graz, Austria. All fibroblasts were maintained in continuous culture essentially as described (28Hanewinkel H. GloÌssl J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12351-12355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine and14C-methylated molecular weight standards were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). Percoll and protein A-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Benzyloxycarbonyl-argininyl-arginine-Î²-naphthylamide (Z-Arg-Arg-NHNap) was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and peptide N-glycosidase F was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The production and characterization of a rabbit antiserum against purified human liver cathepsin B have been previously reported (28Hanewinkel H. GloÌssl J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12351-12355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monospecific antibodies were isolated from this antiserum by affinity chromatography on immobilized cathepsin B (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-peptide antibodies specific for the C-terminal extension of cathepsin B were raised, purified, and characterized as described (30Mach L. Schwihla H. StuÌwe K. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum against the bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR300) was generously provided by Dr. Bernard Hoflack (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Rabbit antibodies against rab7 and lgp120 were kindly supplied by Dr. Lukas Huber (Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria) and Dr. Renate Fuchs (Department of Experimental Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria), respectively. Goat anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulins conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Accurate Chemicals (Westbury, NY). FITC- and TRITC-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). Metabolic labeling of confluent cell monolayers with [35S]methionine was done according to our published procedures (28Hanewinkel H. GloÌssl J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12351-12355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To follow the fate of newly synthesized proteins at reduced temperatures, cells were shifted to the respective temperature after short pulse labeling at 37 Â°C. In some experiments, CCCP (50 Î¼m) or monensin (1 Î¼m) was present throughout the entire experimental procedure to inhibit transfer to and exit from the Golgi apparatus, respectively. Immunoprecipitation of cathepsin B from labeled cell and medium extracts followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography was performed as outlined previously (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NH4Cl-induced [35S]methionine-labeled secretions of SASD- or normal fibroblasts were incubated with the respective recipient cell lines as reported previously (31von Figura K. Steckel F. Hasilik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6066-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Endocytosed cathepsin B was then isolated by immunoprecipitation from extracts of the recipient cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. SASD and normal fibroblasts were harvested, disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 600 Ã g for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatants were layered on top of an isotonic Percoll solution (27% (w/v); buoyant density: 1.065 g/ml) and then subjected to density gradient centrifugation in a Beckman VAC50-rotor at 20,000 rpm, Ï2 t = 1.38 Ã 1010rad2/s essentially as described (32Gieselmann V. Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The gradient was then fractionated from the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Triton X-100 (0.2%) was added to each fraction to solubilize cellular membranes. The activities of the lysosomal enzymes Î²-N-acetylhexosaminidase and cathepsin B were determined in all fractions usingp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-Î²-glucosaminide (33von Figura K. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 111: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Z-Arg-Arg-NHNap (34Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) as substrates, respectively. The buoyant density of each fraction was determined gravimetrically. SASD or normal fibroblasts were incubated for 18 h at 37 Â°C in culture medium containing 1.5 mg/ml FITC-dextran (mol wt 70 kDa) and then briefly rinsed and chased for 1 h in medium devoid of the fluid phase marker. The cells were trypsinized, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately analyzed by spectrofluorimetry according to Ohkuma and Poole (35Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the samples were sequentially excited at 457 and 488 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was quantified in each case at 515 nm. The ratio between the two fluorescence intensities thus obtained was then used to estimate the pH of the terminal endocytic compartment by comparison with a standard curve generated with FITC-dextran-loaded microsomes at defined pH. To this end, microsomes were labeled by loading of fibroblasts with FITC-dextran as described above. The cells were subsequently homogenized, and a postnuclear supernatant was prepared. The labeled microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h, and aliquots were resuspended in buffers of defined pH in the presence of nigericin (1 Î¼m) to dissipate a potential pH gradient. SASD and normal fibroblasts were labeled with FITC-dextran, disrupted, and fractionated by differential centrifugation as described above. The microsomal fractions were then suspended in 1.9 ml of Hepes-KCl buffer (20 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgSO4, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5), and the fluorescence was continuously recorded at 515 nm after excitation at 457 and 488 nm, respectively. After stabilization of the signal (up to 20 min), ATP (potassium salt) was added from a stock solution (500 mm, pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and the time-dependent decrease in fluorescence intensity due to ATP-dependent acidification was determined. Once the fluorescence intensity had again stabilized, the pH gradient across the membranes of the labeled compartments was dissipated by addition of nigericin to a final concentration of 1 Î¼m. The resulting increase in fluorescence was used to calculate the ATP-dependent acidification (36Ohkuma S. Moriyama Y. Takano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2758-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 37Anbari M. Root K.V. van Dyke R.W. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1034-1043PubMed Google Scholar). Background fluorescence resulting from extravesicular FITC-dextran was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the microsomes in pH-defined Hepes buffers without membrane-permeable ions. SASD and normal fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips were fixed and permeabilized by sequential incubation at â20 Â°C in methanol (5 min) and acetone (2 min). The samples were then incubated with rabbit antibodies to cathepsin B, its C-terminal extension, MPR300, rab7, or lgp120. Non-immune rabbit immunoglobulins were used as a negative control. In single labeling experiments, bound primary antibodies were visualized with FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulins. When the respective cells had been preloaded with FITC-dextran, TRITC-labeled secondary antibodies were used for immunostaining. The immunostained cells were examined using Zeiss Axiovert 35 or Olympus AH-2 microscopes with the appropriate filter combinations. To determine the size of the terminal endocytic compartments, fibroblasts were labeled with FITC-dextran as described above, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The digital images thus obtained were analyzed using Vidas 2.1 software (Kontron, Germany). The circle equivalent diameter of the labeled compartments was determined according to Equation 1, d=2(A/Ï)Equation 1 where A is area of the labeled compartment in Î¼m2. Cell homogenates from SASD and normal fibroblasts (50 Î¼g of total cellular protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described earlier (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with affinity purified rabbit antibodies to human cathepsin B or its C-terminal extension and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulins as reported (30Mach L. Schwihla H. StuÌwe K. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bound secondary antibodies were detected using 4-Cl-1-naphthol as peroxidase substrate. Enzymatic deglycosylation of polypeptides was carried out with peptide N-glycosidase F as described (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Total protein was determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major lysosomal cysteine proteinase cathepsin B occurs in human tissues and cell lines as a mixture of single-chain and two-chain variants of the enzyme, which exhibit indistinguishable enzymatic properties (34Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 39Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio between the two forms can differ considerably between individual cell types. Although conversion into the two-chain form is quantitative in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the single-chain enzyme is only partially processed in skin fibroblasts (28Hanewinkel H. GloÌssl J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12351-12355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal human fibroblasts, cathepsin B is initially synthesized as a latent proenzyme of 45 kDa, which is targeted to lysosomes via mannose 6-phosphate receptors, with only a minor fraction being secreted. Upon delivery to the lysosomal pathway, procathepsin B is initially converted into the single-chain 33-kDa form of the mature proteinase, which is partially cleaved at a later stage into the two-chain enzyme consisting of subunits of 27 kDa (heavy chain) and 5 kDa (light chain; Fig. 1 (28Hanewinkel H. GloÌssl J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12351-12355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Both proteolytic processing steps appear to rely primarily on the action of cathepsin B itself (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Mach L. Schwihla H. StuÌwe K. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As in control cells, the first detectable form of newly synthesized cathepsin B in SASD fibroblasts was the 45-kDa proenzyme, which was partially secreted into the culture medium and exhibited the same apparent molecular mass as its normal counterpart. However, the fully processed mature form of cathepsin B appeared to be larger in SASD cells than in normal fibroblasts. Most strikingly, the heavy chain of mature two-chain cathepsin B exhibited a molecular mass of 28 kDa in SASD cells, whereas a 27-kDa polypeptide was observed in normal fibroblasts. In contrast, the electrophoretic mobility of the single-chain enzyme was apparently not affected, but any small difference between the SASD and the normal forms could be masked by the consistently rather diffuse nature of the 33-kDa bands. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that proteolytic conversion of single-chain into two-chain cathepsin B was significantly retarded in SASD fibroblasts (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table IQuantification of cathepsin B processing in SASD and normal fibroblastsBiosynthesis6-h pulse/24-h chase6-h pulse/40-h chase%Control 1917Control 2818ISSDNot detectable11Salla37Endocytosis20 h48 hControl 1920Control 21125ISSDNot detectable10SallaNot detectable9Biosynthesis, ISSD (GM 5520)-, Salla (GM 8496), and normal fibroblasts (controls 1 and 2; GM 5521 and GM 5522, respectively) were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine as described in the legend of Fig. 1.

Internalized cathepsin B was analyzed as described above. Our previous studies indicated that the carbohydrate moiety frequently accounts for cell type-specific cathepsin B forms (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, enzymatic deglycosylation of the immunoprecipitates with peptideN-glycosidase F prior to SDS-PAGE analysis did not eliminate the difference in the electrophoretic mobility between the heavy chains of the SASD and normal enzymes, although removal of the attached oligosaccharides shifted the apparent molecular masses of the large subunits to 25 and 24 kDa, respectively (data not shown). Altogether, these results rule out that a different N-glycosylation pattern causes the observed discrepancy between the molecular forms of cathepsin B in SASD and normal fibroblasts and suggest that the proteolytic maturation of this proteinase is not complete in the former cells. To assess the impact of the proenzyme itself on the altered maturation of cathepsin B in SASD cells, metabolically labeled procathepsin B secreted by normal fibroblasts was offered to unlabeled SASD and normal recipient cells for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Exogenous radiolabeled procathepsin B was taken up in a mannose 6-phosphate-dependent manner (results not shown (29Mach L. StuÌwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. GloÌssl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) and processed into mature forms indistinguishable from the respective endogenous enzymes, demonstrating that the 28-kDa heavy chain typically associated with SASD cells can be generated from the normal proenzyme. Analogous incubation of normal fibroblasts with procathepsin B secreted by labeled SASD cells confirmed the independence of the processing products from the source of the cathepsin B precursor (Fig.2), emphasizing the unique phenotype of cathepsin B processing in SASD fibroblasts and indicating that the defect in the maturation of this enzyme occurs both in the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways. However, it should be noted that proteolytic processing of endocytosed procathepsin B progressed slower in SASD cells than in normal fibroblasts as already observed for the biosynthetic route and that less procathepsin B was endocytosed (Fig. 2and Table I). To assess whether early events in (pro)cathepsin B processing were affected in SASD cells, both normal and SASD fibroblasts were metabolically labeled in the presence of the protonophore CCCP, whic"

MAPK kinase mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase insulin-like growth factor fetal calf serum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4,6-diamidin-2-phenylindol Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the highly conserved innate mechanism by which eukaryotic cells commit suicide and plays an essential role in the normal development of vertebrates. In addition, it represents an important mechanism to help defend against emerging malignant cells, with tumor suppressor gene products and oncogenes functioning as inducers of apoptosis and transformation, respectively. However, certain dominant oncogenes, such as c-myc, have the ability to induce apoptosis, suggesting a coupling of cell growth and cell death (1Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 595-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ha-ras lys12-transformed brown adipocyte cell lines are constitutively differentiated cells that develop insulin resistance and overexpress Ras/Raf-1-signaling cascade (5Lorenzo M.

Although Ras activation is associated primarily with proliferation and differentiation, it has also been implicated in apoptosis. In this regard, constitutive expression of activated Ha-ras in Jurkat cells (a human T lymphoblastoid cell line) renders cells susceptible to apoptosis in the absence of protein kinase C activity (7Chen C.Y.

Furthermore, cells overexpressing Crk-II, an adapter protein that regulates Ras activation, undergo apoptosis when deprived of serum via a Ras-dependent, Raf-1/MEK1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-independent pathway (11Parrizas M. Blakesley V.A. Beithner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, other authors found that Ras is an effective promoter of apoptosis throughout the Raf pathway (12Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to evaluate apoptosis in Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocytes under serum deprivation as well as the involvement in this process of the Ras/Raf/MAPK-signaling cascade using dominant-negative mutants or chemical inhibitors of this pathway.The molecular mechanisms that regulate apoptosis are not yet completely understood. Several genes have been identified that participate as either repressors or inducers of apoptosis. The blocker of cell death,bcl-2, is included in the first group. In mammalian species,bcl-2 gene encodes a 26-kDa protein that predominantly resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane and nuclear envelope. Recently, Bcl-2 has been reported to physically associate with Raf-1, p21 Ras, and p23 Ra-Ras (13Wang H.-G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J.

Furthermore, p21 Ras and Raf-1 association with Bcl-2 is coincident with the phosphorylation status of Bcl-2. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 involved the loss of its anti-apoptotic function, affected its capacity to heterodimerize with Bax (14Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol.

Whether Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-x expression can be controlling apoptosis in Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocytes remains to be established.In this manuscript we have investigated the apoptotic process in Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocyte cell line under serum deprivation, which concurs with up-regulation of Bcl-xS expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein content. A ternary complex between Ras/Raf-1 and phosphorylated Bcl-2 was found under apoptotic conditions. Inhibition of Raf-1 pathway, but not MAPK pathway, precludes apoptosis in brown adipocytes.DISCUSSIONEmbryonic development of brown adipose tissue requires a balance between processes of proliferation, necessary for organ growth, apoptosis, involved in the orderly removal of certain cells, and tissue-specific differentiation, which leads to the cellular phenotype. The products of the Ras genes are known to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, and quite recently, it has been found to play a role in apoptosis, depending on the cell type. In this regard, p21 Ras is involved in IGF-I-induced proliferation of brown adipocyte primary cultures as well as in IGF-I-induced differentiation of primary and immortalized brown adipocytes (27Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Benito M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Lorenzo M. Benito M.

Furthermore Ha-ras lys12-transformed brown adipocyte cell lines overexpressing Ras/Raf-1 signaling cascade are constitutively differentiated cells in the absence of IGF-I (5Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Alvarez A. Benito M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1251-1259PubMed Google Scholar, 6Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Teruel T. Benito M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3195-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Most cell types require growth factors for growth and survival in culture; serum withdrawal causes apoptosis in PC-12 cells, Rat-1 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts (1Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S.

Primary brown adipocytes seem to be resistant to cell death under serum deprivation in a similar fashion that human white adipocytes are refractory to apoptosis (30Prins J.B. Walker N.I. Winterford C.M. Cameron D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Prins J.B. Niesler C.U. Winterford C.M. Bright N.A. Siddle K. Oâ²Rahilly S. Walker N.I. Cameron D.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocyte cell line undergo apoptosis under serum deprivation in a time-dependent manner, as detected by DNA laddering, increase in the percentage of hypodiploid cells, and nuclei condensation and fragmentation, as compared with either immortalized or primary brown adipocytes. Moreover, transient transfection of immortalized brown adipocytes with a constitutive active Ras gene (Ha-ras lys12) and serum deprivation mimic the high rate of apoptosis detected in the transformed cell line, maintaining a high proportion of proliferating cells. Although the evidence of the role of Ras in apoptosis is contradictory, constitutive expression of oncogenic p21 Rascauses apoptosis in several cell types including Jurkat cells (7Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol.

Consiglio E. Formisano S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), or murine fibroblasts (17Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 32Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 11: 984-985Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this work, we described for the first time that active Ras causes apoptosis in serum-deprived brown adipocytes, a cell system constitutively refractory to apoptosis when survival signals are not prevalent.On the other hand, because active Ras is inducing apoptosis in brown adipocytes under serum deprivation, we decided to inhibit Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/MAPK pathway to rescue from apoptotic cell death. In fact, transient transfection of Ha-ras-transformed cells with a dominant-negative raf-1 DNA (pMNC-raftrp375), a kinase death mutant that block transformation by Ras oncogenes (33Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), dramatically decreases the apoptotic status of the cells, maintaining a high proportion of proliferating cells. However, treatment with MEK-1 inhibitor increases the rate of apoptosis observed in Ras apoptotic cells. Moreover, inhibition of MEK-1 causes apoptosis in Ha-ras-transformed cells under nonapoptotic conditions. Although the MEK-1 pathway is constitutively expressed in Ras apoptotic cells after 6 h of serum deprivation, MEK-1 activity is much lower compared with Ha-ras-transformed nonapoptotic cells. These results point out that Ras induces apoptosis in brown adipocytes in the presence of a remnant MAPK activity. Thus, active Ras may have either positive or negative effects on the regulation of apoptosis depending on the cell type and on the balance of the apoptotic-anti-apoptotic signaling. One pathway downstream of Ras stimulates Raf-1, an apoptotic signal for lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Alternatively, other signaling pathways downstream of Ras stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, survival signals for epithelial and myeloid cells, as recently revised by Downward (34Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In serum-deprived Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocytes, active Ras constitutively activates Raf-1 and in a lower extent, MAPKs, but fails to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Alvarez A. Benito M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1251-1259PubMed Google Scholar,6Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Teruel T. Benito M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3195-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Valverde A.M. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the balance, Ras signaling induces apoptosis in brown adipocytes in the absence of survival factors.In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate apoptosis induced by Ras, we have studied the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xS/L. Bcl-xS protein is the small splice variant of the Bcl-x protein, which is found in cells that undergo a high rate of turnover, and inhibits the protective effects on apoptosis of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (17Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our results show that under non-apoptotic conditions the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is predominant over the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS, Bcl-xL being barely expressed in our cell model. However, in ras-induced apoptotic cells, Bcl-xS protein is highly expressed, Bcl-2 protein level being dramatically decreased. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein is highly associated to Ras and Raf-1 in Ras-induced apoptotic cells, as demonstrated by the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, treatment with alkaline phosphatase decreased the Ras-associated Bcl-2 protein level, strongly suggesting that Ras/Raf-1 can form complexes with serine-threonine-phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 involves the loss of its anti-apoptotic function because phosphorylated Bcl-2 has lost its capacity to heterodimerize with Bax (16Poommipanit P.B. Chen B. Oltvai Z.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1033-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, Bcl-2 has been reported to physically associate with Raf-1 or p21 Ras or p23 Ra-Ras(13Wang H.-G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), this association being related to the phosphorylation status of Bcl-2 (14Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1851-1854PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, active Ras induces apoptosis in the absence of survival factors in brown adipocytes in a Raf-1-dependent and MAP kinase-independent manner. Apoptosis induced by active Ras is concurrent with a dramatic increase in Bcl-xS and a decrease in the Bcl-2 protein level. Moreover, phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein is strongly associated with Ras and Raf-1 in Ras-apoptotic cells. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the highly conserved innate mechanism by which eukaryotic cells commit suicide and plays an essential role in the normal development of vertebrates. In addition, it represents an important mechanism to help defend against emerging malignant cells, with tumor suppressor gene products and oncogenes functioning as inducers of apoptosis and transformation, respectively. However, certain dominant oncogenes, such as c-myc, have the ability to induce apoptosis, suggesting a coupling of cell growth and cell death (1Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 2Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Ras proteins are key signal transducers that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of eukaryotic cells: after extracellular factor stimulation, p21 ras initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in sequential activation of the Raf proto-oncogen product and the MEK1 and MAP kinase (MAPK) serine/theonine kinases. p21 ras is involved in IGF-I-induced proliferation of primary fetal brown adipocytes as well as in the insulin-induced differentiation of these cells (3Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Lorenzo M. Benito M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3832-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Navarro P. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 595-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ha-ras lys12-transformed brown adipocyte cell lines are constitutively differentiated cells that develop insulin resistance and overexpress Ras/Raf-1-signaling cascade (5Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Alvarez A. Benito M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1251-1259PubMed Google Scholar, 6Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Teruel T. Benito M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3195-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although Ras activation is associated primarily with proliferation and differentiation, it has also been implicated in apoptosis. In this regard, constitutive expression of activated Ha-ras in Jurkat cells (a human T lymphoblastoid cell line) renders cells susceptible to apoptosis in the absence of protein kinase C activity (7Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Serum withdrawal of Ki-ras-transformed thyroid cells induces apoptotic cell death (9Di Jeso B. Ulianich L. Racioppi L. DaÌrmiento F. Feliciello A. Pacifico F. Consiglio E. Formisano S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and overexpression of rho-p21, a GTPase protein of the Ras superfamily, causes apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells after serum deprivation (10Jimenez B. Arends M. Esteve P. Perona R. Sanchez R. Ramon Y. Cajal S. Wyllie A. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 811-816PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells overexpressing Crk-II, an adapter protein that regulates Ras activation, undergo apoptosis when deprived of serum via a Ras-dependent, Raf-1/MEK1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-independent pathway (11Parrizas M. Blakesley V.A. Beithner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, other authors found that Ras is an effective promoter of apoptosis throughout the Raf pathway (12Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to evaluate apoptosis in Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocytes under serum deprivation as well as the involvement in this process of the Ras/Raf/MAPK-signaling cascade using dominant-negative mutants or chemical inhibitors of this pathway. The molecular mechanisms that regulate apoptosis are not yet completely understood. Several genes have been identified that participate as either repressors or inducers of apoptosis. The blocker of cell death,bcl-2, is included in the first group. In mammalian species,bcl-2 gene encodes a 26-kDa protein that predominantly resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane and nuclear envelope. Recently, Bcl-2 has been reported to physically associate with Raf-1, p21 Ras, and p23 Ra-Ras (13Wang H.-G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p21 Ras and Raf-1 association with Bcl-2 is coincident with the phosphorylation status of Bcl-2. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 involved the loss of its anti-apoptotic function, affected its capacity to heterodimerize with Bax (14Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M.

Another member of the Bcl-2 family is Bcl-x, which has two alternatively spliced forms, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and the apoptotic Bcl-xS (17Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Inhibition of apoptosis by survival factors in PC12 cells is associated with increased expression of Bcl-xL gene product (18Parrizas M. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Whether Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-x expression can be controlling apoptosis in Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocytes remains to be established.

Most cell types require growth factors for growth and survival in culture; serum withdrawal causes apoptosis in PC-12 cells, Rat-1 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts (1Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S.

Primary brown adipocytes seem to be resistant to cell death under serum deprivation in a similar fashion that human white adipocytes are refractory to apoptosis (30Prins J.B. Walker N.I.

However, Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocyte cell line undergo apoptosis under serum deprivation in a time-dependent manner, as detected by DNA laddering, increase in the percentage of hypodiploid cells, and nuclei condensation and fragmentation, as compared with either immortalized or primary brown adipocytes. Moreover, transient transfection of immortalized brown adipocytes with a constitutive active Ras gene (Ha-ras lys12) and serum deprivation mimic the high rate of apoptosis detected in the transformed cell line, maintaining a high proportion of proliferating cells. Although the evidence of the role of Ras in apoptosis is contradictory, constitutive expression of oncogenic p21 Rascauses apoptosis in several cell types including Jurkat cells (7Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 11: 984-985Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this work, we described for the first time that active Ras causes apoptosis in serum-deprived brown adipocytes, a cell system constitutively refractory to apoptosis when survival signals are not prevalent. On the other hand, because active Ras is inducing apoptosis in brown adipocytes under serum deprivation, we decided to inhibit Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/MAPK pathway to rescue from apoptotic cell death. In fact, transient transfection of Ha-ras-transformed cells with a dominant-negative raf-1 DNA (pMNC-raftrp375), a kinase death mutant that block transformation by Ras oncogenes (33Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), dramatically decreases the apoptotic status of the cells, maintaining a high proportion of proliferating cells. However, treatment with MEK-1 inhibitor increases the rate of apoptosis observed in Ras apoptotic cells. Moreover, inhibition of MEK-1 causes apoptosis in Ha-ras-transformed cells under nonapoptotic conditions. Although the MEK-1 pathway is constitutively expressed in Ras apoptotic cells after 6 h of serum deprivation, MEK-1 activity is much lower compared with Ha-ras-transformed nonapoptotic cells. These results point out that Ras induces apoptosis in brown adipocytes in the presence of a remnant MAPK activity. Thus, active Ras may have either positive or negative effects on the regulation of apoptosis depending on the cell type and on the balance of the apoptotic-anti-apoptotic signaling. One pathway downstream of Ras stimulates Raf-1, an apoptotic signal for lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Alternatively, other signaling pathways downstream of Ras stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, survival signals for epithelial and myeloid cells, as recently revised by Downward (34Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In serum-deprived Ha-ras-transformed brown adipocytes, active Ras constitutively activates Raf-1 and in a lower extent, MAPKs, but fails to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Alvarez A. Benito M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1251-1259PubMed Google Scholar,6Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Teruel T. Benito M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3195-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Valverde A.M. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the balance, Ras signaling induces apoptosis in brown adipocytes in the absence of survival factors. In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate apoptosis induced by Ras, we have studied the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xS/L. Bcl-xS protein is the small splice variant of the Bcl-x protein, which is found in cells that undergo a high rate of turnover, and inhibits the protective effects on apoptosis of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (17Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our results show that under non-apoptotic conditions the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is predominant over the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS, Bcl-xL being barely expressed in our cell model. However, in ras-induced apoptotic cells, Bcl-xS protein is highly expressed, Bcl-2 protein level being dramatically decreased. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein is highly associated to Ras and Raf-1 in Ras-induced apoptotic cells, as demonstrated by the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, treatment with alkaline phosphatase decreased the Ras-associated Bcl-2 protein level, strongly suggesting that Ras/Raf-1 can form complexes with serine-threonine-phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 involves the loss of its anti-apoptotic function because phosphorylated Bcl-2 has lost its capacity to heterodimerize with Bax (16Poommipanit P.B. Chen B. Oltvai Z.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1033-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, Bcl-2 has been reported to physically associate with Raf-1 or p21 Ras or p23 Ra-Ras(13Wang H.-G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1851-1854PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, active Ras induces apoptosis in the absence of survival factors in brown adipocytes in a Raf-1-dependent and MAP kinase-independent manner. Apoptosis induced by active Ras is concurrent with a dramatic increase in Bcl-xS and a decrease in the Bcl-2 protein level. Moreover, phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein is strongly associated with Ras and Raf-1 in Ras-apoptotic cells. We thank Dr. A. Alvarez (Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain) for his expert technical assistance with the flow cytometer."
https://openalex.org/W2154246111,"The protein kinase C (PKC) family has been clearly implicated in T-cell activation as have several nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases associated with the T-cell receptor, including p59fyn. This report demonstrates that Î¸PKC and p59fyn specifically interact <i>in vitro</i>, in the yeast two-hybrid system, and in T-cells. Further indications of direct interaction are that p59fyn potentiates Î¸PKC catalytic activity and that Î¸PKC is a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation by p59fyn. This interaction may account for the localization of Î¸PKC following T-cell activation, pharmacological disruption of which results in specific cell-signaling defects. The demonstration of a physical interaction between a PKC and a protein-tyrosine kinase expands the class of PKC-anchoring proteins (receptors for activated C kinases (RACKs)) and demonstrates a direct connection between these two major T-cell-signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2027747381,"A functional element of an enzyme can be defined as the smallest unit of the local peptide backbone of which the connectivity is crucial for the catalytic activity. In order to elucidate the distribution of functional elements in an active site flexible loop (the M20 loop) of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase, systematic cleavage of main chain connectivity was performed using circular permutation. Our analysis is based on the assumption that a permutation within a functional element would significantly reduce enzyme function, whereas ones outside or at the boundaries of the elements would affect the function only slightly. Thus, a functional element would be assigned as the minimum peptide chain between the identified boundaries. Comparison of the activities of the circularly permuted variants revealed that the peptide chain around the M20 loop could be divided into four regions (regions 1-4). Region 1 was found to play an important role in overall tertiary fold because most variants permuted at region 1 did not accumulate in E. coli cells stably. A distinction between region 2 and region 3 was in agreement with the extent of movements calculated from the coordinates of alpha carbons, supporting the idea that the movement of peptide backbone is a key feature of enzyme function. The boundary between region 3 and region 4 coincided with that between the M20 loop and the following alpha helix. From equilibrium binding studies, region 2 was found to be involved in the binding of nicotinamide substrates, whereas region 4 appeared to be very important for the binding of pterin substrates."

Schlessinger J. Dione C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In contrast to other growth factor receptors such as those for EGF1 and PDGF, FGF receptors are poorly auto-phosphorylated upon ligand binding. Instead, a 90-kDa protein called SNT1 or FGF receptor substrate-2 (FRS2) (2Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 3Rabin S.J. Clegon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine sites. FRS2 has also been reported to be serine/threonine-phosphorylated in FGF-treated cell lysates (4Wang J.K. Xu H. Li H.C. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). SNT2, a recently identified isoform of FRS2, has about 50% identity to FRS2 (5Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) mainly at the N- and C-terminal ends. FRS2 and SNT2 possess a myristoylation site and a PTB domain at the N terminus. The PTB domain is responsible for the direct interaction of FRS2 and SNT1 with the juxtamembrane region of the FGFR in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. Deletion of the PTB domain of both proteins abrogates the association and tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 and SNT2 by FGF receptors (5Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6Lin H.Y. Xu J.S. Ischenko I. Ornitz D.M. Halegoua S. Hayman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3762-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). FRS2 and SNT2 substitute for their receptors as docking proteins, a role similar to that of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) in insulin signaling (7Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To date, two important signaling proteins, Grb2 and SHP-2, have been reported to bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 (2Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 8Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Grb2 is an adapter protein best known for its role in linking receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras pathway via the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos (9Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The binding of Grb2 to FRS2 occurs via the interaction of the SH2 domain of Grb2 with some or all of the potentially phosphorylated tyrosine residues at Tyr-196, Tyr-306, Tyr-349, and Tyr-392 on FRS2. Mutational studies showed that when the tyrosine residues at all 4 sites were changed to phenylalanine, the downstream MAP kinase activation was significantly reduced (2Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is a tyrosine phosphatase whose activity has been proposed to be necessary for cell growth and proliferation (10Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 11Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). When cells are stimulated with growth factors such as PDGF, SHP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (12Li W. Nishimura R. Kashisian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-2 also binds to the activated receptors via its own SH2 domain (12Li W. Nishimura R. Kashisian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, SHP-2 functions not only as a phosphatase but also serves as an adapter protein recruiting Grb2 to the receptors. Recently, SHP-2 has been reported to bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 through its N-terminal SH2 domain (8Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The association of SHP-2 with FRS2 and the activation of SHP-2 are essential for a sustained MAP kinase response as well as for the potentiation of FGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (8Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Hence, by recruiting Grb2 and SHP-2, FRS2 plays a crucial role in linking the FGF receptors to the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Apart from the Grb2 and SHP-2 proteins, the activity of the atypical PKCs (aPKCs) is necessary for mitogenic signaling via the MAP kinase cascade (13Edurne B. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Chapkin S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 14Edurne B. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There are two members in the aPKC subfamily, PKC Î» and PKC Î¶, and they share more than 75% identity. PKCs have been subdivided into 3 subfamilies, and they are distinguished by their lipid activation profiles. Conventional PKCs (cPKCs e.g.Î±, Î², and Î³) are activated by diacylglycerol and calcium; novel PKCs (nPKCs e.g. Î´, Îµ, Î·, and Î¸) do not respond to calcium but require diacylglycerol for their activation; and aPKCs are not activated by either diacylglycerol or calcium. It has been shown that MAP kinase and MEK are activated in vivo by an active mutant of PKC Î¶, and a kinase-defective dominant negative mutant of PKC Î¶ impairs the activation of both MEK and MAP kinase by serum and tumor necrosis factor (14Edurne B. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, whereas Grb2 and SHP-2 lie upstream of Ras, PKC Î¶ can bind to and act as a direct effector of Ras (15Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ras (Asn-17) severely impairs the activation of PKC Î¶ by mitogens such as PDGF in mouse fibroblasts (15Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A few groups of proteins that are either regulators or substrates of aPKCs bind to the members in this subfamily. In the first group, a protein called Zeta-InteractingProtein (ZIP) binds specifically to the regulatory domain of PKC Î¶ (16Plus A. Schimdt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas Lambda-InteractingProtein (LIP) binds specifically to the regulatory domain of PKC Î» resulting in an activation of the kinase (17Diaz-Meco M.T. Munico M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Par-4 protein also binds to the regulatory domain of PKC Î» and PKC Î¶ but inhibits their activity (18Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The second group comprises proteins like heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 protein that has been found to bind to the kinase domain of PKC Î¶ in yeast two-hybrid screening and is a specific substrate of the aPKCs (19Municio M.M. Lozano J. Sanchez P. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15884-15891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have been studying p75, a phosphotyrosine protein that is dephosphorylated and dissociates from Grb2 upon growth factor stimulation (27Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Ong S.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29892-29898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In our attempt to identify p75 by immunoprecipitating phosphotyrosyl proteins that are about 75-kDa in molecular mass, we observed that a 90-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, p90, associates specifically with members of the aPKC subfamily but not with other PKC family members. In this report, we identified the p90 protein as FRS2. We have also characterized the factors that regulate its association with the aPKCs. We propose that FRS2 plays an important role in the targeting of activated PKC Î» or Î¶ to the plasma membrane. Thus FRS2 may constitute a third group of proteins that bind to the aPKCs and localize them in specific subcellular compartments. The recruitment of aPKCs by FRS2 to the cell-surface membrane may be an important event contributing to the regulation of the aPKC activity. Monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (PY20), Grb2, SHP-2, and PKC Î» were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies against PKC Î±, Î´, and PKC Î»/Î¶ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC CCL92, Rockville, MD) were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mmglutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Human 293T kidney epithelial cells were grown in 150-mm culture dishes with RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. When the cells were about 80â90% confluent, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed and maintained for another 18â24 h in serum-free medium. Various growth factors were added to the quiescent cells prior to aspiration of the medium. The cells were then washed rapidly in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 Î¼l of lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) added according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell lysates were spun at 11,000 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C, and the supernatants were used for subsequent analyses. The protein concentrations of all cell lysates were normalized after estimation of their protein content using a BCA protein assay kit from Pierce. PKC Î»/Î¹ cDNA and HA-tagged PKC Î¶ in pCDNA3 were kind gifts from Dr. Jorge Moscat (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain). PKC Î²II cDNA and PKC Î´ cDNAs were from Dr. Alexandra Newton (University of California, San Diego) and Dr. Li Weiqun (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda), respectively. cDNAs encoding the full-length PKC Î», PKC Î» fragment A (amino acids 1â239), PKC Î» fragment B (amino acids 240â586), PKC Î¶ fragment B (amino acids 240â592), PKC Î´ fragment B (amino acids 354â701), and PKC Î²II fragment B (amino acids 345â673) were obtained by PCR. These inserts were introduced into pGEX4T1 vector for the expression of GST fusion proteins in bacterial cells. FRS2 cDNA was obtained first by reverse transcription from mRNA extracted from Swiss 3T3 cells. PCR was then carried out with the following primers, which were designed based on the published sequence of FRS2 (2Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), to obtain the full-length cDNA as follows: (forward) 5â² CGC GGA TCC GCG ATG GGT AGC TGT TGT AGC TGT CC 3â² and (reverse) 5â² CG GCGG CCGC TCA CAT GGG CAG GTC AGT ACT ATT G 3â². TheBamHI/NotI insert was introduced into pGEX4T1 and pXJ40HA for the expression of GST fusion protein in bacteria cells and HA-tagged proteins in mammalian cells, respectively. The expressed proteins were partially microsequenced and shown to be authentic. The FRS2 fragments X (amino acids 1â152), Y (amino acids 153â300), Z (amino acids 301â508), XY (amino acids 1â300), and YZ (amino acids 153â508) were obtained by PCR using the full-length FRS2 cDNA as template. All the inserts were cloned into pGEX4T1 for the expression of GST fusion proteins. Human SNT2 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Mitchell Goldfarb (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). cDNA encoding the fragment Z (amino acids 281â492) of SNT2 was obtained by PCR and cloned into pGEX4T1 for the production of GST fusion proteins. The cDNA for human FGF receptor 1 (Flg) was a kind gift from Dr. Lena Claesson-Welsh (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 398â822) of Flg was obtained by PCR and cloned into pXJ40Flag for the expression of Flag-tagged cytosolic Flg in mammalian cells. For yeast two-hybrid screening, cDNAs encoding the full-length fragment A (amino acids 1â239) and fragment B (amino acids 240â586) of PKC Î» were obtained by PCR as described above and introduced into pAS vector suitable for yeast transformation and expression of Gal4-binding domain fusion protein. SHP-2 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Tony Pawson (Mount Sinai Hospital, Ontario, Canada). Full-length FRS2 and SHP-2 were subcloned into pACT vector for yeast expression of Gal4 activation domain fusion proteins. cDNAs for the tandem SH2 domains (amino acids 1â213) and PTP catalytic domain (amino acids 214â603) of SHP-2 were obtained via PCR, and the inserts were also cloned into the pACT vector. Mutation of alanine to glutamate A120E in the pseudo-substrate site of PKC Î» was carried out using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The template used was wild-type full-length PKC Î» in pGEX4T1 and pXJ40HA. The primers used were as follows 5â² CCG GAG AGG GGA ACG CCG TGG GAG 3â² and 5â² CTC CAC CGG CGT TCC CCT CTC CGG 3â². The products were sequenced and verified to be correct. Human 293T kidney epithelial cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes as described above. Cells that were about 90% confluent were used for transfection. For single or co-transfections, 15 Î¼g of each DNA followed by 4.5 Î¼l/Î¼g DNA of TfX 50 from Promega (Madison, WI) were added to 6 ml of serum-free RPMI and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The transfection mix was then added to cells prewashed with serum-free medium and left at 37 Â°C for 1 h. After this, 12 ml of RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were left to recover for 48 h. The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and processed as described under âCell Lines, Cell Stimulation, and Cell Lysis.â All the constructs for the production of GST fusion proteins were transformed into DH5Î± cells. The transformed cells were grown in 1 liter of LB + ampicillin (50 Î¼g/ml) medium and incubated at 37 Â°C with shaking (220 rpm) to anA 600 of about 0.3. These cells were then induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature overnight. The cells were spun down and frozen at â80 Â°C. The cell pellet was then left to thaw on ice, and 10 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the cell. The cell suspension was subsequently sonicated for a total of 12 pulses of 15 s with a 30-s pause between each pulse. The lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were incubated with glutathione beads overnight at 4 Â°C to purify the GST fusion proteins. Quiescent or activated cells were lysed as described above, and an equal volume of 2Ã precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) was added to the cell lysate. For immunoprecipitation, 2.5 Î¼g of the appropriate antibodies were added to the diluted cell lysate and incubated for 1 h or overnight at 4 Â°C. 2.5 Î¼g of secondary antibodies conjugated to agarose was added to capture the immunocomplex for 1 h or overnight at 4 Â°C. In the depletion studies, the immunoprecipitation described above was repeated 5 times, each for 1.5 h. After washing, the immunoprecipitates were pooled together and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For in vitro binding assays with GST fusion proteins, 10 Î¼g of the GST fusion proteins were incubated with the lysates for 1 h or overnight at 4 Â°C. All the beads were washed 3 times with 1Ã precipitation buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2Ã Laemmli buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE. The various constructs of PKC Î» (full length, fragment A, and fragment B) in pAS were sequenced and verified to be correct before they were introduced into yeast strain 190 using the yeast transformation kit fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The transformed yeast were grown in selective media SD-Trp at 30 Â°C until colonies appeared. Single transformants then underwent a second round of transformation with the pACT vectors containing full-length FRS2, full-length SHP-2, SH2 domains, or PTP catalytic domain of SHP-2. Successful dual transformants were selected on SD-Trp/Leu, and LacZ blue assays were carried out, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to detect for protein interactions in the yeast. Yeast transformed with pCL1 expressing functional Gal4 protein turned blue between 0.5 and 1 h. This serves as a positive control for the LacZ assay. Colonies turning blue after 8 h were considered negatives according to the manufacturer's instruction. The dual transformants were also analyzed for the expression of the various proteins by first growing them in SD-Trp/Leu liquid medium. The yeast was lysed according to the transformation kit manufacturer's instructions, and the lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE. Following Western blotting, the various proteins were detected by probing with the appropriate antibodies. For activation studies of aPKCs by growth factors, Swiss 3T3 cells were either untreated or stimulated with bFGF at 20 ng/ml for 10 min. After the cells were lysed, immunoprecipitations of aPKC and subsequent in vitro kinase assays were carried out as described elsewhere (4Wang J.K. Xu H. Li H.C. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). In vitrokinase assays were also carried out either with purified PKA, PKC Î¶, PKC Î±, or PKC Î´ enzyme purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. HA-tagged A120E PKC Î» mutant and HA-tagged PKC Î» fragment B (containing the kinase domain) were also used as a source of kinase activities. In cases where the HA-tagged PKC Î» proteins were used, immunoprecipitations using HA antibodies were carried out before the kinase assays were performed. GST full-length FRS2 or GST-FRS2 fragment Z was tested as substrate for aPKCs, and hnRNPA1, a gift from Dr. Jorge Moscat (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain), and MBP were used as positive controls. All aPKCs reactions were carried out at 30 Â°C for 30 min in 20 Î¼l of buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm phenylphosphate) containing 50 ng of enzymes, 2 Î¼g of substrate, 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 50 Î¼m of ATP. The reactions for the PKC Î± and PKC Î´ were carried out in 20 Î¼l of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 50 ng of enzymes, 50 Î¼g/ml sonicated phosphatidylserine, 2 Î¼g of substrates, 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 50 Î¼m of ATP. The reaction was stopped by boiling with an equal volume of 2Ã Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Our laboratory has been characterizing p75 and its association with Grb2. In quiescent cells, p75 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2. Upon stimulation with growth factors including FGF, p75 is dephosphorylated and dissociates from Grb2 (27Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Ong S.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29892-29898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We were keen to identify p75 and decided to test existing phosphotyrosyl proteins that are about 75 kDa for dephosphorylation upon FGF treatment. One of the candidates that we selected was PKC Î´, a member of the nPKC subfamily which is about 78 kDa and is the only PKC member currently known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated (33Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.C. Wang L.M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore set out to investigate whether PKC Î´ is tyrosine-phosphorylated in quiescent cells. Representative members, namely PKC Î± and PKC Î», from the cPKC and aPKC subfamilies, respectively, were also included for comparison. Preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown that two FGF-responsive cell lines, Swiss 3T3 and PC12 cells, expressed all the three PKCs of interest. Swiss 3T3 cells were chosen for further experiments because they respond better to bFGF than PC12 cells. To examine whether PKC Î´, PKC Î±, or PKC Î» could be the p75 that undergoes dephosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation, immunoprecipitation of the various PKCs was carried out on lysates on Swiss 3T3 cells that were either untreated or stimulated with bFGF. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted. The membrane was probed with phosphotyrosine antibodies to detect for the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCs. None of the PKCs was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the lysates of quiescent cells (Fig.1 A, upper panel). The blot was stripped and re-probed either with PKC Î±, PKC Î´, or PKC Î» antibodies to show that the individual PKCs had been immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). We conclude that none of the PKCs tested are likely to be p75. In these experiments, we noted that a 90-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, similar to an FGF-specific p90 protein that has been reported to bind Grb2 (34Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), was co-immunoprecipitated with PKC Î» (Fig.1 A, upper panel). Neither PKC Î´ nor PKC Î± co-precipitated this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein significantly when compared with PKC Î» in the lysates from bFGF-stimulated cells. We therefore decided to investigate this apparently specific association. It is possible that in the experiments carried out above, differential amounts of the various PKCs were immunoprecipitated by the antibodies due to the different affinities of the individual antibodies for their respective PKCs. The apparently larger amount of p90 co-immunoprecipitated with PKC Î» may due to higher amounts of PKC Î» immunoprecipitated compared with the other PKCs. Hence, it was necessary to ensure that the majority (>80%) of each PKC was immunoprecipitated. Preliminary optimization showed that five successive rounds of immunoprecipitation were enough to deplete 80% or more of the various PKCs (data not shown). Therefore, five rounds of immunoprecipitation of PKC Î», PKC Î±, and PKC Î´ (as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ) were carried out on lysates from Swiss 3T3 cells that have been stimulated with bFGF. The immunoprecipitates were pooled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then probed with phosphotyrosine antibodies to detect p90. Fig. 1 B, top panel, shows that p90 co-immunoprecipitated only with PKC Î». The blot was stripped and cut between lanes and probed for the various PKCs immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). The amounts of the various PKCs present in the lysates before and after multiple immunoprecipitations were assessed by Western blot analyses. Fig.1 B, bottom panel, shows that more than 80% of PKC Î», PKC Î±, or PKC Î´ were immunoprecipitated. Therefore, the co-immunoprecipitation of p90 with PKC Î» is not due to a relatively larger proportion of PKC Î» being immunoprecipitated compared with PKC Î± or PKC Î´. The molecular mass and the gel migration pattern of the 90-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein resembled that of FRS2, a protein that our laboratory is currently studying. To determine whether the p90 protein was FRS2, lysates from Swiss 3T3 cells that were untreated or stimulated with bFGF were subjected to immunoprecipitation of PKC Î». The immunoprecipitates were processed as described above. The blot was first probed with phosphotyrosine antibodies revealing the 90-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-precipitating with PKC Î» upon bFGF stimulation (Fig. 1 C, top panel). The blots were stripped and re-probed with A872, a polyclonal antibody raised against FRS2. As shown in Fig. 1 C, middle panel, FRS2 co-precipitated with PKC Î» from lysates of bFGF-stimulated but not non-stimulated cells. It is noted that phosphotyrosine signal for p90 that co-immunoprecipitated with PKC Î» (Fig. 1 C, top panel) is greater than that of FRS2 co-immunoprecipitated with PKC Î» (Fig.1 C, middle panel). This is attributed to the observation that FRS2 is a multiply tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with at least 6 tyrosine phosphorylation sites. By comparing the amount of FRS2 in the"

It consists of amino acids 133â368 from the N terminus of human double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase, which is implicated in RNA editing. Zab contains two motifs with related sequence, ZÎ± and ZÎ². ZÎ± alone is capable of binding Z-DNA with high affinity, whereas ZÎ² alone has little DNA binding activity. Instead, ZÎ² modulates ZÎ± binding, resulting in increased sequence specificity for alternating (dCdG)n as compared with (dCdA/dTdG)n. This relative specificity has previously been demonstrated with short oligonucleotides. Here we demonstrate that Zab can also bind tightly to (dCdG)nstabilized in the Z form in supercoiled plasmids. Binding was assayed by monitoring cleavage of the plasmids using fusion nucleases, in which Z-DNA-binding peptides from the N terminus of double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase are linked to the nuclease domain of FokI. A fusion nuclease containing ZÎ± shows less sequence specificity, as well as less conformation specificity, than one containing Zab. Further, a construct in which ZÎ² has been replaced in Zab with ZÎ±, cleaves Z-DNA regions in supercoiled plasmids more efficiently than the wild type but with little sequence specificity. We conclude that in the Zab domain, both ZÎ± and ZÎ² contact DNA. ZÎ± contributes contacts that produce conformation specificity but not sequence specificity. In contrast, ZÎ² contributes weakly to binding affinity but discriminates between sequences of Z-DNAs.

New hypotheses were formed upon the discovery that the N terminus of ADAR11 binds to Z-DNA with high affinity (1Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). ADAR1 deaminates adenosines to inosine (functionally G) in double-stranded RNA in vitro (2Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and has been suggested to edit pre-mRNA in vivo (3Maas S. Melcher T. Seeburg P.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The substrates for A to G RNA editing remain to be enumerated; they include modulating central nervous system function by changing glutamic acid receptors (4Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar) and serotonin receptors (5Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). These editing events require the interaction between intronic sequences and the region surrounding the edited site to form the double-stranded RNA substrate; therefore editing must take place before splicing. Splicing has been shown to occur early in mRNA processing, sometimes before the termination of transcription. Movement of RNA polymerase during transcription leaves negatively supercoiled DNA in its wake, which transiently stabilizes Z-DNA. It has been proposed that Z-DNA binding may serve to target ADAR1 to regions of active transcription and thereby to nascent mRNA (6Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11595-11598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although editing events have been characterized primarily in mammals, double-stranded RNA deaminase activity has also been shown in many animal phlya (3Maas S. Melcher T. Seeburg P.H. Curr. Opin.

These motifs, called ZÎ± and ZÎ², are separated by a linker of conserved size but divergent sequence; a single known exception is in the human protein (hADAR1), where the linker has been precisely duplicated (1Herbert A.

It has recently been shown by limited proteolysis that the Z-DNA-binding region of hADAR1 is structurally organized into a bipartite domain (12Schwartz T. Lowenhaupt K. Kim Y.G. Li L. Brown II, B.A. Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2899-2906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This domain, named Zab, contains the originally identified Z-DNA-binding region, ZÎ±; a second motif, ZÎ², identified by sequence similarity (1Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); and the intervening linker. Although this entire region fulfills the definition of a protein domain, it is also possible to identify a proteolytically stable subdomain containing only ZÎ±. The DNA binding of this subdomain, named Za, has been compared with that of Zab. Za and Zab were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and tested for DNA binding by gel mobility shift assays and by the ability to stabilize short oligonucleotides in the Z conformation as shown by CD (12Schwartz T. Lowenhaupt K. Kim Y.G. Li L. Brown II, B.A. Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2899-2906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both bind to Z-DNA in the presence of large amounts of competing B-DNA. Za binds to short stretches of both (dCdG)n and (dCdA/dTdG)n, and oligonucleotides of either sequence adopt the Z form in the presence of a 2:1 base pair:peptide ratio of protein. In contrast, Zab does not bind to (dCdA/dTdG)n in these assays. Fusion nucleases have a particular utility for the study of Z-DNA-binding proteins, because they have separate domains for DNA binding and cleavage. Z-DNA in cells must exist embedded in long stretches of B-DNA. It is likely to be stabilized by supercoiling or by protein binding rather than base modification and high salt. A fusion nuclease with a specificity for binding Z-DNA will cut Z-DNA in a supercoiled plasmid at physiological salt concentrations and at modest protein:DNA ratios. The cleavage can easily be detected (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This assay has allowed us to characterize the binding of several different Z-DNA-binding peptides. A short peptide containing ZÎ± (residues 121â197), which has been described previously (1Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Two molecules of ZÎ± appear to bind together on Z-DNA and display conformational but not sequence specificity (9Herbert A. Schade M. Lowenhaupt K. Alfken J. Schwartz T. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown previously that a construct with two ZÎ± segments connected by a short flexible linker bind Z-DNA more tightly than the ZÎ± construct alone and that two molecules of ZÎ± bind to a 6-base pair Z-DNA substrate (9Herbert A. Schade M. Lowenhaupt K. Alfken J. Schwartz T. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When ZÎ± is linked to ZÎ² by the same flexible linker, the binding differed from that of the linked ZÎ±-ZÎ± construct in character, with less sensitivity to competing Z-DNA (9Herbert A. Schade M. Lowenhaupt K. Alfken J. Schwartz T. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Under low salt conditions, which emphasize nonspecific binding, Za (residues 133â209) binds slightly more specifically than the ZÎ± construct. In contrast, Zab (residues 133â368) remains extremely conformation-specific even under low stringency conditions. Both Za and Zab bind to (dCdG)n in the Z form; however, only the Za nuclease cleaves plasmids containing (dCdA/dTdG)n inserts. Further, Zaa a modified Zab construct in which ZÎ² has been replaced with ZÎ±, cleaves dramatically more efficiently than ZÎ±, Za, or Zab and shows no sequence specificity. Zaa nuclease may thus be used as a reagent to detect Z-DNA bothin vitro and in vivo. Because Zaa binds DNA with a much higher affinity than Za, we conclude that both copies of ZÎ± contribute to the binding site, as has been suggested previously (9Herbert A. Schade M. Lowenhaupt K.

These experiments support the previous interpretation of data about Zab, in which both motifs form a single binding site (12Schwartz T. Lowenhaupt K. Kim Y.G. Li L. Brown II, B.A. Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2899-2906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Within this binding site, ZÎ± contributes contacts that assure conformation specificity, whereas ZÎ² contributes additional sequence specificity. Expression clones for nuclease fusion proteins were constructed in E. coli strain RR1 starting with the vector pET15b (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The plasmids pDPL6, pDHf14, and pDHg16 (13Haniford D.B. Pulleyblank D.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 593-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), grown in XL1 Blue, were used as substrates for ZÎ± nuclease digestion. pDHf14 contains (dCdA/dTdG)30 and pDHg16 contains (dCdG)13. All E. coli strains are K12 derivatives except BL21(DE3). Clones expressing Za and Zab were constructed as described previously (12Schwartz T. Lowenhaupt K. Kim Y.G. Li L. Brown II, B.A. Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2899-2906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To separate the effects of ZÎ± and ZÎ² contacts with DNA, an additional construct was made. In Zaa, the ZÎ² motif is replaced with a second copy of ZÎ± (see Fig. 1). To construct Zaa, the expression plasmid for Za, pZa77, was cleaved with NcoI and NdeI, resulting in linear DNA extending from the NdeI site at the 5â² end of the Za gene to the NcoI site in the pET28a polylinker. DNA coding for ZÎ± and the linker region was amplified using pZab236 as a template and the T7 promoter primer and 5â²-GAGCGGATTAATAAACTCAAGAGGATCTTCC-3â² primer. The latter primer contains complementary nucleotides for residues 287â293 in hADAR1, which are located in the junction between the linker repeat and ZÎ² (see Fig. 1). The AseI site (underlined above) was used to generate NdeI compatible ends. The amplified DNA was cleaved with NcoI, which cuts within the polylinker region, and with AseI. When this DNA is ligated toNcoI-NdeI-cut pZa77, the resulting plasmid includes the restored pET28a sequences connected to ZÎ±, the linker region, and a second ZÎ±. The sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). Expressed protein was purified, and the binding activity was verified by gel mobility shift assay and BIAcore measurements (data not shown). Zaa was found to bind Z-DNA tightly and specifically. In gel mobility shift assays, one major high molecular weight complex is seen, similar to that seen for Zab. In the case of Zaa, the expression level and the amount of intact size Zaa expressed was comparable with those of Zab. This suggests that Zaa is likely to adopt a well folded structure equivalent to Zab. This observation is further supported by the results from limited proteolysis, which are consistent with Zaa being stably folded into a structure very similar to that of Zab (data not shown). The construction of pET15b:ZÎ± nuclease, the plasmid expressing ZÎ±FN, has been described previously (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The three new nucleases were constructed by replacing the ZÎ± region in this construct with the appropriate other DNA-binding domain as follows. pET15b:ZÎ± nuclease was cleaved with NcoI andXbaI to produce linear DNA extending from theXbaI site 5â² to the endonuclease domain to theNcoI site in the polylinker. pZa77, pZab236, and pZaa were used as templates to amplify DNA, with T7 primer and 3â² primer containing a XbaI site that is homologous to the region coding for the C terminus of each of the Z-DNA-binding peptides, respectively. The amplified DNA was cut with NcoI, which cuts in the polylinker region, and XbaI, which cuts within the 3â² primer. NcoI and XbaI-cleaved pET15b:ZÎ± nuclease and amplified DNA were ligated to produce three constructs; each can be expressed as a Z-DNA-binding fusion nuclease (FN). The nucleases are called ZaFN, ZaaFN, and ZabFN. Fig.1 shows the schematic diagrams of fusion nuclease constructs including Z-DNA-binding peptides. The expression of fusion nucleases has been described previously (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and were found in the supernatant after lysis. His-tagged proteins were enriched using His-Bind resin (Novagen). Fusion nucleases were further purified on MonoS cation exchange columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and, if necessary, by Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration chromatography. Nucleases were concentrated and stored at â80 Â°C in 50% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically by measurements of the absorbance maximum near 280 nm. Extinction coefficients were calculated according to Gill and Von Hippel (14Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated from XL1 Blue using the alkaline lysis method followed by Wizard Plus Mini- or Midiprep (Promega). DNA was further extracted with phenol/CHCl3 to remove residual RNase. DNAs were then precipitated and dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The concentration of DNA was determined by using Îµ260(1 mg/ml) = 20. More than 90% of the plasmids were negatively supercoiled, as judged by migration on a 1% agarose gel. Digestion of plasmid DNA with fusion nucleases were carried out under two different salt concentrations. Digestion were performed in the presence of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 50 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 Î¼g/ml E. coli tRNA, and 5% glycerol. High salt buffer contained 75 mm NaCl, whereas low salt buffer contained 15 mm NaCl. Unless otherwise specified, all reactions were performed in high salt. The reactions were preincubated with nucleases for 20 min at 22 Â°C prior to adding 10 mmMgCl2 in the case of high salt digestions or 2.5 mm MgCl2 for low salt digestions. The reactions were incubated for an additional 4 h at 22 Â°C in the presence of MgCl2 and were terminated by heating at 50 Â°C for 30 min. A second nuclease, PstI, was added to allow the mapping of specific cleavage sites. The reaction was incubated an additional 3 h at 37 Â°C. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 50 Î¼g/ml and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h. The results were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA fragments for primer extension were isolated using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The two primers for primer extension, EcoRI primer, 5â²-GTATCACGAGGCCCT-3â² (#1204), and SalI primer, 5â²-AGTCATGCCCCGCGC-3â² (#1208), were purchased from New England Biolabs. The primers were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [Î³-32P]ATP. The reaction contained 10â20 ng of DNA, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 26 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 200 Î¼m of each dNTP, 100,000â200,000 cpm of primer, and 1.5 units of Thermosequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 8 Î¼l. A single cycle of 4 min at 95 Â°C, 1 min at 55 Â°C, and 1 min at 72 Â°C was used for primer extension. The reaction was quenched with 4 Î¼l of stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF). The results were analyzed by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis, using sequencing lanes as markers. Za and other similar constructs containing ZÎ± bind to a variety of sequences in the Z conformation. At micromolar concentrations, Za is able to stabilize oligonucleotides with either (dCdG)n or (dCdA/dTdG)n sequences in the Z conformation equally well (9Herbert A. Schade M. Lowenhaupt K. Alfken J. Schwartz T. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,12Schwartz T. Lowenhaupt K. Kim Y.G. Li L. Brown II, B.A. Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2899-2906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, Zab binds poorly, if at all, to (dCdA/dTdG)nsequences. Because this occurs even at high concentrations of Zab, this binding may reflect true sequence specificity rather than energetic considerations. It is possible to test the sequence specificity of Zab by using DNA substrates in which Z-DNA is stabilized by something other than protein binding. This is accomplished in supercoiled plasmids containing appropriate inserts (13Haniford D.B. Pulleyblank D.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 593-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To compare the binding of Za and Zab, fusion nucleases were constructed with each of these proteins. A previously described ZÎ± fusion nuclease, containing a Z-DNA-binding region more susceptible to proteolytic digestion (12Schwartz T. Lowenhaupt K. Kim Y.G. Li L. Brown II, B.A. Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2899-2906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), has been shown to cleave supercoiled plasmids containing (dCdG)13 inserts (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The newly constructed nucleases, ZaFN and ZabFN, respectively, both cleave the (dCdG)13-containing plasmid, pDHg16, to a similar degree, as shown in Fig.2. Fig. 2 also shows the cleavage of pDHf14, a homologous plasmid with a (dCdA/dTdG)30 insert. Although the extent of cleavage is small, it can be seen that ZaFN cleaves this plasmid at concentrations between 200 and 100 nm. The limited cleavage at the (dCdA/dTdG)30 insert with ZaFN as compared with (dCdG)13 may be accounted for because only some of the plasmids contain Z-DNA at bacterial superhelical density. A higher torsional free energy is required to cause a B-Z transition for (dCdA/dTdG)30 than for (dCdG)13 (13Haniford D.B. Pulleyblank D.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1983; 1: 593-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to ZaFN, ZabFN shows less cleavage of pDHf14 in all concentrations. ZabFN cuts much less efficiently near the (dCdA/dTdG)30 insert than ZaFN, although both nucleases cut (dCdG)13 in similar amounts, supporting the hypothesis that Zab binds to Z-DNA in a sequence-specific manner. This sequence specificity is unlikely to result from contacts between the linker region, which is not conserved in ADAR1 from different species. Instead contacts between ZÎ² and DNA may be implicated. It is also possible that the sequence specificity may result from altering the position of the DNA with respect to ZÎ± in the larger construct, thereby altering the nature of the binding. ZÎ² was first identified by its sequence similarity to ZÎ± (1Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). 17 of 72 amino acid residues are identical, and 20 are conservative changes. If the differences between the binding of Z-DNA by Za and Zab are the result of rearranging the protein-DNA interaction, then replacing ZÎ² with ZÎ± in Zab may have little or no effect. On the other hand, if contacts made by ZÎ² are responsible for these differences, such replacement should result in a peptide that combines the affinity of two ZÎ±s but remains sequence nonspecific. This replacement was carried out as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ to produce Zaa and ZaaFN. Zaa could be expressed and purified under identical conditions used for Za and Zab. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the cleavage by ZaFN, ZabFN, and ZaaFN, as well as the previously characterized ZÎ±FN. Plasmids containing a (dCdG)13 insert were incubated with enzymes and then subsequently cut with PstI. Two diagnostic bands (open arrows) are produced when the plasmid is also cleaved next to the Z-DNA insert by the fusion nuclease. ZÎ±FN cleaves at the insert but also produces a number of other bands as the result of cleavage at non-Z-DNA sites. ZaFN cleaves more effectively, as shown by the increased amount of specific product. Some nonspecific cleavage can also be detected but considerably less than that seen for ZÎ±FN. The amount of cleavage seen for ZabFNis roughly equivalent to that seen for ZaFN; however, the nonspecific product bands are absent, and the overall level of nonspecific cleavage is dramatically reduced. ZaaFN shows increased activity; even at the lowest enzyme concentration, more than 50% of the substrate is specifically cleaved. Like ZabFN, ZaaFN shows decreased nonspecific cleavage. Unlike ZabFN, ZaaFN cleaves at Z-DNA formed by different sequences (Fig. 4). Like ZaFN, ZaaFN cleaves a plasmid with a (dCdA/dTdG)30 insert, albeit only to a limited extent. Both ZÎ±FN and ZaFN produce noticeable degradation of this plasmid at nonspecific sites, as visualized by the other bands near the full-length band. This nonspecific cutting is more pronounced on the (dCdA/dTdG)30-containing plasmid than on the same plasmid without the insert (Fig. 4, pDHf14). The explanation for this is unknown; however, it may be the result of an interaction between ZÎ± or Za and the insert sequence, which is of insufficient duration or affinity to allow specific cleavage but still enough to raise the level of background cleavage. As demonstrated above, both ZaFN and ZÎ±FN cut plasmids with less specificity than either ZabFN or ZaaFN in high salt condition. This is the result of lower specificity of binding by peptides containing only a single motif, as verified in direct measurements of binding by gel mobility shift assay and BIAcore (data not shown). In gel shift assays, Zab binds equally well in the presence or absence of 1,000-fold B-DNA competitor; the protein can be pre-incubated with the competitor without effect. In contrast, ZÎ± and Za show some inhibition of binding in the presence of 1,000-fold B-DNA competitor. This inhibition is significantly enhanced by pre-incubating the protein with the B-DNA before the Z-DNA probe is added (data not shown). To further demonstrate this difference, plasmid containing the (dCdG)13 insert was cleaved with each fusion nuclease under low salt conditions. Lowering the salt enhances cleavage. However, pilot experiments with ZÎ±FN showed a high level of nonspecific cleavage; therefore, low salt conditions were considered suboptimal for that system. Fig. 5 shows the result of using the low stringency conditions. ZÎ±FNproduces almost no specific product at any concentration. At 100 nm, the plasmid is found as small rapidly migrating nonspecific fragments at the bottom of the gel. The nuclease containing a more structurally defined binding domain, ZaFN, produces specific products at 50 nm, but the background remains high, and further dilution results in the loss of all activity. In contrast, ZaaFN has less nonspecific activity than Za at 100 nm and cuts with good specificity at 50 and 25 nm. Zab has the largest difference in binding specificity. The total activity of ZabFN is less than that seen for ZaaFN; however, even at 100 nm the cleavage shows some specificity. Fig. 6 shows the mapping of the plasmid cleavage at nucleotide resolution using each of the nucleases discussed. Cleaved plasmids were used as templates for primer extension. Two primers were used, one for each strand. Cleavage by the fusion nuclease results in preferential stop sites, which are mapped relative to sequencing lanes using the same primers. The experiments shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 reveal only double-stranded breaks, whereas primer extension experiments show both double- and single-stranded breaks. Fig. 6 (A and B) shows the results using pDHg16, the plasmid with the (dCdG)13 insert. The primer is positioned at the bottom in both cases. The overall pattern of cleavage is similar for all the nucleases. Strong sites map between 5 and 20 bases outside the region of alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence. This is in agreement with studies of other fusion nucleases, which show cleavage 1â2 helical turns away from the binding site for Ubx and zinc finger nucleases (15Kim Y.G. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Kim Y.G. Cha J. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity of sites may in part be the result of heterogeneity of B-Z junctions in this plasmid, as shown by Johnston and Rich (17Johnston B.H. Rich A. Cell. 1985; 42: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). No cleavage is seen within the region of Z-DNA. Such cleavage might be expected if the binding domain were situated at random within the insert; however, the simplest interpretation is that the FokI nuclease, like many others, is unlikely to cut within Z-DNA (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The differences in the extent of cleavage with the different nucleases are not unexpected in light of the results shown in Fig. 3. Sites on both sides of the insert can be seen using the SalI primer (Fig. 6 B); using theEcoRI primer, only upstream sites are evident (Fig.6 A). This may be the result of extensive upstream cutting, as will be discussed for ZaaFN. ZaFN and ZabFN show nearly identical patterns, with preferred sites visible on both sides of the insert in both directions. The total extent of cleavage is moderate. There are some differences in intensity between different sites when these two nucleases are compared. ZabFN cleaves distant sites more strongly than the other nucleases (Fig. 6, A andB, designated by asterisks). These differences are reproducible. They may be the result of differences in the size of the binding domain construct and the position on Z-DNA. It is also possible that the difference in preference reflects a difference in ability to bind to junction sequences that may adopt the Z-conformation. ZaaFN cuts at the same sites as the other nucleases. Only sites upstream of the insert are visualized with the EcoRI primer (Fig. 6 A), and downstream sites are underrepresented with the SalI primer as well. This can be explained if the higher level of cleavage with this nuclease results in plasmid molecules that are multiply nicked or cut. Such plasmids will only template for primer extension to the major upstream sites. In addition, cleavage with ZaaFN produces several additional bands, mapping very close to the B-Z junction (Fig. 6 B, open box). Perhaps the binding of Zaa to Z-DNA is stable enough to allow less favorable, slower cleavage by FokI nuclease very close to the Z-DNA or the B-Z junction. Fig. 6 (C and D) shows the map of cleavage sites around a (dCdA/dTdG)30 insert. Only ZaaFN cuts well enough for data to be collected. Cutting is shown flanking the insert and even encroaching into it. The superhelical density of the plasmid is probably not sufficient to maintain the entire insert in the Z form (17Johnston B.H. Rich A. Cell. 1985; 42: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a notable asymmetry of cleavage for the (dCdA/dTdG)30 insert (Fig. 6 E). Cleavage is much stronger 5â² to (dCdA) and 3â² to (dTdG). This cleavage is likely to reflect an asymmetric binding between ZÎ± and this DNA sequence, with both copies in Zaa aligned to reinforce this asymmetry. Fusion nucleases are potent tools to characterize the DNA binding of protein domains. Cleavage by the nuclease moiety is a measure of the specificity and affinity of the binding domain (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Kim Y.G. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we characterize Z-DNA binding, using nucleases that combine the endonuclease domain of FokI restriction enzyme with various constructs from the N-terminal end of hADAR1. This region has been shown to bind Z-DNA with high affinity and specificity (1Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and the domain structure has been mapped (12Schwartz T. Lowenhaupt K. Kim Y.G. Li L. Brown II, B.A. Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2899-2906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we examine the role of subdomains in the binding to Z-DNA. Any of several constructs containing the Z-DNA-binding motif ZÎ± can bind to Z-DNA. High affinity binding does not require the entire subdomain, but Za binding is more Z-DNA-specific than that of truncated constructs. The complete domain, Zab, contains both ZÎ± and ZÎ² motifs with the intervening linker and binds with greater specificity as shown in experiments with B-DNA competitor. It also appears to be more selective for sequence. Our experiments make it unlikely that the specificity for sequence is the result of a requirement for different binding energies needed to stabilize different sequences in the Z form. These experiments were conducted using supercoiling to stabilize the Z conformation, a situation thought to reflect what occurs in vivo. It has been shown previously that ZÎ± provides most of the binding affinity in Zab (11Kim Y.G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When Zab is bisected with chymotrypsin to separate ZÎ± and ZÎ² containing subdomains, the resulting DNA binding is identical to that of the ZÎ±-containing piece alone. This result is supported by our demonstration that when ZÎ² is replaced in Zab with ZÎ±, the resulting construct Zaa binds much more tightly than either Za or Zab. The binding is appropriate for the additive effects of two copies of Za. Further, it had been suggested that ZÎ² might modify the binding of ZÎ± to produce the sequence specificity of Zab. Again, the results from Zaa support this theory; Zaa binds to Z-DNA of different sequences, as does Za. On the other hand, there is evidence that Zaa has sequence specificity; when the cleavage sites are mapped on the nonpalindromic substrate, (dCdA/dTdG)30, there is an asymmetry of cleavage. It is possible that Zaa makes some base-specific contacts that result in this bias. The specific cleavage sites in a plasmid containing a Z-DNA insert are generally the same using ZaFN, ZabFN or ZaaFN. However, some differences in the frequency with which each site is used are observed. ZabFN prefers sites that are further from the edge of the insert, whereas ZaFNand ZaaFN prefer the nearer sites. This preference may be explained by differences in the C-terminal residues between Za and Zaa, which are the same, and Zab. These residues may orient the nuclease domain differently, such that it more easily makes contact with substrate DNA at different sites. Such a result of altered C-terminal residues has been shown previously for two zinc finger DNA-binding domains in fusion nuclease constructs (16Kim Y.G. Cha J. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 20Kim Y.G. Shi Y. Berg J.M. Chandrasegaran S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, ZaaFN has unique cleavage sites, very close to the edge of the insert. These sites may result from the tighter binding seen for this construct, which could allow the nuclease to cleave at less favorable spots. Different binding domains may favor slightly different positions on Z-DNA. Possibly, these positions reflect different B-Z junction points. However, it is likely that ZÎ± and ZÎ² are positioned in Zab similarly with respect to the DNA. When ZÎ² is replaced with ZÎ±, the resulting construct remains stably folded without major changes to the structure, as shown by limited proteolysis (data not shown). The second copy of ZÎ± probably binds Z-DNA at a position similar to that of ZÎ². One goal of research into fusion nucleases containing a Z-DNA-binding domain is the need for useful reagents to identify Z-DNA in vivo. The original construct, ZÎ±FN, showed some promise, but the specificity and affinity were not high enough to be useful. ZabFN, which demonstrates the highest specificity for the Z conformation, may prove useful; however, the sequence specificity is likely to limit its usefulness. ZaaFN is a more likely candidate for an all-purpose reagent to detect Z-DNA. It is capable of cleaving supercoiled (dCdG)n nearly to completion. It can recognize (dCdA/dTdG)n and mixed sequences (data not shown) in the Z form. Future experiments expressing ZaaFNin eukaryotic cells and examining both reporter genes and endogenous genes may prove of interest. We thank Drs. S. Maas, B. Brown, and A. Herbert for helpful discussions."

Here, we investigated the action of BFA on Ca2+-regulated exocytosis in single rat adrenal chromaffin cells.

To examine whether BFA altered the Ca2+-dependence of exocytosis, we employed the whole-cell recording technique in conjunction with the capacitance measurement to measure exocytosis evoked from the entire cell during voltage-gated Ca2+ entry. Our results suggested that BFA treatment did not alter either the initial rate of capacitance increase or the total amount of capacitance increase.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This effect of BFA is at least partially mediated via the inhibition of guanine nucleotide exchange activity of a class of small monomeric GTP-binding proteins called ADP-ribosylating factors (ARFs) (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are at least six forms of ARF proteins. Among the ARF proteins, ARF1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and is postulated to be involved in the recruitment of cytosolic coat proteins to membranes during transport vesicle formation (5Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The functions of the other ARFs are less well studied but may include regulation of phospholipase D (6Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Troung O.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Other than the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus, BFA has been reported to inhibit peptide or protein secretion (9Hendricks L.C. McClanahan S.L. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Fischer T.A. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Singi K. de Zengotita J. de Ugarte D. Alali A. Gadbut A.P. Lee M.A. Balligand J.-L. Kifor I.

Res. 1997; 22: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These actions were postulated to be secondary to the effect of BFA on membrane trafficking. BFA has also been reported to have actions that may be unrelated to membrane trafficking. For example, Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in rat melanotropes was inhibited by intracellular dialysis of BFA (10 Î¼m), and this acute effect could be mimicked by intracellular dialysis of peptide fragment derived from residues 46â61 of ARF (12Rupnik M. Law G.J. Northrop A.J. Mason W.T. Zorec R. NeuroReport. 1995; 6: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In rat intestinal smooth muscle cells, BFA (150 Î¼m) reversibly inhibited the voltage-gated Ca2+ current (13Loirand G. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C816-C821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In planar lipid bilayer, BFA has also been reported to cause formation of small (<15-picosiemens) cation channels (14Zizi M. Fisher R.S. Grillo F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18443-18445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have employed carbon fiber amperometry to examine the effects of BFA on quantal catecholamine release from rat chromaffin cells. We have also measured [Ca2+]i and membrane capacitance simultaneously to examine whether BFA affects Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Under the condition that BFA had clearly disassembled the Golgi apparatus, we found that BFA increased the quantal size of catecholamine release and dramatically increased the proportion of âstand alone signals,â which probably arise from slow release of catecholamine via fusion pores that never dilate completely. However, BFA had no significant effects on the Ca2+ dependence of exocytosis. BFA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was kept as stock solution (10 mm) in ethanol and stored at â20 Â°C. Immediately before use, BFA was diluted to 1 or 10 Î¼mwith Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). C6-NBD-ceramide and indo-1 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Indo-1FF was purchased from Teflabs (Austin, TX). Collagenase, deoxyribonuclease, hyaluronidase, and concanavalin A were purchased from Sigma. Rat chromaffin cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (15Park Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 481: 555-570Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, adrenal medullas were removed from male Sprague Dawley rats (200â250 g) killed with halothane in accordance with the standards of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The medullas were dissociated enzymatically in a modified Hanks' solution containing collagenase type I (3.0 mg/ml), hyaluronidase type I-S (2.4 mg/ml), and deoxyribonuclease type I (0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Single chromaffin cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with either 1% gelatin and 1.6 mg/ml concanavalin A or 0.25 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. The cells were maintained in standard culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. All electrochemical and electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature (21â24 Â°C) on cells maintained in culture for 1â4 days. The Golgi stacks of living chromaffin cells were stained by C6-NBD-ceramide, a fluorescent lipid that has been demonstrated to label the Golgi apparatus in living cells reliably (16Lipsky N.G. Pagno R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat chromaffin cells were incubated with C6-NBD-ceramide (10 mmol/liter) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.68 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 37 Â°C. After washing off the C6-NBD-ceramide, the cells were bathed in standard bath solution (see below) for 30 min at 37 Â°C. The stained cells were then observed under a fluorescent microscope via a 63Ã objective. For BFA pretreatment, the cells were first incubated with 1 or 10 Î¼m BFA for 2 h at 37 Â°C before staining with C6-NBD-ceramide. Otherwise, BFA was applied to stained cells acutely for the duration indicated. Amperometry with carbon fiber electrodes was performed on single chromaffin cells to monitor real-time release of catecholamine molecules during exocytosis of vesicle (17Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.D. Near J.A. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The fabrication of carbon fiber electrodes (tip diameter of 7 Î¼m) was as described in Refs. 18Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholarand 19Zhou Z. Misler S. Chow R.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1543-1552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar. During the recording, the tip of the carbon fiber electrode was positioned such that it was touching the cell surface. A 700-mV potential (D.C.) was applied to the carbon fiber electrode, using a VA-10 Voltammeter (NPI Electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany). The amperometric current was filtered at 1 kHz, stored on videocassette recorder tapes with a NeuroData PCM recorder (Neuro Data Corp., New York, NY), and digitized at 10 kHz later. Cells were initially bathed in the standard bath solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mm glucose, and 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4). To trigger catecholamine release, cells were perfused with 50 mm KCl isotonic solution (the [K+] in the standard bath solution was increased to 50 mm by decreasing equal [Na+]). Amperometric events were analyzed with software developed by Drs. Robert H. Chow and Zhuan Zhou (19Zhou Z. Misler S. Chow R.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1543-1552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For combined fluorimetry and electrochemical measurement, cells were incubated with 5 Î¼m indo-1-AM in the standard bath solution for 30 min at 37 Â°C, followed by at least 15 min in dye-free solution at room temperature (â¼23 Â°C) before [Ca2+]imeasurement. For combined fluorimetry and capacitance measurement, 100 Î¼m of the pentapotassium salt of indo-1 (for [Ca2+]i elevations <3 Î¼m) or indo-1-FF (for [Ca2+]i elevations >3 Î¼m) was included in the internal recording solution and dialyzed into the cell through whole-cell pipettes. Fluorescence signals were measured at 405 and 500 nm by photomultipliers, and the ratio of fluorescence (405 nm/500 nm) was used to calculate [Ca2+]i according to the equation (20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i=K*(RâRmin)/(RmaxâR)Equation 1 where all three calibration constants,R min, R max, andK* were determined in situ for both indo-1 and indo-1-FF by dialyzing various solutions of known Ca2+concentration into cells as described previously (21Tse A. Tse F.W. Hille B. Pflugers Arch. 1995; 430: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Horstmann H. Almers W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The values for R min, R max, andK* were 0.27, 2.82, and 2.54 Î¼m for indo-1 and 0.21, 1.49, and 29.4 Î¼m for indo-1-FF. Membrane currents were recorded with the whole-cell gigaseal method (23Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 397: 85-100Crossref Scopus (15060) Google Scholar) using an EPC-7 amplifier. Pipettes were made from hematocrit glass (VWR Scientific, London, Ontario, Canada), and the resistance was 2â3 megaohms after being filled with pipette solution. In experiments where exocytosis was triggered via short depolarizing voltage steps, [Ca2+]i in the standard bath solution was increased to 10 mm. In addition, tetradotoxin (0.5 Î¼m) and apamin (0.4 Î¼m) were included in the bath solution to block Na+ currents and the small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ currents, respectively. The standard pipette solution contained 135 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 20 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na2-ATP, 0.3 mm GTP, and 0.1 mm indo-1 or indo-1-FF (pH 7.4). To measure membrane capacitance changes (ÎC m), which reflected the addition of plasma membrane and hence exocytosis at high temporal resolution, we employed a software-based phase-sensitive detector (Pulse Control) (24Herrington J. Bookman R.J. Pulse Control V: Igor XOPs for Patch Clamp Data Acquisition. University of Miami Press, Miami, FL1994Google Scholar) developed by Drs. Jack Herrington and Richard Bookman (University of Miami, Miami, FL). A 30-mV, 822-Hz sinusoidal wave was added to the holding potential (â90 mV D.C.). The resulting current signal at two orthogonal phase angles was analyzed to generate an output for changes in cell capacitance (ÎC m) and another output, ÎG, which reflects changes in membrane conductance, electrode seal, and series resistance. To reduce contamination in the capacitance signal due to the gating of Na+ channels (25Horrigan F.T. Bookman R.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1119-1129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), all capacitance recordings were subtracted with the capacity transient in response to a 5-ms depolarization delivered to the same cell. Each treatment with BFA was compared with control cells from the same batch(es) of culture. On each experimental day, recordings were performed alternately on BFA-treated and control cells. The number of cells as well as the number of cultures pooled for each comparison are indicated in the figure legends. All mean values are given as mean Â± S.E. In order to determine whether the BFA effect is statistically significant, a Student's t test for two independent populations was performed on data collected from BFA-treated cells and control cells of the same batches. All t values with (p < 0.05) were considered statistically significant. We have chosen to examine the effects of BFA while the Golgi apparatus was disassembled. To determine the experimental conditions under which BFA would cause the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus, we employed a fluorescent ceramide (C6-NBD-ceramide) that reliably labels the Golgi membranes in living cells (16Lipsky N.G. Pagno R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In control chromaffin cells, the fluorescence of C6-NBD-ceramide was always confined to a small region adjacent to the nucleus. Acute application of BFA (10 Î¼m) for 5â10 min at room temperature did not cause any significant change in the pattern of staining. In contrast, in cells pretreated with 1 or 10 Î¼m BFA for 2 h (at 37 Â°C), the fluorescence became dispersed all over the cytoplasm (except the nucleus). Thus, a 2-h incubation with BFA at 37 Â°C was sufficient to disrupt the Golgi apparatus in most chromaffin cells (>90%). Although BFA was removed from the cells during the time of staining (40 min at 37 Â°C), the dispersed fluorescence persisted throughout our observation (30 min, at room temperature). Thus, it is likely that, at room temperature, the BFA-induced morphological changes in the Golgi stacks can persist for at least 1 h following BFA removal. In this study, we performed electrochemical and/or electrophysiological experiments on cells treated with BFA under three conditions. First, we applied BFA acutely during the experiment (3â5 min at room temperature) to examine whether BFA had any acute effects on quantal release or exocytosis before changes in the Golgi morphology could occur. Second, we pretreated the cells with BFA for 2 h (at 37 Â°C) and then performed measurements within 1 h (at room temperature) following BFA removal to examine the persistent effects of BFA. Last, we performed experiments on cells continuously exposed to BFA (2 h at 37 Â°C, followed by <1 h at room temperature) to investigate whether the continuous presence of BFA might have more prominent effects. Fig.1 shows a typical recording obtained from a cell pretreated with 10 Î¼m BFA for 2 h. The resting [Ca2+]i in control cells was typically between 50 and 300 nm, and all of the BFA treatments did not affect this value in the vast majority of the cells (95â99%). For all electrochemical experiments, we selected cells with resting [Ca2+]i around 100 nm. We applied 50 mm K+ to depolarize the cell to trigger voltage-gated Ca2+ entry and catecholamine secretion. Following the perfusion of high extracellular [K+], [Ca2+]i rose from the resting level (â¼100 nm) to the micromolar range. In the continuous presence of high [K+], [Ca2+]i remained elevated at a level of 300â500 nm. The [Ca2+]i elevation was accompanied by amperometric spikes that reflected quantal release of catecholamines (17Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.D. Near J.A. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Similar patterns of [Ca2+]i rise and amperometric signals were observed in control cells (n = 28), cells acutely exposed to 10 Î¼m BFA (n = 6), cells pretreated with 1 (n = 8) or 10 Î¼m BFA (n = 7), and cells exposed continuously to BFA 10 Î¼m (n = 6). The frequency and total number of amperometric spikes recorded in the first few minutes varied among cells. Typically, during the first 2 min of stimulation with high extracellular [K+], 100â400 amperometric spikes could be recorded from an individual cell. The similar pattern of [Ca2+]i rise and amperometric signals in control and BFA-treated cells during application of high [K+] suggested that BFA treatment had no dramatic effect on the voltage-gated Ca2+ entry and the triggering of catecholamine release. However, detailed analysis of individual amperometric spikes suggested that BFA might have some major actions on the quantal release of catecholamines. Fig.2 plots the frequency histograms of quantal charge (time integral of individual amperometric spike) in control cells, and in cells pretreated with 1 or 10 Î¼mBFA. Note that in cells pretreated with 10 Î¼m BFA, the proportion of amperometric spikes with large quantal charge (>2 pC) was increased. Concomitantly, the proportion of amperometric spikes with small charge (<0.2 pC) was reduced. The effect of 10 Î¼m BFA pretreatment could be clearly observed in the cube-root transformation (charge 13; Fig. 2 B), or the log transformation (log(charge); Fig. 2C), of the quantal charge histogram. Both of these transformations are expected to convert the quantal charge distribution into a normal distribution (26Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Cahill P.S. Huang L. Zerby S.E. Ewing A.G. Kennedy R.T. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Pothos E.N. Przedborski S. Davila V. Schmitz Y. Sulzer D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5575-5585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Note that in comparison with the controls, the mean value of quantal charge 13 in cells pretreated with 10 Î¼m BFA was increased by â¼1.2-fold (from 0.66 Â± 0.01 to 0.78 Â± 0.01 pC 13), and the log (charge) was increased by 0.22 log unit (from â0.63 Â± 0.02 to â0.41 Â± 0.02). These correspond to a â¼1.7-fold increase in mean quantal charge after 10 Î¼mBFA pretreatment. Fig. 3 summarizes the mean values of quantal charge 13 of control cells and cells subjected to different BFA treatments. Note that in comparison with the controls, pretreatment or continuous exposure of 10 Î¼mBFA increased the mean of quantal charge 13 by more than 1.2-fold. However, acute application of 10 Î¼m BFA had no significant effect in the mean quantal charge. These results suggest that prolonged BFA treatment is needed to alter the quantal charge in chromaffin cells. The similarity between the BFA-pretreated cells and the continuously treated cells suggests that at room temperature, the BFA-induced increase in quantal charge cannot be reversed in 1 h. This effect of BFA also appeared to be concentration-dependent. In cells pretreated with 1 Î¼m BFA (Fig. 2), there was an increase in the proportion of spikes with large total charge, but neither the cube root (0.67 Â± 0.01 pC 13) nor the log (â0.62 Â± 0.02) of quantal charge showed any significant difference from those in control cells.Figure 3The BFA effect on quantal size of vesicles depends on the concentration and duration of treatment. For each BFA treatment, the mean value of cube roots of quantal charge is normalized to that of control cells from the same batch(es). Theasterisks denote BFA treatments that exhibit significant increase in mean quantal charge when compared with control (p < 0.05). The number of cell cultures used in each comparison is as follows: acute treatment of 10 Î¼m BFA (1Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), pretreatment with 1 Î¼m BFA (2Fullekrug J. Sonnichsen B. Schafer U. Van P.N. Soling H.-D. Mieskes G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), pretreatment with 10 Î¼m BFA (2Fullekrug J. Sonnichsen B. Schafer U. Van P.N. Soling H.-D. Mieskes G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), continuous treatment with 10 Î¼mBFA (1Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). The number of cells for each comparison (control:treatment) is as follows: acute treatment of 10 Î¼m BFA (7:6), pretreatment with 1 Î¼m BFA (8:8), pretreatment with 10 Î¼m BFA (8:7), and continuous treatment with 10 Î¼m BFA (5:6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 4 shows the amplitude, rise time (the time between 50 and 90% of the peak amplitude), and the half-width (duration of the amperometric signal at 50% of its peak amplitude) of the control and BFA-pretreated cells. Note that in cells pretreated with 10 Î¼m BFA, there was an increase in the proportion of amperometric spikes with large amplitude (e.g.>300 pA; Fig. 4 A), slow rise time (e.g. >3 ms; Fig. 4 B), and long half-width (e.g. >10 ms; Fig.4 C). Similar effects were also observed in cells exposed continuously to 10 Î¼m BFA but not for cells acutely exposed to 10 Î¼m BFA (data not shown). As in Fig. 2, the change in cells pretreated with 1 Î¼m BFA was less obvious. Overall, the patterns of change caused by BFA are consistent with an increase in the amount of catecholamine released during an average spike (quantum) and in the proportion of quanta with a slower kinetics of release. Consistent with previous studies in chromaffin cells and other catecholamine-secreting cells (28Chow R.H. von Ruden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 29de Toledo G.A. Fernadez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M.

Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-275Google Scholar, 31Bruns D. Jahn R. Nature. 1995; 377: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), some of the amperometric spikes we recorded are preceded by a âfootâ signal (Fig. 5 A), reflecting transmitter leakage through an early fusion pore that does not dilate immediately. In control cells, the occurrence of the foot signals was 19 Â± 2% of all amperometric events. Interestingly, BFA treatment increased the occurrence of the foot signals (summarized in Fig. 5 B). This increase is statistically significant in cells exposed to 10 Î¼m BFA acutely, continuously, or in pretreatment. Previous electrochemical studies also demonstrated the existence of stand alone signals in amperometry (Fig. 5 C), which represent openings of fusion pores that never dilate but flicker before closing (19Zhou Z. Misler S. Chow R.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1543-1552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Chow R.H. von Ruden L. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-275Google Scholar, 31Bruns D. Jahn R. Nature. 1995; 377: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These stand alone signals typically have a rapid rise time and have rapid current fluctuations that clearly exceed the base-line noise. Except for the absence of a following spike, they are similar to foot signals in both temporal and amplitude characteristics. Under normal conditions, the stand alone signals are rarely observed in chromaffin cells (0.8 Â± 0.3% of all amperometric signals in our control cells; also see Ref. 30Chow R.H. von Ruden L. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-275Google Scholar). BFA treatments (10 Î¼m; pretreatment or continuous treatment), however, significantly increased the frequency of the stand alone signals (Fig. 5 D). The results above suggested that BFA caused a change in the quantal size as well as the kinetics of catecholamine release in some vesicles. We further examined whether BFA affected the Ca2+ dependence of exocytosis. In this series of experiments, single chromaffin cells were whole-cell voltage-clamped at â90 mV (D.C.). Exocytosis was triggered by a 250- or 500-ms depolarization to +10 mV to stimulate extracellular Ca2+entry via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The rise in cell-averaged [Ca2+]i was measured by the ratiometric fluorescent indicator indo-1 or indo-1-FF, while the triggered exocytosis was monitored as changes in membrane capacitance. Fig. 6 shows a typical experiment in control cells. During the depolarization, Ca2+ current (I Ca; peak amplitude, â¼250 pA) was activated, and it was accompanied by a rise in [Ca2+]i and an increase in membrane capacitance (ÎC m), which reflects exocytosis. Following the termination of the voltage step, [Ca2+]i decayed slowly and remained above 1 Î¼m for >3 s. Meanwhile, the membrane capacitance continued to increase slowly for â¼300 ms and then started to decline. Note that the gradual decrease in ÎC m actually overshot the original resting value. This pattern of ÎC m decrease has been interpreted as endocytosis of the âexcessive retrievalâ type (32Engisch K.L. Nowycky M.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 591-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Smith C. Neher E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and is typically observed following a large [Ca2+]i elevation. In our analysis, we used both the capacitance increase during the depolarizing pulse (referred to as the âC mjumpâ) and the âtotal C m riseâ (the sum ofC m jump and any C m rise following the depolarizing pulse) as indices of exocytosis evoked by a single depolarization (Fig. 5). Similar experiments were repeated on cells treated with BFA. We first examined Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in cells pretreated with 1 Î¼m BFA, a treatment that clearly disrupted the Golgi apparatus but caused no significant increase in quantal size. Fig. 7 summarizes the relationship between [Ca2+]i and exocytosis in control cells and cells pretreated with 1 Î¼m BFA. Since chromaffin cells vary in size (3.0â8.2 pF), both theC m jump and the total C m rise were normalized by cell surface area (initial C m) and expressed as percentage increase in cell capacitance. The relationship between exocytosis and the peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient was plotted in Fig. 7,A and B. Since exocytosis was triggered by Ca2+ entry via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, our measurements of average cytosolic [Ca2+] may underestimate the local [Ca2+] near the vesicles. Therefore, we also plotted the relationship between exocytosis and Ca2+ entry during the depolarization in Fig. 7,C and D. The Ca2+ entry during depolarization was estimated by the time integral ofI Ca and normalized to individual cell volume. In this series of experiments, 57 control cells and 32 cells pretreated with 1 Î¼m BFA (from 15 batches) were analyzed. These cells were selected according to the following criteria. First, only cells with basal [Ca2+]i < 300 nmwere analyzed. Second, to reduce error in [Ca2+]imeasurement, cells with [Ca2+]i that did not fall into the dynamic range of indo-1 (>3 Î¼m) or indo-1 FF (<3 Î¼m) were not included in the analysis. Third, in cells where I Ca appeared to be contaminated by incomplete suppression of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ current (34Lim W. Kim S.J. Yan H.D. Kim J. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 435: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), only the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient was included in the analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, at peak [Ca2+]i of <3 Î¼m, there was little difference in the Ca2+ dependence of exocytosis between the control cells and the BFA-treated cells. For [Ca2+]i of >3 Î¼m, a slightly larger C m jump and total C m rise were observed in BFA-treated cells than in control cells (but not statistically different). A similar result was observed in Fig. 7,C and D. For Ca2+ entry of <0.6 mmol/liter, C m jump or total C mrise was similar in both groups of cells. At Ca2+ entry of >0.6 mmol/liter, however, a slightly larger totalC m rise was observed in BFA-treated cells (but not statistically different). Our amperometry experiments (e.g. Fig. 1) have shown that during continuous perfusion of high [K+], BFA-treated cells could release catecholamine for many minutes. This suggested that BFA might not have dramatic effects on the mobilization of vesicle in the time course of many minutes. However, the amperometry method only monitors catecholamine secretion from a fraction of the cell surface, and previous studies in chromaffin cells (35Robinson I.M. Finnegan J.M. Monck J.R. Wightman R.M. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2474-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have also suggested that the sites of catecholamine release might be unevenly distributed on the cell surface. Therefore, it is hard to rely on amperometry to get a quantitative comparison of secretion from different groups of cells. To further examine whether BFA affected vesicle mobilization, we measured the cumulative increase in capacitance during a train of depolarization steps. In this set of experiments, the cell was held at â90 mV (D.C.). A train of 15 depolarization steps (held at +10 mV for 50 ms in each step) was delivered at 4 Hz. An example of such an experiment on a cell pretreated with 1 Î¼m BFA was shown in Fig.8, A and B. In this cell, the train of depolarization steps triggered a [Ca2+]i rise as well as increases inC m. Fig. 8 C plots the cumulative exocytosis versus the peak [Ca2+]i in both the control cells and cells pretreated with 1 Î¼mBFA. Note that at comparable peak [Ca2+]i, no significant difference could be detected between the two groups. We also examined whether BFA affected the initial rate of exocytosis by measuring the rate of C m jump during the first 50-ms depolarization (Fig. 8 D). Since the Ca2+ entry during the brief depolarization (50 ms) might not be distributed uniformly throughout the cell volume, we have normalized the Ca2+ entry (time integral of I Ca) to the cell surface area (initial cell membrane capacitance) instead of the cell volume. Fig. 8 D shows that at comparable Ca2+ entry, the initial rate of exocytosis was not significantly affected by BFA. Thus, 1 Î¼m BFA pretreatment had no significant effect on either the cumulative Ca2+-dependent exocytosis or the initial rate of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in chromaffin cells. We have shown earlier that a continuous exposure of 10 Î¼mBFA not only disrupted the Golgi apparatus but also increased the mean quantal charge in chromaffin cells (Fig. 3). To examine whether such a BFA treatment can affect Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, we repeated the train of depolarization experiments (similar to Fig. 8, A and B) on cells continuously exposed to 10 Î¼m BFA. Fig. 8, Eand F, shows that even in cells treated continuously with 10 Î¼m BFA, there was no statistically significant change in the Ca2+ dependence of the cumulative exocytosis or the initial rate of exocytosis. These results further confirm that BFA treatment has little effect on Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Consistent with studies in other cell types (1Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar, 2Fullekrug J. Sonnichsen B. Schafer U. Van P.N. Soling H.-D. Mieskes G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), our staining with the fluorescent lipid, C6-NBD-ceramide indicates that a 2-h treatment with BFA (1 or 10 Î¼m) effectively disrupted the Golgi apparatus in most chromaffin cells. This effect in chromaffin cells is not rapidly reversible and persists for >1 h at room temperature. The breakdown of the stacks of Golgi membrane has been postulated to lead to blockade of vesicle trafficking, and inhibition of âconstitutiveâ secretion of membrane protein (1Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). However, our amperometry experiments demonstrated that BFA treatment did not affect the pattern of catecholamine release evoked by high [K+]. In both control cells and BFA-treated cells, amperometric spikes elicited by continuous high [K+] perfusion persisted for at least 5 min and up to 30 min in a few cells. These results suggest that the mobilization of catecholamine-containing vesicles in chromaffin cells does not significantly involve any BFA-sensitive compartments. Nevertheless, analysis of the quantal characteristics of catecholamine-containing vesicles showed that BFA pretreatment or continuous treatment for 2 h tended to increase the quantal size of some vesicles. This trend was clear for the higher BFA concentration (10 Î¼m), which almost doubled the mean quantal size (Figs. 2 and 3). This change in the catecholamine content in single vesicles may be due to an alteration in the concentration of catecholamine and/or the vesicle volume. BFA is known to inhibit the formation of coated vesicles, hence causing a misregulation of vesicle budding. Thus, it is possible that the budding of some catecholamine vesicles either at the plasma membrane or at internal membranes is misregulated by the BFA treatment, and this in turn leads to the formation of larger vesicles. Alternatively, fusion between catecholamine-containing vesicles may occur when BFA disrupts the membrane trafficking pathway. In theory, an increase in the average size of vesicles may be detected as a larger increase in capacitance for identical Ca2+ entry during activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (i.e. if the same number of vesicles is triggered to undergo exocytosis). However, in cells continuously treated with 10 Î¼m BFA for 2 h (the experimental condition that caused the largest increase in quantal size of catecholamine vesicles), we detected no significant change in either the cumulative exocytosis or the initial rate of exocytosis (Fig. 8,E and F). If the increase in quantal charge indeed came from larger vesicles, it is possible that the number of vesicles readily releasable by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels was also decreased. Finally, although BFA is not known to affect amine transporters, the possibility that there is increased accumulation of catecholamine molecules in some vesicles after BFA treatment cannot be completely ruled out here. Indeed, significant increase in the quantal size in some amine-secreting cells has been reported (36Pothos E.N. Davila V. Sulzer D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4106-4118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, either pretreatment or continuous exposure of 10 Î¼m BFA results in an increase in the number of amperometric events with preceding foot and stand alone signals, suggesting that 10 Î¼m BFA affects the fusion kinetics of some vesicles. Both the foot and stand alone signals represent a delayed or aborted dilation of the fusion pore. Acute application of 10 Î¼m BFA significantly increased the frequency of events with foot but not with stand alone signals. This suggests that the onset of the effect of BFA on foot signals is more rapid than that on the stand alone signals. However, the effects on both types of signals persisted after the termination of BFA pretreatment (1 or 10 Î¼m). These persistent effects of BFA may be mediated by changes in proteins (37Sollner T. Bennet M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Sheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 38Robinson L.J. Martin T.F.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or the lipid composition of the vesicle. Consistent with the notion of slow dilation of the fusion pore, BFA pretreatment (10 Î¼m) also increased the proportion of quantal spikes with longer rise time (Fig. 4). Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that after the disruption of the Golgi apparatus by a 2-h treatment of 10 Î¼m BFA, specific protein(s) or lipid(s) that are required for complete dilation of the fusion pore may fail to be incorporated in some vesicles. Earlier studies have shown that BFA could rapidly and reversibly inhibit constitutive secretion of membrane proteins or peptides (1Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). In pituitary melanotropes (12Rupnik M. Law G.J. Northrop A.J. Mason W.T. Zorec R. NeuroReport. 1995; 6: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), intracellular dialysis of BFA has been shown to reduce the initial rate of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. In the present study, the BFA-treated cells with the disrupted Golgi apparatus could release catecholamine for at least 5 min and even up to 20â30 min in some cases. In addition, our capacitance experiments show that BFA (1 Î¼m pretreatment or 10 Î¼m continuous treatment for 2 h) had no inhibitory effects on either the initial rate of exocytosis or the amount of calcium-regulated exocytosis during single depolarization or a train of depolarizations. Thus, BFA treatment has no significant inhibition on the exocytosis of the readily releasable vesicle or on vesicle mobilization. In summary, our study suggests that different vesicle cycling patterns exist for constitutive secretion and regulated secretion. The disruption of the Golgi apparatus by BFA may hinder the constitutive secretory pathway but not the regulated one. The mechanisms underlying the more subtle effects of BFA treatment on the quantal size and release kinetics of catecholamine remain to be elucidated. We thank Drs. Andy Lee and Amy Tse for discussions and Robert Chow and Zhuan Zhou for the analysis program of amperometric signals."

In this study, we demonstrate the effects of DZA on nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) regulation. DZA inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB through the hindrance of p65 (Rel-A) phosphorylation without reduction of its nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity. The inhibitory effect of DZA on NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity is potentiated by the addition of homocysteine. Taken together, DZA promotes the proteolytic degradation of IÎºBÎ±, but not IÎºBÎ², resulting in an increase of DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB in the nucleus in the absence of its transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 cells. The reduction of IÎºBÎ± by DZA is neither involved in IÎºB kinase complex activation nor modulated by the addition of homocysteine. This study strongly suggests that DZA may be a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which NF-ÎºB plays a central pathogenic role, as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of NF-ÎºB.

A prototype member of the Rel family, hetero- or homodimeric NF-ÎºB, is made from monomers that have a highly conserved approximately 300-amino acid amino-terminal domain, which is called the Rel homology domain, which functions in DNA binding, nuclear translocation, formation of dimers, and IÎºB binding. Most of the dimeric NF-ÎºB complexes are stored in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells as inactive complexes through interactions with a group of inhibitory proteins called IÎºB. Recently, the vertebrate IÎºB family such as IÎºBÎ±, IÎºBÎ², Bcl-3, precursor proteins p105 and p100, and IÎºBÎµ were reported (4Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar,5Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.-C. Rice N.R. IsraeÌl A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Inactive cytoplasmic NF-ÎºB can be activated by stimulation of cells with a broad range of NF-ÎºB-inducing agents including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±). Despite differences among these stimuli, one of their common targets is the cytoplasmic NF-ÎºBÂ·IÎºB complexes. These signals known to activate NF-ÎºB result in phosphorylation, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation of the IÎºB proteins, allowing NF-ÎºB to translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific ÎºB sites and thereby activate target genes such as various cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, acute-phase proteins, and immunoreceptors (6Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Researchers have long searched to identify IÎºB kinase which phosphorylates the IÎºB proteins to initiate the activation cascade of NF-ÎºB. Recently, IÎºB kinase Î± (IKKÎ±) and IÎºB kinase Î² (IKKÎ²) were reported as essential kinases for NF-ÎºB activation downstream of TNF-Î± and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors (7Mercurio F. Zhu H.

Activation of NF-ÎºB could be inhibited through diverse mechanisms by manifold compounds at distinct positions in the activation cascade. One group of NF-ÎºB inhibitors which share the property of being anti-oxidative, includes N-acetyl-l-cysteine (10Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar), acetylsalicylic acid (11Kopp E. Ghosh S.

Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Some inhibitors interrupt the induced degradation of IÎºB proteins by the inhibition of 26 S protease (13Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), or by increase of IÎºBÎ± synthesis (14Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K.

Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). Another group of inhibitors hinders the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB already bound to DNA. This group includes SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (16Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Schmitz M.L. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol.

Richards H.H. Cantoni G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar). This agent binds to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase resulting in the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine andS-adenosylmethionine, and serves as a substrate for the enzyme resulting in the huge accumulation of 3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine (DZA-Hcy) in cultured cells (18Chiang P.K.

Although the wide variety of biological properties underscores that DZA is to be an effective drug for treatment of many human diseases, the action mechanism of DZA is not yet fully understood. Previously, we reported that DZA inhibits LPS-induced TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² transcription in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells (26Jeong S.-Y. Lee J.-H. Kim H.-S. Hong S.-H. Cheong C.-H. Kim I.-K. Immunology. 1996; 89: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, elementary experiments confirming DZA inhibition of TNF-Î± transcription in human monocytic macrophage THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) encouraged us to investigate the effect of DZA on NF-ÎºB activation with the intention of understanding the cellular mechanism of DZA. DZA potently inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB through the hindrance of p65 phosphorylation without reduction of nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB. In RAW 264.7 cells, DZA promoted the proteolytic degradation of IÎºBÎ± resulting in an increase of DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB in the nucleus. These results strongly suggest that DZA may serve as a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which NF-ÎºB plays an important pathogenic role, as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of NF-ÎºB. DZA, 3-deaza-(Â±)-aristeromycin (DZAri), and DZA-Hcy were donated by Dr. Chiang of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D. C. Hcy-thiolactone and LPS (Escherichia coli, No. 0127 B-8) were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of human TNF-Î± and GST human IÎºBÎ± were kindly provided by Dr. Dae-Myung Jue in our department. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Mouse macrophage RAW 264.7, human monocytic THP-1, and SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). PBMC were isolated from defibrinated blood using Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) by density-gradient separation, followed by adherence to tissue culture dish for 2 h at 37 Â°C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing the monolayer four times with phosphate-buffered saline. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, 50 Î¼g/ml gentamicin, and 10% heat-inactivated (56 Â°C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) at 37 Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells at 2 h after LPS (1 Î¼g/ml) stimulation according to a previously described method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Five Î¼g of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (26Jeong S.-Y. Lee J.-H. Kim H.-S. Hong S.-H. Cheong C.-H. Kim I.-K. Immunology. 1996; 89: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All of the digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany)-labeled probes were prepared from each specific primer and cDNA fragments of amplimer sets (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by polymerase chain reaction. After RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS (1 Î¼g/ml) for 1 h and COS-7 cells were stimulated with recombinant GST-human TNF-Î± protein (50 ng/ml) for 1 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cytosolic fraction and nuclear extract for Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (32Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Concentration of protein was determined using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Five Î¼g of nuclear protein and 1 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per reaction were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with NF-ÎºB consensus sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), which was 3â²-end labeled with32P, in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20, 30 mm KCl). After the binding reaction, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel that was run in 0.5Ã Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, pH 8.0, and then the dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. For competition, 50-fold unlabeled NF-ÎºB or AP-1 consensus sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Ten Î¼g of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for NF-ÎºB proteins or 12.5% SDS-PAGE for IÎºB proteins, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris base, 193 mm glycine, 20% methanol) at 500 mA for 4 h. Western blot analysis was performed as described (26Jeong S.-Y. Lee J.-H. Kim H.-S. Hong S.-H. Cheong C.-H. Kim I.-K. Immunology. 1996; 89: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

To assess variations in transfection efficiencies, a control plasmid pCMVÎ² (CLONTECH) which expresses the LacZ gene was used. Transfection of cells was performed using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to a procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Cells transfected with either J16 or J32 were cultured for 18 h, and then exposed to LPS or TNF-Î± in the presence or absence of DZA alone or DZA with Hcy together. For the pSVL65 transfection, cells were exposed to 100 Î¼m DZA at 6 h after transfection, and further incubated for 18 h. Induction of CAT expression was determined using CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and standardized to constitutive levels of Î²-galactosidase activity. Confluent monolayers of RAW 264.7 cells in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium for 1 h. Media was replaced by fresh phosphate-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 100 Î¼Ci of32Pi per ml (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and the cells were incubated for 2 h. Cells were pretreated with or without DZA (100 Î¼m) for 1 h, and stimulated by the addition of LPS (1 Î¼g/ml). After incubation for 1 h, the cells were washed, and p65 was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-p65 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunopellets were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to confirm that the equal amount of protein was loaded in each wall. Dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 100 Î¼m DZA for various time intervals, and subjected to IKK assay. IKK activity was measured as described (34DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), using recombinant protein of GST-human IÎºBÎ± as a substrate. A polyclonal antibody to IKKÎ± (M-280) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transcription of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² was inhibited by DZA in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS (26Jeong S.-Y. Lee J.-H. Kim H.-S. Hong S.-H. Cheong C.-H. Kim I.-K. Immunology. 1996; 89: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of DZA on the expression of TNF-Î± in other types of cells, THP-1 cells and PBMC were pretreated with increasing concentrations of DZA for 1 h, and stimulated by the addition of LPS at a final concentration of 1 Î¼g/ml. As shown in Fig. 1, LPS stimulation increased the steady-state levels of TNF-Î± mRNA as early as 2 h. Treatment of DZA inhibited the LPS-induced expression of TNF-Î± mRNA dose dependently in both THP-1 cells and PBMC in the same manner as in RAW 264.7 cells. Expression of Î²-actin mRNA as a control was not affected by DZA in any of the cells. These results show that DZA efficiently inhibits the LPS-induced expression of TNF-Î± mRNA and this potency is not only restricted to murine macrophage cells. Since the activation of transcription factor NF-ÎºB has been shown to be indispensable for TNF-Î± expression induced by LPS (35Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of DZA on DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB in the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells by EMSA, using 32P-labeled NF-ÎºB specific oligonucleotides. An inducible protein-DNA complex was observed in the nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 (Fig.2 A). Unexpectedly, cells pretreated with DZA revealed no significant decrease of the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB, even though expression of the TNF-Î± gene was potently inhibited by exposure to DZA. Moreover, DNA binding activity was potentiated in nuclear extracts dose dependently by DZA, irrespective of LPS stimulation. In competition experiments, a 50-fold amount of unlabeled NF-ÎºB-specific oligonucleotide absolutely inhibited typical binding activities, but the same amount of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide failed to inhibit binding activities, confirming their specificities (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the inhibition of TNF-Î± gene expression by DZA occurred without down-regulation of NF-ÎºB DNA binding activity, and that DZA increases DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB in RAW 264.7 cells. Since the presence of a reducing agent such as DTT in preparation of the nuclear extract and the execution of EMSA could mask lost DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB, we repeated the EMSA assay without DTT (Fig. 2 C). Removal of DTT from the assay could not modulate each of the DNA binding activities which were presented by DTT in an assay with DTT, indicating that the DZA inhibition of TNF-Î± gene expression is not caused by a loss of NF-ÎºB DNA binding activity. We examined the effects of DZA on the translocation of p65 (Rel-A), p50 (NF-ÎºB1), and c-Rel into the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with or without LPS using Western blot analysis. LPS stimulation increased protein levels of each NF-ÎºB subunit in the nucleus. Treatment of DZA at a concentration of 100 Î¼m induced an increase of Rel family proteins in the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells regardless of LPS stimulation (Fig.3 A). These results are in exact agreement with the results in Fig. 2 A, which shows that DZA induces nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB and potentiates its LPS-induced translocation in RAW 264.7 cells. We next established the modulation of p65 in the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells by DZA at either various concentrations or various time intervals. Similar to the results in Fig. 2 A, DZA at 100 Î¼mconcentration increased the levels of p65 in the nucleus regardless of LPS stimulation (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 C shows the modulation of p65 level in the nucleus by treatment of DZA at various time intervals. p65 in the nucleus increased remarkably at 60 and 120 min after treatment with DZA, even though there was a slight decrease at 15 min. The total amount of cellular p65 was not modulated by DZA, whereas the amount of cytoplasmic p65 decreased proportionally to the increase of nuclear p65 by DZA as measured in a Western blot analysis of total cellular extracts and cytoplasmic fractions (data not shown). These results demonstrate that DZA increases the amount of p65 nuclear translocation in RAW 264.7 cells, and that the increase of p65 in the nucleus by DZA is caused only by nuclear translocation, and not by the enhancement of p65 expression. Since DZA is known to inhibit the expression of TNF-Î± mRNA without a diminution of NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity, we proved the effects of DZA on the NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity by transient transfection experiments of RAW 264.7 cells using reporter gene constructs carrying two copies of the wild-type (J16) NF-ÎºB binding sequence or mutant (J32) NF-ÎºB binding sequence in front of the CAT gene, which have been shown to specifically respond to NF-ÎºB activation (33Lenardo M.J. Fan C.-H. Maniatis T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). LPS stimulation of cells transfected with J16 resulted in a 4.7-fold induction of CAT expression (Fig. 4 A), whereas no induction of CAT expression by LPS was observed in cells transfected with J32. Treatment of the cells with 100 Î¼m DZA for 1 h before LPS stimulation resulted in a drastic inhibition of LPS-induced CAT expression. LPS-induced transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB was dose dependently inhibited by DZA (Fig. 4 B). These results strongly suggest that DZA potently inhibits NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS, even though it more intensely provokes the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB. The effect of Hcy on DZA inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity was examined. There was a tendency to inhibit NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity more than the inhibition observed by DZA alone (Fig. 4 B). These results imply that DZA inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity is involved in the accumulation of DZA-Hcy in RAW 264.7 cells. To determine the effect of DZA on CAT expression induced by expression of p65, RAW 264.7 cells were co-transfected with CAT-reporter plasmids and pSVL65 that express large amounts of p65. As a control, cells were transfected with pSVL substituting for pSVL65. After 6 h of transfection, one group of cells was exposed for 18 h to 100 Î¼m DZA and the other was not (Fig. 4 C). Expression of p65 induced a 5.9-fold increase of CAT protein, driven from J16 under the absence of DZA treatment, but did not induce CAT protein expression from J32. The expression of CAT protein was completely inhibited from the cells transfected with pSVL65 when DZA was treated into cells at the concentration of 100 Î¼m, although the induction of CAT expression in the cells transfected with pSVL 65 was higher than that in the cells only stimulated with LPS. The production of p65 was not affected by DZA as monitored by Western blot analysis using anti-p65 (data not shown). These results, together with the results in Fig. 4,A and B, showing DZA inhibition of LPS-induced NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity, suggest that DZA directly inhibits the transcriptional activity of p65 but not at the signal cascade of LPS-induced NF-ÎºB activation. To elucidate whether any of the observed effects could be due to DZA-Hcy, cells to be exposed to 100 Î¼m DZA for 1 h before LPS stimulation were pretreated with a more specific and potent inhibitor ofS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, DZAri, to block the intracellular accumulation of DZA-Hcy (Fig. 4 D). Treatment of DZAri almost completely abrogated the inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity in cells treated with 100 Î¼mDZA, indicating a central role for DZA-Hcy in the DZA inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity. No inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity was observed in cells treated with DZAri alone. To investigate whether exogenous DZA-Hcy is capable of inhibition, cells were exposed to 100 Î¼m DZA-Hcy for 1 h before LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4 D, exogenous DZA-Hcy failed to inhibit NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity in the cells stimulated with LPS, demonstrating that DZA-Hcy is incapable of inhibition when given exogenously. To determine if DZA might inhibit the functional activation of NF-ÎºB by modifying phosphorylation of p65, we examined the phosphorylation of p65 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in the presence or absence of DZA. As shown in Fig. 5, LPS induced a strong phosphorylation of p65. In cells pretreated with 100 Î¼m DZA, however, LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 was markedly reduced. A low constitutive phosphorylation of p65 was observed in unstimulated cells, which was reduced by treatment of the cells with DZA alone. These results strongly suggest that DZA inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB by the hindrance of p65 phosphorylation required for the functional activation of NF-ÎºB. We tried to determine if DZA could inhibit NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity without affecting nuclear translocation in non-hematopoietic cells stimulated by other inducers of NF-ÎºB. TNF-Î± stimulation of COS-7 cells prominently induced the nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB and the DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB, which was not observed in unstimulated cells (Fig.6 A). The addition of 100 Î¼m DZA to COS-7 cells before TNF-Î± stimulation had no effect on nuclear translocation or DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB, suggesting that DZA did not affect TNF-Î±-induced nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB in COS-7 cells. DZA alone did not induce the nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB in the cells. In transient transfection experiments of COS-7 cells using reporter gene constructs (J16 or J32), TNF-Î± stimulation of cells transfected with J16 resulted in CAT expression that was 2.6-fold greater (Fig.6 B). No induction of CAT expression by TNF-Î± was observed in cells transfected with J32. Treatment of these cells with 100 Î¼m DZA for 1 h before TNF-Î± stimulation resulted in complete inhibition of CAT protein expression. These results reveal that DZA is a common and potent inhibitor of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity induced by distinct stimuli. The effect of Hcy on DZA inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity was examined. As shown in Fig. 6 C, DZA dose dependently inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB in cells stimulated by TNF-Î±. Combination of DZA and Hcy more potently inhibited NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity than inhibition observed by DZA alone. These results show that DZA inhibition of NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity is involved in the accumulation of DZA-Hcy in COS-7 cells stimulated with TNFÎ±. Cells co-transfected with pSVL65 and CAT-reporter plasmid (J16 or J32) showed a 3.0-fold expression of CAT protein driven from J16, but not from J32 (Fig. 6 D). 100 Î¼m DZA strongly inhibited the induction of CAT protein in cells expressing p65, suggesting that DZA directly inhibits the transcriptional activity of p65. Translocation of NF-ÎºB into the nucleus is linked to proteolytic degradation of IÎºB proteins (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar), and as we have described above, DZA increases NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation in RAW 264.7 cells. To test whether DZA promotes proteolytic degradation of IÎºB proteins, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with DZA following stimulation with or without LPS. As shown in Fig.7 A, the level of IÎºBÎ± protein was notably reduced by treatment of DZA alone for 2 h at a concentration of 100 Î¼m. The IÎºBÎ± protein was fully recovered at 1 h after LPS stimulation without DZA, since IÎºBÎ± is autoregulated through the activation of NF-ÎºB (3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. A"

We have expressed this domain (residues 545â680) inEscherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The purified fusion protein trimerizes spontaneouslyin vitro, and after thrombin cleavage, the purified C-terminal domain trimer (46.2 kDa) is extremely stable and trypsin-resistant.

Each mutation had identical consequences regarding the fusion protein: 1) absence of trimeric formation, 2) copurification of the â¼60-kDa GroEL chaperone protein, and 3) sensitivity of the monomeric fusion protein to trypsin digestion. These results show that the C-terminal domain of collagen X is sufficient to produce a very stable and compact trimer in the absence of collagen Gly-X-Y repeats. Moreover, mutations causing SMCD interfere in this system with the correct folding of the C-terminal domain.

Human collagen X is a homotrimer composed of a 38-amino acid non-triple helical domain (NC2) at the N terminus, a 463-amino acid triple helical domain, and a 161-amino acid non-triple helical domain (NC1) at the C terminus (see Fig. 1). Unlike the C-terminal propeptide of fibrillar collagens, the C-terminal NC1 domain is not cleaved following secretion into the extracellular space. Recent cloning data have shown that there is a family of molecules that contain C-terminal domains homologous to the NC1 domain of collagen X. These include collagen VIII (7Yamaguchi N. Mayne R.

A sequence comparison between the C termini of collagens X and VIII, subunit C1q of the human C1 enzyme complex, and the fibrillar collagens has revealed a conserved cluster of aromatic residues (16Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This cluster is found in a region of â¼130 amino acids that exhibits marked similarities in hydrophilicity profiles between the different collagens, despite a low level of sequence similarity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and structure predictions suggested that the trimeric C1q module presents a pattern of 10 Î²-strands interspersed by Î²-turns and/or loops (17Smith K.F. Haris P.I. Chapman D. Reid K.B. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the homotrimeric ACRP30 C-terminal domain, which is clearly homologous to its C1q counterpart. This structure revealed an asymmetrical trimer of Î²-sandwich protomers. Each of the protomers has a 10-strand jelly-roll folding topology similar to the tumor necrosis factor family (18Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was inferred from sequence homologies that this folding is common to all C1q module family proteins. The trimer is bell-shaped, with a wide base. Trimer contacts form primarily through a cluster of hydrophobic interactions near the base. The trimer interface near the apex is largely hydrophilic and contains many ordered water molecules. The importance of the interactions of collagen X NC1 domains in the assembly of the molecule was suggested by the observation that chick collagen X containing the triple helical and NC1 domains renatures much more rapidly than collagen X containing only the triple helical domain (19Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The isolated NC1 domain of collagen X purified after bacterial collagenase digestion was studied (19Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F.

The existence of very stable multimeric forms, even in the absence of covalent binding between the subunits, was established. The NC1 domain from human procollagen X expressed as recombinant protein in a human kidney epithelial cell line (HEK293) migrates as multimers with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE,1 even after reduction and heat denaturation, and gives rise to monomers of 18â20 kDa after treatment with trichloroacetic acid (21Frischholz S.

Schmid's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD; MIM 156500) is a mild autosomal disorder of the osseous skeleton associated with growth plate abnormalities, short stature, and waddling gait.

Several experiments have demonstrated the role of the NC1 domain of collagen X in the trimerization process. Pre-Î±1(X) collagen chains have been synthesized with NC1 mutations of those found in SMCD, including G618V (26Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 1952delC, 1953del10, and Y598D (27Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F.

Contrary to the control construct, the mutant molecules were unable to assemble into homotrimers in vitro. Furthermore, the mutant chains did not associate with normal Î±1(X) chains and did interfere with the efficiency of normal chain assembly in cotranslation experiments. Expression in transiently transfected cells showed that the mutant chains are not secreted from the cells and are probably rapidly degraded intracellularly. In contrast, in-frame deletions within the triple helical domain and the NC2 domain, obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, did not prevent assembly, and the mutant chains were secreted as pepsin-resistant triple helical homotrimers (27Chan D.

In this study, we have expressed in bacteria the last 136 residues of the NC1 domain of collagen X. This region corresponds to a C1q module as defined by Bork and Koonin (14Bork P. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and has been expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein designated by us as GST-NC1. Our objectives were to confirm the trimerization process of the wild-type NC1 domain and to understand the effect of SMCD mutations on this process. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The bacterial culture medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Molecular mass markers were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A 408-base pair fragment corresponding to amino acids +545 to +680 of human collagen X was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification from plasmid pSAh10f (28Apte S.S. Seldin M.F. Hayashi M. Olsen B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (gift of Dr. Suneel S. Apte, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Two oligonucleotides were used, one carrying aBamHI site (boldface) within the sequence 5â²-TATGGATCCGGGGTAACAGGAATG-3â² and the other with aHindIII site (boldface) in a sequence complementary to the C-terminal region 5â²-AATAAGCTTTCACATTGGAGCCAC-3â². The DNA fragment thus obtained was purified and incorporated into the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene) according to the experimental protocol of the manufacturer. After amplification, the recombinant plasmid was digested with BamHI andXhoI restriction endonucleases and ligated into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously opened with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid (pXHNC1) encoded the C1q module domain of human collagen X fused with GST under the control of thetac promoter. The resulting translation product is referred to as the GST-NC1 fusion protein (GST-NC1). The recombinant plasmid was checked by sequencing the double-stranded DNA using the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pXHNC1 were grown exponentially in LB medium containing 100 Î¼g of ampicillin/ml at 37 Â°C with agitation at 270 rpm. The expression of GST-NC1 was induced by addition of 0.4 mm of isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the A 600 nm reached â¼0.7â0.9. Four h post-induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl (buffer A; 40 ml/liter of culture medium) with aprotinin and leupeptin (final concentration of 1 Î¼g/ml) as protease inhibitors. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were lysed by sonication on ice (pulses of 2 s followed by pauses of 10 s for a total of 2 min; Vibra Cell 72408, Bioblock Scientific). After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 40,000 Ã g for 30 min, the supernatant was filtered on a 0.45-Î¼m pore size membrane (Sartorius Corp.). The filtrate was then incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with 1.0 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in an end-over-end agitator. After washing of the gel with 10 column volumes of buffer A, GST-NC1 was eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Purified GST-NC1 was dialyzed against 2000 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, to remove the free glutathione and then treated with thrombin (10 units/mg of protein) in an end-over-end agitator for 4 h at room temperature. Thrombin was inhibited by addition of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solution was incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with 1.6 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel in an end-over-end agitator to bind the cleaved GST protein. The NC1 domain was recovered in the unbound fraction. A fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column (5 mm Ã 5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was connected to a Bio-Logic HR system (Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and eluted by a NaCl gradient (0â1 m, 20 min, 1 ml/min) in the same buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed on 7 Ã 8 Ã 0.75-cm slab gels in a Mighty SmallTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using a 12.5% acrylamide concentration. Unless otherwise stated, the sample buffer contained 20 mm dithiothreitol as reducing agent, and the samples were heated for 5 min at 100 Â°C before electrophoresis. The gels were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in ethanol/acetic acid/water (40:8:52) and destained with ethanol/acetic acid/water (5:8:87). A peptide with the sequence LQLPNAESNGLY, corresponding to amino acids +652 to +663 of human collagen X, was synthesized by a stepwise solid-phase method using an Applied Biosystems 430A automated synthesizer. Synthesis was performed on a phenylacetamidomethyl resin, and thet-butyloxycarbonyl group was used for Î±-amino protection. The purified peptide was dissolved in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and citraconic anhydride was added in a ratio of amine functions/citraconic anhydride of 1:10 (mol/mol). The pH was adjusted to 8.5â9.0 with 5 m NaOH; a second citraconylation of the amine functions was carried out as described above; and the solution was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Benzidine (5 mg/ml) in 0.2 m HCl was mixed with sodium nitrite (3.5 mg/ml) and mixed for 2 h at 4 Â°C. The coupling reaction was initiated by mixing the citraconylated peptide with 5 mg of ovalbumin (peptide/ovalbumin ratio of 30:1 (mol/mol)), 20 ml of 0.2m borate buffer, pH 9.0, and 200 Î¼l of the benzidine solution. The mixture was vigorously mixed for 2 h at 4 Â°C. The peptide coupled to ovalbumin was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, and 0.15 m NaCl), freeze-dried, and used for the immunization of rabbits. The specificity of the antibody to the NC1 domain of human collagen X was confirmed by the fact that all the mutant and wild-type GST-NC1 fusion proteins were recognized except the mutant molecule that lacked the sequence corresponding to the synthetic peptide. Four human collagen X NC1 domain SMCD mutations (Fig.1) were produced by site-directed mutagenesis using single-stranded DNA from expression vector pXHNC1, previously modified by introducing the DNA fragment from pUC-f1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the replication origin of phage f1 (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). The resulting expression vector (pXHNC1-f1) was transformed into CJ236 cells. The transformed strain was infected with the M13K07/helper phage (Bio-Rad), and site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the single-stranded DNA produced from the resulting phagemid and the mutagenic oligonucleotides GGTGTACATTACCGGTGTGACATTCTTATACAGGCC, GGCATTGGGAAGCTAGATCTACACCTGGTCATT, CCTGAGAAAGAGATCTAGACATACTCAGAGG, and GTATGAAAAATCGTATATCCCGGGTATCTGAC for the mutations G618V, W651X, H669X, and Y598D, respectively, whereX stands for premature termination. The mutant plasmids were checked by sequencing the double-stranded DNA using the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) to confirm the accuracy of the mutations and to verify the absence of unwanted accidental mutation. Amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer using the trifluoroacetic acid conversion programs provided by the manufacturer. The sequencer was connected on line with an Applied Biosystems 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Mass spectra were obtained with a time of flight mass spectrometer (Voyager Elite Xl, Perseptive Biosystems) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. A mass spectrum of each sample was recorded by averaging â¼128 laser shots at various locations across the spot. All spectra were acquired in the positive-ion mode with delayed extraction. After a 50-ns delay time, the first acceleration grid was set to 20,000 V, and the second acceleration grid to 94.7% of this value or 18,940 V. The guide wire in the flight tube was held at 0.150% of the pulse acceleration value (15 V). Aliquots of 0.5 Î¼l of the protein solution and 0.5 Î¼l of the matrix solution were mixed on the stainless steel sample plate and dried in the air prior to analysis. All experiments were performed using a saturated solution of 2.5 dihydroxybenzoic acid prepared in a 50% (v/v) solution of acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. External calibration was performed with horse skeletal muscle myoglobin (m/z 16,952). Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed using a Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray source. The ion spray voltage was set at 5000 V, and the orifice voltage at 80 V. The interface temperature was set at 55 Â°C. Sample volumes of 1 Î¼l were injected at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min with water/methanol/acetic acid (74:25:1) as vector solvent. Spectra were acquired in the multichannel acquisition mode at anm/z range from 920 to 1100, including three charge states of the denatured protein, with a scan step of 0.1m/z and a dwell time of 2 ms. Calibration was performed in the positive mode using polypropylene glycol ions. Mass spectra were analyzed using a Quadra 950 data system (Apple Computer Inc.). After SDS-PAGE, the gel was soaked in transfer buffer (10 mmCAPS, pH 11.0, and 10% methanol) for 5 min. During this time, a ProBlotTM transfer membrane (Applied Biosystems) was rinsed with 100% methanol and soaked in transfer buffer. The gel, sandwiched between a sheet of ProBlotTM transfer membrane and several sheets of blotting paper (Whatman No. 3MM) also equilibrated in transfer buffer, was assembled into a blotting apparatus (Trans-BlotTM Cell, Bio-Rad). After electroelution (1 h at 60 V) in transfer buffer, the membrane was rinsed with deionized water, saturated with 100% methanol for a few seconds, and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 1% acetic acid for 1 min. The membrane was then destained with 50% methanol and rinsed with deionized water. The band of interest was excised and submitted to Edman degradation as described above. After SDS-PAGE, the gel, a ProtranÂ® BA nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & SchuÌll), and three sheets of blotting paper (Whatman No. 3MM) were soaked in anode buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% isopropyl alcohol) for 5 min. The three sheets of blotting paper were placed on the graphite anode electrode plate of a blotting apparatus (MilliBlotTM-Graphite Electroblotter systems, Millipore Corp.) and then covered by the transfer membrane and the gel. Three other sheets of blotting paper equilibrated in cathode buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS) were placed on top of the gel. After electroelution (1 h at 40 mA), the membrane was soaked rapidly in 0.2% Ponceau S to detect the transferred proteins and the molecular mass markers. It was then destained with deionized water and saturated overnight with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20 and 5% low fat milk. The membranes were incubated for 1 h with different antibodies diluted in the same buffer (1:500 for the anti-NC1 antibody, 1:100 for the anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1:5000 for the anti-GroEL antibody (gift of Dr. S. M. van der Vies, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland)), rinsed (3 Ã 5 min) in phosphate buffer containing 0.3% Tween 20, and then incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) for detection of the NC1 and GroEL proteins or with peroxidase-labeled anti-goat IgG for detection of the GST protein. A fragment of human collagen X cDNA similar to the C1q module of the human C1 complement complex (residues 545â680) has been cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector. BL21(DE3) cells harboring pXHNC1 expressed a major 39-kDa protein when induced with isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fig.2, compare lanes 1 and2). This apparent molecular mass is close to the 41.5-kDa value deduced from the nucleotide sequence of GST-NC1. Two major species of 39 and â¼105 kDa were specifically retained on a column with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Fig. 2, lane 3). Both bands specifically reacted with the anti-NC1 and anti-GST antibodies (data not shown), indicating that the lower band corresponds to monomeric GST-NC1 and the upper band to a multimeric form of this protein. Purified GST-NC1 (Fig. 2, lane 3) was treated with thrombin, and the result of the cleavage was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (lane 4). Two species with apparent molecular masses of 46.2 and 17.3 kDa were immunoreactive to the anti-NC1 antibody, but not to the anti-GST antibody. The intermediate bands (â¼26 kDa) were immunoreactive only to the anti-GST antibody and thus correspond to the GST protein and a truncated fragment. The GST moiety was removed by affinity chromatography, and the unbound NC1 domain was then chromatographed by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column, leading to the 46.2- and 17.3-kDa purified proteins (Fig. 2, lane 5). The same sample unreduced before SDS-PAGE analysis provided an additional band recognized by the anti-NC1 antibody with an apparent molecular mass of 31.4 kDa (Fig. 2,lane 6). Omission of the boiling step before SDS-PAGE analysis provided only the band of 46.2 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 7). If the same sample was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid before electrophoresis and then heated and reduced, the band of 46.2 kDa disappeared, and only the band of 17.3 kDa was present (data not shown). The purified NC1 domain was submitted to N-terminal Edman degradation. The obtained sequence (GSGVTGMPVSAFTVI) corresponded to the expected NC1 domain. The two first amino acids (boldface) come from the GST protein as they are just after the thrombin cleavage site (Fig. 1). A molecular mass of 15,419.5 Da was determined for the NC1 domain by ion spray mass spectrometry. This molecular mass is higher by 45.1 Da compared with the calculated mass (15,374.4 Da) of the NC1 domain expressed. This difference could be due to the oxidation of the three methionine residues. By MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we detected three principal components (Fig. 3) with molecular masses of 15,386, 30,769.3, and 46,122 Da. By comparison with the calculated masses (Table I), these components are likely to correspond to the monomer, the dimer, and the trimer of the NC1 domain of collagen X considering a partial oxidation of the methionine residues.Table IComparison of the molecular masses of the monomer, the dimer, and the trimer of the NC1 domain determined by SDS-PAGE and by MALDI-TOF analysis with the calculated massesMonomerDimerTrimerSDS-PAGE (kDa)17.331.446.2Calculated mass (Da)15,37430,74846,122Mass by MALDI-TOF (Da)15,38630,76946,122 Open table in a new tab All the expressed mutant proteins (see Fig. 1) had apparent molecular masses on SDS-PAGE that were consistent with the introduced mutations (Fig. 4, lanes 1â4). Although no molecular mass changes were observed for the GST-NC1 mutants with the G618V and Y598D amino acid substitutions (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 4), the premature stop codons introduced at amino acids 651 and 669 resulted in reductions of the apparent molecular masses of 3.3 and 1.2 kDa, respectively (lanes 3 and 4) compared with wild-type GST-NC1 (lane 5). As expected, the GST-NC1 mutant containing the premature stop codon introduced at amino acid 651 was not recognized by the anti-NC1 antibody because it lacks the epitope (Fig. 4 B), but was recognized by the anti-GST antibody (Fig. 4 C). Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed the presence of bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 50 to 60 kDa (Fig. 4 A). The N-terminal sequence (AAKDVKFGNDARVKM) of the higher species corresponded to the 60-kDa GroEL chaperone protein from E. coli (Swiss-Prot accession number P06139). The sequence of the lower band (FGAPTITKDG) indicated a removal of 42 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the same protein. The GroES chaperone protein was not found in these samples (data not shown). We wanted to determine the nature of the interaction of the 60-kDa GroEL chaperone protein with the GST-NC1 mutants. We expected that the fusion protein binds the glutathione fixed on the gel by its GST extremity and that the GroEL chaperone protein interacts with the NC1 domain extremity (Fig. 5). Only the results for the Y598D mutant are described here in detail because they are identical for the three other mutants (data not shown). The mutant was fixed on glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and the gel was divided into four aliquots. The four samples were then treated under various conditions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described in the legend of Fig. 6. The first sample was incubated in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 as a control. Under these conditions, all the proteins remained bound to the gel (Fig. 6, lanes 1). As the association of the subunits of GroEL can be destabilized by ATP, we incubated the second sample with 2 mm ATP (Fig. 6, lanes 2). A specific release of the GroEL chaperone protein, identified by immunodetection with the anti-GroEL antibody (Fig. 6 B, lane 2), was observed. A small quantity of the GST-NC1 mutant, detected by the anti-NC1 and anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 6, B andC, lanes 2), but not by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 6 A, lane 2), was also eluted. The third sample was incubated with 10 mm reduced glutathione to remove the GST-NC1 mutant from the gel (Fig. 6, lanes 4). Elution of the GST-NC1 mutant and of the GroEL chaperone protein was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 6 A,lane 4) and was confirmed by immunodetection with the different antibodies (Fig. 6, BâD, lanes 4). Some GST protein and degraded fragments were also eluted under these conditions. The last sample was treated with thrombin (Fig. 6,lanes 3). By Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig.6 A, lane 3), bands corresponding to the GroEL chaperone protein (upper bands), to thrombin (apparent"

One of the most widespread effects of RA is the ability to arrest growth in a large number of different cell types such as melanoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, embryonic stem, and carcinoma cells. In some cell types, RA-mediated growth inhibition is associated with decreased expression of transcription factors c-myc and c-myb, tumor suppressors p53 and pRB as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (9Gudas L.J Sporn M.B Roberts A.B.

However, the search for factors responsible for the antiproliferative effects of retinoids has so far been unrewarding in the majority of cell types and tissues. We have previously demonstrated that various retinoids inhibit growth and induce cellular differentiation in a broad panel of human pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo(16Rosewicz S.

We were therefore interested in identifying RA-regulated genes to delineate the molecules involved in the antiproliferative effects of retinoic acid. Differential display RT-PCR has been demonstrated as a suitable approach to isolate differentially regulated genes in a variety of cells (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar, 22Liang P. Averboukh L. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6966-6968PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liang P.

We therefore used this technique to detect changes in gene expression due to retinoic acid treatment. We now report the identification of the kinesin-related protein HsEg5 as a central molecule involved in the antiproliferative action of all-trans-retinoic acid. All cell lines were grown as subconfluent monolayer cultures either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v; Panc-1, MCF-7), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v; BON), or in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v; DAN-G, HL-60), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml). HaCat cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) under serum-free conditions with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml). Cells were kept under 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. All experiments were carried out in the log phase of growth after the cells had been plated for 24 h. For growth assays, cells were plated in 96-well dishes at a density of 5,000 cells/well. At the indicated times, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then obtained by trypsinization. Viable cells were counted in a hemocytometer by trypan blue exclusion. Triplicate wells were analyzed for each time point. Poly(A)+ enriched RNA was extracted from DAN-G, Panc-1, and BON cells using the Poly AT tract kit following the instructions of the supplier. From DAN-G cells, total RNA was isolated by the method described by Chomczynski (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar) using the RNAzolTMB reagent (Wak-Chemie, Bad Homburg, Germany). For quantitative analysis, RNA was analyzed in a 1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gel, blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany) and immobilized by UV cross-linking. The BamHI/HindIII cDNA insert of HsEg5 was eluted by glasmilk with the Geneclean II kit (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and labeled using the Megaprime labeling kit with [Î±-32P]dCTP following the instructions of the supplier. Hybridization was carried out using the QuickHyb reagent (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Differential display RT-PCR was performed according to the method described by Lianget al. (21Liang P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 3269-3275Crossref Scopus (885) Google Scholar) using the RNAmapâ¢ kit (WAK-Chemie). Total RNA was isolated from DAN-G cells treated for 4 h either with 10 Î¼m all-trans-retinoic acid or vehicle. 0.7 Î¼g of RNA were treated with DNase I, reverse transcribed, and the reverse transcription mixture was then used for polymerase chain reaction in a dilution of 1:10. Subsequent PCR reaction was performed in 1Ã PCR buffer (2 Î¼m dNTP, 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCL, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin) containing 1 Î¼m of T12M (G/A/T/C) primers, 0.2 Î¼m AP-12 primer, 0.6 Î¼l of [33P]dATP (1,000â3,000 Ci/mmol) and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The amplification products were separated on a 6% denaturating polyacrylamide gel. The gel was blotted onto Whatman 3 MM paper, vacuum-dried, and exposed to BioMaxMR film (Eastman Kodak) overnight. Differentially expressed bands were excised from the dried gel and incubated in 100 Î¼l of H2O for 10 min. After rehydration of the polyacrylamide gel, DNA was eluted by boiling the gel slice for 15 min. Subsequently DNA was ethanol precipitated with 50 Î¼g of glycogen as carrier and redissolved in 10 Î¼l of H2O. Reamplification was carried out with the same primers, and PCR conditions as previously used except that 20 Î¼mdNTP and no labeled dATP were used. Reamplified cDNA probes were cloned into the PCRâ¢2.1 vector using the TA cloning system from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA, USA) and subsequently sequenced by the dideoxy-sequencing technique. DAN-G cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 Î¼m ATRA for 4 and 24 h. Nuclei were prepared by resuspending cells in a lysis buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and homogenized two to three times with 30 strokes of a tight fitting pestle of a Dounce homogenizer on ice. In vitro transcription was carried out using a modified protocol by Nelson & Groudine (25Nelson J.A. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) exactly as described previously (26Kaiser A. Stier U. Riecken E.O. Rosewicz S. Digestion. 1996; 57: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DAN-G cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 1% SDS (w/v), 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.05m EDTA, 0.02 m EGTA, 0.1 msaccharose, 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized using an ultrasound cell disruptor. 20 Î¼g of protein/lane were run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a rabbit antiserum raised against human HsEg5 (27Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) which was used at a dilution of 1:3,000. Detection was performed using goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dianova) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 664-base pair fragment encoding the 5â² region of human HsEg5 was isolated from the vector pCMVDW2â1 and subcloned in antisense orientation into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV. The construct was named pHsEg5-AS and verified by restriction analysis. DAN-G cells (approximately 2 Ã 106cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with 5 Î¼g of pHsEg5-AS plasmid using the LipofectAMINETM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Control cells were transfected with pRc/CMV vector (mock-transfected) only. 24 h after transfection cells were diluted 1:10 and plated in medium containing 1.0 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant cell clones appeared after approximately 21 days and were picked for expansion at 35 days. The transfected and mock-transfected cells were kept under selective pressure at all times. 5 Ã 105 DAN-G cells were preincubated with 10 Î¼m ATRA for 48 h and synchronized by incubation with 2 mm thymidine for 24 h in early S-phase. Cells were released from S-phase by washing three times with PBS followed by addition of fresh medium containing either 10 Î¼m ATRA or Me2SO. 12, 15, 18, and 21 h after release, cells were trypsinated and resuspended in PBS. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and incubated in PBS containing 40 Î¼g/ml RNaseA for 30 min at room temperature. DNA content of the cells was analyzed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 Î¼m EDTA, 1.5 Î¼g of propidium iodide on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). To detect early differences in gene expression mediated by ATRA in pancreatic carcinoma cells, we compared the mRNA expression pattern before and after treatment (4 h) with ATRA using DDRT-PCR. Subsequent DDRT-PCR was performed using a total of 60 primer combinations yielding 11 differentially expressed cDNA bands. Fig.1 shows the sequencing gel of amplification products obtained with a primer combination of T12MG and AP12. One cDNA band that was only present in the control lane was therefore excised from the gel, reamplified, and analyzed for size determination in a 1% agarose gel. The 230-base pair reamplification product was then subcloned into a TA-cloning vector and subsequently sequenced. Comparison with the nucleotide sequence data base revealed that the isolated cDNA corresponds to the human kinesin-related protein (GenBankâ¢ accession number X85137) as well as to the human kinesin-like spindle protein (GenBankâ¢ accession numberU37426). Both nucleotide sequences encode for the human HsEg5 protein (27Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 28Whitehead C.M. Winkfein R.J. Fritzler M.J. Rattner J.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To confirm ATRA-mediated inhibition of HsEg5 expression discovered by DDRT-PCR, we performed Northern and Western blot analysis in DAN-G cells. Hybridization with the radioactively labeled HsEg5 cDNA revealed two bands at 4.8 and 3.7 kilobase pairs corresponding to both existing HsEg5 mRNA species. ATRA resulted in a rapid and significant decrease of HsEg5 mRNA and protein concentrations, reaching a maximal reduction of 50% of control at 48 h (Fig.2, A and B). To elucidate by which mechanism ATRA inhibits HsEg5 expression, we investigated the effects of ATRA on HsEg5 gene transcription as well as mRNA stability. Using nuclear run-on analysis we were unable to detect an inhibition of HsEg5 gene transcription by ATRA (Fig.3 A). In contrast, mRNA decay studies revealed that pretreatment with ATRA for 12 h significantly decreases HsEg5 mRNA stability (t 1/2, 5.6 h versus 14.0 h in untreated controls) suggesting a primarily posttranscriptional inhibitory mechanism (Fig. 3 B). To examine whether the ATRA-mediated inhibition of HsEg5 expression was cell type specific, we investigated a panel of different cell types that are growth inhibited by ATRA. Northern blot analysis revealed a decrease of HsEg5 mRNA expression in human pancreatic carcinoma cells, BON and Panc-1, in response to ATRA (Fig.4 A). In addition, Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease of HsEg5 protein expression in human HaCat keratinocytes (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, ATRA at a concentration of 10 Î¼m had no effect on HsEg5 expression in breast carcinoma MCF-7 and lymphoma HL-60 cells (Fig.4 B), although both cell lines were profoundly growth inhibited at a concentration range of 10 nm to 10 Î¼m ATRA (data not shown). To evaluate whether HsEg5 expression is specifically mediated by ATRA and to exclude that HsEg5 inhibition fortuitously coincides with inhibition of growth, we investigated the effects of sodium butyrate and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on growth and HsEg5 expression. Treatment of DAN-G cells with 1 mm sodium butyrate as well as with 1 Î¼m TPA resulted in a pronounced and time-dependent growth inhibition (Fig. 5 A). Western blot analysis revealed that neither sodium butyrate nor TPA had inhibitory effects on HsEg5 protein expression (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that HsEg5 expression is not a nonspecific epiphenomenon associated with growth inhibition. HsEg5 is essential for the proper coordination of spindle assembly and spindle stabilization during mitosis. If HsEg5 plays a role in ATRA-mediated growth inhibition, we would therefore expect a retarded progression through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle upon ATRA treatment. After pretreatment with 10 Î¼m ATRA, DAN-G cells were blocked in early S-phase with 2 mm thymidine. Cell cycle kinetics were performed after release from S-phase and compared with untreated control cells. Compared with controls, ATRA treatment of DAN-G cells resulted in a significant increase in the G2/M phase population accompanied by a decrease in the S-phase population for up to 21 h (Fig. 6). These results indicate that ATRA treatment interferes with the cell cycle by a delayed progression through G2/M phase supporting the hypothesis that inhibition of HsEg5 expression results in a transient arrest of DAN-G cells in mitosis. To further corroborate the functional biological correlation between ATRA-mediated inhibition of HsEg5 expression and growth inhibition, we established HsEg5-depleted DAN-G cell clones by stable transfection of a HsEg5 antisense cDNA. Five independent HsEg5-antisense (AS-11, AS-22, AS-26, AS-30, AS-34) and two mock-transfected (CMV6, CMV18) DAN-G cell clones were generated, and HsEg5 expression was investigated using Western blot analysis (Fig. 7 A). All HsEg5 antisense clones showed a significant reduction of HsEg5 expression (AS-11, 17%; AS-34, 23%; AS-26, 43%; AS-30, 52%; AS-22, 63% of control) as compared with mock-transfected and wild type cells. We then explored whether depletion of HsEg5 expression was capable and sufficient to mediate growth inhibition in DAN-G cells. Therefore, all five HsEg5 antisense clones were investigated for cellular proliferation by determining viable cell number at various time points. Reduction of HsEg5 expression results in a significant decrease of cellular proliferation in all antisense clones compared with mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, when we compared the rate of cellular proliferation with the intracellular HsEg5 concentration, we observed a tight linear correlation (Fig.7 C). In addition, the values obtained for ATRA-mediated HsEg5 reduction and growth inhibition fit well to the regression curve generated with HsEg5 antisense clones. Based on their ability to inhibit growth and induce differentiation, retinoids have recently received considerable attention in medical oncology. In this context, we have recently established retinoids in preclinical and clinical trials as an effective novel treatment strategy for human pancreatic cancer (16Rosewicz S. Stier U. Brembeck F.

Cancer. 1998; 83: 2317-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The identification of retinoid-responsive genes that are involved in retinoid-mediated growth inhibition might therefore provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of action and potentially reveal novel target molecules for the design of antiproliferative therapeutic strategies in cancer therapy. Based on our previous work (16Rosewicz S. Stier U. Brembeck F. Kaiser A. Papadimitriou C.A. Berdel W.E. Wiedenmann B. Riecken E.O. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1646-1660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we chose the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line DAN-G as a representative in vitromodel, in which treatment with ATRA results in a dose-dependent profound growth inhibition with maximal effects observed at a concentration of 10 Î¼m ATRA. Using DDRT-PCR in this system, we have identified for the first time the human kinesin-related protein HsEg5 whose gene expression is inhibited by ATRA in human pancreatic cancer cells. HsEg5 belongs to the superfamily of kinesin-related microtubule-associated motor proteins, which hydrolyze ATP to move toward the plus ends of microtubules (29Walczak C.E Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 943-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The kinesin-related proteins have been divided into at least seven different families and have been proposed to function in mitotic spindle assembly and dynamics (29Walczak C.E Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 943-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Sawin K.E. Endow S.A. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). HsEg5 belongs to the bimC family of kinesin-related proteins that are conserved throughout evolution, because homologs have been isolated from widely divergent organisms (27Blangy A.

Yannoni Y. Spradling A.C. Goldstein L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Segregation of chromosomes during mitosis requires formation of the mitotic spindle apparatus, which consists of microtubules and associated proteins that force the movement of spindle assembly and chromosome distribution (36Saunders W.S. Trends. Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 432-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Two mechanisms of action responsible for the regulation of kinesin-related motor proteins have recently been elucidated, phosphorylation and the level of intracellular concentration. First, HsEg5 has been shown to be associated with centrosomes during early prophase, which depends on specific phosphorylation of Thr-927 by the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex which might trigger the onset of mitosis (27Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Second, microinjection of specific anti-HsEg5 antibodies into human HeLa cells resulted in a transient arrest with monoastral microtubule arrays in about 80% of injected cells, indicating that HsEg5 is required for centrosome separation and the assembly of bipolar spindles (27Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that aside from cdc2-mediated phosphorylation, the cellular concentration of HsEg5 critically determines the mitotic process. Confirming the differential expression of HsEg5 identified by DDRT-PCR, we observed a profound inhibition of HsEg5 mRNA and protein levels by ATRA in DAN-G cells, indicating a pretranslational regulation of HsEg5 expression. Although dose-response experiments were not performed in this study, it appears highly unlikely that the observed inhibition of HsEg5 expression is because of nonspecific effects due to relatively high ATRA concentrations, because we have previously shown that under identical experimental conditions, matrix-metalloprotease-1 gene expression is in fact stimulated in the same cell line by identical RA concentrations (37v. Marschall Z. Riecken E.O. Rosewicz S. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). We observed that ATRA did not alter the transcription rate of the HsEg5 gene but decreased HsEg5 mRNA stability compared with untreated cells. These results indicate that HsEg5 gene expression is regulated by ATRA at a posttranscriptional level. Over the last years, experimental evidence has accumulated that in addition to transcriptional control, modulation of mRNA stability by retinoids can function as an alternative molecular mechanism to control gene expression of retinoid-regulated genes (38Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Clairmont A. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 15: 268-270Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Lopez-Barahona M. Minano M. Mira E. Iglesias T. Stunnenberg H.G. Rodriguez-Pena A. Bernal J. Munoz A. J. Biol.

The underlying molecular mechanisms are currently poorly understood. In the case of connexin 43 gene expression, retinoic acid is able to influence mRNA stability via elements located in the 3â²-untranslated region (39Clairmont A. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 15: 268-270Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether this observation also applies for retinoic acid-mediated HsEg5 mRNA stability is currently under investigation. In addition, we observed that HsEg5 gene expression is specifically inhibited by ATRA and that other growth inhibitory agents, such as the phorbol ester TPA and sodium butyrate, had no effect on HsEg5 expression, although they resulted in pronounced growth inhibition. It is therefore unlikely that inhibition of HsEg5 expression by ATRA is a nonspecific epiphenomenon associated with growth inhibition. If inhibition of HsEg5 expression indeed plays a central role in ATRA-mediated growth inhibition, it should be expected, based on the analogy to HsEg5 immunodepletion experiments performed in HeLa cells (27Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), that ATRA-treated cells display retarded progression through mitosis. In fact, when we performed cell cycle analysis in pancreatic tumor cells, which were synchronized in S-phase, we observed that ATRA treatment results in a significant increase of cells retarded in G2/M phase compared with untreated controls. The decrease in HsEg5 concentrations in response to ATRA treatment therefore most likely results in retardation of centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation leading to a prolonged mitotic phase. Because we did not observe a significant increase of polyploid cells upon ATRA treatment (data not shown), we conclude that completion of mitosis was not completely inhibited by ATRA but strongly retarded. In analogy, Blangy et al. (27Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HeLa cells injected with neutralizing HsEg5 antibody accumulated as mitotic cells for up to 40 h before completing the mitotic process. To evaluate whether HsEg5 depletion per se is sufficient to mediate growth inhibition, we determined the proliferation rate of HsEg5 antisense clones over a period of 5 days. We demonstrated that all five transfected cell clones expressing reduced levels of HsEg5 protein were significantly growth inhibited as compared with mock-transfected controls. Furthermore, in the HsEg5 antisense clones as well as in the ATRA-treated tumor cells the level of HsEg5 expression correlated in a linear manner with the extent of growth inhibition. We therefore conclude that inhibition of HsEg5 expression is a crucial step in growth inhibition mediated by ATRA in pancreatic carcinoma cells. The antiproliferative mechanism of action appears to be cell type specific for ATRA. Although ATRA inhibits HsEg5 expression in several pancreatic carcinoma cells as well as in keratinocytes, ATRA treatment in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells and lymphoma HL-60 cells had no effect on HsEg5 expression although these cell lines are also growth inhibited by ATRA. This is most likely explained by the fact that retinoids cause an accumulation of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle in MCF-7 and HL-60 cells due to down-regulation of cyclin E (HL-60) or cyclin D1, cdk 2 and pRB protein levels (MCF-7) (10Teixeira C. Pratt M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1191-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11BuÌrger C. Wick M. MuÌller R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, retinoids might control different subsets of retinoid-responsive genes to induce growth inhibition in different cell types. Moreover, it has been suggested that mediation of the pleiotropic effects of retinoids are based on the cell-specific expression pattern and dimeric combinations of retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors subtypes (6Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 42Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In addition, the recently discovered co-activators and co-repressors of retinoid receptors might display further cell type specific regulatory factors of retinoid-mediated gene expression (43HoÌrlein A.J.

In summary, we have identified the kinesin-related protein HsEg5 as a novel molecule involved in the antiproliferative effects of ATRA. To our knowledge, this observation represents the first experimental evidence that ATRA acts as a cytostatic drug by interference with the bipolar spindle apparatus, which might classify ATRA as a âchemotherapeutic vitamin.â We are grateful to Dr. M. Kress (Villjuif, France) for providing the HsEg5 plasmid and to Dr. E. A. Nigg (Geneve, Switzerland) for providing the HsEg5 antiserum. We would like to thank Dr. C.

The first critical step of this process is regulated by the selectins, which are a family of cell adhesion molecules composed of three members, E- (expressed on the endothelium), P- (endothelium and platelet), and L-selectin (leukocyte) (3Lasky L.A.

To account for this discrepancy in binding affinity, it has been hypothesized that the selectins, like other C-type lectins (10Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In support of this hypothesis, the natural ligand of P-selectin (PSGL-1) contains a clustered array of SLex O-linked oligosaccharides necessary for high affinity binding (13Norgard K.E. Moore K.L.

L-selectin binds a tetravalent SLex O-linked oligosaccharide with greater affinity than monovalent or divalent oligosaccharides as determined by a Stamper-Woodruff assay (16Turunen J.P. Majuri M.-L.

Likewise, a body of evidence suggests that E-selectin binds to a clustered array of SLex determinants presented onN-linked oligosaccharides. Confocal laser scanning microscopy determined that E-selectin clusters on activated human umbilical venule endothelial cells in response to binding to HL-60 cells (17Yoshida M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A proposed natural ligand for E-selectin (ESL-1) requires its N-glycosylation for high affinity binding to the lectin (18Levinovitz A. Muhlhoff K. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J.

Also, a bivalent SLex N-linked oligosaccharide was shown to have a higher affinity for binding E-selectin in vitro relative to monovalent ligands (21DeFrees S.A. Kosch W. Way W. Paulson J.C.

In the present study we used a panel of multivalent SLex N-linked oligosaccharide ligands to examine the ligand specificity of E-selectin induced in LPS mice. Using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, earlier studies determined LPS induces the expression of E- and P-selectin in all major tissues in mice (23Eppihimer M.J. Wolitzky B. Anderson D.C.

Using radiolabeled SLex N-linked oligosaccharides as ligand probes, we report the kidney as the major target site with 2â3-fold selectivity over controls and an unexpected ligand cluster effect that implicates E-selectin as a divalent lectin that accepts a SLex biantennary oligosaccharide as its minimal N-linked oligosaccharide ligand. Sodium [125I]iodide was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Sephadex G-10, chloramine T, sodium metabisulfite,Escherichia coli LPS (0111:B4), and heparin were purchased from Sigma.

Xylazine hydrochloride was purchased from Miles Inc., Shawnee Mission, KS. Silastic catheters (0.305 mm, inner diameter, Ã 0.635 mm, outer diameter) were purchased from Baxter, Obetz, OH. ICR mice (30â35 g) and BALB/c mice (22â25 g) were purchased from Harlan, Indianapolis, IN and housed in cages located in a limited access area maintaining a 12 h light-dark cycle and controlled temperature (26â28 Â°C). Rat anti-mouse E-selectin mAb (IgG2a 10E9.6) was purchased from PharMigen, Los Angeles, CA. Hamster anti-mouse P-selectin mAb (C104) was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Ward, University of Michigan. SLexand sialylated N-linked oligosaccharides were synthesized as their t-butoxycarbonyl-tyrosinamide derivative as described previously (25Thomas V.H. Elhalabi J. Rice K.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 306: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were radioiodinated at the tyrosine aglycone using a modification of the chloramine-T method as described previously (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of each iodinated oligosaccharide was analyzed by spotting 1 Î¼l (10 nCi) at the origin of a TLC plate developed with ethyl acetate/acetic acid/pyridine/water at a ratio optimized for each oligosaccharide (see Fig. 1 for structures;I and Iâ², 2:1:1:1; II andIIâ², 3:3:2:2; III and IIIâ², 2.5:2.8:2:2; IV and IVâ², 2:2:2:2) and detected by autoradiography on a Phosphor Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). ICR mice were dosed intraperitoneal with 0â200 Î¼g of LPS in 200 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline. At times ranging from 1â6 h, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) followed by insertion of a single cannula into the right jugular vein. SLex or sialyl oligosaccharides (15 Î¼l, 2 Î¼Ci in saline) were dosed i.v. and allowed to biodistribute for 6â45 min after which mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The major organs (liver, lung, spleen, stomach, kidney, heart, large intestine, and small intestine) were harvested, rinsed with saline, and measured by direct Î³-counting for total radioactivity (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biodistribution was also studied in LPS mice dosed i.v. with 7 Î¼Ci (50 Î¼l) of oligosaccharide. After a 15 min biodistribution period, mice were euthanized by a lethal injection of phenobarbital (100 mg/kg) and were subjected to whole-body autoradiography analysis as described previously (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacokinetic analysis of SLex and sialyl oligosaccharides was performed in triplicate in both normal and LPS mice. Mice were dosed intraperitoneal with LPS (20 Î¼g in 200 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline), and after 4 h a dual jugular vein cannulation was performed. Oligosaccharides were dosed in the left vein while blood time points were taken at 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min from the right vein. Serial blood time points were analyzed by direct Î³-counting, after which the oligosaccharide was extracted from blood by adding 60 Î¼l of water and 200 Î¼l of acetonitrile. Proteins were precipitated by centrifugation for 10 min (13,000 Ãg), and the pellet was washed twice with 50 Î¼l of 80% v/v acetonitrile, resulting in an 80% recovery of the radioactivity. Extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness on a Centra-vap under reduced pressure and reconstituted in 3 Î¼l of water. Each time point was analyzed by spotting 1 Î¼l onto a TLC plate that was developed and autoradiographed as described above. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from direct blood countsversus time for triplicate data sets of each oligosaccharide and averaged to obtain the mean and standard deviation (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iterative nonlinear least squares fits for individual data sets were obtained with PCNONLIN (SCI Software, Lexington, KY) using a two-compartment open model described by the integrated Equation 1: Cb=AeâÎ±t+BeâÎ²tEquation 1 where C b is the concentration of oligosaccharide in blood. A and B are constants, and Î± and Î² are hybrid first-order rate constants that characterize the slopes of the fast and slow phases of decline in a plasma concentration versus time profile (27Wagner J.G. Fundamentals of Clinical Pharmacokinetics. Drug Intelligence Publications, Hamilton, IL1975: 57-90Google Scholar). The mean residence time (MRT) was calculated according to Equation 2: MRT=AÎ±2+BÎ²2AÎ±+BÎ²Equation 2 which is the average time that the oligosaccharide was in the mouse (28Riegelman S. Collier P. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1980; 8: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The total body clearance (Cl tb) was calculated using Equation 3: Cltb=doseAÎ±+BÎ²Equation 3 and the volume of distribution at steady-state (Vd ss) was calculated according to Equation 4(29Benet L.Z. Galeazzi R.L. J. Pharm. Sci. 1979; 68: 1071-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Vdss=CltbâMRTEquation 4 Inhibition experiments were performed in Balb/c mice dosed i.p. with 100 Î¼g of LPS. After 4 h, mice were cannulated and dosed i.v. with 200 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 Î¼Ci of oligosaccharide and 40 Î¼g of anti-E-selectin or 40 Î¼g of anti-P-selectin mAb. Following a 15 min biodistribution period, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation; the organs were harvested and Î³ counted as described above. Selectin targeting was studied using a panel ofN-linked oligosaccharides that contained a clustered array of one to four SLex determinants (Fig.1, structuresI-IV). Sialyl oligosaccharidesIâ²-IVâ² were chosen to control for specific targeting because they possess a similar size and charge but lacked the full SLex tetrasaccharide required for selectin binding (Fig. 1). Each oligosaccharide was radioiodinated at thet-butoxycarbonyl-tyrosine aglycone, resulting in probes with a specific activity of 125 Î¼Ci/nmol. All doses of oligosaccharide were 16 pmol (2 Î¼Ci), thereby avoiding the potential saturation of the receptor activity. LPS was chosen as an immunostimulant because it was previously shown to systemically induce E-selectin expression (30Fries J.W.U. Williams A.J. Atkins R.C. Newman W. Lipscomb M.F. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 725-737PubMed Google Scholar). The optimum selectivity in SLex oligosaccharide III to sialyl oligosaccharide IIIâ² tissue targeting ratio was determined by varying the LPS dose, induction period, and oligosaccharide biodistribution time. Initially, the biodistribution of oligosaccharide III andIIIâ² was determined at 30 min following an LPS dose of 0â200 Î¼g and a 4 h induction period. The kidney was the major target site for both III and IIIâ², which demonstrated an LPS dose-dependent targeting efficiency (% of dose in the target organ) that ranged from 2 to 16% (Fig.2). The oligosaccharide targeting to other organs was unaffected by the LPS dose, whereas the kidney targeting was highest at an LPS dose of 200 Î¼g but lacked selectivity for III over IIIâ². The greatest selectivity in kidney targeting occurred at an LPS dose of 20 Î¼g, which produced a targeting efficiency of 12% for III compared with 6% forIIIâ² (Fig. 2). Therefore, a 20-Î¼g dose of LPS was used throughout the rest of the study in ICR mice. At an LPS dose of 20 Î¼g and induction time of 4 h, oligosaccharide biodistribution time was analyzed at times ranging from 6 to 45 min. The kidney targeting efficiency for III was 10% at 6 min, which increased to 18% at 15 min, followed by a gradual decline to 3% at 45 min (Fig.3 A, dashed line). In contrast, the kidney targeting efficiency for III in normal mice was 10% at 6 min and then declined to 4% or lower over 45 min (Fig. 3 A, solid line). Likewise, control oligosaccharide IIIâ² produced a maximal targeting efficiency of either 10 (LPS) or 7% (normal) at 6 min, which slowly declined to 5% over 45 min (Fig. 3 B). The liver was the second most active targeted site for both III and IIIâ² with 3% targeting efficiency at 6 min, which declined to 1% at 45 min (Fig. 3, C and D). Consequently, a biodistribution time of 15 min was used throughout the rest of the study because it afforded the greatest kidney targeting selectivity between III and IIIâ². The kidney targeting efficiency for III and IIIâ²was determined at an LPS dose of 20 Î¼g and a biodistribution time of 15 min while varying the induction time from 0 to 6 h. Oligosaccharide III targeted the kidney at approximately 4â7% during the first 3 h, after which the targeting efficiency increased to 18% at 4â5 h and then declined to 12% at 6 h (Fig.4). In contrast, oligosaccharideIIIâ² targeted the kidney with 4â7% efficiency during the first 3 h, but failed to increase at induction times of 4 h or longer (Fig. 4). Based on these results, an induction period of 4 h was used throughout the rest of the study. Using the parameters derived above, the pharmacokinetic profiles for oligosaccharides I-IV were compared withIâ²-IVâ² in normal and LPS-dosed mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that each oligosaccharide showed a biexponential decline in blood after i.v. dosing, which was fit by an open two-compartment model with elimination from the central compartment. In normal mice, all oligosaccharides rapidly distributed and showed a MRT under 126 min (TableI).Table IPharmacokinetic parameters for N-linked oligosaccharides in ICR miceOligosaccharideaSee Fig. 1 for oligosaccharide structures.MRTbMean residence time derived from Equation 2 along with the standard deviation for three determinations.t 1/2cThe half-life derived from t 1/2 = 0.693/Î².Vd ssdSteady-state volume of distribution derived from Equation 4.Cl tbeTotal body clearance rate derived from Equation 3.TEfThe targeting efficiency (TE) is defined as the percent of dose in the kidney after a 15-min biodistribution along with the standard error.minminmlml/min%INormal126 Â± 7.491.1 Â± 5.216.5 Â± 3.30.13 Â± 0.035.5 Â± 1.3LPS323 Â± 173225 Â± 12012.4 Â± 5.00.05 Â± 0.035.8 Â± 2.3Iâ²Normal60.9 Â± 10.146.8 Â± 8.813.9 Â± 6.10.22 Â± 0.14.7 Â± 0.5LPS275 Â± 59.7196 Â± 42.810.3 Â± 2.00.04 Â± 0.014.4 Â± 0.2IINormal43.1 Â± 1234.6 Â± 7.811.3 Â± 1.40.27 Â± 0.043.7 Â± 0.4LPS40.7 Â± 2.231.3 Â± 1.07.5 Â± 0.90.18 Â± 0.0220.5 Â± 3.5IIâ²Normal51.9 Â± 7.742.9 Â± 8.712.6 Â± 2.30.24 Â± 0.024.4 Â± 0.5LPS165 Â± 36.2118 Â± 24.49.96 Â± 2.10.06 Â± 0.029.0 Â± 1.6IIINormal90.9 Â± 5.867.9 Â± 2.616.8 Â± 3.80.19 Â± 0.034.3 Â± 1.4LPS52.9 Â± 8.842.4 Â± 8.18.9 Â± 2.80.17 Â± 0.0618.2 Â± 4.0IIIâ²Normal45.3 Â± 11.133.3 Â± 7.514.0 Â± 1.10.32 Â± 0.064.1 Â± 0.7LPS92.9 Â± 14.868.4 Â± 10.98.7 Â± 0.40.09 Â± 0.027.3 Â± 2.8IVNormal54.5 Â± 5.545.0 Â± 6.4215.2 Â± 5.50.27 Â± 0.083.7 Â± 0.3LPS308 Â± 93.1219 Â± 61.711.5 Â± 2.20.04 Â± 0.029.7 Â± 1.4IVâ²Normal36.5 Â± 11.930.8 Â± 9.414.8 Â± 3.10.43 Â± 0.164.3 Â± 1.1LPS303 Â± 55.2216 Â± 34.913.7 Â± 3.20.05 Â± 0.0212.0 Â± 4.1a See Fig. 1 for oligosaccharide structures.b Mean residence time derived from Equation 2 along with the standard deviation for three determinations.c The half-life derived from t 1/2 = 0.693/Î².d Steady-state volume of distribution derived from Equation 4.e Total body clearance rate derived from Equation 3.f The targeting efficiency (TE) is defined as the percent of dose in the kidney after a 15-min biodistribution along with the standard error. Open table in a new tab With the exception of II and III, the pharmacokinetic half-life of each SLex and sialyl oligosaccharide was significantly increased in LPS miceversus normal mice (Table I). Oligosaccharide IIand III demonstrated a significantly shorter half-life than sialyl oligosaccharides IIâ² and IIIâ² in LPS mice (Fig. 5), consistent with the shorter half-life of oligosaccharides that target the asialoglycoprotein receptor (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chiu M.H. Thomas V.H. Stubbs H.J. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24024-24031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Comparison of the kidney targeting efficiency forI-IV in normal and LPS mice provided evidence of receptor binding specificity for II and III (Fig.6). Analysis of I andIâ² in normal mice established that approximately 5% of the dose was recovered in the kidney after a 15 min biodistribution period (Fig. 6 A). In LPS mice, I displayed a slight increase in the kidney targeting (6%) compared with the negligible change observed for Iâ². These results were supported by whole-body autoradiography analysis of I in LPS mice, which indicated only nonspecific targeting to the kidney (Fig.6 E). By comparison, the kidney targeting efficiency of II was dramatically increased in LPS mice. The whole-body autoradiography predicted a very high kidney targeting efficiency (Fig. 6 F), which was supported by the finding that 20% of II targeted the kidney in LPS mice compared with only 4% in the normal mice (Fig.6 B). In contrast, the kidney targeting of control oligosaccharide IIâ² was only moderately increased in LPS mice (9%) relative to normal mice (4%) establishing a significance (p < 0.05) for II/IIâ² kidney targeting in LPS mice. Whole-body autoradiographic analysis established a similar biodistribution profile for III in LPS mice (Fig.6 G), confirming the kidney as the major target site. The kidney targeting efficiency was 18% for III in LPS mice compared with 4% in normal mice. The targeting efficiency forIIIâ² increased only slightly from 4 up to 7% upon dosing with LPS, which established a significance (p < 0.05) for III/IIIâ² kidney targeting selectivity (Fig.6 C). In contrast to the results presented above, biodistribution analysis of oligosaccharides IV and IVâ² failed to establish specific targeting to the kidney. In LPS mice, 10% of IVtargeted the kidney relative to 4% determined in normal mice (Fig.6 D). However, control experiments with IVâ² also demonstrated kidney targeting of 12% in LPS mice and 4% in normal mice, indicating no selectivity in the kidney targeting for oligosaccharides IV and IVâ² in LPS mice (Fig.6 D). To establish if the specific kidney targeting determined forII and III was E- or P-selectin-dependent, blocking mAbs were co-administered with II and IIâ², III andIIIâ², and IV and IVâ² to inhibit kidney targeting. Balb/c mice were used during these experiments because they reportedly produce higher levels of E-selectin when stimulated with LPS (32Henseleit U. Steinbrink K. Goebeler M. Roth J. Vestweber D. Sorg C. Sunderkotter C. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, we found it necessary to dose with 100 Î¼g of LPS to stimulate specific targeting in Balb/c mice compared with 20 Î¼g in ICR mice. Under these conditions, a kidney targeting efficiency of 17% was determined for II in LPS mice compared with 5% forIIâ² (Fig. 7 A). Simultaneous dosing of II with 40 Î¼g of anti-E-selectin mAb blocked the kidney targeting to 8% (p < 0.005), whereas co-administration of II with 40 Î¼g of anti-P-selectin mAb only reduced the kidney targeting to 15%. Co-administration of 40 Î¼g of anti-E- or anti-P-selectin mAb withIIâ² failed to inhibit the kidney targeting. Analysis of III in LPS Balb/c mice established a targeting efficiency of 21% relative to 10% for IIIâ² (Fig.7 B). Co-administration of III with 40 Î¼g of anti-E-selectin mAb inhibited kidney targeting to 6% (p < 0.001), whereas the same dose of anti-P-selectin mAb only caused inhibition to 15%. Likewise, co-administration of either antibody with IIIâ² failed to inhibit kidney targeting (Fig. 7 B). Comparison of oligosaccharide IV and IVâ² in Balb/c mice established that each targeted the kidney at 3% in normal mice, which increased to 11% in LPS mice (Fig. 7 C). In contrast to the inhibition results presented for oligosaccharideII and III, co-administration of 40 Î¼g of anti-E-selectin or anti-P-selectin mAb failed to inhibit the kidney targeting of either IV or IVâ² (Fig.7 C). Since the discovery of the selectins, rapid progress has been made toward unraveling their role in leukocyte trafficking and identifying their glycoprotein ligands. In the case of P- and L-selectin, glycoprotein ligands have been elucidated that possess multipleO-linked oligosaccharides terminating in SLex or sulfo-Lex glycans (33Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 34Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18732-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a proposed ligand for E-selectin (ESL-1) loses its binding activity upon treatment with N-glycosidase F, implicating the involvement ofN-linked oligosaccharides as ligands for E-selectin (18Levinovitz A. Muhlhoff K. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how the ligand valency for E-, P-, and L-selectin relates to the oligomeric state of the receptors on the cell surface. The present study attempts to further elucidate theN-linked oligosaccharide ligand specificity for E-selectin and to shed light on the oligomeric state of the receptor on the cell surface. The data presented indicate the kidney is the major target site for both SLex and sialyl oligosaccharide in LPS and normal mice (Fig. 2). This result can be rationalized because i.v. dosedN-linked oligosaccharides are rapidly cleared by renal filtration and recovered from the kidney in the range of 3â5% (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Chiu M.H. Thomas V.H. Stubbs H.J. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24024-24031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). LPS dosing has been shown to slow the glomerular filtration rate (36Hewett J.A. Roth R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 381-411Google Scholar, 37Hasegawa T. Nadai M. Wang L. Takayama Y. Kato K. Nabeshima T. Kato N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22: 8-13PubMed Google Scholar), which also results in an elevation in the oligosaccharide concentration recovered from the kidney. However, the finding that a 20-Î¼g dose of LPS produced a greater kidney targeting for SLex triantennary III relative to sialyl triantennary IIIâ² (Fig. 2) provided early evidence of selective receptor binding of III. This selectivity was then further enhanced at an optimized biodistribution time of 15 min (Fig.3). Several lines of experimental evidence established that the 17â20% kidney targeting efficiency determined for SLexoligosaccharides II and III in LPS mice was due to specific receptor binding (Fig. 6, B and C). Sialyl oligosaccharide IIâ² and IIIâ² only target the kidney with 9% or lower efficiency demonstrating the requirement for subterminal fucose (Fig. 6, B and C). Only oligosaccharides II and III possessed a shorter pharmacokinetic half-life (Fig. 5, B and C), a result analogous to that reported for N-linked oligosaccharides that target the asialoglycoprotein receptor (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chiu M.H. Thomas V.H. Stubbs H.J. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24024-24031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Likewise, the lack of specific targeting determined for monovalent SLex (I) and SLex tetraantennary oligosaccharide (IV) demonstrates a requirement for either bi- or trivalent SLex N-linked oligosaccharides (Figs. 6 D and 7 C). Two experimental results suggest that the targeting activity is primarily related to E-selectin binding. First, antibody inhibition experiments demonstrated that the majority of the kidney targeting of oligosaccharides II and III can be blocked with anti-E-selectin mAb but not with anti-P-selectin mAb (Fig. 7,A and B). Both antibodies failed to block the kidney targeting of sialyl oligosaccharide controls as well as the SLex tetraantennary oligosaccharide. Second, the kidney targeting induction profile of 4â5 h closely matches the profile of E-selectin mRNA induction reported previously in LPS mice (Fig. 4) (30Fries J.W.U. Williams A.J. Atkins R.C. Newman W. Lipscomb M.F. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 725-737PubMed Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that SLex biantennary and triantennary target E-selectin on the kidney endothelium. The major structural difference between oligosaccharides IIand III relative to IV is the valency of their terminal SLex. Other C-type lectins recognize clustered arrays of oligosaccharides through a multivalent interaction leading to an enormous increase in binding affinity with increasing valency (38Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar,39Lee Y.C. Townsend R.R. Hardy M.R. Lonngren J. Arnarp J. Haraldsson M. Lonn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 199-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, a triantennaryN-linked oligosaccharide mediates a 57% liver targeting efficiency, whereas a biantennary oligosaccharide only targets at 6% efficiency because of suboccupancy of the three available galactose binding pockets (26Chiu M.H. Tamura T. Wadhwa M.W. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16195-16202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chiu M.H. Thomas V.H. Stubbs H.J. Rice K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24024-24031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 40Lee Y.C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3193-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A similar interpretation of the kidney targeting data presented here suggests that E-selectin binds optimally to a biantennary oligosaccharide because nearly equivalent targeting efficiencies were determined for II and III, suggesting that the third antenna possessing SLex on III fails to contribute to the binding affinity. The lack of specific E-selectin targeting observed for IV indicates this is not a simple multivalency effect because one would expect an increased, not a decreased, affinity if the receptor could oligomerize to accept all four SLex determinants. Rather, the inability of E-selectin to bind IV may be due to steric hinderance that prevents even two of the four SLex epitopes from binding. This unexpected multivalent ligand effect leads to the hypothesis that E-selectin is dimeric, possessing two carbohydrate recognition domains that must position binding sites to simultaneously accept two SLex ligands. These are apparently closely spaced by no more than 25â30 â« on the cell surface, because this is the maximum distance spanned by the antennae on an N-linked oligosaccharide (40Lee Y.C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3193-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to support this hypothesis by attempting to cross-linking E-selectin subunits on the cell surface and by determining the exact chemical nature of theN-linked oligosaccharides on ESL-1. But it is intriguing to consider that the oligomeric state of E-, P-, and L-selectin may each be unique, providing different selectivity and binding affinity for ligands possessing multivalent SLex."
https://openalex.org/W2160627003,"Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) catalyzes the selective release of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of phospholipids and is believed to play a key cellular role in the generation of arachidonic acid. When assaying the human recombinant cPLA2 using membranes isolated from [3H]arachidonate-labeled U937 cells as substrate, 2-(2â²-benzyl-4-chlorophenoxy)ethyl-dimethyl-n-octadecyl-ammonium chloride (compound 1) was found to inhibit the enzyme in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 5 Î¼m). It was over 70 times more selective for the cPLA2 as compared with the human nonpancreatic secreted phospholipase A2, and it did not inhibit other phospholipases. Additionally, it inhibited arachidonate production inN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated U937 cells. To further characterize the mechanism of inhibition, an assay in which the enzyme is bound to vesicles of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphomethanol containing 6â10 mol % of 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was employed. With this substrate system, the dose-dependent inhibition could be defined by kinetic equations describing competitive inhibition at the lipid-water interface. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the inhibitor bound to the enzyme at the interface (K I*app) was determined to be 0.097 Â± 0.032 mol % versus an apparent dissociation constant for the arachidonate-containing phospholipid of 0.3 Â± 0.1 mol %. Thus, compound 1 represents a novel structural class of inhibitor of cPLA2 that partitions into the phospholipid bilayer and competes with the phospholipid substrate for the active site. Shorter n-alkyl-chained (C-4, C-6, C-8) derivatives of compound 1 were shown to have even smallerK I*app values. However, these short-chained analogs were less potent in terms of bulk inhibitor concentration needed for inhibition when using the [3H]arachidonate-labeled U937 membranes as substrate. This discrepancy was reconciled by showing that these shorter-chained analogs did not partition into the [3H]arachidonate-labeled U937 membranes as effectively as compound 1. The implications for in vivo efficacy that result from these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2343541664,"T raumatic injuries are often followed by chronic nerve pain that remains long after the original injury has healed. Drugs to treat such neuropathic pain are often ineffective and can be associated with severe side effects. Wilson ([1][1]), Iadarola ([2][2]), and their colleagues now report two similar strategies for treating chronic pain, using viruses to deliver genes encoding pain-killer proteins to the central nervous system. Unlike analgesic drugs that are administered systemically, targeted delivery of a therapeutic pain-killer gene ensures that its protein product will be secreted in the vicinity of the nerves that conduct pain impulses.

To deliver the therapeutic gene to the spinal cord, the two groups developed different methods. Wilson and co-workers selected herpes simplex virus, which readily infects nerve cells, to transport the gene for human preproenkephalin (a precursor of Met-enkephalin, an opioid peptide with pain-killer activity) into mouse afferent nerves. They inoculated herpesvirus carrying the pain-killer gene into an abrasion in the mouse hindpaw. The virus traveled up the afferent nerves from the skin, taking up residence in the spinal cord. Here, proenkephalin was synthesized (red fluorescence in photo) and then processed into Met-enkephalin. Compared with mice inoculated with a marker gene, mice inoculated with the therapeutic gene took much longer to withdraw their hindpaw from a noxious stimulus, a measure of sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia). Decreased pain sensitivity was observed for up to 6 weeks after inoculation of the therapeutic gene. That the pain-killing effect was at least partly due to Met-enkephalin was demonstrated by the restoration of hindpaw pain sensitivity after administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist.

Iadarola's group took a different approach to deliver their therapeutic gene. They injected adenovirusâengineered to express the Î²-endorphin geneâdirectly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes the spinal cord. Î²-endorphin (another pain-killer opioid peptide) was synthesized in the connective tissue cells of the pia mater (one of the membranes that protects the spinal cord). These cells secreted Î²-endorphin into the CSF. They found that injection of the therapeutic gene several days before testing resulted in a naloxone-reversible decrease in pain sensitivity.

Although these effects were transient, when applied repeatedly this gene delivery strategy may be applicable to chronic pain in humans.
