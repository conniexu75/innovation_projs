https://openalex.org/W3131871667,"Human monoclonal antibodies are safe, preventive, and therapeutic tools that can be rapidly developed to help restore the massive health and economic disruption caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. By single-cell sorting 4,277 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific memory B cells from 14 COVID-19 survivors, 453 neutralizing antibodies were identified. The most potent neutralizing antibodies recognized the spike protein receptor-binding domain, followed in potency by antibodies that recognize the S1 domain, the spike protein trimer, and the S2 subunit. Only 1.4% of them neutralized the authentic virus with a potency of 1–10 ng/mL. The most potent monoclonal antibody, engineered to reduce the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement and prolong half-life, neutralized the authentic wild-type virus and emerging variants containing D614G, E484K, and N501Y substitutions. Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the hamster model was observed at 0.25 and 4 mg/kg respectively in absence of Fc functions."

However, the methods used to prepare mono-, di-, or trifluorocarbon centers tend to differ from each other in inconvenient ways. Yu et al. developed a radical reaction that can successively remove one or two fluorine atoms from trifluoromethyl groups adjacent to amides or esters. The mechanism relies on a spin-center shift after attack at the carbonyl oxygen by a boryl radical. Science , this issue p. 1232"

Mann et al. now show that this variation is forced externally by episodes of high-amplitude explosive volcanism. They used an ensemble of climate models to evaluate the causes of the AMO, finding that volcanos are the most important influence, and that there is no evidence to show that it has been internally generated during the last millennium.

https://openalex.org/W3133531010,"Warming autumns, fewer butterflies Many recent studies have revealed sweeping declines in insects over the past few decades. Butterflies are no exception. Forister et al. used three different datasets, collected by both experts and community scientists, and found that the number of butterflies has declined over the past 40 years. Although the drivers of decline are complex, the authors found that climate change—in particular, warmer months in the autumn—explain a large portion, even as warming summers actually lead to increases. This work shows that climate change impacts may be insidious and unexpected in their effects. Science , this issue p. 1042"
https://openalex.org/W3135258157,"Divergence of gene function is a hallmark of evolution, but assessing functional divergence over deep time is not trivial. The few alleles available for cross-species studies often fail to expose the entire functional spectrum of genes, potentially obscuring deeply conserved pleiotropic roles. Here, we explore the functional divergence of WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX9 (WOX9), suggested to have species-specific roles in embryo and inflorescence development. Using a cis-regulatory editing drive system, we generate a comprehensive allelic series in tomato, which revealed hidden pleiotropic roles for WOX9. Analysis of accessible chromatin and conserved cis-regulatory sequences identifies the regions responsible for this pleiotropic activity, the functions of which are conserved in groundcherry, a tomato relative. Mimicking these alleles in Arabidopsis, distantly related to tomato and groundcherry, reveals new inflorescence phenotypes, exposing a deeply conserved pleiotropy. We suggest that targeted cis-regulatory mutations can uncover conserved gene functions and reduce undesirable effects in crop improvement."

However, when the solid fraction is below about 30%, the mechanical properties rapidly degrade. Shi et al. discovered that two dealloying steps allow for the creation of a silver-gold alloy with a solid fraction as low as 12%. Unexpectedly, this process does not degrade the mechanical properties while allowing for large samples to be synthesized. The strategy should be applicable to other alloy systems, providing a pathway for creating strong and lightweight materials. Science , this issue p. 1026"
https://openalex.org/W3133592101,"Macrophages seal 'em in the coelom GATA6 + macrophages resident in body cavities exhibit both phagocytic and repair functions. However, the mechanisms by which these cells can identify and migrate to sites of injury have remained unclear. Using intravital imaging of mouse peritoneal cavities, Zindel et al. report that GATA6 + macrophages rapidly assemble clot-like structures in a process strongly analogous to thrombosis (see the Perspective by Herrick and Allen). The formation of these aggregates requires the expression of macrophage scavenger receptor domains and acts to plug wounds and promote healing. This pathway can be inadvertently activated during medical procedures, when macrophage aggregates can promote the generation of abdominal scar tissue known as adhesions. Inhibition of macrophage scavenger receptors may therefore be a useful therapeutic approach after surgeries that cause injury to body cavities. Science , this issue p. eabe0595 ; see also p. 993"

Guo et al. found concentric circular bands of polarization in a ferroelectric polymer that look like a bull's-eye target (see the Perspective by Martin). This self-organized toroidal texture is aligned perpendicularly to the axis of the polymer chains, allowing the authors to demonstrate selective absorption of infrared radiation and manipulation of terahertz radiation. This distinct structure in a polymer could be of interest for exploring and using other exotic effects. Science , this issue p. 1050 ; see also p. 992"

https://openalex.org/W3134383627,"Microbial production of antibiotics is common, but our understanding of their roles in the environment is limited. In this study, we explore long-standing observations that microbes increase the production of redox-active antibiotics under phosphorus limitation. The availability of phosphorus, a nutrient required by all life on Earth and essential for agriculture, can be controlled by adsorption to and release from iron minerals by means of redox cycling. Using phenazine antibiotic production by pseudomonads as a case study, we show that phenazines are regulated by phosphorus, solubilize phosphorus through reductive dissolution of iron oxides in the lab and field, and increase phosphorus-limited microbial growth. Phenazines are just one of many examples of phosphorus-regulated antibiotics. Our work suggests a widespread but previously unappreciated role for redox-active antibiotics in phosphorus acquisition and cycling."
https://openalex.org/W3135337453,"Peripheral nerve injury induces long-term pro-inflammatory responses in spinal cord glial cells that facilitate neuropathic pain, but the identity of endogenous cells that resolve spinal inflammation has not been determined. Guided by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we found that MRC1+ spinal cord macrophages proliferated and upregulated the anti-inflammatory mediator Cd163 in mice following superficial injury (SI; nerve intact), but this response was blunted in nerve-injured animals. Depleting spinal macrophages in SI animals promoted microgliosis and caused mechanical hypersensitivity to persist. Conversely, expressing Cd163 in spinal macrophages increased Interleukin 10 expression, attenuated micro- and astrogliosis, and enduringly alleviated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in nerve-injured animals. Our data indicate that MRC1+ spinal macrophages actively restrain glia to limit neuroinflammation and resolve mechanical pain following a superficial injury. Moreover, we show that spinal macrophages from nerve-injured animals mount a dampened anti-inflammatory response but can be therapeutically coaxed to promote long-lasting recovery of neuropathic pain."

Both features are important and can be unrelated or antagonistic. Pinney et al. combined rich experimental work on thermophilic and mesophilic variants of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) with bioinformatic data from a diverse set of bacterial enzymes to reveal the molecular determinants of thermal adaptation in enzymes. For KSI, they observed a trade-off between activity and thermal stability that comes down to a single active-site residue. With their larger dataset, they identified patterns of individual amino acid substitutions that are favored at higher temperatures, and also consider how networks of stabilizing interactions develop.

https://openalex.org/W3135463285,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBCs) account for 15-20% of all breast cancers and represent the most aggressive subtype of this malignancy. Early tumor relapse and progression are linked to the enrichment of a sub-fraction of cancer cells, termed breast tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), that undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and typically exhibit a basal-like CD44high/CD24low and/or ALDH1high phenotype with critical cancer stem-like features such as high self-renewal capacity and intrinsic (de novo) resistance to standard of care chemotherapy. One of the major mechanisms responsible for the intrinsic drug resistance of BTICs is their high ALDH1 activity leading to inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that aurora-A kinase (AURKA) is required to mediate TGF-β-induced expression of the SNAI1 gene, enrichment of ALDH1high BTICs, self-renewal capacity, and chemoresistance in TNBC experimental models. Significantly, the combination of docetaxel (DTX) with dual TGF-β and AURKA pharmacologic targeting impaired tumor relapse and the emergence of distant metastasis. We also showed in unique chemoresistant TNBC cells isolated from patient-derived TNBC brain metastasis that dual TGF-β and AURKA pharmacologic targeting reversed cancer plasticity and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to DTX-based-chemotherapy. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time the critical role of AURKA oncogenic signaling in mediating TGF-β-induced TNBC plasticity, chemoresistance, and tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W3134472965,"Human PrP (huPrP) is a high-affinity receptor for oligomeric amyloid β (Aβ) protein aggregates. Binding of Aβ oligomers to membrane-anchored huPrP has been suggested to trigger neurotoxic cell signaling in Alzheimer’s disease, while an N-terminal soluble fragment of huPrP can sequester Aβ oligomers and reduce their toxicity. Synthetic oligomeric Aβ species are known to be heterogeneous, dynamic, and transient, rendering their structural investigation particularly challenging. Here, using huPrP to preserve Aβ oligomers by coprecipitating them into large heteroassemblies, we investigated the conformations of Aβ(1–42) oligomers and huPrP in the complex by solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopy. The disordered N-terminal region of huPrP becomes immobilized in the complex and therefore visible in dipolar spectra without adopting chemical shifts characteristic of a regular secondary structure. Most of the well-defined C-terminal part of huPrP is part of the rigid complex, and solid-state NMR spectra suggest a loss in regular secondary structure in the two C-terminal α-helices. For Aβ(1–42) oligomers in complex with huPrP, secondary chemical shifts reveal substantial β-strand content. Importantly, not all Aβ(1–42) molecules within the complex have identical conformations. Comparison with the chemical shifts of synthetic Aβ fibrils suggests that the Aβ oligomer preparation represents a heterogeneous mixture of β-strand-rich assemblies, of which some have the potential to evolve and elongate into different fibril polymorphs, reflecting a general propensity of Aβ to adopt variable β-strand-rich conformers. Taken together, our results reveal structural changes in huPrP upon binding to Aβ oligomers that suggest a role of the C terminus of huPrP in cell signaling. Trapping Aβ(1–42) oligomers by binding to huPrP has proved to be a useful tool for studying the structure of these highly heterogeneous β-strand-rich assemblies.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for an estimated 60 to 80% of all types of dementia (12018 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures.Alzheimers Dement. 2018; 14: 367-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of AD is the formation of amyloid plaques, which consist mainly of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides comprising 39 to 43 residues (2Selkoe D.J. Hardy J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease at 25 years.EMBO Mol. Med. 2016; 8: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (3204) Google Scholar). Aβ is produced by cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases (3Kellett K.A.B. Hooper N.M. Prion protein and Alzheimer disease.Prion. 2009; 3: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Of the two most abundant species Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42), the latter is more prone to aggregation and its aggregates are more toxic (3Kellett K.A.B. Hooper N.M. Prion protein and Alzheimer disease.Prion. 2009; 3: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Small to moderately sized Aβ oligomers (Aβoligos) have been identified as the most neurotoxic factor in the pathogenesis of AD, whereas large fibrils are known to be the main component of insoluble plaques (4Selkoe D.J.

A structural study of insoluble PrPC-Aβoligo complexes described them as a “hydrogel,” in which the Aβ(1−42)oligos were rigid, while PrP still has high molecular mobility (44Kostylev M.A. Tuttle M.D. Lee S.

Additionally, this study reported a conformational change in the N terminus of PrPC upon complexation with Aβoligo. We recently demonstrated that Aβoligo forms large heteroassemblies with either full-length (huPrP(23–230)) or C-terminally truncated (huPrP(23–144)) membrane-anchorless monomeric PrP (40Rösener N.S.

These assemblies have a size of a few micrometers as determined by dynamic light scattering and show cloud-like morphologies as seen by atomic force microscopy (40Rösener N.S. Gremer L. Reinartz E.

Chem. 2018; 293: 15748-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Aβ:huPrP stoichiometry of the heteroassemblies depends on the amount of huPrP added to Aβoligo and reaches a value of 4:1 (monomer ratio Aβ:huPrP) if either huPrP(23–144) or huPrP(23–230) is added to the oligomer solution in excess (40Rösener N.S.

In all these in vitro preparations, Aβ oligomers and early-stage protofibrils are stabilized and prevented from elongation by PrP, which has been shown to preferentially bind to fast-growing fibril and oligomer ends (22Amin L. Harris D.A. Aβ receptors specifically recognize molecular features displayed by fibril ends and neurotoxic oligomers.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/822361Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Here we exploit this stabilizing effect in an NMR study on different samples of Aβoligo complexed by huPrP. Isotope labeling of either huPrP or Aβ allowed us to characterize both components of the complex separately. While the N-terminal region of huPrP in the complex remains largely devoid of secondary structure and still undergoes fast backbone conformational averaging on the microsecond to millisecond timescale, Aβoligos exhibit a high degree of β-strand conformation. While these Aβoligos are highly heterogeneous, solid-state NMR spectra reveal similarities with the corresponding spectra of all fibril polymorphs published so far (45Colvin M.T. Silvers R. Ni Q.Z.

Fibril structure of amyloid-β(1–42) by cryo–electron microscopy.Science. 2017; 358: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The solution structure of huPrP(23–230) had originally been determined in acetate buffer at an acidic pH of 4.5 and a temperature of 20 °C (48Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. López García F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. NMR solution structure of the human prion protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), whereas the huPrP-Aβ(1–42)oligo complex samples for solid-state NMR were prepared at a pH value close to neutral. As a basis for studying the interaction between huPrP and Aβoligo, we therefore first investigated free huPrP(23–144) by NMR spectroscopy in solution at different pH values ranging from 4.5 to 7.0 and at a temperature of 5.0 °C, which is closer to the temperature used for the solid-state NMR experiments. As reported previously, the chemical shifts of the N-terminal amino acid residues 23 to 124 in truncated huPrP(23–144) are almost identical to those of huPrP(23–230), whereas residues 125 to 144, which are part of the well-ordered globular domain of huPrP(23–230), are strongly affected by the truncation at position 144 (40Rösener N.S. Gremer L. Reinartz E. König A. Brener O. Heise H. Hoyer W. Neudecker P. Willbold D. A d-enantiomeric peptide interferes with heteroassociation of amyloid-β oligomers and prion protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 15748-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We obtained almost complete sequence-specific 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone resonance assignments for huPrP(23–144) at pH values of 4.5 and 7.0 and a temperature of 5.0 °C using a combination of HNCO, HNCACB, and BEST-TROSY-(H)N(COCA)NH triple-resonance experiments (Fig. S2). The assigned chemical shifts at pH 4.5 and pH 7.0 have been deposited with the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) under accession codes 28115 and 28116, respectively. As expected, side-chain titration in this pH range causes significant chemical shift changes for all seven histidine residues and for residues next to histidine. Other than that, the chemical shifts at pH 4.5 and pH 7.0 are very similar to each other and very close to random coil shifts (49Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. H-1, C-13 and N-15 random coil NMR chemical-shifts of the common amino-acids.1. Investigations of nearest-neighbor effects.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis reveals that the Random Coil Index (RCI) order parameters (50Berjanskii M.V. Wishart D.S. A simple method to predict protein flexibility using secondary chemical shifts.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14970-14971Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) SRCI2, which are a measure of how different the backbone chemical shifts are from those of a disordered random coil on a scale of 0 (typical for a random coil) to 1 (typical for a well-ordered backbone conformation), are consistently below ≈0.6 (Fig. S3). This demonstrates conclusively that free huPrP(23–144) in solution at neutral and mildly acidic pH is highly disordered and devoid of any stable secondary structure. High-molecular-weight heteroassemblies of oligomeric Aβ(1–42) and huPrP(23–144) or of oligomeric Aβ(1–42) and huPrP(23–230) were prepared by adding the respective huPrP construct to a preincubated solution of Aβ(1–42), as described previously (40Rösener N.S. Gremer L. Reinartz E. König A. Brener O. Heise H. Hoyer W. Neudecker P. Willbold D. A d-enantiomeric peptide interferes with heteroassociation of amyloid-β oligomers and prion protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 15748-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immediately after addition of huPrP to the solution, precipitation of a solid fine white powder was observed. These formed high-molecular-weight heteroassemblies were analyzed by an MTT cell viability test (Fig. 1A). Both huPrP(23–230) and huPrP(23–144) reduce Aβ(1–42)oligo toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner, thus these complexes are not toxic, and huPrP has a protective effect. As our complexes do not exhibit a GPI anchor, this fits to the observation of a protective role for non-membrane-bound huPrP fragments (32Nieznanski K. Choi J.-K. Chen S. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K.

Adjunctive to mechanical treatment of periodontitis and as alternatives to antibiotics, the use of probiotic bacteria was suggested. In this study, the inhibitory effect of the probiotic Streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius strains M18 and K12, Streptococcus oralis subsp. dentisani 7746, and Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 5289 on anaerobic periodontal bacteria and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was tested. Rarely included in other studies, we also quantified the inverse effect of pathogens on probiotic growth. Probiotics and periodontal pathogens were co-incubated anaerobically in a mixture of autoclaved saliva and brain heart infusion broth. The resulting genome numbers of the pathogens and of the probiotics were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Mixtures of the streptococcal probiotics were also used to determine their synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. The overall best inhibitor of the periodontal pathogens was L . reuteri ATCC PTA 5289, but the effect is coenzyme B12-, anaerobiosis-, as well as glycerol-dependent, and further modulated by L . reuteri strain DSM 17938. Notably, in absence of glycerol, the pathogen-inhibitory effect could even turn into a growth spurt. Among the streptococci tested, S . salivarius M18 had the most constant inhibitory potential against all pathogens, followed by K12 and S . dentisani 7746, with the latter still having significant inhibitory effects on P . intermedia and A . actinomycetemcomitans . Overall, mixtures of the streptococcal probiotics did inhibit the growth of the pathogens equally or–in the case of A . actinomycetemcomitans - better than the individual strains. P . gingivalis and F . nucleatum were best inhibited by pure cultures of S . salivarius K12 or S . salivarius M18, respectively. Testing inverse effects, the growth of S . salivarius M18 was enhanced when incubated with the periodontal pathogens minus/plus other probiotics. In contrast, S . oralis subsp. dentisani 7746 was not much influenced by the pathogens. Instead, it was significantly inhibited by the presence of other streptococcal probiotics. In conclusion, despite some natural limits such as persistence, the full potential for probiotic treatment is by far not utilized yet. Especially, further exploring concerted activity by combining synergistic strains, together with the application of oral prebiotics and essential supplements and conditions, is mandatory."

We report that Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms can discriminate between colors despite the fact that they lack eyes and opsins. Specifically, we found that white light guides C. elegans foraging decisions away from a blue-pigment toxin secreted by harmful bacteria. These foraging decisions are guided by specific blue-to-amber ratios of light. The color specificity of color-dependent foraging varies notably among wild C. elegans strains, which indicates that color discrimination is ecologically important. We identified two evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response genes required for opsin-independent, color-dependent foraging by C. elegans, and we speculate that cellular stress response pathways can mediate spectral discrimination by photosensitive cells and organisms-even by those lacking opsins."

https://openalex.org/W3134382291,"Prostate cancer is a major global health concern with limited treatment options for advanced disease. Its heterogeneity challenges the identification of crucial driver genes implicated in disease progression. Activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor is associated with cancer since the first identification of its subunits, the proto-oncogenes JUN and FOS. Whereas both JUN and FOS have been implicated in prostate cancer, this study provides the first functional evidence that FOS acts as a tumor suppressor during prostate cancer progression and invasion. Data mining revealed decreased FOS expression in prostate cancer and a further downregulation in metastatic disease, consistent with FOS expression in cell lines derived from different prostate cancer stages. FOS deficiency in prostate cancer cell lines increases cell proliferation and induces oncogenic pathway alterations. Importantly, in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Fos and Pten double mutation in murine prostate epithelium results in increased proliferation and invasiveness compared to the abrogation of Pten alone. Interestingly, enhanced Jun expression is observed in the murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lacking Fos. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Jun combined with Fos and Pten deficiency diminishes the increased proliferation rate in vivo but not the ability to form invasive disease. Overall, we demonstrate that loss of Fos promotes disease progression from clinical latent prostate cancer to advanced disease through accelerated proliferation and invasiveness, partly through Jun."

Song et al. transferred human fetal liver cells into MISTRG mice, which are immunodeficient and are genetically engineered with several human genes involved in hematopoiesis. This approach was unsuccessful because mature huRBCs are rapidly destroyed in the mouse liver. They then used CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate these mice into a fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase–deficient strain, allowing them to replace the mouse liver with engrafted human hepatocytes. These mice exhibited enhanced human erythropoiesis and circulating huRBC survival and could recapitulate SCD pathology when reconstituted with SCD-derived HSCs. Science , this issue p. 1019"
https://openalex.org/W3133570421,"Metabolic deregulation, a hallmark of cancer, fuels cancer cell growth and metastasis. Here, we show that phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), an enzyme of the serine metabolism pathway, is upregulated in patient-derived melanoma samples. PSPH knockdown using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) blocks melanoma tumor growth and metastasis in both cell culture and mice. To elucidate the mechanism underlying PSPH action, we evaluated PSPH shRNA-expressing melanoma cells using global metabolomics and targeted mRNA expression profiling. Metabolomics analysis showed an increase in 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels in PSPH knockdown cells. 2-HG inhibits the TET family of DNA demethylases and the Jumonji family of histone demethylases (KDM and JMJD), which is known to impact gene expression. Consistent with these data, PSPH knockdown in melanoma cells showed reduced DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and increased histone H3K4me3 modifications. 2-HG treatment also inhibited melanoma growth. The nCounter PanCancer Pathways Panel-based mRNA expression profiling revealed attenuation of a number of cancer-promoting pathways upon PSPH knockdown. In particular, PSPH was necessary for nuclear receptor NR4A1 expression. Ectopic NR4A1 expression partly rescued the growth of melanoma cells expressing PSPH shRNA. Collectively, these results link PSPH to the facilitation of melanoma growth and metastasis through suppression of 2-HG and thus activation of pro-oncogenic gene expression."

The polysaccharide xylan is abundant in dietary fiber but noncarbohydrate decorations hinder efficient cleavage by glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and need to be addressed by carbohydrate esterases (CEs). Enzymes from carbohydrate esterase families 1 and 6 (CE1 and 6) perform key roles in xylan degradation by removing feruloyl and acetate decorations, yet little is known about these enzyme families especially with regard to their diversity in activity. Bacteroidetes bacteria are dominant members of the microbiota and often encode their carbohydrate-active enzymes in multigene polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs).

We demonstrate that the CEs are functionally distinct, with one highly efficient CE6 acetyl esterase and two CE1 enzymes with feruloyl esterase activities. One multidomain CE1 enzyme contains two CE1 domains: an N-terminal domain feruloyl esterase, and a C-terminal domain with minimal activity on model substrates. We present the structure of the C-terminal CE1 domain with the carbohydrate-binding module that bridges the two CE1 domains, as well as a complex of the same protein fragment with methyl ferulate.

The gastrointestinal tract of mammals is a complex environment characterized by very high densities of microorganisms. The majority of the human gut microbiota is located in the colon (1Sender R. Fuchs S. Milo R. Revised estimates for the number of human and bacteria cells in the body.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14e1002533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar), where bacterial communities degrade undigested food particles (dietary fiber), which the human host cannot directly process (2Flint H.J.

In return, many species found in these microbial communities secrete short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can be absorbed and metabolized by host cells (3Martens E.C. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I.

By mining for conserved SusC/SusD-like sequences in other genomes, PULs can be predicted and are collected in the PULDB database (www.cazy.org/PULDB; (14Terrapon N. Lombard V. Lap P. Al-Masaudi S.

Biofuels. 2016; 9: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the Bacteroidetes phylum, the genus Dysgonomonas forms a phylogenetic cluster within the Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, and the genus maintains genome sequence similarities between 79 and 88% to the other group members (21Lawson P.A. Falsen E. Inganäs E. Weyant R.S. Collins M.A.D. Dysgonomonas mossii sp. nov., from human sources.Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2002; 25: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dysgonomonas mossii is a species that was first isolated from human abdominal drainage, and it has been demonstrated to hydrolyze starch and produce SCFAs from polysaccharide building blocks such as l-arabinose, cellobiose, l-rhamnose, and d-xylose (21Lawson P.A. Falsen E. Inganäs E. Weyant R.S. Collins M.A.D. Dysgonomonas mossii sp. nov., from human sources.Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2002; 25: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The capabilities of D. mossii to degrade complex carbohydrates have not been studied in detail, but according to the PULDB, it encodes 29 putative PULs, none as of yet supported with experimental data. The predicted activities of the putative CAZymes found in the largest predicted PUL of D. mossii, PUL 17, suggest that this bacterium is able to target complex xylan polysaccharides that are abundant in dietary fiber. Xylan is a major plant cell wall component and is the second most abundant polysaccharide in hardwoods and grass species after cellulose (22Timell T.E. Recent progress in the chemistry of wood hemicelluloses.Wood Sci. Technol. 1967; 1: 45-70Crossref Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The backbone of xylan consists of β-1,4-linked xylose moieties that can be substituted with various carbohydrate and noncarbohydrate decorations depending on the plant species and tissue (23Terrett O.M. Dupree P. Covalent interactions between lignin and hemicelluloses in plant secondary cell walls.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2018; 56: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX) is the most structurally complex form of xylan, requiring multiple enzymatic activities for complete hydrolysis into monosaccharides. Carbohydrate decorations on the main chains of GAX include α-1,2-linked d-glucuronic acid, α-1,2 and/or α-1,3 linked l-arabinofuranosyl groups, and α-1,2-, α-1,3- and/or β-1,3-linked xylosyl substitutions (24Rogowski A.

Henrissat B. et al.Glycan complexity dictates microbial resource allocation in the large intestine.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 1-16Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Noncarbohydrate decorations include acetylation at the O-2 and/or O-3 positions of the xylan backbone (25Kabel M.A. De Waard P. Schols H.A. Voragen G.J.

Feruloyl groups can additionally be either linked to lignin or neighboring feruloylated GAX chains by forming diferulate cross-links that increase recalcitrance to enzymatic degradation (27de O Buanafina M.M.

Specifically, noncarbohydrate decorations on the xylan backbone have been shown to inhibit the activity of endo-xylanases, thus impeding efficient biomass degradation (30Biely P. MacKenzie C.R. Puls J. Schneider H. Cooperativity of esterases and xylanases in the enzymatic degradation of acetyl xylan.Nat. Biotechnol. 1986; 4: 731-733Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Grabber J.H. Hatfield R.D. Ralph J. Diferulate cross-links impede the enzymatic degradation of non-lignified maize walls.Sci. Food Agric. 1998; 77: 193-200Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The enzyme repertoires used by mammalian gut symbionts could therefore also serve as a source for the discovery of enzymes relevant to biorefineries. Carbohydrate esterases (CEs) are enzymes able to remove ester-linked decorations from carbohydrates. Enzymes from carbohydrate esterase family 1 (CE1) and CE6 are common in PULs and have been shown, or predicted, to target xylans (14Terrapon N. Lombard V. Lap P. Al-Masaudi S. Gilbert H.J. Henrissat B. PULDB: The expanded database of polysaccharide utilization loci.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CE6 enzymes have exclusively been shown to be acetyl xylan esterases, though only a few enzymes from the family have been characterized to date (15Cantarel B.I. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): An expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3888) Google Scholar). Several specificities have conversely been discovered in CE1, such as acetyl xylan esterase, feruloyl esterase, and cinnamoyl esterase. Specificity toward certain feruloylations and whether the heterogeneity of lignin influences feruloyl esterase activity is thus far not well understood. In the densely colonized gut, there is fierce competition for nutrients, and it is likely that possession of efficient CEs that enable greater access to cell wall polysaccharides can give microorganisms a competitive advantage. In a recent study, we demonstrated that in two unique PULs from the gut bacterium Bacteroides ovatus and the aerobic soil bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae, CE1 and CE6 enzymes are found in “multicatalytic” enzymes, i.e., enzymes comprised of multiple catalytic domains on the same polypeptide (32Kmezik C. Bonzom C. Mazurkewich S. Olsson L. Larsbrink J. Multimodular fused acetyl-feruloyl esterases from soil and gut Bacteroidetes improve xylanase depolymerization of recalcitrant biomass.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2020; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The combination of complementary enzymatic activities into single proteins with strongly enhanced activity has previously been shown mainly for enzyme activities targeting the main polysaccharide chain (20Larsbrink J. Zhu Y. Kharade S.S. Kwiatkowski K.J. Eijsink V.G.H. Koropatkin N.M. McBride M.J. Pope P.B. A polysaccharide utilization locus from Flavobacterium johnsoniae enables conversion of recalcitrant chitin.Biotechnol.

Revealing nature’ s cellulase diversity: The digestion mechanisms of Caldicellulosiruptor bescii CelA.Science. 2013; 342: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), but research on multicatalytic enzymes is often impeded by their large size and resulting difficulties in protein production (34Krska D. Larsbrink J. Investigation of a thermostable multi-domain xylanase-glucuronoyl esterase enzyme from Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii incorporating multiple carbohydrate-binding modules.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2020; 13: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The benefit from combining “accessory” CE activities into a single enzyme is not as obvious as for glycoside hydrolases (GHs), where e.g., an endo-acting enzyme can provide new chain ends for exo-acting enzymes that in turn reveal new sites of attack for the endo-acting enzymes and so forth. Combined CE action may instead “only” trim carbohydrate decorations. Why a simultaneous attack by fused enzymes is desirable is not clear. However, we recently showed that CE action may also be enhanced by a multicatalytic protein architecture when aiding endo-acting GH enzymes (32Kmezik C. Bonzom C. Mazurkewich S. Olsson L. Larsbrink J. Multimodular fused acetyl-feruloyl esterases from soil and gut Bacteroidetes improve xylanase depolymerization of recalcitrant biomass.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2020; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have investigated the role of the CEs encoded in PUL 17 of the gut bacterium D. mossii. The PUL, assumed to target xylan, encodes one CE6 and two CE1 enzymes, one of which was shown to be a multicatalytic CE1-CE1 fusion. Studies of such CE1-CE1 fusions have to our knowledge not previously been reported. The enzymes were biochemically characterized on model substrates by kinetic studies and product analyses. The multicatalytic CE1 enzyme was studied in both its full-length form and as truncated single catalytic domain variants. Both CE1 enzymes contain carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) from family 48 (CBM48), though binding studies of these revealed no affinity to the range of glycans tested. Boosting studies where the enzymes were used in conjunction with a xylanase were performed on milled corn cob biomass as a native substrate, with the results supporting the hypothesis that each PUL-encoded CE serves a distinct biological function in the xylan metabolism of D. mossii. We further present the structure of the C-terminal CE1 and internal CBM48 domains of the multicatalytic DmCE1B enzyme. The structure was solved both in the apo form and with a feruloyl esterase substrate ligand, and these provide a basis of understanding the elusive substrate specificity of this catalytic domain. Of the 29 predicted PULs found in the D. mossii genome, 19 are composed of six or fewer proteins, and several only encode a single SusC/D-like pair (PULDB; (14Terrapon N. Lombard V. Lap P. Al-Masaudi S. Gilbert H.J. Henrissat B. PULDB: The expanded database of polysaccharide utilization loci.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)) and may not be functional PULs targeting polysaccharides. The largest and most complex of the D. mossii PULs is labeled PUL 17 (locus tags HMPREF9456_02254–HMPREF9456_02292; Fig. 1A), and none of its 39 encoded proteins have previously been biochemically characterized. The PUL encodes glycoside hydrolases (GHs) from families known to target xylan, including putative xylanases (GH8, GH10), a β-xylosidase (GH43), α-l-arabinofuranosidases (GH43, GH51, GH146), and α-glucuronidases (GH67, GH115), which collectively indicate that PUL 17 likely targets complex GAX. This is further supported by the fact that the PUL also contains a set of CE1 and CE6 enzymes (DmCE1A, DmCE1B, and DmCE6A), which may enable removal of acetyl and feruloyl moieties, which are common in GAX. The listed enzyme families are also present in the characterized xylan-targeting PUL BoXylL, which enables B. ovatus to metabolize complex GAX (24Rogowski A. Briggs J.A. Mortimer J.C. Tryfona T. Terrapon N. Morland C. Day A.M. Zheng H. Rogers T.E. Lowe E.C. Basle A. Thompson P. Hawkins A.R. Yadav M.P. Henrissat B. et al.Glycan complexity dictates microbial resource allocation in the large intestine.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 1-16Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The overall architecture of the D. mossii PUL17 however appears unique, and no similar PULs can be found currently in the PULDB (14Terrapon N. Lombard V. Lap P. Al-Masaudi S. Gilbert H.J. Henrissat B. PULDB: The expanded database of polysaccharide utilization loci.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our recent biochemical characterization of the BoXylL-encoded multicatalytic BoCE6-CE1 enzyme showed how it could greatly boost the GAX degradation ability of a commercial xylanase through its combined acetyl- and feruloyl esterase activities (32Kmezik C. Bonzom C. Mazurkewich S. Olsson L. Larsbrink J. Multimodular fused acetyl-feruloyl esterases from soil and gut Bacteroidetes improve xylanase depolymerization of recalcitrant biomass.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2020; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DmCE1B in the D. mossii PUL 17 comprises two individual CE1 catalytic domains separated by a small CBM48 domain (Fig. 1B). While numerous putative CE6-CE1 fusions can be found in the PULDB, only two have been characterized (32Kmezik C. Bonzom C. Mazurkewich S. Olsson L. Larsbrink J. Multimodular fused acetyl-feruloyl esterases from soil and gut Bacteroidetes improve xylanase depolymerization of recalcitrant biomass.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2020; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As mentioned, no CE1-CE1 fusion enzymes have previously been characterized, though such enzymes can be found in various Dysgonomonas species and other genera from both gastrointestinal and environmental habitats including Chryseobacterium, Dyadobacter, and Chitinophaga (14Terrapon N. Lombard V. Lap P. Al-Masaudi S. Gilbert H.J. Henrissat B. PULDB: The expanded database of polysaccharide utilization loci.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both DmCE1A and DmCE1B are multidomain enzymes, where DmCE1B as mentioned comprises two CE1 domains bridged by a CBM48 domain, while DmCE1A has a single CE1 domain and an N-terminal CBM48 domain (Fig. 1B). Comparative amino acid sequence analysis against sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; (35Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. The protein data bank.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25563) Google Scholar)) revealed that the CE1 domains of these enzymes shared the highest sequence similarity with feruloyl esterases with sequence identities of 43 to 53% to studied enzymes (Table S1). Compared with each other, the D. mossii CE1 domains displayed moderate similarities: DmCE1A shares 36% and 49% sequence identity with the N- and C-terminal CE1 domains of DmCE1B, respectively. The two CE1 domains in DmCE1B share 35% sequence identity, illustrating that they are not closely related and likely DmCE1B has not arisen from a recent gene duplication event of one of the two domains. A multiple sequence alignment of the CE1 domains investigated here with sequences of characterized feruloyl esterases revealed that each D. mossii CE1 domain contained the expected conserved Ser-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad (Fig. S1). The CE6 enzyme of PUL 17 is composed of a single catalytic domain (Fig. 1B). DmCE6A had relatively high sequence identity to the previously characterized acetyl xylan esterase FjCE6 from F. johnsoniae (seq. id. 63%) (32Kmezik C. Bonzom C. Mazurkewich S. Olsson L. Larsbrink J.

Biofuels. 2020; 13: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and also in this enzyme the esterase catalytic triad appeared conserved based on a multiple sequence alignment (Fig. S2). Signal peptide predictions using SignalP (36Almagro Armenteros J.J. Tsirigos K.D. Sønderby C.K. Petersen T.N. Winther O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 5.0 improves signal peptide predictions using deep neural networks.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) showed that DmCE1A, DmCE1B, and DmCE6A all possess putative N-terminal Sec/SPI signal peptides and are thus predicted to be secreted. Whether the proteins reside in the periplasm or are further exported outside of the cell is not known. Since only a small number of CE1 and CE6 members have been thoroughly characterized to date, and knowledge on multicatalytic CEs is still very limited, we pursued biochemical characterization of the various CE domains found in PUL 17 to confirm their predicted activities and shed light on their roles in the biology of D. mossii. The different CEs of the D. mossii PUL 17 were cloned and heterologously produced in E. coli resulting in the enzymes DmCE1A (43.5 kDa), DmCE1B (73.5 kDa), and DmCE6A (31.7 kDa; Fig. S3). To assess the role of each catalytic domain of the multicatalytic DmCE1B, the separate domains were also produced: DmCE1B_nt (45.3 kDa), comprising the N-terminal CE1 domain and the CBM48 domain, and DmCE1B_ct (43.3 kDa) comprising the CBM48 domain and the C-terminal CE1 domain (Fig. 1B). All enzymes were assayed on model substrates to test for acetyl esterase activity (4-methylumbelliferyl acetate, 4-MU-Ac; and p-nitrophenyl acetate, pNP-Ac) and feruloyl esterase activity (methyl ferulate, MFA; methyl sinapate, MSA; methyl caffeate, MCA; and methyl p-coumarate, MpCA).

https://openalex.org/W3134674790,"Perception improves by repeated practice with visual stimuli, a phenomenon known as visual perceptual learning (VPL). The interplay of attentional and neuromodulatory reward signals is hypothesized to cause these behavioral and associated neuronal changes, although VPL can occur without attention (i.e., task-irrelevant VPL). In addition, task-relevant VPL can be category-selective for simple attended oriented stimuli. Yet, it is unclear whether category-selective task-irrelevant VPL occurs and which brain centers mediate underlying forms of adult cortical plasticity. Here, we show that pairing subliminal complex visual stimuli (faces and bodies) with electrical microstimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA-EM) causes category-selective task-irrelevant VPL. These perceptual improvements are accompanied by fMRI signal changes in early and late visual and frontal areas, as well as the cerebellum, hippocampus, claustrum, and putamen. In conclusion, Pavlovian pairing of unattended complex stimuli with VTA-EM causes category-selective learning accompanied by changes of cortical and subcortical neural representations in macaques."

It is a typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin with an active site (peroxidatic) Cys residue (CP) that reacts extremely rapidly with H2O2 (1Rhee S.G. Kil I.S.

Sci. 2015; 40: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The initial product is a CP-sulfenic acid that undergoes a structural rearrangement to condense with the resolving Cys (CR) located in the C-terminal region of the opposing chain of the functional homodimer (as shown in Fig. 1). At higher H2O2 concentrations, this occurs in competition with further oxidation (hyperoxidation) to the sulfinic acid. During turnover, the CP-CR disulfide is recycled by reaction with thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR). The sulfenic acid and the CP-CR disulfide also react with GSH to form a mixed disulfide which is reduced by glutaredoxin (3Peskin A.V. Pace P.E. Behring J.B. Paton L.N. Soethoudt M. Bachschmid M.M.

The active site geometry dictates the exquisite specificity and high reactivity of CP with H2O2 and other peroxides (4Perkins A. Parsonage D. Nelson K.J. Ogba O.M. Cheong P.H. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A.

On this basis, a number of studies, especially those investigating interacting partners or redox relays involving 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, have been performed with the resolving Cys mutated to Ser or Ala (e.g., (6Kwak M.S.

However, this assumption is not necessarily justified as, for example, the C172S variant of bacterial AhpC has a higher CP pKa and only 0.5% of the H2O2 reactivity of the WT enzyme (8Nelson K.J.

Also, the reaction of the C173S/C83S mutant of Prdx1 with urate hydroperoxide is 10-times slower than for the WT (9Carvalho L.A.C. Truzzi D.R. Fallani T.S. Alves S.V. Toledo Jr., J.C. Augusto O.

Structural studies of both the C172S (10Nelson K.J. Parsonage D. Hall A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B.

Parsonage D. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. The sensitive balance between the fully folded and locally unfolded conformations of a model peroxiredoxin.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 8708-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) mutants of AhpC showed that the mutations destabilized the folding of the C-terminal region of the protein and that because of their proximity (see Fig. 1B), this indirectly destabilized and perhaps even shifted the folding of the peroxidatic active site. If structural disruption around CR alters active site geometry, this could impact on peroxide reactivity during catalytic turnover. As demonstrated for Prdx2, turnover by GSH involves initial formation and reduction of a GS-Prdx disulfide (3Peskin A.V. Pace P.E. Behring J.B. Paton L.N. Soethoudt M. Bachschmid M.M. Winterbourn C.C. Glutathionylation of the active site cysteines of peroxiredoxin 2 and recycling by glutaredoxin.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 3053-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and resolution of the CP-CR disulfide by Trx proceeds via an intermediate mixed disulfide inferred to be between Trx and CR. Such mixed-disulfide derivatives of CR would be expected to be more structurally disruptive than a Cys to Ser or Ala mutation. Moreover, mixed disulfide formation with CR would release reduced CP–SH, which could potentially react with H2O2 before resolution of the conjugate. If this were the case, the mechanism of catalytic turnover of Prdx2 would involve steps involving mixed disulfides. To investigate the physiological relevance of these intermediates and how they affect structure and CP reactivity, we generated CR mutants designed to mimic the disruptive effect of mixed disulfide formation. We have performed a combination of functional analysis and structural characterizations, and also report the first high-resolution crystal structures of WT Prdx2 as well as the CR-to-serine mutation (C172S) in the reduced state. Until now the WT structure has been inferred from the original Prdx2 crystallographic study performed on the hyperoxidized form (12Schroder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A.

Crystal structure of decameric 2-Cys peroxiredoxin from human erythrocytes at 1.7 A resolution.Structure. 2000; 8: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The structure of the locally unfolded (LU) disulfide form has also been reported (13Bolduc J.A. Nelson K.J. Haynes A.C. Lee J. Reisz J.A. Graff A.H. Clodfelter J.E. Parsonage D. Poole L.B.

For our study, we selected the commonly used C172S mutation, which is predicted to cause minimal disruption to the overall structure, and two mutants (C172D and C172W) that either through charge or bulk should be more disruptive and are therefore potential models for the effects of conjugation of CR to Trx or GSH during Prdx recycling. We find that the modification of CR-to-Ser yields nearly identical rate constants to WT for oxidation and hyperoxidation by H2O2, whereas CR-to-Asp and CR-to-Trp have highly decreased rates. We demonstrate that both latter mutants are largely unstructured at the C terminus and propose that this is how they influence CP reactivity. Our study highlights the important regulatory role of CR and the C-terminal region of Prdx2 in its redox activities. Stopped flow analysis of changes in Trp fluorescence was used to determine rate constants for the reaction of the reduced Prdx mutants with H2O2. As described previously (9Carvalho L.A.C. Truzzi D.R.

This recovery is associated with disulfide formation, plus at higher H2O2 concentrations, hyperoxidation (16Dalla Rizza J. Randall L.M. Santos J. Ferrer-Sueta G. Denicola A.

The mutants all showed an initial drop in fluorescence (Fig. 2, B–D), but the returning fluorescence was detected only with C172S. With a 2-fold excess of H2O2 recovery was slower for C172S than for the WT (Fig. 2B), but as expected for hyperoxidation and described in detail in (17Peskin A.V. Meotti F.C. De Souza L.F.

In contrast, the C172D (Fig. 2C) and C172W (Fig. 2D) mutants did not present this returning fluorescence even at higher H2O2 concentrations but showed a slow, H2O2 concentration-independent, continuous drop of fluorescence similar to that observed with no H2O2 added, which is most likely attributable to photobleaching. Analysis of the fast phase over a range of H2O2 concentrations was performed for WT Prdx2 and for each mutant (as shown in inserts, Fig. 3). Second-order rate constants, determined from plots of the pseudo first-order rate constants versus H2O2 (Fig. 3), are shown in Table 1.

WT Prdx2 gave an [H2O2]-independent increase in fluorescence because of disulfide formation plus an [H2O2]-dependent component because of hyperoxidation of the sulfenic acid (Fig. 2A). Analysis of these data, described in (17Peskin A.V. Meotti F.C. De Souza L.F. Anderson R.F. Winterbourn C.C. Intra-dimer cooperativity between the active site cysteines during the oxidation of peroxiredoxin 2 Free.Radic. Biol. Med. 2020; 158: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), gave a second-order rate constant (khyp) of 4200 M−1s−1 (Table 1). With the C172S mutant, only the [H2O2]-dependent recovery was seen, and analysis of this reaction (17Peskin A.V. Meotti F.C. De Souza L.F. Anderson R.F. Winterbourn C.C.

Using LC/MS to monitor sulfinic acid formation and catalase competition to determine a khyp, we previously obtained values of 6000 M−1s−1 for both WT Prdx2 and the C172S mutant (3Peskin A.V.

Chem. 2013; 288: 14170-14177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These are somewhat higher but in general agreement with those obtained by stopped flow. For the C172D and C172W mutants, no [H2O2]-dependent recovery phase was seen over the same time scale (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that mutation of C172 to Asp or Trp dramatically decreases the rate of Prdx2 hyperoxidation. To measure the rate directly, we carried out LC/MS analysis to follow accumulation of the sulfinic acid over time. As shown in Figure 4, this occurred over several minutes. Under these conditions, oxidation of the reduced Prdx to the sulfenic acid is relatively rapid, the rate determining step is the subsequent slower oxidation to the sulfinic acid, and the rate constant measured is khyp. As shown for the C172D mutant, the rate of oxidation increased with H2O2 concentration (Fig. 4A), and a plot of pseudo first-order rate constant versus H2O2 concentration (Fig. 4B) gave a second-order rate constant, khyp of 24 M−1s−1. The reaction of C172W with H2O2 followed a similar time course to that of the C172D mutant (Fig. 4C) and gave a similar second-order rate constant of 33 M−1s−1 (Table 1). It was not possible to use the same approach to obtain a rate constant for the C172S mutant, as even with 10 μM H2O2, LC/MS showed that all the protein was hyperoxidized within 20 s. This is consistent with the khyp values obtained from stopped flow and catalase competition. Thus, our results establish that the mutation of CR to Ser has little effect, but replacement with Trp or Asp decreases the hyperoxidation rate constant by more than 100-fold. To demonstrate that the reaction of the sulfenic acid with H2O2 is the rate determining step, we also followed the reaction with the C172D and C172W mutants by trapping the sulfenic acid with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (instead of reducing before analysis as in Fig. 4). With this method, MS analysis of the untreated proteins showed major peaks corresponding to the addition of 1, 2, and 3 NEM (Fig. 5, A and D). At 25 s after addition of H2O2 (B,D), these were replaced with peaks with an additional 16 Da. This is consistent with partial alkylation of the two Cys residues present in the mutants plus an additional non-Cys site, with the 16 Da (one oxygen) corresponding to conversion of one Cys residue to a sulfenic acid and derivatization by NEM. At 150 s (C,F), these peaks had declined and were replaced by peaks with one less NEM and an additional 32 Da, as expected for conversion of the sulfenic to the sulfinic acid. These results support a mechanism in which the sulfenic acid is formed and decays slowly on reaction with H2O2. Recombinant Prdx2 (Prdx2SH) and the C172S variant (Prdx2C172S) crystallized under the same conditions, and their structures were solved at 1.7 Å and 2.15 Å resolution, respectively (Table 2). As the Prdx2SH crystals were catalytically active, we also produced the hyperoxidized sulfinate form in crystallo using a H2O2 soak (see Experimental procedures; Fig. S2) and solved the structure (Prdx2SO2) at 2.3 Å resolution (Table 2). Extensive efforts to crystallize the C172D and C172W variants were not successful. The three solved structures all include a decamer (Chains A through J) in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, and all residues (Ala2-Asn198) were modeled for each chain. All subunits adopt the fully folded (FF) conformation, shown as a ribbon diagram for Prdx2SH in Figure 1B and have unambiguous electron density for the CP and CR thiols in Prdx2SH, the CP sulfinate in Prdx2SO2, and the Ser172 side chain in Prdx2C172S (Fig. 6). Also, all of the structures are highly similar to each other (rmsd <0.3 Å) and to that originally published (12Schroder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N.

The close alignment of all these structures confirms the long held assumption that for this enzyme, the CP sulfinate form mimics the functional FF active site (12Schroder E. Littlechild J.A.

While a Ser side chain is nominally isosteric with a Cys side chain, the hydroxyl is both smaller and much more polar than the thiol, meaning it can fit in smaller spaces and requires a polar, hydrogen-bonding environment for stability. As seen in the Prdx2C172S structure, the Ser172 side chain adopts a different χ1 side chain rotamer so it does not sit in the fully hydrophobic pocket in which the Cys172 thiol resides (Figs. 6D and S3). Instead, it is inserted into a tightly packed position in which it can form one hydrogen bond with a buried water molecule and make additional weak polar interactions with nearby backbone amides involved in β-sheet hydrogen-bonding polar interactions. The ability of the Ser side chain to adopt a conformation that allows it to donate a hydrogen bond and have a weakly polar environment mitigates what would have been a major destabilizing factor if it was oriented into the pocket filled by the Cys172 side chain and had no hydrogen bonding partners at all.

However, not all patients respond due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to PARP1 inhibitor. Development of alternative synthetic lethality approaches is a high priority. DNA polymerase β (Polβ), a critical player in base excision repair (BER), interacts with PARP1 during DNA repair. Here we show that polβ deficiency is a predictor of platinum sensitivity in human ovarian tumours. Polβ depletion not only increased platinum sensitivity but also reduced invasion, migration and impaired EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) of ovarian cancer cells. Polβ small molecular inhibitors (Pamoic acid and NSC666719) were selectively toxic to BRCA2 deficient cells and associated with double-strand breaks (DSB) accumulation, cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Interestingly, PARG [Poly(ADP-Ribose) Glycohydrolase] inhibitor (PDD00017273) [but not PARP1 inhibitor (Olaparib)] was synthetically lethal in polβ deficient cells. Selective toxicity to PDD00017273 was associated with poly (ADP-ribose) accumulation, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) level, DSB accumulation, cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. In human tumours, polβ-PARG co-expression adversely impacted survival in patients. Our data provide evidence that polβ targeting is a novel strategy and warrants further pharmaceutical development in epithelial ovarian cancers."

We previously demonstrated that strategies to increase liver glycogen content in a high-fat-diet mouse model of obesity and insulin resistance led to a reduction in food intake and ameliorated obesity and glucose tolerance. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in insulin levels, but whether this decrease contributed to the phenotype observed in this animal was unclear. Here we sought to evaluate this aspect directly, by examining the long-term effects of increasing liver glycogen in an animal model of insulin-deficient and monogenic diabetes, namely the Akita mouse, which is characterized by reduced insulin production. We crossed Akita mice with animals overexpressing protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) in the liver to generate Akita mice with increased liver glycogen content (Akita-PTGOE). Akita-PTGOE animals showed lower glycemia, lower food intake, and decreased water consumption and urine output compared with Akita mice. Furthermore, Akita-PTGOE mice showed a restoration of the hepatic energy state and a normalization of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis back to nondiabetic levels. Moreover, hepatic lipogenesis, which is reduced in Akita mice, was reverted in Akita-PTGOE animals. These results demonstrate that strategies to increase liver glycogen content lead to the long-term reduction of the diabetic phenotype, independently of circulating insulin.

Glycogen is synthesized by glycogen synthase (GS) (1Roach P.J. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Hurley T.D. Tagliabracci V.S. Glycogen and its metabolism: Some new developments and old themes.Biochem. J. 2012; 441: 763-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), an enzyme regulated allosterically and by phosphorylation at multiple sites. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of GS and thus its activation. PP1 is composed of a catalytic subunit (PP1C) and a glycogen-targeting subunit (G subunit). G subunits are molecular scaffolds that localize the catalytic subunit to the glycogen particle (2Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R.

Hepatic glycogen synthesis plays a critical role in maintaining normal glucose homeostasis. After a mixed meal, glucose is taken up by the liver from the portal vein and the systemic circulation and is temporarily stored as glycogen (7Taylor R. Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Cline G.W. Caumo A.

In addition to hyperglycemia, disruption of lipid metabolism contributes to the morbidity and mortality associated with patients with diabetes (21Verges B. Lipid disorders in type 1 diabetes.Diabetes Metab. 2009; 35: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In cases of poor control, patients with insulin-deficient, type 1 diabetes may present with increased plasma triacylglyceride (TAG) levels (22Dullaart R.P. Plasma lipoprotein abnormalities in type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.Neth. J. Med. 1995; 46: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and ketoacidosis (21Verges B. Lipid disorders in type 1 diabetes.Diabetes Metab. 2009; 35: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Such hypertriglyceridemia and ketogenesis are stimulated because the increase in adipose tissue lipolysis promotes the delivery of free fatty acids (FFAs) to the liver. Hepatic lipid synthesis is reduced in type 1 diabetic patients (23Regnell S.E. Peterson P. Trinh L. Broberg P. Leander P. Lernmark A. Mansson S. Elding Larsson H. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals altered distribution of hepatic fat in children with type 1 diabetes compared to controls.Metabolism. 2015; 64: 872-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and in insulin-dependent diabetic mice (24Jiang S.

The Akita strain is a mouse model of insulin-deficient and monogenic diabetes. A spontaneous mutation in the insulin 2 gene leads to incorrect folding of the insulin protein, which leads to toxicity in pancreatic ß cells, reduced ß cell mass, and decreased insulin secretion. Heterozygous Akita mice develop insulin-deficient diabetes and show hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, polydipsia, and polyuria by 3 to 4 weeks of age. We previously showed that strategies to increase liver glycogen stores reduce food intake and ameliorate obesity in a high-fat-diet (HFD) mouse model of obesity and insulin resistance (6Lopez-Soldado I. Zafra D. Duran J. Adrover A. Calbo J. Guinovart J.J. Liver glycogen reduces food intake and attenuates obesity in a high-fat diet-fed mouse model.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 796-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This effect was accompanied by a reversal of hyperinsulinemia. It has been reported that pathological hyperinsulinemia drives diet-induced obesity and its complications (25Mehran A.E. Templeman N.M. Brigidi G.S. Lim G.E. Chu K.Y. Hu X. Botezelli J.D. Asadi A. Hoffman B.G. Kieffer T.J. Bamji S.X. Clee S.M. Johnson J.D. Hyperinsulinemia drives diet-induced obesity independently of brain insulin production.Cell Metab. 2012; 16: 723-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, to analyze whether these effects were dependent on the action of insulin, here we used a model with markedly reduced insulin production, the Akita mouse, to examine the long-term effects of increasing liver glycogen on glucose metabolism, food intake, and diabetes complications. We crossed Akita mice with animals overexpressing PTG in the liver (PTGOE) (6Lopez-Soldado I. Zafra D. Duran J. Adrover A. Calbo J. Guinovart J.J. Liver glycogen reduces food intake and attenuates obesity in a high-fat diet-fed mouse model.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 796-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The resulting mice (Akita-PTGOE) showed increased liver glycogen and long-term reduction of the diabetic phenotype. This observation demonstrates that strategies to increase liver glycogen can provide an effective therapeutic approach to treat insulin-deficient diabetes. Males heterozygous for the Akita mutation (strain name C57BL/6-Ins2Akita/J) develop hyperglycemia at 3 weeks of age, and this condition becomes progressively more severe with age. The diabetic phenotype is more severe in males than in females (26Yoshioka M. Kayo T. Ikeda T. Koizumi A. A novel locus, Mody4, distal to D7Mit189 on chromosome 7 determines early-onset NIDDM in nonobese C57BL/6 (Akita) mutant mice.Diabetes. 1997; 46: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Akita mice were crossed with females that overexpressed PTG specifically in the liver (6Lopez-Soldado I. Zafra D. Duran J. Adrover A. Calbo J. Guinovart J.J. Liver glycogen reduces food intake and attenuates obesity in a high-fat diet-fed mouse model.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 796-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to generate the Akita-PTGOE mice. PTG overexpression starts in the second week of embryogenesis and is maintained through the life of the animal. All experiments were performed on males fed ad libitum. Liver glycogen is decreased in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic models (16Ros S. Garcia-Rocha M. Calbo J. Guinovart J.J.

Under ad libitum feeding conditions, Akita mice showed a 30% reduction in liver glycogen compared with control littermates (Fig. 1A). As expected, PTGOE and Akita-PTGOE mice showed a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in hepatic glycogen content compared with control and Akita mice, respectively (Fig. 1A). Plasma glucose levels were measured in 10-, 20-, and 40-week-old mice fed ad libitum. Akita mice showed hyperglycemia with fed plasma glucose levels ∼40 mM at 10 weeks of age, and this hyperglycemia worsened progressively with time. Akita-PTGOE mice showed a 30% reduction in plasma glucose levels compared with Akita mice at the three time points studied (Fig. 1B), indicating that hyperglycemia at the onset and during the progression of the disease reduced in response to increased liver glycogen. At 40 weeks of age, the diabetic mice showed extreme hyperglycemia (over 50 mM), decreased activity, and physical deterioration. Therefore, we decided to perform the study at 20 weeks of age. At this age, Akita mice showed a 30% decrease in body weight compared with control mice (Fig. 1C), which corresponded to a decrease in lean (25%) and fat mass (60%) (Fig. 1, D and E). Akita-PTGOE mice were significantly heavier than Akita mice (Fig. 1C). This difference in weight was associated with a significantly larger lean mass in Akita-PTGOE mice (Fig. 1D). Hyperglycemia in Akita mice was associated with hyperphagia and overt polydipsia and polyuria. Their daily food intake was threefold greater than that of control mice and their fluid consumption was sixfold greater than that of nondiabetic mice. Akita-PTGOE animals ate less (Fig. 1F) and showed significant decreases in water consumption (30%) and urine output (25%) compared with Akita mice (Fig. 1, G and H). We previously demonstrated that strategies to increase liver glycogen content lead to a reduction in food intake and ameliorate obesity and glucose tolerance in a HFD mouse model. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in insulin levels. It was then necessary to check for changes in the circulating levels of insulin and other key hormones in the Akita model. As expected, Akita mice had lower levels of plasma insulin (Fig. 2A) and higher plasma glucagon (Fig. 2B) than nondiabetic littermates, but these levels were not altered in the Akita-PTGOE. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone involved in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure (28Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Leptin and the regulation of body weight in mammals.Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4403) Google Scholar). In insulin-deficient diabetic animals, adiposity and plasma leptin levels are decreased (29Sivitz W.I. Walsh S. Morgan D. Donohoue P. Haynes W. Leibel R.L.

Akita and Akita-PTGOE mice showed a similar reduction in adiposity and plasma leptin levels (Figs. 1E and 2C). Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which is a potent regulator of metabolism and circulates in the blood (31Owen B.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A.

Metab. 2015; 26: 22-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was increased in PTGOE mice compared with control mice, and this increase may be attributable to decreased insulin since it has been described that the level of insulin under normal conditions inhibits the production of FGF21 (32Lin Z. Gong Q. Wu C. Yu J. Lu T. Pan X. Lin S. Li X. Dynamic change of serum FGF21 levels in response to glucose challenge in human.J. Clin. Endocrinol.

However, the physiological pattern of FGF21 secretion present in healthy individuals is lost in type 1 diabetic patients (33Zhang J. Weng W. Wang K. Lu X. Cai L. Sun J. The role of FGF21 in type 1 diabetes and its complications.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2018; 14: 1000-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and this could explain why FGF21 levels are not affected by PTG overexpression in Akita mice (Fig. 2D). In summary, the lowering of blood glucose in Akita-PTGOE mice was independent of changes in the levels of circulating insulin, glucagon, leptin, and FGF21.Figure 2Plasma hormones were similar in fed Akita and Akita-PTGOE mice.

Akita mice showed an increase in PEPCK and a decrease in GK and PK, thereby indicating an increase in gluconeogenesis and a decrease in glycolysis. Interestingly, Akita-PTGOE mice showed a reversal of these effects (Fig. 3, A–E). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC1α) is a coactivator of several transcriptional factors that regulate the transcription of rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes such as PEPCK. PGC1α expression was elevated in the livers of Akita mice but normalized in those of Akita-PTGOE animals (Fig. 3F). These changes were associated with an increase in the hepatic content of lactate in the latter model (Fig. 3G). We next studied the impact of PTG overexpression on hepatic lipid metabolism. Lipogenesis is downregulated in insulin-deficient diabetes. Accordingly, hepatic TAGs were decreased in Akita compared with nondiabetic mice. However, Akita-PTGOE mice showed similar levels of hepatic TAG as nondiabetic animals (Fig. 4A). The expression of some of the main lipogenic genes, i.e., fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), was lower in the livers of Akita mice compared with controls (Fig. 4, C and D), but was upregulated in Akita-PTGOE compared with Akita mice (Fig. 4D). Of note, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) expression was similar across the groups (Fig. 4B). Although normally present at very low levels in the liver (35Reid B.N. Ables G.P. Otlivanchik O.A.

However, Akita-PTGOE animals showed similar levels of HSL and ATGL compared with those of nondiabetic controls (Fig. 4, E and F). Metabolic disorders such as diabetes lead to decreased ATP (36Wang C. Chen Z. Li S. Zhang Y. Jia S. Li J. Chi Y. Miao Y. Guan Y. Yang J.

Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2412-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the livers of Akita mice had a lower ATP (Fig. 5A) and higher AMP (Fig. 5B) content compared with control mice, which resulted in a higher AMP/ATP ratio (Fig. 5C). In contrast, Akita-PTGOE mice showed levels of adenine nucleotides similar to those of control animals, thus indicating that the hepatic energy state in this diabetic model was improved by increasing liver glycogen. We also measured other plasma metabolites that are altered in diabetes. As expected, plasma glycerol, FFA, β-hydroxybutyrate, and TAGs were increased in diabetic animals compared with their nondiabetic littermates. However, these changes were not corrected in Akita-PTGOE mice (Fig. 6, A–D). The levels of plasma cholesterol (Fig. 6E) were similar between the different genotypes. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the long-term effects of increasing liver glycogen in the context of insulin-deficient diabetes. We demonstrate that long-term enhancement of liver glycogen reduces hyperglycemia, since Akita-PTGOE mice showed a consistent decrease in plasma glucose that was maintained as the disease progressed. The reduction in hyperglycemia was accompanied by an amelioration of the diabetic symptoms polyphagia, polydipsia, and polyuria. This effect was independent of changes in circulating insulin, glucagon, leptin, or FGF21. Given these findings, an explanation for the observed phenotype must be sought in the changes induced in the liver by PTG overexpression. Akita-PTGOE mice have increased glycogenic capacity. Therefore, the diversion of blood glucose toward the synthesis of glycogen may explain the reduced hyperglycemia. However, another mechanism that may be responsible for the reduction in glucose is the lower gluconeogenic and higher glycolytic capacity observed in the liver of Akita-PTGOE mice. PGC1α has been identified as a key regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis and its expression is increased in diabetes (38Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J.

All nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) contain molybdenum-nitrogenase (Mo-nitrogenase) (1Howard J.B. Kechris K.J. Rees D.C. Glazer A.N.

MoFeP contains two unique metal clusters, the [Mo:7Fe:9S:1C] active site, referred to as FeMoco, and the [8Fe:7S] P-cluster. FeP shuttles electrons from its [4Fe:4S] cluster to MoFeP in an ATP-dependent reaction (Equation 1) (5Igarashi R.Y. Seefeldt L.C.

Electron transfer in nitrogenase.Chem. Rev. 2020; 120: 5158-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to Mo-nitrogenase, a subset of diazotrophs contain one or both of the alternative nitrogenases, Vanadium-nitrogenase (V-nitrogenase) and Iron-only nitrogenase (Fe-nitrogenase) (2Jasniewski A.J.

These nitrogenases contain a V or Fe metal instead of Mo in their respective active sites. V-nitrogenase further differs structurally from Mo-nitrogenase in that it contains a small α-helical subunit, the δ-subunit, which binds to VFeP (the catalytic component of V-nitrogenase) in the vicinity of the active site (Fig. S1A) (7Lee C.C.

CO is generated both anthropogenically (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-04/documents/2014neiv1_profile_final_april182017.pdf, accessed May 29, 2020) and naturally by soil chemical processes (14Rich J.J.

CO has also been identified as a plant signaling molecule that plays a role in lateral root formation (16Xuan W. Xu S. Yuan X. Shen W.

Unsurprisingly, diazotrophs have evolved defenses to prevent inhibition of nitrogen fixation by CO. Protection against CO is best described in Rhodospirillum rubrum (19Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Sustaining N2-dependent growth in the presence of CO.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and Rhodobacter capsulatus (20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Both organisms are able to grow diazotrophically in the presence of CO. These results are surprising since CO inhibition of nitrogenase is expected to prevent bacterial growth. Protection against CO inhibition hinges on a protein called CowN. Knocking out CowN in either R. rubrum or R. capsulatus renders the bacteria incapable of growing diazotrophically under CO (19Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Sustaining N2-dependent growth in the presence of CO.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B.

Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although CO is a potent inhibitor of N2 reduction, it is also a nitrogenase substrate that is converted into hydrocarbons (21Yang Z.-Y. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C.

Chem. 2011; 286: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Lee C.C. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. Vanadium nitrogenase reduces CO.Science. 2010; 329: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). V-nitrogenase has the highest CO reducing activity; it is about 800-fold more active toward CO compared with Mo-nitrogenase (23Lee C.C. Tanifuji K. Newcomb M. Liedtke J. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. A comparative analysis of the CO-reducing activities of MoFe proteins containing Mo- and V-nitrogenase cofactors.Chembiochem. 2018; 19: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Rebelein J.G. Lee C.C. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. The in vivo hydrocarbon formation by vanadium nitrogenase follows a secondary metabolic pathway.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CowN exclusively sustains Mo-nitrogenase-dependent growth, as CowN expression is not triggered under diazotrophic growth supported by alternative nitrogenases (20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The reason for this is unclear; however, it has been suggested that alternative nitrogenases do not require the action of CowN since they may circumvent CO inhibition by reducing CO to hydrocarbons (20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). While the role of CowN as a CO-protective protein is established, its mechanism is unknown. We do not know if CowN acts directly on nitrogenase. It is possible that CowN’s target is not nitrogenase but another vital part of the bacterial nitrogen-fixing machinery that is susceptible to inactivation by CO, such as the nuo electron transport system (25Wareham L.K. Begg R. Jesse H.E. Van Beilen J.W. Ali S. Svistunenko D. McLean S. Hellingwerf K.J. Sanguinetti G. Poole R.K. Carbon monoxide gas is not inert, but global, in its consequences for bacterial gene expression, iron acquisition, and antibiotic resistance.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2016; 24: 1013-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or protective terminal oxidases (26Pitcher R.S. Watmough N.J. The bacterial cytochrome cbb3 oxidases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Previous studies on CowN did not measure nitrogenase activity under diazotrophic growth conditions in the presence of CO. On the one hand, it has been shown that CO inhibits N2 reduction in vivo (11Davis L.C. Wang Y.L. In vivo and in vitro kinetics of nitrogenase.J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1230-1238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other, the fact that R. rubrum and R. capsulatus growth kinetics were not significantly slowed by CO would suggest that nitrogenase must remain active (19Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Sustaining N2-dependent growth in the presence of CO.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it was proposed that CowN acts similarly to Shethna protein. Shethna protein protects nitrogenase from O2 oxidation by locking FeP and MoFeP together to block O2 access to nitrogenase’s oxygen-sensitive metal clusters (27Schlesier J. Rohde M. Gerhardt S. Einsle O. A conformational switch triggers nitrogenase protection from oxygen damage by shethna protein II (FeSII).J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Ureta A. Nordlund S. Evidence for conformational protection of nitrogenase against oxygen in Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus by a putative FeSII protein.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5805-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism for CowN could either involve trapping nitrogenase in a conformation that blocks CO binding to the active site or prevent FeMoco from reaching the E2 oxidation state required for CO binding (29Lee H.I. Sorlie M. Christiansen J. Yang T.C. Shao J. Dean D.R. Hales B.J. Hoffman B.M. Electron inventory, kinetic assignment (E(n)), structure, and bonding of nitrogenase turnover intermediates with C2H2 and CO.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15880-15890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CowN is structurally uncharacterized, but is predicted to be a four-helical bundle (Fig. 1B). It does not feature a known cofactor binding site, nor is it predicted to coordinate metals. CowN is therefore unlikely to react with CO or take part in CO transport. Instead, we postulate that CowN exerts its protective effect through protein–protein interactions with nitrogenase. CowN is predicted to have a negative surface charge profile (Fig. 1C) that is complementary to positive patches on the MoFeP surface near FeMoco and known CO access channels (Fig. S1, B and C). This raises the possibility that CowN binds to MoFeP in a similar manner as δ-subunit binds to VFeP, close to the active site, where CowN could influence FeMoco reactivity and substrate binding. Alternatively, CowN may bind at the entrance of a substrate channel and thereby alter gas access. Based on our current knowledge of CowN, two hypotheses emerge on how CowN prevents CO inhibition of nitrogenase:(1)CowN operates similarly to Shethna protein and protects nitrogenase by shutting down turnover.(2)CowN prevents CO binding to nitrogenase without shutting down turnover. In this case, nitrogenase turns over normally in the presence of CowN since CO is selectively prevented from tightly binding to FeMoco. A third potential mechanism is that CowN engenders substantial CO reduction activity to Mo-nitrogenase. While intriguing, this possibility is unlikely since extensive in vivo experiments detected only negligible hydrocarbon formation by Mo-nitrogenase under CO (24Rebelein J.G. Lee C.C. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. The in vivo hydrocarbon formation by vanadium nitrogenase follows a secondary metabolic pathway.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine our hypotheses, we have expressed and purified recombinant CowN and determined its effect on nitrogenase in the presence of CO. Our results suggest CowN interacts directly with nitrogenase. CowN does not shut down nitrogenase. Instead, CowN enables nitrogenase to turn over under CO by significantly increasing the inhibition constant of CO. We chose to study CowN in the diazotroph Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, an agriculturally relevant organism with a well-characterized nitrogenase (30Owens C.P. Tezcan F.A.

Nitrogenase proteins from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, a sugarcane-colonizing bacterium.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1750: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Importantly, G. diazotrophicus has no alternative nitrogenases so any regulatory cross talk between nitrogenases that may influence CowN expression can be ruled out. In G. diazotrophicus, CowN is part of a three-gene cluster consisting of algH, cooA, and cowN (Fig. 1D). CooA is a CO-responsive hemoprotein (33Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Structure of the CO sensing transcription activator CooA.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) that activates gene expression by binding to a tGTCg-(N)6-tGACa (lower case letters denote less conserved nucleotides) upstream activator sequence (UAS) (19Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Sustaining N2-dependent growth in the presence of CO.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This sequence is found 60 base pairs (bp) upstream of cowN and 75 bp ahead of algH. This indicates that CowN is likely regulated by CooA, consistent with regulation in R. capsulatus (20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The functional importance of CooA regulation of algH is unclear. AlgH is a regulatory protein with an α/β structure of unknown function (34Urbauer J.L. Cowley A.B. Broussard H.P. Niedermaier H.T. Bieber Urbauer R.J. Solution structure and properties of AlgH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Proteins. 2015; 83: 1137-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and algH is not found in the genomic vicinity of CowN in many diazotrophs. CowN expression is also dependent on the central nitrogenase regulator NifA, which binds to a TGT-(N)10-ACA UAS (35Morett E. Buck M. NifA-dependent in vivo protection demonstrates that the upstream activator sequence of nif promoters is a protein binding site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9401-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) 59 bp upstream of CowN. The overlap between the CooA and NifA UAS suggests there is interplay between CooA and NifA in regulating CowN expression. CooA expression in G. diazotrophicus is likely dependent on RpoN, a σ54 factor commonly associated with nitrogen fixation (36Fischer H.M. Genetic regulation of nitrogen fixation in rhizobia.Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 352-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies in diazotrophs that have both Mo- and alternative nitrogenases indicate that CowN expression is turned on by CO and, to a lesser extent, nitrogen fixing conditions (20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To examine how CowN expression is regulated in G. diazotrophicus, which lacks alternative nitrogenases, we performed RT-qPCR assays using bacterial cultures grown either diazotrophically or with abundant (NH4)2SO4. As indicated in Figure 2A, CowN expression increases 30-fold under diazotrophic conditions when compared with cultures that are given extra NH4+. Expression is induced to an even greater extent under diazotrophic conditions in the presence of CO (Fig. 2B, N− media). CowN expression is specific to diazotrophic growth and not enhanced under CO in (NH4)2SO4 replete cultures (Fig. 2B, N+ media). Our results follow the same pattern seen in R. capsulatus (20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), indicating that the CowN response to CO is fundamentally the same between diazotrophs that harbor exclusively Mo-nitrogenase and those that have alternative nitrogenases. Furthermore, our results confirm that CowN is expressed under all nitrogen fixing conditions, suggesting CowN may have an unidentified role in maintaining nitrogen fixation in the absence of exogenous CO. Alternatively, CowN may be expressed in response to very low levels of metabolic CO production, known to occur in some diazotrophs (37Milligan P. King G.M. Carbon monoxide production is not enhanced by nitrogenase activity.FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2000; 34: 157-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CowN’s mechanism for sustaining nitrogen fixation under CO is unknown. To generate CowN for functional assays with nitrogenase, we cloned cowN into a pET28a expression plasmid and expressed the protein heterologously as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Recombinant His-CowN expressed in inclusion bodies. Attempts to obtain soluble protein by changing growth media and temperature were unsuccessful (Fig. S2). A second construct was made where CowN was expressed and purified as a Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) fusion since the soluble MBP tag is known to help prevent inclusion body formation (Fig. S3A) (38Sun P. Tropea J.E. Waugh D.S. Enhancing the solubility of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli by using hexahistidine-tagged maltose-binding protein as a fusion partner.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 705: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, MBP-CowN mostly formed a high-molecular-weight soluble aggregate, suggesting that CowN (Fig. S3B), when expressed recombinantly, has the propensity to aggregate. To obtain CowN for nitrogenase experiments, we used His-CowN. His-CowN (henceforth referred to as CowN) was solubilized with urea and refolded after Ni2+ purification through stepwise dialysis. CowN was then purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3A), leading to the separation of aggregated from monomeric CowN (Fig. S4A). The molecular weight of CowN was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S5). Analysis by CD spectroscopy indicates that aggregated CowN represents misfolded protein (Fig. S6). Monomeric CowN is α-helical (Fig. 3B), consistent with structural predictions (Fig. 1B). CowN’s thermal stability was measured by monitoring unfolding at 222 nm using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3C). Its Tm is equal to 46.0 °C, indicating CowN is folded in the temperature range in which G. diazotrophicus nitrogenase operates (around 30.0 °C). Cleavage of the His-tag resulted in immediate precipitation of CowN, suggesting that the tag is needed to keep the protein in solution. As discussed below, the His-tag does not appear to interfere with CowN activity. The size of CowN based on gel filtration is 19.4 kDa (Fig. S4, B and C), lying between that of a CowN monomer (13 kDa) and dimer (26 kDa). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments reveal that CowN has a hydrodynamic radius of 1.96 ± 0.25 nm, from which a 15 to 18 kDa molecular weight can be calculated (Fig. 3D). These experiments suggest CowN is most likely monomeric. CowN has a single Cys residue that can potentially form intermolecular disulfide bonds. Refolding the protein in the presence of DTT and performing gel filtration chromatography under reducing conditions does not increase the amount of CowN monomer, nor does it change the retention time of the monomer peak or CowN’s secondary structure (Figs. S5D and S6), suggesting that CowN does not form intermolecular disulfide bonds with itself. Nitrogenase was expressed and purified based on previously described methods (Fig. S7) (30Owens C.P.

Isolation, purification, and characterization of nitrogenase from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus.Methods Enzymol. 2018; 599: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Our typical maximum MoFeP C2H2 reduction activity is about 1500 nmol mg−1 min−1 (Fig. S8), slightly higher than in previous reports (31Owens C.P. Katz F.E. Carter C.H. Oswald V.F. Tezcan F.A. Tyrosine-coordinated P-cluster in G. diazotrophicus nitrogenase: Evidence for the importance of O-based ligands in conformationally gated electron transfer.J. Am. Chem.

Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1750: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The integrity of MoFeP and FeP metal clusters was confirmed by EPR (Fig. S9). The EPR spectrum of G. diazotrophicus FeP, reported here for the first time, is nearly identical to that of Azotobacter vinelandii FeP (39Danyal K. Yang Z.Y. Seefeldt L.C. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 766: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and features an S = 1/2 signal in its ATP-bound form. We first tested the hypothesis that CowN operates similar to Shethna protein. In such a case, we expected CowN to turn off nitrogenase activity, as measured using reduction of the established nitrogenase substrate acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4) (40Lowe D.J. Fisher K. Thorneley R.N. Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase. Mechanism of acetylene reduction and its inhibition by carbon monoxide.Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 4A and Fig. S10, nitrogenase activity is the same in the presence and absence of CowN. These data suggest that CowN does not stop nitrogenase turnover and must have a different mechanism compared with Shethna protein. This result is consistent with diazotrophs’ ability to grow efficiently under CO, as discussed earlier (19Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Sustaining N2-dependent growth in the presence of CO.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Hoffmann M.C. Pfander Y. Fehringer M. Narberhaus F. Masepohl B. NifA- and CooA-coordinated cowN expression sustains nitrogen fixation by Rhodobacter capsulatus in the presence of carbon monoxide.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We next tested whether CowN allows nitrogenase to remain catalytically active under CO (Fig. 4A). In the absence of CowN, nitrogenase is nearly completely inhibited under 0.1 atm CO and 50 to 60% inhibited under 0.001 atm. With the addition of CowN, nitrogenase activity increases about ninefold for samples containing 0.1 atm CO. Strikingly, nitrogenase activity under 0.001 atm CO is nearly fully restored by CowN. Control experiments with unfolded CowN aggregate (from the 8.3 ml peak in Fig. S4A) demonstrate that unfolded CowN does not prevent CO inhibition of nitrogenase (Fig. 4B and Fig. S10). Likewise, addition of BSA, which binds to proteins nonspecifically, does not protect nitrogenase from CO inhibition (Fig. S10). These results suggest CowN likely interacts with nitrogenase through a specific interaction. To determine if CowN’s His-tag interferes with its activity, we performed CO protection experiments with nonaggregated MBP-CowN (14.2 ml peak in Fig. S3B). We found similar results between His-CowN and MBP-CowN (Fig. S11), indicating the tag does not interfere with CowN activity. Further control experiments suggest that CowN, by itself, does not reduce either CO or C2H2 (Fig. S12). We also confirmed that CowN does not promote CO reduction by Mo-nitrogenase (Fig. S12), as expected based on earlier studies (24Rebelein J.G. Lee C.C. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. The in vivo hydrocarbon formation by vanadium nitrogenase follows a secondary metabolic pathway.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We present a brief summary of the mechanism of CO binding to MoFeP since this will help contextualize results that are presented in the subsequent sections. CO inhibition kinetics are described by Equation 2.vo=Vmax[S]αKM+α′[S](2) where α and α’ represent the strength of inhibitor binding to the free enzyme and the enzyme–substrate complex, respectively. α and α’ are given by:α=1+[I]KIaα′=1+[I]KIbKIa is the inhibition constant for inhibitor binding to the free enzyme and KIb is the inhibition constant for binding to the ES complex. In pure noncompetitive inhibition, KIa and KIb are equal to each other, whereas KIa ≠ KIb for a mixed inhibitor. For a competitive inhibitor KIa << KIb and for an uncompetitive inhibitor KIa >> KIb. CO inhibits most nitrogenases in a mixed fashion (11Davis L.C. Wang Y.L. In vivo and in vitro kinetics of nitrogenase.J.

https://openalex.org/W3135174950,"Introduction Although advance care planning may be beneficial for older adults in the last year of life, its relevance following an emergency hospitalisation requires further investigation. This study quantifies the one-year mortality outcomes of all emergency admissions for patients aged 70+ years and explores patient views on the value of advance care planning following acute hospitalisation. Method This mixed methods study used a two-stage approach: firstly, a quantitative longitudinal cohort study exploring the one-year mortality of patients aged 70+ admitted as an emergency to a large multi-centre hospital cohort; secondly, a qualitative semi-structured interview study gathering information on patient views of advance care planning. Results There were 14,260 emergency admissions for 70+-year olds over a 12-month period. One-year mortality for admissions across all conditions was 22.6%. The majority of these deaths (59.3%) were within 3 months of admission. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated higher one-year mortality with increasing age and male sex. Interviews with 20 patients resulted in one superordinate theme, “ Planning for health and wellbeing in the spectrum of illness” . Sub-themes entitled (1) Advance care planning benefitting healthcare for physical and psycho-social health , (2) Contemplation of physical deterioration death and dying and 3) Collaborating with healthcare professionals to undertake advance care planning , suggest that views of advance care planning are shaped by experiences of acute hospitalisation. Conclusion Since approximately 1 in 5 patients aged 70+ admitted to hospital as an emergency are in the last year of life, acute hospitalisation can act as a trigger for tailored ACP. Older hospitalised patients believe that advance care planning can benefit physical and psychosocial health and that discussions should consider a spectrum of possibilities, from future health to the potential of chronic illness, disability and death. In this context, patients may look for expertise from healthcare professionals for planning their future care."
https://openalex.org/W3135858442,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation (CDI) of CaV channels is a critical regulatory process that tunes the kinetics of Ca2+ entry for different cell types and physiologic responses. CDI is mediated by calmodulin (CaM), which is bound to the IQ domain of the CaV carboxy tail. This modulatory process is tailored by alternative splicing such that select splice variants of CaV1.3 and CaV1.4 contain a long distal carboxy tail (DCT). The DCT harbors an inhibitor of CDI (ICDI) module that competitively displaces CaM from the IQ domain, thereby diminishing CDI. While this overall mechanism is now well described, the detailed interactions required for ICDI binding to the IQ domain are yet to be elucidated. Here, we perform alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the IQ and ICDI domains and evaluate the contribution of neighboring regions to CDI inhibition. Through FRET binding analysis, we identify functionally relevant residues within the CaV1.3 IQ domain and the CaV1.4 ICDI and nearby A region, which are required for high-affinity IQ/ICDI binding. Importantly, patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that disruption of this interaction commensurately diminishes ICDI function resulting in the re-emergence of CDI in mutant channels. Furthermore, CaV1.2 channels harbor a homologous DCT; however, the ICDI region of this channel does not appear to appreciably modulate CaV1.2 CDI. Yet coexpression of CaV1.2 ICDI with select CaV1.3 splice variants significantly disrupts CDI, implicating a cross-channel modulatory scheme in cells expressing both channel subtypes. In all, these findings provide new insights into a molecular rheostat that fine-tunes Ca2+-entry and supports normal neuronal and cardiac function.

L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV1.1–1.4) are an important conduit for extracellular Ca2+ entry into many excitable cells including cardiac myocytes, neurons, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle (1Harvey R.D.

As such, these channels are subject to rich and powerful modes of feedback regulation (5McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J.

In particular, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation (CDI) of L-type channels is a crucial negative feedback mechanism that reshapes the electrical properties of neurons and cardiac myocytes and protects cells from Ca2+ overload (8Pitt G.S.

CDI is driven by the ubiquitous Ca2+ sensing molecule, calmodulin (CaM) (10Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T.

Under basal Ca2+ conditions, Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM) binds to the carboxy-terminal IQ domain of the channel and enhances channel openings (12Adams P.J. Ben-Johny M. Dick I.E. Inoue T. Yue D.T.

Upon elevation of intracellular Ca2+, the “resident” CaM repositions on the channel, interacting with Ca2+/CaM binding sites located on the channel amino- and proximal carboxy- termini (13Bazzazi H.

Yue D.T. Dynamic switching of calmodulin interactions underlies Ca2+ regulation of CaV1.3 channels.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This conformational change antagonizes the initial upregulation in channel open probability, which manifests as CDI. Not surprisingly, CDI of L-type channels has emerged as a key physiological process to limit excess Ca2+ influx during repetitive or sustained depolarization, and disruption of this feedback in the cardiac myocytes may lead to lethal cardiac arrhythmias (15Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Decher N. Kumar P. Sachse F.B. Beggs A.H. Sanguinetti M.C. Keating M.T. Severe arrhythmia disorder caused by cardiac L-type calcium channel mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ca(V)1.2 calcium channel dysfunction causes a multisystem disorder including arrhythmia and autism.Cell. 2004; 119: 19-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). This stereotypic behavior, however, diverges in multiple physiological settings where strong CDI of L-type channels is curtailed, thus permitting Ca2+ channels to faithfully respond to a tonic stimulus. For example, in photoreceptors and bipolar cells, endogenous CaV1.4 exhibits minimal CDI, thereby allowing sustained Ca2+ influx and slow, graded changes in the membrane potential necessary for tonic glutamate release, and normal vision (17Griessmeier K.

Similarly, CaV1.3 channels in inner hair cells also lack CDI (19Yang P.S. Alseikhan B.A. Hiel H. Grant L. Mori M.X. Yang W. Fuchs P.A. Yue D.T.

Beyond these, the basal strength of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 CDI varies in different neuronal subtypes in the central nervous system, suggesting a sophisticated scheme of CaV channel feedback ripe with physiological insights (20Liu X.

First, splice inclusion of the DCT occurs in a cell-type-dependent manner. For instance, alternative splicing of CaV1.3 results in variable inclusion of the ICDI domain in distinct regions of the brain and in the sinoatrial node, enabling precise tuning of CDI in these cell types (27Bock G.

Fourth, adding to the richness the modulatory role of ICDI, RNA editing, and/or fluctuations in cytosolic CaM concentrations can tune the extent of this competition, enabling different degrees of CDI tailored to specific cell types or physiologic states (12Adams P.J.

Importantly, pathologic changes to this system may be linked to altered CaM concentrations in Parkinson’s disease and heart failure (37Bezprozvanny I.

Thus, the modulation of CDI by ICDI stands as a critical and robust mechanism for adapting channel regulation to select cell types and conditions. Moreover, as the number of known pathogenic mutations within LTCCs continues to grow, the ability to map these mutations to a locus with known mechanistic impact would enable rapid insight into the pathogenesis of LTCC channelopathies. Although the overall competitive nature of ICDI regulation of L-type channels is now well established (20Liu X. Yang P.S. Yang W. Yue D.T.

This gap in understanding is critical as mutations in the carboxy tail of LTCCs result in neurological disease (32Singh A. Hamedinger D. Hoda J.C. Gebhart M. Koschak A. Romanin C. Striessnig J.

Furthermore, a residue-level analysis may shed light upon structural differences between the ICDI domain of CaV1.3 and the homologous segment of CaV1.2 that engender differential functional regulation. To characterize the landscape of the IQ/ICDI interaction of L-type channels, here we undertook systematic alanine scanning mutagenesis of both IQ and ICDI domains. Through live-cell FRET two-hybrid binding assays and electrophysiological analysis, we identified several novel hotspots on both IQ and ICDI segments that mediate a high-affinity interaction and are functionally relevant for CDI inhibition. Systematic analysis of these mutations revealed a strong inverse correlation between the strength of CDI and the binding affinity of the ICDI domain for the IQ segment, as predicted for a competitive inhibitor (13Bazzazi H. Ben Johny M. Adams P.J. Soong T.W. Yue D.T.

Yue D.T. Enzyme-inhibitor-like tuning of Ca(2+) channel connectivity with calmodulin.Nature. 2010; 463: 968-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, we have identified residues that alter binding in a functionally relevant manner. Moreover, similar critical residues were identified in adjacent regions, defining a comprehensive interface map of the IQ/ICDI interaction. Finally, extending our analysis to CaV1.2 channels, we found that the ICDI module binds to the CaV1.2 IQ domain with a reduced affinity and that this binding is insufficient to cause more than a nominal change in the CDI of full-length channels. However, the ICDI from CaV1.2 is capable of binding the CaV1.3 IQ region with high affinity, resulting in a much larger decrease in CDI of these channels. Given the propensity of the carboxy tail of CaV1.2 to exist as a separate peptide within myocytes and neurons (27Bock G. Gebhart M. Scharinger A. Jangsangthong W. Busquet P. Poggiani C. Sartori S.

Overall, these results elucidate the detailed binding interface between components of the carboxy tail of L-type Ca2+ channels, lending new insight into normal and pathologic channel regulation. To identify key residues that support a high-affinity IQ/ICDI interaction, we undertook systematic alanine substitution of the IQ domain and evaluated both the relative binding affinity and the strength of ICDI-mediated inhibition of CaM regulation. Importantly, the ICDI domains of both CaV1.3 and CaV1.4 are highly homologous and have been shown to interact with IQ domains in a similar manner evoking similar functional effects (20Liu X.

Even so, the ICDI domain from CaV1.4 (ICDI1.4) has a greater binding affinity for the IQ domains of both CaV1.3 and CaV1.4, with FRET binding assays yielding more robust measurements with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio as compared with ICDI1.3 (43Sang L. Dick I.E. Yue D.T. Protein kinase A modulation of CaV1.4 calcium channels.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore focus on this canonical ICDI motif for our studies. However, robust expression of the holo-CaV1.4 channel in recombinant systems is notoriously challenging, largely due to their diminutive open probability (12Adams P.J. Ben-Johny M. Dick I.E. Inoue T.

To this end, we utilized a chimeric channel in which the DCT of CaV1.4 is spliced onto the backbone of CaV1.3 (CaV1.3Δ/DCT1.4) (Fig. 1A), which has previously proven useful in dissecting the mechanisms underlying ICDI modulation of the channel (12"

However, quantification can be affected by the image processing methodology applied. This study’s goal was to address how amyloid quantification is influenced by different semi-automatic image processing pipelines. Images were analysed in their Native Space and Standard Space ; non-rigid spatial transformation methods based on maximum a posteriori approaches and tissue probability maps (TPM) for regularisation were explored. Furthermore, grey matter tissue segmentations were defined before and after spatial normalisation, and also using a population-based template. Five quantification metrics were analysed: two intensity-based, two volumetric-based, and one multi-parametric feature. Intensity-related metrics were not substantially affected by spatial normalisation and did not significantly depend on the grey matter segmentation method, with an impact similar to that expected from test-retest studies (≤10%). Yet, volumetric and multi-parametric features were sensitive to the image processing methodology, with an overall variability up to 45%. Therefore, the analysis should be carried out in Native Space avoiding non-rigid spatial transformations. For analyses in Standard Space , spatial normalisation regularised by TPM is preferred. Volumetric-based measurements should be done in Native Space , while intensity-based metrics are more robust against differences in image processing pipelines."

The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved at 1-3 months postoperatively and beyond 3 months in both gauge groups. Risk of any complication within 1 month postoperatively was lower in the 25-gauge group, but the difference was statistically not significant (HR [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.53; 1.70], p = 0.85). Intraocular pressure less than 5 mmHg was observed in 2 eyes (2%) in the 23-gauge group at the first postoperative day. Intraocular pressure elevation over 25 mmHg occurred in 5 eyes (2 eyes, 2%, in 23-gauge and 3 eyes, 3%, in 25-gauge group) at postoperative day 1, between 7 and 28 days in 5 cases (2 eyes, 2%, in 23-gauge and 3 eyes, 3%, in 25-gauge group), and in 2 eyes (2%) of the 23-gauge group at postoperative day 145 and 61, respectively. Retinal detachment occurred in 1 eye (1%) in the 23-gauge and in 3 eyes (3%) in the 25-gauge group. We did not observe any cases of endophthalmitis.Results in terms of safety, surgical success and visual outcomes for the treatment of common vitreoretinal surgery indications seem to be comparable between 23-gauge and 25-gauge vitrectomy systems, indicating that the two gauge systems can be used equally in the clinical routine."
https://openalex.org/W3133737699,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) secreted by a variety of cell types are known to play essential roles in cell differentiation and matrix formation in the bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessel, and neuronal tissue. BMPs activate intracellular effectors via C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad9, which relay the signaling by forming a complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus for transcriptional activation. Smad6 inhibits BMP signaling through diverse mechanisms operative at the membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear levels. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of Smad6 functional diversity remain unclear. Here, using a biochemical approach and cell differentiation systems, we report a cytosolic mechanism of action for Smad6 that requires arginine methylation at arginine 81 (R81) and functions through association with Smad1 and interference with the formation of Smad1-Smad4 complexes. By mutating the methylated arginine residue, R81, and by silencing the expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1, we show that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 catalyzes R81 methylation of Smad6 upon BMP treatment, R81 methylation subsequently facilitates Smad6 interaction with the phosphorylated active Smad1, and R81 methylation facilitates Smad6-mediated interruption of Smad1-Smad4 complex formation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, Smad6 WT but not the methylation-deficient R81A mutant inhibited BMP-responsive transcription, attenuated BMP-mediated osteogenic differentiation, and antagonized BMP-mediated inhibition of cell invasion. Taken together, our results suggest that R81 methylation plays an essential role in Smad6-mediated inhibition of BMP responses."

Treatment options and estimated survival outcomes after pulmonary resection differ between patients with LSQCC and MSQCC. This study aimed to investigate whether microRNA (miRNA) profiling by RNA sequencing of HNSQCC, MSQCC, and LSQCC was useful for differential diagnosis of MSQCC and LSQCC. RNA sequencing was performed to identify bioinformatically significant miRNAs from a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block from a derivation set. MiRNA levels were confirmed by validation sets using FFPE samples and serum extracellular vesicles from patients. Step-wise discriminant analysis and canonical discriminant analysis identified 13 miRNAs by which the different expression patterns of LSQCC, MSQCC, and HNSQCC groups were demonstrated. Six miRNAs (miR-10a/28/141/320b/3120) were assessed in validation sets, and 4 miRNAs (miR-10a/28/141/3120) were significantly upregulated in LSQCCs compared with MSQCCs and HNSQCCs. Serum extracellular vesicles from LSQCC patients demonstrated significantly elevated miR-10a ( p = .042), miR-28 ( p = .041), and miR-3120 ( p = .047) levels compared with those from MSQCC patients. RNA sequencing is useful for differential diagnosis of LSQCC and MSQCC, and the expression level of miR-10a, miR-28, and miR-3120 in serum extracellular vesicles are promising noninvasive tools for this purpose."
https://openalex.org/W3135743269,"Joint flexibility is theoretically considered to associate with muscle-tendon unit (MTU) architecture. However, this potential association has not been experimentally demonstrated in humans in vivo. We aimed to identify whether and how MTU architectural parameters are associated with joint range of motion (RoM), with a special emphasis on slack angle. The fascicle length, pennation angle, tendinous tissue length, MTU length, and shear modulus of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) were assessed during passive ankle dorsiflexion using ultrasound shear wave elastography in 17 healthy males. During passive dorsiflexion task, the ankle joint was rotated from 40° plantar flexion to the maximal dorsiflexion joint angle at which each subject started experiencing pain. From the ankle joint angle-shear modulus relationship, the angle at which shear modulus began to rise (slack angle) was calculated. Two dorsiflexion RoMs were determined as follows; 1) range from the anatomical position to maximal angle (RoM anat-max ) and 2) range from the MG slack angle to maximal angle (RoM slack-max ). The MTU architectural parameters were analyzed at the anatomical position and MG slack angle. The resolved fascicle length (fascicle length × cosine of pennation angle) and ratios of resolved fascicle or tendinous tissue length to MTU length measured at the MG slack angle significantly correlated with the RoM slack-max (r = 0.491, 0.506, and -0.506, respectively). Any MTU architectural parameters assessed at the anatomical position did not correlate with RoM anat-max or RoM slack-max . These results indicate that MTUs with long fascicle and short tendinous tissue are advantageous for joint flexibility. However, this association cannot be found unless MTU architecture and joint RoM are assessed with consideration of muscle slack."

Therefore, the present study specifically evaluates the mutual relationships between adiponectin and leptin and anxiety and depression in postmenopausal women. Participants and design In this cross-sectional study, a total of 190 women aged 40–65 years were enrolled. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Fasting specimens were collected to measure sex hormone, glucose, insulin, and adipokine levels. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between depression and anxiety and adipocyte-derived hormones. Settings The study was performed in a hospital medical center. Results Among 190 enrolled postmenopausal women, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between CES-D and HAM-A (r = 0.715, P &lt; 0.0001), between CES-D and adiponectin ( p = 0.009) and leptin ( p = 0.015), and between HAM-A and adiponectin ( p = 0.01) and leptin ( p = 0.001). The subjects with CES-D ≥ 16 and with HAM-A ≥ 18 had higher adiponectin levels than those with CES-D &lt; 16 and HAM-A &lt; 18, respectively. After adjusting for age, body mass index, exercise, alanine amino transferase and parameters of lipid profiles, Log adiponectin levels were found to be significantly associated with both CES-D and HAM-A, and Log leptin levels were only significantly associated with HAM-A. Conclusions The data show that adiponectin and leptin levels are significantly associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. These results suggest that higher adiponectin and lower leptin levels may serve as potential markers related to anxiety and mood in postmenopausal women. More future research that is designed to deal with the important confounders (e.g., population heterogeneity) is needed to investigate comprehensively on these associations."

To date, our understanding about the situation and risk factors of perinatal asphyxia-induced disabilities among Chinese children is still limited. Objectives To evaluate the prevalence and socio-demographic risk factors of disabilities caused by perinatal asphyxia among Chinese children in 2006 and compare disability trajectories across different socio-demographic status. Methods Cross-sectional data came from the 2006 China National Survey on Disability which includes a total of 616,940 children aged 0–17 years old was employed in the investigation. Perinatal asphyxia-induced disabilities were identified by following the guidance in consensus manuals. Population-weighted numbers and prevalence rates were investigated, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate associations between disabilities and socio-demographic factors. Adjusted predictions at representative values were computed to compare the disability trajectories relative to significant socio-demographic variables. Results The prevalence rate of disabilities caused by perinatal asphyxia was 7.70 per 10,000 children (95% CI: 7.01–8.39). Male (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47–2.23) and low family income (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.21–2.49) have higher and the increase of per additional year of age (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.88–0.91) has lower probability of being disabilities caused by perinatal asphyxia. Further disability trajectories showed that differences in probability between gender and family income group were more evident before age 7 and weakened with increasing age. Conclusions Our results showed that both demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are risk factors for disabilities caused by perinatal asphyxia. Of these, gender and family income have much higher impact than other factors on the prevalence rate of disabilities caused by perinatal asphyxia at infants and young children. Multiple society sectors should increase their effort to bring about fundamental social change to prevent disabilities caused by perinatal asphyxia, especially concerning younger children and their families."

Indeed, the IGF-I analog heregulin-1β supports hESC proliferation and self-renewal (6Wang L. Schulz T.C. Sherrer E.S. Dauphin D.S. Shin S. Nelson A.M. Ware C.B. Zhan M. Song C.Z. Chen X. Brimble S.N.

Conversely, blockade of IGF1R decreases survival of hESCs (7Bendall S.C. Stewart M.H. Menendez P. George D. Vijayaragavan K. Werbowetski-Ogilvie T. Ramos-Mejia V. Rouleau A. Yang J. Bosse M.

Beyond pluripotency, the knockout of IR in the mouse brain has also been reported to lead to neuronal defects that contribute to neurological disorders (8Kleinridders A. Cai W. Cappellucci L. Ghazarian A. Collins W.R. Vienberg S.G. Pothos E.N. Kahn C.R. Insulin resistance in brain alters dopamine turnover and causes behavioral disorders.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 3463-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although most studies to date have focused on IGF1R signaling in regulating human pluripotency, the precise role of IR in hPSCs and their differentiated progeny has received poor attention. To directly address the significance of IR in pluripotency and hPSC identity, we used two independent shRNAs to stably knock down IR in two different hPSC lines and interrogated the consequences on insulin/IGF-I signaling pathways (9Taniguchi C.M. Emanuelli B. Kahn C.R. Critical nodes in signalling pathways: Insights into insulin action.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Knock down of IR decreased basal pAKT and reciprocally increased pERK1/2 levels. Next, genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics analyses in shIR-hPSCs revealed an increased expression of numerous pluripotency genes (OCT4, SOX2, DPPA4, and LIN28). The compensatory increase in pERK1/2 could possibly account for the elevated pluripotency gene expression since ERK2 has been reported to bind proximal to the promoter of pluripotency genes (10Goke J. Chan Y.S. Yan J. Vingron M. Ng H.H. Genome-wide kinase-chromatin interactions reveal the regulatory network of ERK signaling in human embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 844-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ERK2 chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase assays, and ERK1/2 inhibitors together establish direct causality between ERK1/2 and OCT4 expression. It is striking that RNA-Seq and proteomics analyses revealed a dysregulation of germ layer cell fate specification genes and an unexpected global downregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. When these shIR-hPSCs were differentiated toward the neural lineage, we observed aberrant neuroectoderm and cerebral organoid development. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of IR-mediated signaling in the maintenance of pluripotency, the ECM which contributes to the hPSC niche (11Watt F.M. Huck W.T. Role of the extracellular matrix in regulating stem cell fate.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and long-lasting effects on tissue and neural differentiation. Consistent with previous reports (12Ding V. Choo A.B. Oh S.K. Deciphering the importance of three key media components in human embryonic stem cell cultures.Biotechnol. Lett. 2006; 28: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Ludwig T. J A.T. Defined, feeder-independent medium for human embryonic stem cell culture.Curr. Protoc. Stem Cell Biol. 2007; (Chapter 1:Unit 1C 2)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we detected high levels of human insulin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12/20% KOSR (∼1200 ± 175 nM) and mTeSR1 media (∼1407 ± 128 nM). Although the rationale for adding >100× physiological concentration of recombinant insulin/IGFs to hPSC media is unclear, one implication is that insulin/IGF signaling is important for the maintenance of hPSCs. To directly investigate the role of IR signaling in mediating human pluripotency, we stably knocked down IR in two different hESC lines (CHB8 and H9). Among the four shRNA constructs (Sigma) we tested, the short hairpins that target the CACTGATTACTTGCTGCTCT sequence in exon 2 and GTGCTGTATGAAGTGAGTTA sequence in exon 13 of IR gene (INSR) resulted in a reproducible knockdown of IR transcript and protein expression. Of a total of 52 clones (35 for CHB8 and 17 for H9) that were screened both at the transcript and protein levels, we obtained two independent IR knocked down clones in CHB8 (shIR-CHB8) and three in H9 hESCs (shIR-H9). QPCR and Western blot analyses confirmed the knock down of IR in CHB8 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A) and H9 hESCs (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). Of interest, knock down of IR resulted in a concomitant decrease in IGF1R protein expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, upon IR knockdown, we observed that IRS-1 and p85α protein expression was marginally decreased, whereas IRS-2 protein expression either increased or did not change (Fig. S1, C–E). Notwithstanding the mild changes in expression of the proximal adaptor proteins, we observed a drastic decrease in pAKTS473 and a surprising reciprocal increase in pERK1/2T202/Y204 signaling (Fig. 1, C and D). Western blot analyses on additional independent IR knocked down clones in H9 hESCs, generated using different shRNA constructs, reflected similar changes in protein expression (Fig. S1E). Together, these data indicate that IR/AKT/ERK1/2 signaling is active in hPSCs and the loss of IR modulates PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways in a reciprocal manner, which may, in turn, impact the hPSC state. To determine if the shIR-hPSCs continued to respond normally to ligand, we starved the hPSCs for 24 h in DMEM/F-12 + 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 10 ng/ml Activin + 12 ng/ml FGF2 (3Vallier L. Alexander M. Pedersen R.A. Activin/Nodal and FGF pathways cooperate to maintain pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4495-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) (minimal pluripotency-sustaining conditions devoid of undefined factors that would activate insulin signaling) before stimulating them with increasing doses of human insulin. The scrambled controls (shScr-hPSCs) exhibited a dose-dependent increase in pAKTS473 upon insulin stimulation (Fig. 1E), indicating primary activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency. In contrast, shIR-hPSCs lost their responsiveness to exogenous insulin stimulation (Fig. 1E). Next, to determine if the knock down of IR in hPSCs affected the hPSC state, we immunostained both shScr- and shIR-hPSCs for OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA4, and TRA-1-60 and confirmed that they remain pluripotent (Fig. 2A). We also differentiated them into the three germ layers in vivo via teratoma assays (Fig. S2A) and performed in vitro directed differentiation (Fig. S2B) to definitively demonstrate their pluripotency. We next undertook a systems biology approach to gain further insights into the impact of IR knock down on hPSCs. RNA-Seq performed on shIR-CHB8 hESCs indicated that INSR transcript was knocked down without affecting IGF1R transcripts (Table S1), suggesting that the short hairpins targeting INSR transcript are specific and that the decrease in IGF1R protein expression (Fig. 1, A and B and Fig. S1E) is secondary to the loss of IR protein expression. Proteomics analyses further confirmed that IR protein was knocked down in shIR-CHB8 hESCs (Table S2). RNA-Seq analyses performed on shIR-CHB8 hESCs revealed an interesting trend of upregulation of numerous pluripotency genes (Fig. 2B, Fig. S2C and Table S1). Proteomics analyses revealed similar changes in both CHB8 (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2D) and H9 (Fig. S2, E and F) hESCs (Tables S2 and S3). Western blot analyses confirmed that the knock down of IR resulted in an upregulation of OCT4, SOX2, DPPA4, and LIN28 protein expression both in CHB8 (Fig. 2D) and H9 (Fig. S2, G and H) hESCs. Phosphoproteomics analyses performed on shIR-H9 hESCs confirmed an increased phosphorylation of ERK1Y204 and ERK2Y187 (Table S4), corroborating our observations on increased pERK1/2T202/Y204 in shIR-hPSCs (Fig. 1, C and D and Fig. S1E). These data gain significance since ERK2 has been reported to bind to promoter/enhancer regions of pluripotency genes OCT4, SOX2, DPPA4, LIN28A, SALL4, and DNMT3B (10Goke J. Chan Y.S. Yan J. Vingron M. Ng H.H. Genome-wide kinase-chromatin interactions reveal the regulatory network of ERK signaling in human embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 844-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OCT4, SOX2, and SALL4 all contain putative ERK phosphorylation sites among which ERK2 was confirmed to phosphorylate OCT4, thereby directly linking ERK signaling with pluripotency (14Brumbaugh J. Hou Z. Russell J.D. Howden S.E. Yu P. Ledvina A.R. Coon J.J. Thomson J.A. Phosphorylation regulates human OCT4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 7162-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the loss of IR in hPSCs led to a compensatory increase in pERK1/2, which in turn upregulated the expression of pluripotency genes to maintain the hPSC state. To establish direct causality between ERK1/2 and pluripotency, we first performed ERK2 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) qPCR analyses on promoter/enhancer regions of pluripotency genes OCT4, SOX2, DPPA4, LIN28A, SALL4, and ZFX as indicated by Goke et al. (2013) (10Goke J. Chan Y.S. Yan J. Vingron M. Ng H.H. Genome-wide kinase-chromatin interactions reveal the regulatory network of ERK signaling in human embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 844-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Among these genomic loci, we only found ERK2 to consistently bind onto the OCT4 enhancer region (Fig. 2E). To confirm that the OCT4 enhancer region bound by ERK2 is transcriptionally active, we cloned the promoter/enhancer regions of OCT4, SOX2, and DPPA4 into luciferase assay vectors. Among these three pluripotency genes, indeed we found the OCT4 enhancer region to be transcriptionally active (Fig. 2F). To further demonstrate that the direct interaction between ERK1/2 and OCT4 genomic loci is functionally active, we used two different ERK1/2 inhibitors (instead of MEK inhibitors) on shScr- and shIR-hPSCs and observed that the inhibition of ERK1/2 reproducibly abolished the protein expression of OCT4 but not that of SOX2 (Fig. 2, G and H). The knockdown of ERK1/2 via shRNAs was unfortunately unsuccessful across multiple attempts. To identify other pluripotency genes that could be directly phosphorylated and regulated by pERK1/2, we performed phosphoproteomics analyses on shIR-CHB8 and shIR-H9 hESCs. NR6A1, SALL4, and DPPA4 exhibited increased phosphorylation (p < 0.05) in shIR-CHB8 hESCs (Table S5), whereas DPPA4 and UTF1 exhibited increased phosphorylation (p < 0.05) in shIR-H9 hESCs (Table S4). DPPA4 distinctly exhibited increased phosphorylation (p < 0.05) in both hESCs (Tables S4 and S5). Taken together, our data suggest that the increased pERK1/2 due to loss of IR in hPSCs phosphorylates and increases the expression of pluripotency genes to maintain the hPSC state. Since shIR-hPSCs exhibited increased pERK1/2 and gene expression of pluripotency factors, we next sought to determine if the increased expression of pluripotency genes modulated cell fate specification markers, in line with reports that increased pERK1/2 can lead to increased differentiation (15Singh A.M. Reynolds D. Cliff T. Ohtsuka S. Mattheyses A.L. Sun Y. Menendez L. Kulik M. Dalton S. Signaling network crosstalk in human pluripotent cells: A Smad2/3-regulated switch that controls the balance between self-renewal and differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 312-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Initial triage of RNA-Seq data from shIR-CHB8 hESCs (fold change > 1.5; p < 0.05) via Gene Ontology (GO) analyses indicated an upregulation of genes linked to nervous system development and neurogenesis (Fig. 3, A–C). This correlated with the increased expression of all Hox genes (majorly expressed in the vertebrate nervous system) detected in the RNA-Seq data (among 20,469 genes) (Fig. 3B). In addition, a majority of the most differentially upregulated genes in shIR-hPSCs were related to the neural lineage (Table S1). GO analyses indicated that multiple biological processes were both up- and downregulated in the RNA-Seq data (Fig. 3, C and D). Among the early germ layer specification genes, we observed that indeed numerous neuroectodermal genes such as PAX2, GBX2, CHRD, and NES and numerous HOX genes were upregulated, whereas most of the mesodermal and endodermal genes were strikingly downregulated in shIR-hPSCs (Fig. 3, A and B). GO analyses performed on downregulated proteins in the proteomics data from both shIR-CHB8 and shIR-H9 hESC lines (fold change > 1.5) (Fig. 3E) corroborated the RNA-Seq data (Fig. 3D). QPCR analyses then confirmed that some of the most downregulated genes (mostly endodermal) such as EOMES, SOX17, and FOXA2 were severely suppressed in shIR-hPSCs (Fig. 3, F and G). Thus, knockdown of IR in hPSCs causes an imbalance in germ layer specification genes, likely owing to an increase in phosphorylation coupled with total protein expression of numerous pluripotency genes. The knock down of IR in hPSCs also distinctly resulted in a global downregulation of ECM gene expression. RNA-Seq data indicated that a majority of the collagen (COL), keratins (KRT), vitronectin (VTN), fibronectin (FN1), laminins (LAM), and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) genes were dramatically downregulated in shIR-hPSCs (Fig. S3A). Proteomics data in shIR-CHB8 and shIR-H9 hESCs further reflected this global downregulation of ECM proteins (Fig. S3, B and C). QPCR analyses on FN1, COL1A1, and KRT19 genes in both shIR-CHB8 and shIR-H9 hESCs (Fig. S3D) and Western blot analyses on FN1, COL1, and P4HB (Fig. S3E) provided corroborative independent validations. Considering the RNA-Seq data pointed to perturbations in genes involved in nervous system development in undifferentiated hPSCs (Fig. 3, A–C), we then differentiated both shScr- and shIR-hPSCs into neuroectoderm and cerebral organoids to evaluate the effects of IR knockdown on neural lineage differentiation. QPCR analyses revealed an upregulation of neuroectodermal markers SOX2, SOX1, PAX6, and SIP1 in shIR-hPSCs differentiated into day 7 neuroectoderm (Fig. 4A). Immunostaining then revealed that SOX1 and PAX6 proteins colocalized in shScr-hPSC–derived neuroectoderm but not in shIR-hPSC–derived neuroectoderm (Fig. 4B and Fig. S4). Moving forward, we differentiated both shScr- and shIR-hPSCs into cerebral organoids using the protocol published by Lancaster et al. (16Lancaster M.A. Knoblich J.A. Generation of cerebral organoids from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 2329-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). We continued to observe an upregulation of PAX6 gene expression in this advanced neural differentiation protocol (Fig. 4C). However, we consistently found the forebrain marker FOXG1 and Cajal–Retzius marker REELIN to be significantly downregulated at the end of the cerebral differentiation (Fig. 4C). Immunostaining for FOXG1 in these cerebral organoids then showed that shScr-hPSC–derived cerebral organoids formed FOXG1+ cortical membrane-like structures (see white arrows) but shIR-hPSC–derived cerebral organoids did not (Fig. 4D). This suggests that the knockdown of IR in hPSCs led to aberrant neuroectoderm development, giving rise to disrupted neural gene expression and the proper formation of mature cortical structures in this cerebral organoid model. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the knock down of IR in hPSCs (1; Fig. 4E) decreased pAKT (2; Fig. 4E) and resulted in a global decrease in ECM gene expression necessary for the hPSC niche (3; Fig. 4E). The knockdown also resulted in a compensatory increase in pERK1/2 (4; Fig. 4E), an inherent compensatory mechanism, leading to increased pluripotency marker gene expression (5; Fig. 4E), and perturbations in cell fate specification such as that of neural development (6; Fig. 4E). Insulin/IGF-I signaling pathways regulate the growth and specialized functions of most mammalian tissues including pluripotent stem cells. Although a role for IGF1R has been reported (6Wang L. Schulz T.C. Sherrer E.S. Dauphin D.S. Shin S. Nelson A.M. Ware C.B. Zhan M. Song C.Z. Chen X. Brimble S.N. McLean A. Galeano M.J. Uhl E.W.

IGF and FGF cooperatively establish the regulatory stem cell niche of pluripotent human cells in vitro.Nature. 2007; 448: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), virtually nothing is known about the significance of IR in hPSCs. Using genome-wide RNA-Seq, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analyses of two different clones in two different hESC lines (CHB8 and H9), we demonstrated that the IR is indeed important for hPSC viability and function. Knockdown of IR marginally perturbed adaptor proteins while strongly decreasing pAKT and evoking a compensatory increase in pERK1/2 signaling. Insulin stimulation of shScr-hPSCs demonstrates that pAKT signaling is the predominant pathway activated via ligand binding to IR/IGF1R. Among the nodes downstream of insulin/IGF-I signaling, both the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways (9Taniguchi C.M. Emanuelli B. Kahn C.R. Critical nodes in signalling pathways: Insights into insulin action.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar) are considered important for pluripotency and viability of hESCs (17Armstrong L. Hughes O. Yung S. Hyslop L. Stewart R. Wappler I. Peters H. Walter T. Stojkovic P. Evans J. Stojkovic M. Lako M.

Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1894-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast to human PSCs, IR-mediated signaling showed a decrease in Erk/mTor pathways along with a decrease in Akt pathway in mouse PSCs (18Gupta M.K. De Jesus D.F. Kahraman S. Valdez I.A. Shamsi F. Yi L. Swensen A.C. Tseng Y.H. Qian W.J. Kulkarni R.N. Insulin receptor-mediated signaling regulates pluripotency markers and lineage differentiation.Mol. Metab. 2018; 18: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting some species differences. In our studies, the severe reduction in pAKT signaling in shIR-hPSCs and a strong concomitant increase in pERK1/2 signaling is consistent with a recent report that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces pERK1/2 expression to modulate self-renewal of hPSCs (15Singh A.M. Reynolds D. Cliff T. Ohtsuka S. Mattheyses A.L. Sun Y. Menendez L. Kulik M. Dalton S.

The decrease in pAKT signaling in our shIR-hPSCs should not be confused with the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling that induces endoderm differentiation because the latter takes place in the presence of a high dose of Activin A (19McLean A.B. D'Amour K.A. Jones K.L. Krishnamoorthy M. Kulik M.J. Reynolds D.M. Sheppard A.M. Liu H. Xu Y. Baetge E.E. Dalton S. Activin a efficiently specifies definitive endoderm from human embryonic stem cells only when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling is suppressed.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Since the insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway is known to be actively involved in the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of hPSCs (20Dalton S. Signaling networks in human pluripotent stem cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2013; 25: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and considering the high levels of recombinant insulin/IGFs in hPSC media, one can argue that insulin/IGF-I is highly implicated in mediating the increase in pERK1/2 signaling. Insulin/IGF-I signaling activates the MAPK pathway, and a high basal level of MAPK signaling has been reported to maintain the expression of pluripotency genes in hPSCs (21Eiselleova L. Matulka K. Kriz V. Kunova M. Schmidtova Z. Neradil J. Tichy B. Dvorakova D. Pospisilova S. Hampl A. Dvorak P.

MEK/ERK signaling contributes to the maintenance of human embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Differentiation. 2007; 75: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). MAPK signaling is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in both mouse and human PSCs, but, in contrast, high levels of MAPK signaling is reported to involve differentiation in mouse PSCs. The MEK/ERK signaling pathway has diverse functions with some reports indicating that it maintains pluripotency and self-renewal (17Armstrong L. Hughes O. Yung S. Hyslop L. Stewart R. Wappler I. Peters H. Walter T. Stojkovic P. Evans J. Stojkovic M. Lako M.

Methods. 2005; 2: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Since KOSR contains BMP-like activities, the increased pERK1/2 in shIR-hPSCs could be playing a role in inhibiting BMP signaling-induced differentiation. Increased pERK1/2 has been suggested to lead to increased differentiation (15Singh A.M. Reynolds D. Cliff T. Ohtsuka S. Mattheyses A.L. Sun Y. Menendez L. Kulik M. Dalton S.

However, in our shIR-hPSCs, the increased pERK1/2 is tightly correlated with increased pluripotency gene expression, phosphorylation, and widespread downregulation of mesodermal and endodermal gene expression. In fact, investigation of ERK signaling for the self-renewal of hESCs reveals that ERK2 binds near OCT4, SOX2, DPPA4, LIN28A, SALL4, and DNMT3B and is necessary for the maintenance of pluripotency"

Methods In this cohort study, 63 eyes from 55 patients (21 females) diagnosed with PDR, who needed PPV for non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage or fibrovascular membrane proliferation were enrolled. All the eyes underwent IVB followed by PPV. Anterior chamber tap was performed at the beginning of both procedures to evaluate the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Results Forty-seven patients (54 eyes) were followed over six months, averaging 12±5 (6–19) months. The concentration of VEGF significantly decreased after IVB (P&lt;0.001), while other cytokines did not change significantly. The aqueous humor level of IL-8 after IVB (R = 0.378, P = 0.033), MCP-1 before (R = 0.368, P = 0.021) and after (R = 0.368, P = 0.038) IVB, and combined phacoemulsification (R = 0.293, P = 0.032) was correlated with the logMAR visual acuity at the last follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed that MCP-1 was the predictor for a worse visual outcome (B = 0.108, 95% CI 0.013–0.202; P = 0.027). Conclusions MCP-1 was a predictor for the unfavorable visual outcome of PDR after IVB pretreatment and PPV."

The central cause of cancer-related mortality is metastasis. The increase in the metastatic potential of certain solid tumors has been linked to the overexpression of embryonic and lineage-specific developmental programs that regulate cell fate during organogenesis. Therefore, how this cancer cell plasticity is achieved and how to successfully target these cells are fundamental questions. My training as both a cancer biologist and a developmental biologist gives me a unique perspective in answering these two tough questions. My lab will focus on understanding how genes that regulate proper organogenesis become aberrantly used to enhance chemoresistance and metastatic potential. I have been at the UT Southwestern campus since early January 2021. Sitting in my office (socially distancing with the door closed) while trying to hire staff for my lab, organizing data to write grants, and thinking of the most critical experiments that can be done, I cannot help but ask myself what I have learned in 2020. At the end of 2019, no one could have imagined what 2020 had in store. Like the rest of the world, I lived in an endless cycle of mixed emotions ranging from anxiety to fear, depression to anger, with intermittent periods of hope. Hope, my grandmother used to say, is comfort for fools. Yet it was hope that kept me going—and applying for this position when everyone said this was going to be a bad year to apply for academic jobs. This year I learned that dreaming of equality, peace, justice, and the tangible expectation that one’s dream will be reality is not foolish. After a very exciting and scientifically useful rollercoaster with dogmas getting overturned again and again over the past 20 years, recent reports have unequivocally demonstrated that adult-born neurons are generated in human hippocampus throughout adulthood. This process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is compromised in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients and, intriguingly, the levels of neurogenesis in the Alzheimer’s hippocampus correlate with the ante-mortem cognitive status of the affected individuals. My lab studies how adult hippocampal neurogenesis impacts, and is impacted by, Alzheimer’s disease pathology and whether it can be recruited to “rejuvenate” the degenerating brain and prevent or counteract memory loss. Just before the pandemic hit, I was in the process of recruiting my new team, making practical arrangements for my new lab, and finalizing a strenuous manuscript revision. And then COVID-19 happened. Was it more difficult than normal to remotely set up a new life, a new lab, and a new team in a different country? Probably. Will the pandemic have a greater impact on starting PIs than on already established ones? Possibly. Could things be worse than what they have been? Definitely. I am privileged to be granted the opportunity to do what I love and to receive tremendous support from previous and new mentors, colleagues, and collaborators. I am fortunate to be surrounded by a team of caring individuals and devoted scientists. The pandemic has taken its toll on our students and mentees more than on us. This is a good time to be grateful and supportive. During my early scientific career, I was fascinated by the ability of organoid technology and manipulation to recapitulate tissue. My passion for applying stem/progenitor cells in regenerative medicine, which began during my postdoc at the Hubrecht Institute, continues in the present. My lab at Shandong University, established in 2019, seeks to understand adult cell fate decisions in homeostasis, regeneration, and disease, focusing on liver, the gastrointestinal tract, and organ crosstalk. We are developing organoids (including hepatocyte and tumor organoids), mouse models, and multi-omics approaches to study cell plasticity. We are creating new approaches to explore mechanisms of dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation, and functional reconstruction within injured tissue, with an eye toward interdisciplinary collaboration to link experimental approaches with translational medicine. Our group was recruited and formed in a supportive environment. Everything was going well during my transition into an independent PI. Later, COVID-19 provided unanticipated challenges. However, thanks to my friends, colleagues, and young enthusiastic lab members early during the pandemic, we managed to mostly minimize its effects on lab research. I am grateful for our good administration and for family support. The lab has almost returned to pre-COVID-19 activity, except for the requirement for remote communication and online conferences. This return has filled our days with more cooperation, understanding, and appreciation. After injury, proper cellular communication is essential for repair and restoration of tissue function. Cells at the injured location must actively recruit immune cells that initially clear pathogens and debris, then orchestrate stem and progenitor cell-mediated repair. When tissue-resident cells do not properly communicate with immune cells, the resulting delayed or excessive immune cell infiltration impairs healing and leads to tissue dysfunction. My lab uses skin as a model to uncover cellular interactions necessary for rapid, robust infiltration of immune cells after damage. Specifically, we investigate how local keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and adipocytes are activated after injury to recruit myeloid cells and define how a breakdown in cellular activation and communication contributes to impaired healing. Like damaged tissue, this pandemic pushed my group outside of homeostatic setpoints. Before the pandemic hit, I was proud of how my group initially grew and the exciting data being generated. Suddenly, things came to a screeching halt. When COVID-19 restrictions were implemented, I quickly lost my entire research team and hiring was placed on hold. As restrictions eased, my group slowly recovered and began settling into the “new norm.” Now my lab relies on multiple modes of communication to have productive interactions, both in person and virtually. We still face challenges associated with current restrictions; however, like our response to injury, we work hard to ensure our communication is rapid, efficient, and clear so that we can maintain function and productivity. I think one of the most fascinating things about the human brain is how it is different from that of other animals, and how this uniqueness may contribute to our vulnerability to brain diseases. Using pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells and brain organoids, my group aims to study human brain development in normal and disease conditions. In particular, we focus on pathways that control cellular growth for their roles in regulating brain development, evolution, and disease. Since starting in 2018, I was fortunate to attract a group of talented trainees that want to use our in vitro models to answer these fundamental questions. With the support of excellent collaborators, we are exploring how abnormal cellular growth leads to autism, epilepsy, and degeneration. The current situation further highlights the translational value of our stem cells and organoid models in studying human diseases. Working with the lab of my long-time collaborator Julien Muffat, we are also reconstructing immune-competent neural cultures to study the impact of viruses on the brain. The pandemic hit us right in the middle of many long-term experiments, jeopardizing our momentum. However, I am incredibly inspired to see how resilient my lab members have been. We adapt to changes in the way we work, pushing forward on all fronts, and the lab has emerged stronger. I am very optimistic about the future of my lab, the team we are building, and the exciting science that we are producing and look forward to sharing soon. My lab leverages stem cell science to investigate clonal and lineage compositions of “normal” human epithelial tissues and identify cellular risk states and linked molecular programs that control the genesis of premalignant clones. At Mayo, we established the first comprehensive “living” tissue organoid biobanks for breast and fallopian tubes from healthy individuals and cancer patients. Amidst the pandemic, we also launched a bold Regenerative Medicine initiative to develop the first autologous salivary transplant biobank to treat radiotherapy-induced xerostomia and improve quality of life in cancer survivors. Our major emphasis is to develop in vitro and in vivo assays to track clonal regenerative activities. We have created NGS pipelines for cellular DNA barcoding-based clonal tracking and to investigate normal and malignant stem cells. I suggested that the International Society for Stem Cell Research conduct a survey to identify adverse impacts of the pandemic on ECRs, and we discussed the findings in a Commentary published in the June 2020 issue of Stem Cell Reports. I had the opportunity to co-lead a study on COVID-19 published in the December 2020 issue of Cell Death & Discovery where we described COVID-engine, a blood-based systems biology approach to study host response to coronaviruses. COVID-19 is a true testament to the Sanskrit wisdom Vasudeiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and has reinforced the joy and importance of pursuing a team approach in order to maintain sanity and ensure scientific progress for a shared future."

But don't worry—it was a virtual bomb, part of a game I started to play with my research group through teleconferencing in the early days of the pandemic. Called Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (KTANE), the game consists of a “defuser”—me—who has the bomb but no idea how to defuse it, and a group of “experts”—the members of my team—who have an instruction manual but cannot see the bomb. I have to describe the components of the bomb to them. They have to identify each component in their manual, figure out how to defuse it, and explain the solution to me. Then I have to execute based on their instructions. If we make too many mistakes or run out of time—boom!—the bomb explodes and the game is over. For our group, playing offered excitement and camaraderie—and for me, a lesson in how games can hone leadership skills."
https://openalex.org/W3134544217,"Main textOn November 30, 2020, we lost the brilliant, generous, and forward-thinking leader who founded and chaired the Developmental Biology Program at the Sloan Kettering Institute from 2002 to 2019. Kathryn Anderson was an extraordinary scientist who made landmark discoveries at every stage of her career (Figure 1). Her work transformed our understanding of mechanisms of embryonic patterning in Drosophila and mammals, and her insights into the diverse roles of the Toll/NF-κB and Hedgehog pathways have had a broad impact on biology and medicine. As the current faculty of the Developmental Biology Program, we join together to share our thoughts on Kathryn’s remarkable career.Kathryn Virginia Anderson was born in La Jolla, California in 1952. After completing her bachelor’s degree in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, Kathryn explored various fields in biology, ultimately enrolling in a new PhD program at the University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA, she began to assemble tools to study embryonic development, a problem that would fascinate her throughout her career. As the first graduate student of Judith Lengyel, Kathryn used biochemical techniques to probe the earliest aspects of genome activity in fruit fly embryos. By measuring the rates of DNA and RNA synthesis using incorporation of radioactive thymidine and uridine, she discovered that maternal mRNAs sustain the development of the early Drosophila embryo and revealed that embryos undergo a progressive transition from maternal to zygotic gene expression (Anderson and Lengyel, 1979Anderson K.V. Lengyel J.A. Rates of synthesis of major classes of RNA in Drosophila embryos.Dev. Biol. 1979; 70: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; Anderson and Lengyel, 1980Anderson K.V. Lengyel J.A. Changing rates of histone mRNA synthesis and turnover in Drosophila embryos.Cell. 1980; 21: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This work inspired Kathryn’s appreciation for molecular approaches and provided the foundation for her future research in developmental biology.Kathryn’s training in molecular biology served her well when, as a postdoc, she set out to identify the maternally provided factors that pattern the developing embryo. Kathryn traveled to Tübingen, Germany to join another new lab, the lab of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, who had recently completed the first screens for zygotic patterning mutants in Drosophila with Eric Wieschaus. Focusing on mutations in maternally provided genes that pattern the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing embryo (Figure 2A), Kathryn demonstrated that injection of wild-type cytoplasm into dorsalized Toll mutants restores the entire dorsal-ventral axis, and moreover, that the injection site specifies the ventral-most position of the embryo (Anderson and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1984Anderson K.V. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Information for the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo is stored as maternal mRNA.Nature. 1984; 311: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar; Anderson et al., 1985Anderson K.V.

Establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo: the induction of polarity by the Toll gene product.Cell. 1985; 42: 791-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). These observations provided the first clues that a maternal gene product specifies ventral identity. In her own lab at the University of California, Berkeley, Kathryn’s group cloned several components of this novel dorsal-ventral patterning pathway in a rapid and spectacular fashion, including the cell-surface receptor Toll (Hashimoto et al., 1988Hashimoto C. Hudson K.L. Anderson K.V. The Toll gene of Drosophila, required for dorsal-ventral embryonic polarity, appears to encode a transmembrane protein.Cell. 1988; 52: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), the Toll ligand Spätzle (Morisato and Anderson, 1994Morisato D.

The spätzle gene encodes a component of the extracellular signaling pathway establishing the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo.Cell. 1994; 76: 677-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar; Schneider et al., 1994Schneider D.S. Jin Y. Morisato D. Anderson K.V. A processed form of the Spätzle protein defines dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.Development. 1994; 120: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the extracellular protease Easter that activates Spätzle (Chasan and Anderson, 1989Chasan R. Anderson K.V. The role of easter, an apparent serine protease, in organizing the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo.Cell. 1989; 56: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition to identifying key components of this pathway, Kathryn’s lab used elegant genetic approaches to deduce the sequence of events between Toll receptor activity at the membrane and the cellular response in the nucleus. Building on her elucidation of this novel receptor and its downstream signaling pathway, other labs showed that Toll-like receptors represent a large family of proteins with conserved functions in the innate immune system. The discovery that Toll receptors function in innate immunity—a finding recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its implications for understanding sepsis and inflammation—would not have been possible without Kathryn’s pioneering research.Figure 2A journey of discovery, from flies to miceShow full caption(A) Cuticles of a wild-type Drosophila embryo (WT, ventral view) and dorsalized Toll loss-of-function (lof) or ventralized Toll gain-of-function (gof) mutants.(B and C) Wild-type mouse embryos (left) and Dync2h1 (B) or Ttc21b (C) mutants (right).

Rosa, who was renowned for her experimental prowess in the early mouse embryo, was bemused that such a highly accomplished fly geneticist wanted to come to her lab to work with mice. In the Beddington lab, Kathryn formulated an ambitious experimental strategy to carry out a genome-wide screen in the mouse for recessive lethal mutations that perturb embryonic development. While gene targeting efforts in mice at the time focused primarily on reverse genetic approaches, Kathryn’s plan to screen for recessive lethal mutations that affect embryonic development was widely considered to be impossible in a mammalian system. Yet upon returning to Berkeley, Kathryn and her graduate student Andrew Kasarskis initiated the first screens to identify genes with essential roles in early post-implantation mouse development (Kasarskis et al., 1998Kasarskis A. Manova K. Anderson K.V. A phenotype-based screen for embryonic lethal mutations in the mouse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 7485-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These studies took off when Kathryn moved to Sloan Kettering in 1996 (García-García et al., 2005García-García M.J. Eggenschwiler J.T. Caspary T. Alcorn H.L. Wyler M.R. Huangfu D. Rakeman A.S. Lee J.D. Feinberg E.H. Timmer J.R. Anderson K.V. Analysis of mouse embryonic patterning and morphogenesis by forward genetics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5913-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There, developmental biologists Liz Lacy and Lee Niswander were implementing emerging technologies for reverse genetics and high-resolution imaging of mouse cells, tissues, and embryos, part of a long line of pioneering research programs in mouse genetics at Sloan Kettering.Over more than two decades at Sloan Kettering, Kathryn’s lab screened tens of thousands of mutations and identified over 100 mutations that generate profound and specific defects in mouse development. This mutant collection has been a treasure trove for unlocking the secrets of gastrulation, axis formation, cell migration, and neural tube patterning and morphogenesis. One might think that such an immense undertaking would require an army of students and postdocs, but in fact, Kathryn maintained a moderate-sized lab. She was directly involved in experiments and could often be found dissecting embryos, peering intently through the microscope, and routinely visiting the mouse room to look after her colony. Kathryn’s unbiased ENU mutagenesis screens, coupled with her keen eye for interesting phenotypes, led to the discovery of many new genes and revolutionized our understanding of known pathways. This is perhaps best illustrated by her lab’s work on a series of mutants that affect Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), a ventralizing signal in the mammalian neural tube. Defects in SHH signaling cause striking morphological abnormalities that are readily identifiable. Consequently, many mutants identified in the screens were found to affect HH signaling. However, several mutants with classic HH pathway phenotypes did not correspond to known regulators of HH signaling. In a paradigm-shifting series of experiments, Kathryn’s lab made the surprising discovery that HH signaling requires the primary cilium, an ancient organelle that is present on most mammalian cells (Figures 2B and 2C) (Huangfu et al., 2003Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V. Hedgehog signalling in the mouse requires intraflagellar transport proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Kathryn’s lab proceeded to identify many critical regulators of ciliary biology and elucidate how they modulate HH signaling by dynamically concentrating critical positive and negative regulators within the tiny cilium structure. As the core components of the Hedgehog pathway are highly conserved from flies to mammals, it was completely unexpected that vertebrate Hedgehog signaling would require a conserved cellular organelle that is not used for Hedgehog signaling in flies. How this occurred during evolution remains a mindboggling mystery, yet the medical implications are profound as numerous diseases, including medulloblastoma and ciliopathies, are affected by HH signaling.Shortly after she arrived at Sloan Kettering, Kathryn and several other faculty members studying development in flies (Mary Baylies) and mice (Peter Besmer, Liz Lacy, and Lee Niswander) hatched the idea of launching a developmental biology program. The Sloan Kettering leadership at the time, MSKCC President Harold Varmus and SKI Director Tom Kelly, recognizing the clear overlap between genes involved in development and cancer, enthusiastically agreed with one proviso: that Kathryn agree to be the chair. It is our great fortune that Kathryn served as chair of the Developmental Biology Program for 17 years. She built a multidisciplinary and interactive department encompassing diverse topics and organisms. Kathryn recruited investigators using genetics and live imaging to study the mechanisms that build the embryo in mouse (Kat Hadjantonakis), flies (Jennifer Zallen), and worms (Zhirong Bao) and investigators using these tools to probe the mechanisms that establish the neural circuitry of the brain (Songhai Shi and Julia Kaltschmidt). Kathryn recognized early on the potential of human pluripotent stem cells, first inviting Lorenz Studer and later recruiting Danwei Huangfu and Thomas Vierbuchen, who are pioneering new approaches to study cell fate specification and model human disease. Reflecting Kathryn’s belief that developmental biology is all of biology, Kathryn also included investigators working on fundamental cellular processes in multicellular organisms, such as RNA biology (Eric Lai) and epigenetics (Mary Goll). Kathryn recruited many women to the program, unusual for biomedical fields, reflecting her long-standing commitment to gender equality in science. This, in turn, attracted talents such as Maria Jasin, renowned for her work on genomic integrity in stem cells and mice, and Alex Joyner, a pioneer in using mouse genetics to understand development and cancer. Under Kathryn’s leadership, the Developmental Biology Program has become a model of gender equality and scientific excellence, highlighting the importance of having women in leadership positions in science.Kathryn’s foresight and fearlessness are evident throughout her career, from her bold decision to train in new labs, her risky transition from the fly to the mouse, and her role as the architect of a new department. Kathryn’s exceptional achievements have been recognized by many awards, including election to the National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, the Genetics Society of America Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal, the FASEB Excellence in Science Award, and the Society for Developmental Biology Edwin G. Conklin Medal. As chair, Kathryn mentored faculty in her uniquely unpretentious style. She edited our grants and papers, delighted in our latest cool results, cheered on the successes of our students and postdocs, nudged us to consider other ways of thinking, provided invaluable advice, and conveyed not only her high expectations of us but also her confidence that we could meet them. Kathryn was a dedicated teacher of genetics and developmental biology and a devoted mentor to dozens of students and postdocs, seeding the field with her outstanding trainees, including many remarkable women.Kathryn demonstrated by example the value of an inclusive community, the importance of focusing on fundamental questions, and the joy of discovery through curiosity, careful observation, and an open mind. Her talks and papers described often astonishing findings in a clear and intellectually rigorous fashion, with overwhelming evidence, elegant logic, and a complete absence of hype. When not doing hands-on research or leading the department, Kathryn had a rich cultural life. She had a special passion for music, playing the harpsichord and piano, and she admired a wide range of artists from Philip Glass to Radiohead. She loved opera, theater, and the arts. Having spent much of her life in California, she eventually became a true New Yorker and delighted in its restaurants, culture, and people, together with her husband, Tim Bestor. Her work was truly revolutionary, and her legacy will be lasting. As our leader, colleague, and friend, she will be greatly missed.

Under Kathryn’s leadership, the Developmental Biology Program has become a model of gender equality and scientific excellence, highlighting the importance of having women in leadership positions in science.Kathryn’s foresight and fearlessness are evident throughout her career, from her bold decision to train in new labs, her risky transition from the fly to the mouse, and her role as the architect of a new department. Kathryn’s exceptional achievements have been recognized by many awards, including election to the National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, the Genetics Society of America Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal, the FASEB Excellence in Science Award, and the Society for Developmental Biology Edwin G. Conklin Medal. As chair, Kathryn mentored faculty in her uniquely unpretentious style. She edited our grants and papers, delighted in our latest cool results, cheered on the successes of our students and postdocs, nudged us to consider other ways of thinking, provided invaluable advice, and conveyed not only her high expectations of us but also her confidence that we could meet them. Kathryn was a dedicated teacher of genetics and developmental biology and a devoted mentor to dozens of students and postdocs, seeding the field with her outstanding trainees, including many remarkable women.Kathryn demonstrated by example the value of an inclusive community, the importance of focusing on fundamental questions, and the joy of discovery through curiosity, careful observation, and an open mind. Her talks and papers described often astonishing findings in a clear and intellectually rigorous fashion, with overwhelming evidence, elegant logic, and a complete absence of hype. When not doing hands-on research or leading the department, Kathryn had a rich cultural life. She had a special passion for music, playing the harpsichord and piano, and she admired a wide range of artists from Philip Glass to Radiohead. She loved opera, theater, and the arts. Having spent much of her life in California, she eventually became a true New Yorker and delighted in its restaurants, culture, and people, together with her husband, Tim Bestor. Her work was truly revolutionary, and her legacy will be lasting. As our leader, colleague, and friend, she will be greatly missed. On November 30, 2020, we lost the brilliant, generous, and forward-thinking leader who founded and chaired the Developmental Biology Program at the Sloan Kettering Institute from 2002 to 2019. Kathryn Anderson was an extraordinary scientist who made landmark discoveries at every stage of her career (Figure 1). Her work transformed our understanding of mechanisms of embryonic patterning in Drosophila and mammals, and her insights into the diverse roles of the Toll/NF-κB and Hedgehog pathways have had a broad impact on biology and medicine. As the current faculty of the Developmental Biology Program, we join together to share our thoughts on Kathryn’s remarkable career. Kathryn Virginia Anderson was born in La Jolla, California in 1952. After completing her bachelor’s degree in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, Kathryn explored various fields in biology, ultimately enrolling in a new PhD program at the University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA, she began to assemble tools to study embryonic development, a problem that would fascinate her throughout her career. As the first graduate student of Judith Lengyel, Kathryn used biochemical techniques to probe the earliest aspects of genome activity in fruit fly embryos. By measuring the rates of DNA and RNA synthesis using incorporation of radioactive thymidine and uridine, she discovered that maternal mRNAs sustain the development of the early Drosophila embryo and revealed that embryos undergo a progressive transition from maternal to zygotic gene expression (Anderson and Lengyel, 1979Anderson K.V. Lengyel J.A. Rates of synthesis of major classes of RNA in Drosophila embryos.Dev. Biol. 1979; 70: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; Anderson and Lengyel, 1980Anderson K.V. Lengyel J.A. Changing rates of histone mRNA synthesis and turnover in Drosophila embryos.Cell. 1980; 21: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This work inspired Kathryn’s appreciation for molecular approaches and provided the foundation for her future research in developmental biology. Kathryn’s training in molecular biology served her well when, as a postdoc, she set out to identify the maternally provided factors that pattern the developing embryo. Kathryn traveled to Tübingen, Germany to join another new lab, the lab of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, who had recently completed the first screens for zygotic patterning mutants in Drosophila with Eric Wieschaus. Focusing on mutations in maternally provided genes that pattern the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing embryo (Figure 2A), Kathryn demonstrated that injection of wild-type cytoplasm into dorsalized Toll mutants restores the entire dorsal-ventral axis, and moreover, that the injection site specifies the ventral-most position of the embryo (Anderson and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1984Anderson K.V. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Information for the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo is stored as maternal mRNA.Nature. 1984; 311: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar; Anderson et al., 1985Anderson K.V. Bokla L. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo: the induction of polarity by the Toll gene product.Cell. 1985; 42: 791-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). These observations provided the first clues that a maternal gene product specifies ventral identity. In her own lab at the University of California, Berkeley, Kathryn’s group cloned several components of this novel dorsal-ventral patterning pathway in a rapid and spectacular fashion, including the cell-surface receptor Toll (Hashimoto et al., 1988Hashimoto C. Hudson K.L. Anderson K.V. The Toll gene of Drosophila, required for dorsal-ventral embryonic polarity, appears to encode a transmembrane protein.Cell. 1988; 52: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), the Toll ligand Spätzle (Morisato and Anderson, 1994Morisato D. Anderson K.V. The spätzle gene encodes a component of the extracellular signaling pathway establishing the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo.Cell. 1994; 76: 677-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar; Schneider et al., 1994Schneider D.S. Jin Y. Morisato D. Anderson K.V. A processed form of the Spätzle protein defines dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.Development. 1994; 120: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the extracellular protease Easter that activates Spätzle (Chasan and Anderson, 1989Chasan R. Anderson K.V. The role of easter, an apparent serine protease, in organizing the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo.Cell. 1989; 56: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition to identifying key components of this pathway, Kathryn’s lab used elegant genetic approaches to deduce the sequence of events between Toll receptor activity at the membrane and the cellular response in the nucleus. Building on her elucidation of this novel receptor and its downstream signaling pathway, other labs showed that Toll-like receptors represent a large family of proteins with conserved functions in the innate immune system. The discovery that Toll receptors function in innate immunity—a finding recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its implications for understanding sepsis and inflammation—would not have been possible without Kathryn’s pioneering research. Spurred on by her fascination with embryonic patterning and morphogenesis, Kathryn ventured into mouse development in 1993 through a sabbatical in Rosa Beddington’s lab at Mill Hill in England. Rosa, who was renowned for her experimental prowess in the early mouse embryo, was bemused that such a highly accomplished fly geneticist wanted to come to her lab to work with mice. In the Beddington lab, Kathryn formulated an ambitious experimental strategy to carry out a genome-wide screen in the mouse for recessive lethal mutations that perturb embryonic development. While gene targeting efforts in mice at the time focused primarily on reverse genetic approaches, Kathryn’s plan to screen for recessive lethal mutations that affect embryonic development was widely considered to be impossible in a mammalian system. Yet upon returning to Berkeley, Kathryn and her graduate student Andrew Kasarskis initiated the first screens to identify genes with essential roles in early post-implantation mouse development (Kasarskis et al., 1998Kasarskis A. Manova K. Anderson K.V. A phenotype-based screen for embryonic lethal mutations in the mouse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 7485-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These studies took off when Kathryn moved to Sloan Kettering in 1996 (García-García et al., 2005García-García M.J. Eggenschwiler J.T. Caspary T. Alcorn H.L. Wyler M.R. Huangfu D. Rakeman A.S. Lee J.D. Feinberg E.H. Timmer J.R. Anderson K.V. Analysis of mouse embryonic patterning and morphogenesis by forward genetics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5913-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There, developmental biologists Liz Lacy and Lee Niswander were implementing emerging technologies for reverse genetics and high-resolution imaging of mouse cells, tissues, and embryos, part of a long line of pioneering research programs in mouse genetics at Sloan Kettering. Over more than two decades at Sloan Kettering, Kathryn’s lab screened tens of thousands of mutations and identified over 100 mutations that generate profound and specific defects in mouse development. This mutant collection has been a treasure trove for unlocking the secrets of gastrulation, axis formation, cell migration, and neural tube patterning and morphogenesis. One might think that such an immense undertaking would require an army of students and postdocs, but in fact, Kathryn maintained a moderate-sized lab. She was directly involved in experiments and could often be found dissecting embryos, peering intently through the microscope, and routinely visiting the mouse room to look after her colony. Kathryn’s unbiased ENU mutagenesis screens, coupled with her keen eye for interesting phenotypes, led to the discovery of many new genes and revolutionized our understanding of known pathways. This is perhaps best illustrated by her lab’s work on a series of mutants that affect Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), a ventralizing signal in the mammalian neural tube. Defects in SHH signaling cause striking morphological abnormalities that are readily identifiable. Consequently, many mutants identified in the screens were found to affect HH signaling. However, several mutants with classic HH pathway phenotypes did not correspond to known regulators of HH signaling. In a paradigm-shifting series of experiments, Kathryn’s lab made the surprising discovery that HH signaling requires the primary cilium, an ancient organelle that is present on most mammalian cells (Figures 2B and 2C) (Huangfu et al., 2003Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V. Hedgehog signalling in the mouse requires intraflagellar transport proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Kathryn’s lab proceeded to identify many critical regulators of ciliary biology and elucidate how they modulate HH signaling by dynamically concentrating critical positive and negative regulators within the tiny cilium structure. As the core components of the Hedgehog pathway are highly conserved from flies to mammals, it was completely unexpected that vertebrate Hedgehog signaling would require a conserved cellular organelle that is not used for Hedgehog signaling in flies. How this occurred during evolution remains a mindboggling mystery, yet the medical implications are profound as numerous diseases, including medulloblastoma and ciliopathies, are affected by HH signaling. Shortly after she arrived at Sloan Kettering, Kathryn and several other faculty members studying development in flies (Mary Baylies) and mice (Peter Besmer, Liz Lacy, and Lee Niswander) hatched the idea of launching a developmental biology program. The Sloan Kettering leadership at the time, MSKCC President Harold Varmus and SKI Director Tom Kelly, recognizing the clear overlap between genes involved in development and cancer, enthusiastically agreed with one proviso: that Kathryn agree to be the chair. It is our great fortune that Kathryn served as chair of the Developmental Biology Program for 17 years. She built a multidisciplinary and interactive department encompassing diverse topics and organisms. Kathryn recruited investigators using genetics and live imaging to study the mechanisms that build the embryo in mouse (Kat Hadjantonakis), flies (Jennifer Zallen), and worms (Zhirong Bao) and investigators using these tools to probe the mechanisms that establish the neural circuitry of the brain (Songhai Shi and Julia Kaltschmidt). Kathryn recognized early on the potential of human pluripotent stem cells, first inviting Lorenz Studer and later recruiting Danwei Huangfu and Thomas Vierbuchen, who are pioneering new approaches to study cell fate specification and model human disease. Reflecting Kathryn’s belief that developmental biology is all of biology, Kathryn also included investigators working on fundamental cellular processes in multicellular organisms, such as RNA biology (Eric Lai) and epigenetics (Mary Goll). Kathryn recruited many women to the program, unusual for biomedical fields, reflecting her long-standing commitment to gender equality in science. This, in turn, attracted talents such as Maria Jasin, renowned for her work on genomic integrity in stem cells and mice, and Alex Joyner, a pioneer in using mouse genetics to understand development and cancer. Under Kathryn’s leadership, the Developmental Biology Program has become a model of gender equality and scientific excellence, highlighting the importance of having women in leadership positions in science. Kathryn’s foresight and fearlessness are evident throughout her career, from her bold decision to train in new labs, her risky transition from the fly to the mouse, and her role as the architect of a new department. Kathryn’s exceptional achievements have been recognized by many awards, including election to the National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, the Genetics Society of America Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal, the FASEB Excellence in Science Award, and the Society for Developmental Biology Edwin G. Conklin Medal. As chair, Kathryn mentored faculty in her uniquely unpretentious style. She edited our grants and papers, delighted in our latest cool results, cheered on the successes of our students and postdocs, nudged us to consider other ways of thinking, provided invaluable advice, and conveyed not only her high expectations of us but also her confidence that we could meet them. Kathryn was a dedicated teacher of genetics and developmental biology and a devoted mentor to dozens of students and postdocs, seeding the field with her outstanding trainees, including many remarkable women. Kathryn demonstrated by example the value of an inclusive community, the importance of focusing on fundamental questions, and the joy of discovery through curiosity, careful observation, and an open mind. Her talks and papers described often astonishing findings in a clear and intellectually rigorous fashion, with overwhelming evidence, elegant logic, and a complete absence of hype. When not doing hands-on research or leading the department, Kathryn had a rich cultural life. She had a special passion for music, playing the harpsichord and piano, and she admired a wide range of artists from Philip Glass to Radiohead. She loved opera, theater, and the arts. Having spent much of her life in California, she eventually became a true New Yorker and delighted in its restaurants, culture, and people, together with her husband, Tim Bestor. Her work was truly revolutionary, and her legacy will be lasting. As our leader, colleague, and friend, she will be greatly missed.

https://openalex.org/W3135880034,"Background Food hypersensitivity (FH) has received considerable attention in the scientific community in recent years. However, little attention has been given to the efforts people make to manage their FH. We aimed to explore these efforts by using Normalization Process Theory, which is a conceptual framework formerly used to describe the self-management ‘work’ of long-term conditions. Methods We carried out qualitative individual interviews with 16 women with FH. Transcripts from recorded interviews were analyzed using template analysis. Results 16 women participated; some had diagnoses from conventional medicine (celiac disease, lactose intolerance, food allergies, irritable bowel syndrome) and some did not. Participants described carrying out several tasks, some of which were time-consuming, to manage their FH. Women who had clarified once and for all what food(s) caused symptoms, described that they could concentrate on carrying out a restricted diet, which could become routine. Conversely, participants who had not achieved such clarification described carrying out tasks to identify what food(s) caused symptoms, and to implement and evaluate a tentative diet. Participants’ descriptions also revealed a heightened vigilance when they ate food that others had prepared, and some made efforts to conceal their FH. Conclusions Self-management of FH may, like the self-management of other long-term conditions, imply a large workload and burden of treatment. Efforts made to conceal FH may be considered part of this workload, while help in clarifying which food(s) cause symptoms has the potential to reduce the workload."
