https://openalex.org/W3137409463,"How an early variant got ahead Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemiologists have monitored the evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with particular focus on the spike protein. An early variant with an aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) mutation at position 614, D614G, rapidly became dominant and is maintained in current variants of concern. Zhang et al. investigated the structural basis for the increased spread of this variant, which does so even though it binds less tightly to the host receptor (see the Perspective by Choe and Farzan). Structural and biochemical studies on a full-length G614 spike trimer showed that there are interactions not present in D614 that prevent premature loss of the S1 subunit that binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This stabilization effectively increases the number of spikes that can facilitate infection. Science , this issue p. 525 ; see also p. 466"

https://openalex.org/W3136390341,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the third outbreak this century of a zoonotic disease caused by a coronavirus, following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20031 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 20122. Treatment options for coronaviruses are limited. Here we show that clofazimine-an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile3-possesses inhibitory activity against several coronaviruses, and can antagonize the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in a range of in vitro systems. We found that this molecule, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, inhibits cell fusion mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein, as well as activity of the viral helicase. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis led to reduced viral loads in the lung and viral shedding in faeces, and also alleviated the inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinations of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract. Clofazimine, which is orally bioavailable and comparatively cheap to manufacture, is an attractive clinical candidate for the treatment of outpatients and-when combined with remdesivir-in therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in contexts in which costs are an important factor or specialized medical facilities are limited. Our data provide evidence that clofazimine may have a role in the control of the current pandemic of COVID-19 and-possibly more importantly-in dealing with coronavirus diseases that may emerge in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3137784896,"Objective To estimate the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for COVID-19 in Western Europe. Methods Data (official statistics) on the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the start of the outbreak (before any confinement rules were declared) were retrieved in the 15 largest countries in Western Europe, allowing us to estimate the exponential growth rate of the disease. The rate was then combined with estimates of the distribution of the generation interval as reconstructed from the literature. Results Despite the possible unreliability of some official statistics about COVID-19, the spread of the disease appears to be remarkably similar in most European countries, allowing us to estimate an average R 0 in Western Europe of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9–2.6). Conclusions The value of R 0 for COVID-19 in Western Europe appears to be significantly lower than that in China. The proportion of immune persons in the European population required to stop the outbreak could thus be closer to 50% than to 70%."
https://openalex.org/W3136869861,"Burying Mars' ancient water in the crust Mars once had oceans of liquid water on its surface but little of that water remains today in the planet's ice caps and atmosphere. This discrepancy is usually interpreted as loss of water to space, supported by the atmospheric deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio, but this has been difficult to reconcile with other constraints. Scheller et al. propose that water could instead have been incorporated into minerals in the planet's crust, which were later buried (see the Perspective by Kurokawa). They simulated the evolution of the D/H ratio and atmospheric loss rates for a range of plausible conditions, finding that 30 to 99% of Mars' initial water was buried in the crust.

https://openalex.org/W3137169455,"Owing to the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic worldwide, individuals experience considerable psychological distress daily. The present study aimed to clarify the prevalence of psychological distress and determine the population most affected by risk factors such as the pandemic, socioeconomic status (SES), and lifestyle-related factors causing psychological distress in the early phases of the pandemic in Japan. This study was conducted via a web-based survey using quota sampling to ensure representativeness of the Japanese population aged 20–64 years. A cross-sectional study of 11,342 participants (5,734 males and 5,608 females) was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire that included the Japanese version of the Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and questions related to the pandemic, SES, and lifestyle. The prevalence of psychological distress, represented by a K6 score of 5 or more, was 50.3% among males and 52.6% among females. Both males and females with annual household incomes less than 2 million yen and males aged in their twenties had significantly higher K6 scores than those with annual household incomes above 2 million yen and males aged over 30 years. Binary logistic regression analyses found pandemic-related factors such as medical history, inability to undergo clinical tests immediately, having trouble in daily life, unavailability of groceries, new work style, and vague anxiety; SES-related factors such as lesser income; and lifestyle-related factors such as insufficient rest, sleep, and nutritious meals to be significantly related to psychological distress. Psychological distress was more prevalent among people with low income and in younger generations than among other groups. There is an urgent need to provide financial, medical, and social support to those affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3137327477,"Importance There is a pressing need for development of novel pharmacology for the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Given increasing use of medical cannabis among US military veterans to self-treat PTSD, there is strong public interest in whether cannabis may be a safe and effective treatment for PTSD. Objective The aim of the present study was to collect preliminary data on the safety and potential efficacy of three active concentrations of smoked cannabis (i.e., High THC = approximately 12% THC and &lt; 0.05% CBD; High CBD = 11% CBD and 0.50% THC; THC+CBD = approximately 7.9% THC and 8.1% CBD, and placebo = &lt; 0.03% THC and &lt; 0.01% CBD) compared to placebo in the treatment of PTSD among military veterans. Methods The study used a double-blind, cross-over design, where participants were randomly assigned to receive three weeks of either active treatment or placebo in Stage 1 (N = 80), and then were re-randomized after a 2-week washout period to receive one of the other three active treatments in Stage 2 (N = 74). The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to end of treatment in Stage 1. Results The study did not find a significant difference in change in PTSD symptom severity between the active cannabis concentrations and placebo by the end of Stage 1. All three active concentrations of smoked cannabis were generally well tolerated. Conclusions and relevance The present study is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial of smoked cannabis for PTSD. All treatment groups, including placebo, showed good tolerability and significant improvements in PTSD symptoms during three weeks of treatment, but no active treatment statistically outperformed placebo in this brief, preliminary trial. Additional well-controlled and adequately powered studies with cannabis suitable for FDA drug development are needed to determine whether smoked cannabis improves symptoms of PTSD.

https://openalex.org/W3137614587,"Background Research surrounding COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is rapidly increasing, including the study of biomarkers for predicting outcomes. There is little data examining the correlation between serum albumin levels and COVID-19 disease severity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether admission albumin levels reliably predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 181 patients from two hospitals who had COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and radiologic imaging, who were hospitalized between March and July 2020. We recorded demographics, COVID-19 testing techniques, and day of admission labs. The outcomes recorded included the following: venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, discharge with new or higher home oxygen supplementation, readmission within 90 days, in-hospital mortality, and total adverse events. A multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis was then performed to determine significant predictors for increased adverse events in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Results A total of 109 patients (60.2%) had hypoalbuminemia (albumin level &lt; 3.3 g/dL). Patients with higher albumin levels on admission had a 72% decreased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (adjusted relative risk [RR]:0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.14–0.53, p&lt;0.001) for every 1 g/dL increase of albumin. Moreover, higher albumin levels on admission were associated with a lower risk of developing ARDS (adjusted RR:0.73, 95% CI:0.55–0.98, p = 0.033), admission to the ICU (adjusted RR:0.64, 95% CI:0.45–0.93, p = 0.019), and were less likely to be readmitted within 90 days (adjusted RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.17–0.81, p = 0.012). Furthermore, higher albumin levels were associated with fewer total adverse events (adjusted RR:0.65, 95% CI:0.52–0.80, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Admission serum albumin levels appear to be a predictive biomarker for outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We found that higher albumin levels on admission were associated with significantly fewer adverse outcomes, including less VTE events, ARDS development, ICU admissions, and readmissions within 90 days. Screening patients may lead to early identification of patients at risk for developing in-hospital complications and improve optimization and preventative efforts in this cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3136597676,"Developing an efficacious vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to stemming COVID-19 fatalities and providing the global community with immune protection. We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in designing an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers and 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC I and II alleles, respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. With our In silico test, the vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was also characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations. We, therefore, propose that potential vaccine designs consider this approach."

https://openalex.org/W3139022409,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) patients exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms are reported to have worse prognosis. Ace2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the gene encoding the host protein to which SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind, is expressed in the gut and therefore may be a target for preventing or reducing severity of COVID-19. Here we test the hypothesis that Ace2 expression in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts is modulated by the microbiome. We used quantitative PCR to profile Ace2 expression in germ-free mice, conventional raised specific pathogen-free mice, and gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota. Intestinal Ace2 expression levels were significantly higher in germ-free mice compared to conventional mice. A similar trend was observed in the respiratory tract. Intriguingly, microbiota depletion via antibiotics partially recapitulated the germ-free phenotype, suggesting potential for microbiome-mediated regulation of Ace2 expression. Variability in intestinal Ace2 expression was observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota, partially attributable to differences in microbiome-encoded proteases and peptidases. Together, these data suggest that the microbiome may be one modifiable factor determining COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3137607267,The Covid-19 pandemic has spread across the world since the beginning of 2020. Many regions have experienced its effects. The state of South Carolina in the USA has seen cases since early March 2020 and a primary peak in early April 2020. A lockdown was imposed on April 6th but lifting of restrictions started on April 24th. The daily case and death data as reported by NCHS (deaths) via the New York Times GitHUB repository have been analyzed and approaches to modeling of the data are presented. Prediction is also considered and the role of asymptomatic transmission is assessed as a latent unobserved effect. Two different time periods are examined and one step prediction is provided.
https://openalex.org/W3136275197,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global health problem. Currently, there is no effective therapeutic strategy for HCC. Methyl gallate (MG), from plant-derived phenolic gallic acid, has exhibited antitumor efficacy. However, the effect of MG on HCC is unclear. In vitro growth activity was detected by a sulforhodamine assay. A zebrafish xenotransplantation was applied to evaluate the inhibitory effect of MG. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, autophagy, and lysosome formation were detected by specific dyes. Finally, apoptosis was examined using annexin V-FITC/PI staining and western blot was performed to determine the molecular mechanism. It was demonstrated that MG treatment inhibited the proliferation of Hep3B, Mahlavu, and HepJ5 cells. Xenotransplantation also showed that MG inhibited the growth of Hep3B and HepJ5 cells. MG treatment increased cellular levels of superoxide and oxidative stress. Increases in autophagy and lysosome formation were found after MG treatment. The western blot analysis showed that MG activated cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (SDP ribose) polymerase (PARP), modulated levels of the Bcl2, Bax, and Bad ligands, and induced apoptosis. MG induced autophagy with notable activation of beclin-1, autophagy related 5+12 (ATG5+12), and conversion of light chain 3-I (LC3-I) to II. Our study showed that MG exposure inhibited HCC proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. And blocking autophagy enhanced MG-induced cytotoxicity in HCC cells. These findings suggested MG might serve as a powerful therapeutic supplement for human HCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3138119074,"Background Neonatal mortality is a public health issue in, Ethiopia. Unfortunately, the issue is noticeably under-reported and underestimated, so the true gravity of the situation cannot be acknowledged in developing regions of the country. Regrettably, there is no single study to show the rates and predictors of neonatal mortality for Afar region. Thus, this study aims to assess neonatal mortality and associated factors in Afar region, Ethiopia. Methods A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 403 neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) from January 2015 to December 2019. Maternal and neonatal medical records were reviewed and audited using structured data extraction checklist. The data was collected by four trained nurses and midwives. The medical records were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done. Adjusted odds ratio with the corresponding 95% confidence interval were used to assess the association between neonatal mortality and the associated factors. Finally, the statistical significance level was declared at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results In this study, 391 medical records of newborns were included with the data complete rate of 97.02%. The prevalence of neonatal mortality was 57 (14.6%) [95% CI 11.0%-18.4%]. A multivariable logistic regression showed that lack of antenatal care (ANC) follow up [AOR = 4.69: 95%CI (1.77, 12.47)], giving birth through cesarean section [AOR 3.59, 95%CI (1.22, 10.55)], having admission temperature less than 36.5°C [AOR 10.75, 95%CI (3.75, 30.80)], birth asphyxia [AOR 7.16, 95%CI (2.22, 23.10)], and having a length of stay greater than five days in the hospital [AOR 0.23, 95%CI (0.08, 0.66)] were significantly associated with neonatal mortality. Conclusion This study revealed that the rate of neonatal mortality is still high compared to the national data. Antenatal care, cesarean section delivery, length of stay in the hospital, low temperature at admission and birth asphyxia were factors associated with neonatal mortality. Thus, the health facilities should give due attention to improve antenatal care, intrapartum care and standardized care for admitted neonates. Furthermore, prospective studies are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3137199839,"Background As COVID-19 vaccines become available, screening individuals for prior COVID-19 infection and vaccine response in point-of-care (POC) settings has renewed interest. We prospectively screened at-risk individuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein antibodies in a POC setting to determine if it was a feasible method to identify antibody from prior infection. Methods Three EUA-approved lateral flow antibody assays were performed on POC finger-stick blood and compared with serum and a CLIA nucleocapsid antibody immunoassay. Variables including antibody class, time since PCR, and the assay antigen used were evaluated. Results 512 subjects enrolled, of which 104 had a COVID-19 history and positive PCR. Only three PCR-positive subjects required hospitalization, with one requiring mechanical ventilation. The POC results correlated well with the immunoassay (93–97% sensitivity) and using serum did not improve the sensitivity or specificity. Conclusions Finger-stick, POC COVID-19 antibody testing was highly effective in identifying antibody resulting from prior infections in mildly symptomatic subjects. Using high-complexity serum immunoassays did not improve the screening outcome. Almost all individuals with COVID-19 infection produced detectable antibodies to the virus. POC antibody testing is useful as a screen for prior COVID-19 infection, and should be useful in assessing vaccine response."
https://openalex.org/W3137727264,"Blastocystis and Clostridioides difficile co-occurrence is considered a rare event since the colonization by Blastocystis is prevented under a decrease in beneficial bacteria in the microbiota when there is C . difficile infection (CDI). This scenario has been reported once, but no information on the gut microbiota profiling is available. The present study is motivated by knowing which members of the microbiota can be found in this rare scenario and how this co-occurrence may impact the abundance of other bacteria, eukaryotes or archaea present in the gut microbiota. This study aimed to describe the bacterial and eukaryotic communities using amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S- and 18S-rRNA regions of three patient groups: (1) Blastocystis and C . difficile infection (B+/C+, n = 31), (2) C . difficile infection only (B˗/C+, n = 44), and (3) without Blastocystis or C . difficile (B˗/C˗, n = 40). Blastocystis was subtyped using amplicon-based sequencing of the 18S-rRNA gene, revealing circulation of subtypes ST1 (43.4%), ST3 (35.85%) and ST5 (20.75%) among the study population. We found that B+/C+ patients had a higher abundance of some beneficial bacteria (such as butyrate producers or bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties) compared with non- Blastocystis -colonized patients, which may suggest a shift towards an increase in beneficial bacteria when Blastocystis colonizes patients with CDI. Regarding eukaryotic communities, statistical differences in the abundance of some eukaryotic genera between the study groups were not observed. Thus, this study provides preliminary descriptive information of a potential microbiota profiling of differential presence by Blastocystis and C . difficile ."
https://openalex.org/W3136318627,"The psychological impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on cancer patients, a population at higher risk of fatal consequences if infected, has been only rarely evaluated. This study was conducted at the Departments of Oncology of four hospitals located in the Verona area in Italy to investigate the psychological consequences of the pandemic on cancer patients under active anticancer treatments. A 13-item ad hoc questionnaire to evaluate the psychological status of patients before and during the pandemic was administered to 474 consecutive subjects in the time frame between April 27 th and June 7 th 2020. Among the 13 questions, 7 were considered appropriate to elaborate an Emotional Vulnerability Index ( EVI ) that allows to separate the population in two groups (low versus high emotional vulnerability) according to observed median values. During the emergency period, the feeling of high vulnerability was found in 246 patients (53%) and was significantly associated with the following clinical variables: female gender, being under chemotherapy treatment, age ≤ 65 years. Compared to the pre-pandemic phase, the feeling of vulnerability was increased in 41 patients (9%), remained stably high in 196 (42%) and, surprisingly, was reduced in 10 patients (2%). Overall, in a population characterized by an high level of emotional vulnerability the pandemic had a marginal impact and only a small proportion of patients reported an increase of their emotional vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W3138997076,"Iran is a center of origin and diversity for walnuts ( Juglans regia L.) with very good potential for breeding purposes. The rich germplasm available, creates an opportunity for study and selection of the diverse walnut genotypes. In this study, the population structure of 104 Persian walnut accessions was assessed using AFLP markers in combination with phenotypic variability of 17 and 18 qualitative and quantitative traits respetively. The primers E-TG/M-CAG, with high values of number of polymorphic bands, polymorphic information content, marker index and Shannon’s diversity index, were the most effective in detecting genetic variation within the walnut germplasm. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated 93.98% of the genetic variability was between individuals, while 6.32% of variation was among populations. A relatively new technique, an advanced maximization strategy with a heuristic approach, was deployed to develop the core collection. Initially, three independent core collections (CC1–CC3) were created using phenotypic data and molecular markers. The three core collections (CC1–CC3) were then merged to generate a composite core collection (CC4). The mean difference percentage, variance difference percentage, variable rate of coefficient of variance percentage, coincidence rate of range percentage, Shannon’s diversity index, and Nei’s gene diversity were employed for comparative analysis. The CC4 with 46 accessions represented the complete range of phenotypic and genetic variability. This study is the first report describing development of a core collection in walnut using molecular marker data in combination with phenotypic values. The construction of core collection could facilitate the work for identification of genetic determinants of trait variability and aid effective utilization of diversity caused by outcrossing, in walnut breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3136197974,"There are currently no standard evaluation tools for poststroke neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia. We previously suggested calculating the relative movements of the hyoid bone and larynx by ultrasonography to evaluate swallowing movement. Swallowing movement is altered in neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia. Therefore, the present study aimed to verify whether an ultrasonographic evaluation of swallowing movement facilitates the detection of neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia. Eighteen healthy male elderly participants (the healthy group) and 18 male stroke patients diagnosed with neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia (the dysphagia group) were enrolled. Participants swallowed 5 mL of liquid and water with an adjusted viscosity and the movements of the hyoid bone and larynx were visualized by ultrasonography. The results obtained revealed significant differences in laryngeal duration (static phase), laryngeal displacement (elevation phase), and the hyoid bone–laryngeal motion ratio (HL motion ratio) between the two groups. A multiple regression analysis was performed to adjust for confounding factors, and laryngeal duration (static phase) and the HL motion ratios were identified as factors affecting dysphagia. In the receiver operation characteristic curve of the two variations, the area under the curve for laryngeal duration (static phase) was 0.744 and the cut-off was 0.26 sec with 72.2% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity; the area under the curve for the HL motion ratio was 0.951 and the cut-off was 0.56 with 88.9% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. Therefore, the objective evaluation of hyoid bone and larynx movements during swallowing by ultrasonography facilitated the detection of neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia."
https://openalex.org/W3138076055,"Microfluidic-based assays have become effective high-throughput approaches to examining replicative aging of budding yeast cells. Deep learning may offer an efficient way to analyze a large number of images collected from microfluidic experiments.

We found that convolutional neural networks outperformed capsule networks in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The capsule networks had the most robust performance in detecting one specific category of cell images. An ensemble of three best-fitted single-architecture models achieves the highest overall accuracy, precision, and recall due to complementary performances. In addition, extending classification classes and data augmentation of the training dataset can improve the predictions of the biological categories in our study.

https://openalex.org/W3138098027,"The COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship has provided empirical data to study the transmission potential of COVID-19 with the presence of pre/asymptomatic cases. We studied the changes in R 0 on DP from January 21 to February 19, 2020 based on chain binomial models under two scenarios: no quarantine assuming a random mixing condition, and quarantine of passengers in cabins—passengers may get infected either by an infectious case in a shared cabin or by pre/asymptomatic crew who continued to work. Estimates of R 0 at the beginning of the epidemic were 3.27 (95% CI, 3.02–3.54) and 3.78 (95% CI, 3.49–4.09) respectively for serial intervals of 5 and 6 days; and when quarantine started, with the reported asymptomatic ratio 0.505, R 0 rose to 4.18 (95%CI, 3.86–4.52) and 4.73 (95%CI, 4.37–5.12) respectively for passengers who might be exposed to the virus due to pre/asymptomatic crew. Results confirm that the higher the asymptomatic ratio is, the more infectious contacts would happen. We find evidence to support a US CDC report that “a high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew.” Our study suggests that if the asymptomatic ratio is high, the conventional quarantine procedure may not be effective to stop the spread of virus."
https://openalex.org/W3139076370,"Agricultural non-point source pollution refers that substance such as nitrogen and phosphorus cause water environment pollution through surface runoff and underground leakage in agricultural production activities. Water environment pollution related to agricultural non-point source pollution in the Huaihe River Basin is becoming more and more prominent. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the characteristic of soil nutrient in cultivated land and explore the spatial variation and influencing factors of soil nutrients at the watershed scale. A total of 239 topsoil samples were collected from the Guo river basin, and the related factors of soil organic matter (SOM), total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), total potassium (TK) and potential of hydrogen (PH) were studied by using descriptive statistics and geostatistical methods. The results showed that TK and PH were weak variation, while SOM, TC, TN and TP were medium variation. Soil pH, TP, TK, TC and SOM had moderate spatial variability, which was caused by both random factors and structural factors such as soil texture, soil type, fertilization and local ecological restoration management. Soil TN showed a strong spatial correlation, mainly due to soil texture and soil type. If the recommended fertilization amount is still given based on the average value of soil nutrients ignoring the spatial heterogeneity, it will not only affect crop production efficiency and fertilizer utilization, but may also cause greater environmental pollution. This study can provide a theoretical basis for the management of agro-ecological environments throughout the basin area."

All 401 medical professionals were surveyed using an anonymous with an investigator using the Questionnaire star APP. The participants answered 14 questions; of the 401 participants, 55.2% agreed with the statement “TCM can be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19,” 40.4% remained neutral, and 4.4% disagreed. Moreover, 75.3% agreed with the statement “There is no specific drug for COVID-19,” 67% agreed with the statement “TCM can develop immunity to COVID-19” and 62.1% agreed with “TCM can alleviate the symptoms of patients with COVID-19.” Meanwhile, 69.1% were aware that TCM has been recommended for COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Regarding the selection of sources of knowledge on whether “TCM can be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19,” There were 277, 123, 82, 369, and 17 participants selected sources from “Hospital training,” “Academic journals,” “Academic Conferences,” “Social media platforms (such as WeChat)” and “Others,” respectively. Further, 358 participants will take TCM for the prevention of COVID-19. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, major and received TCM treatment within the last five years were independent factors affecting the participants’ attitudes. In the absence of specific drugs for COVID-19, more than half of the participants agreed that TCM could be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and most participants are willing to take TCM to prevent COVID-19, although unsure about its effectiveness. The main information sources on TCM for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 were social platforms and hospital training."
https://openalex.org/W3136761769,"The purpose of this study was to explore the association between perceived social support and COPD outcomes and to determine whether the associations are mediated by depressive symptoms.Subjects with COPD who were enrolled as part of SPIROMICS were included in this analysis. Questionnaires relating to quality of life, symptom burden, and functional status were administered at annual clinic visits for over a 3 year period. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we examined the association of social support as measured by the FACIT-F with COPD outcomes. Cross sectional analyses used multivariable linear or logistic regression, adjusting for covariates. For longitudinal analyses, generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts were used. Models were adjusted with and without depressive symptoms and mediation analyses performed.Of the 1831 subjects with COPD, 1779 completed the FACIT- F questionnaire. In adjusted cross-sectional analysis without depressive symptoms, higher perceived social support was associated with better quality of life, well-being, 6 minute walk distance, and less dyspnea. When also adjusting for depressive symptoms, all associations between social support and COPD outcomes were attenuated and no longer statistically significant. Mediation analysis suggested that depressive symptoms explained the majority (> = 85%) of the association between social support and measured COPD outcomes. Results of the longitudinal analysis were consistent with the cross-sectional analyses. There was no association between social support and odds of exacerbations.Higher social support was associated with better COPD outcomes across several measures of morbidity including quality of life, respiratory symptoms, and functional status. In addition, these associations were largely attenuated when accounting for depressive symptoms suggesting that the beneficial association of social support with COPD outcomes may be largely mediated by the association between social support and depression.SPIROMICS was approved by Institutional Review Boards at each center and all participants provided written informed consent (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01969344)."

We aimed to replicate this finding by using the well-validated heartbeat discrimination task and to compare the biofeedback with a deep breathing and a control condition (viewing a film clip). The trial was preregistered at open science framework (https://osf.io/9fxn6). Overall, 93 participants were randomized to one of the three conditions and the heartbeat discrimination task was presented prior and after the 20-minutes training sessions. The study had a power of .86 to detect a medium-sized effect in the biofeedback group and a power of .96 to detect a medium-sized interaction of intervention group and time. A general tendency for improvement in heartbeat detection accuracy was found across intervention groups (d = 0.19, p = .08); however, groups did not differ significantly. In particular, there was no significant interaction of intervention group and time (f = .00, p = .98) and no reliable effect for the biofeedback group (d = 0.15, p = .42). One limitation is that a different, but well-validated task was used to quantify interoceptive accuracy. This study suggests that biofeedback might not improve interoceptive accuracy in the cardiac domain, but effects seem to depend on the specific task applied."
https://openalex.org/W3137128738,"Proper development of the maize kernel is of great significance for high and stable maize yield to ensure national food security. Gibberellin (GA), one of the hormones regulating plant growth, is involved in modulating the development of maize kernels. Cellulose, one of the main components of plant cells, is also regulated by gibberellin. The mechanism of hormone regulation during maize grain development is highly complicated, and reports on GA-mediated modulation of cellulose synthesis during maize grain development are rare. Our study revealed that during grain growth and development, the grain length and bulk density of GA-treated corn kernels improved significantly, and the cellulose content of grains increased, while seed coat thickness decreased. The transcription factor basic region/leucine zipper motif 53 ( bZIP53) , which is strongly correlated with cellulose synthase gene 1 ( CesA1) expression, was screened by transcriptome sequencing and the expression of the cellulose synthase gene in maize grain development after GA treatment was determined. It was found that bZIP53 expression significantly promoted the expression of CesA1 . Further, analysis of the transcription factor bZIP53 determined that the gene-encoded protein was localized in the cell and nuclear membranes, but the transcription factor bZIP53 itself showed no transcriptional activation. Further studies are required to explore the interaction of bZIP53 with CesA1 ."
https://openalex.org/W3137426107,"The kinetic boundary condition (KBC) represents the evaporation or condensation of molecules at the vapor-liquid interface for molecular gas dynamics (MGD). When constructing the KBC, it is necessary to classify molecular motions into evaporation, condensation, and reflection in molecular-scale simulation methods. Recently, a method that involves setting the vapor boundary and liquid boundary has been used for classifying molecules. The position of the vapor boundary is related to the position where the KBC is applied in MGD analyses, whereas that of the liquid boundary has not been uniquely determined. Therefore, in this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to discuss the position of the liquid boundary for the construction of KBCs. We obtained some variables that characterize molecular motions such as the positions that the molecules reached and the time they stayed in the vicinity of the interface. Based on the characteristics of the molecules found from these variables, we investigated the valid position of the liquid boundary. We also conducted an investigation on the relationship between the condensation coefficient and the molecular incident velocity from the vapor phase to the liquid phase. The dependence of the condensation coefficient on the incident velocity of molecules was confirmed, and the value of the condensation coefficient becomes small in the low-incident-velocity range. Furthermore, we found that the condensation coefficient in the non-equilibrium state shows almost the same value as that in the equilibrium state, although the corresponding velocity distribution functions of the incident velocity significantly differ from each other."
https://openalex.org/W3137644064,"Nidoviruses and arenaviruses are the only known RNA viruses encoding a 3’-5’ exonuclease domain (ExoN). The proofreading activity of the ExoN domain has played a key role in the growth of nidoviral genomes, while in arenaviruses this domain partakes in the suppression of the host innate immune signaling. Sequence and structural homology analyses suggest that these proteins have been hijacked from cellular hosts many times. Analysis of the available nidoviral ExoN sequences reveals a high conservation level comparable to that of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), which are the most conserved viral proteins. Two highly preserved zinc fingers are present in all nidoviral exonucleases, while in the arenaviral protein only one zinc finger can be identified. This is in sharp contrast with the reported lack of zinc fingers in cellular ExoNs, and opens the possibility of therapeutic strategies in the struggle against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3137691882,"Adults under time pressure share with others generously, but with more time they act more selfishly. In the current study, we investigated whether young children already operate in this same way, and, if so, whether this changes over the preschool and early school age years. We tested 144 children in three age groups (3-, 5-, and 7-year olds) in a one-shot dictator game: Children were given nine stickers and had the possibility to share stickers with another child who was absent. Children in the Time Pressure condition were instructed to share quickly, whereas children in the Delay condition were instructed to take time and consider their decision carefully. Across ages, children in the Time Pressure condition shared significantly more stickers than children in the Delay condition. Moreover, the longer children waited, the less they shared. Thus, children, like adults, are more prosocial when acting spontaneously than after considering their decision more carefully."

Understanding late Quaternary paleoclimatic change in this vulnerable region is hampered by a lack of available, reliably-dated records. Here we present a sequence from a well-stratified sedimentary infill occupying a lower slope basin which covers 17,060 to 13,400 cal yr BP with the aim to reconstruct paleoclimatic variability in the high Drakensberg during the Late Glacial. We use a combination of pollen, total organic carbon and nitrogen, δ 13 C, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectral and elemental data on contiguous samples with high temporal resolution (10 to 80 years per sample). Our data support a relatively humid environment with considerable cold season precipitation during what might have been the final stage of niche-glaciation on the adjoining southern aspects around 17,000 cal yr BP. Then, after an initial warmer and drier period starting ~15,600 cal yr BP, we identify a return to colder and drier conditions with more winter precipitation starting ~14,380 cal yr BP, which represents the first local evidence for the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) in this region. On decadal to centennial timescales, the Late Glacial period was one marked by considerable climatic fluctuation and bi-directional environmental change, which has not been identified in previous studies for this region. Our study shows complex changes in both moisture and thermal conditions providing a more nuanced picture of the Late Glacial for the high Drakensburg."
https://openalex.org/W3136335418,"There is an urgent need for reliable region-specific hematological reference values for clinical monitoring. Laboratory reference ranges are important for assessing study participant eligibility, toxicity grading and management of adverse events in clinical trials and clinical diagnosis. Most clinical laboratories in Kenya rely on hematological reference values provided by instrument manufacturers and/or textbooks, which are based on population from Europe or North America. The use of such values in medical practice could result in improper patient management, selection bias in selection of appropriate participants for clinical trials and flawed classification of the clinical adverse events when applied to African populations. The aim of this study was to establish local laboratory hematological reference values in infants aged 1 month to 17 months from Kombewa Sub-county that could be true representative of the existing rural population. The study participants in the current study were those who had previously been recruited from GSK-sponsored study. This study was a phase III, Double Blind, Randomized, GSK-sponsored, Malaria Vaccine Clinical Trial that was conducted in infants aged 1month to 17months. 1,509 participants were included in the study analysis. Data were partitioned into 3 different age groups (1–6 months[m], 6–12 m and 12–17 m) and differences between gender were compared within each group. Data were analyzed using Graphpad prism V5 to generate 95% reference ranges (2.5 th -97.5 th percentile). There was evidence of gender differences in hemoglobin values (p = 0.0189) and platelet counts (p = 0.0005) in the 1 to 6m group. For the 12-17m group, there were differences in MCV (p&lt;0.0001 ) and MCH (p = 0.0003). Comparing gender differences for all age groups, differences were noted in percent lymphocytes (p = 0.0396), percent monocytes (p = 0.0479), percent granulocytes (p = 0.0044), hemoglobin (p = 0.0204), hematocrit (p = 0.0448), MCV (p = 0.0092), MCH (p = 0.0089), MCHC (p = 0.0336) and absolute granulocytes (p = 0.0237). In 1 to 6m age group and all age groups assessed, for WBCs, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV and lymphocytes absolute counts, both 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles for Kisumu infants were higher than those from Kilifi. Platelet ranges for Kisumu children were narrower compared to Kilifi ranges. Kisumu hematology reference ranges were observed to be higher than the ranges of Tanzanian children for the WBCs, absolute lymphocyte and monocyte counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit and MCV. Higher ranges of WBCs, absolute lymphocyte and monocyte counts were observed compared to the values in US/Europe. Wider ranges were observed in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCV. Wider ranges were observed in platelet counts in Kisumu infants compared to the US/Europe ranges. Compared to Harriet Lane Handbook reference values that are used in the area, higher counts were observed in WBC counts, both absolute and percent lymphocyte counts, as well as monocyte counts for current study. Wider ranges were observed in RBC, platelets and RDW, while lower ranges noted in the current study for hemoglobin, hematocrit and granulocyte counts. This study underscores the importance of using locally established hematology reference ranges of different age groups in support of proper patient management and for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3138164732,"“ Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” ( C Las) and Spiroplasma citri are phloem-limited bacteria that infect citrus and are transmitted by insect vectors. S . citri causes citrus stubborn disease (CSD) and is vectored by the beet leafhopper in California. C Las is associated with the devastating citrus disease, Huanglongbing (HLB), and is vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid. C Las is a regulatory pathogen spreading in citrus on residential properties in southern California and is an imminent threat to spread to commercial citrus plantings. CSD is endemic in California and has symptoms in citrus that can be easily confused with HLB. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a multiplex qPCR and duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay for simultaneous detection of C Las and S . citri to be used where both pathogens can co-exist. The multiplex qPCR assay was designed to detect multicopy genes of C Las—RNR (5 copies) and S . citri –SPV1 ORF1 (13 copies), respectively, and citrus cytochrome oxidase (COX) as internal positive control. Absolute quantitation of these pathogens was achieved by duplex ddPCR as a supplement for marginal qPCR results. Duplex ddPCR allowed higher sensitivity than qPCR for detection of C Las and S . citri . ddPCR showed higher tolerance to inhibitors and yielded highly reproducible results. The multiplex qPCR assay has the benefit of testing both pathogens at reduced cost and can serve to augment the official regulatory protocol for C Las detection in California. Moreover, the ddPCR provided unambiguous absolute detection of C Las and S . citri at very low concentrations without any standards for pathogen titer."
https://openalex.org/W3138455022,"Introduction Orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) is a dosage form that overcomes the problem of swallowing which is prevalent in about 35% of the general population. Co-trimoxazole (CTX) is given for patients with HIV for the prophylaxis of opportunistic infection (OI), commonly for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. It was reported that CTX was associated with a 25–46% reduction in mortality among individuals infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Esophageal candidiasis which usually comes along with HIV/AIDS is one of AIDS defining illness affecting up to 1 in 5 of people with AIDS. This opportunistic illness is manifested by painful or difficulty of swallowing. In this respect, CTX ODT offer the advantages of both liquid dosage forms in terms of easy swallowing thereby improve patient compliance and solid dosage forms in terms of dose uniformity, stability, lower production, and transportation costs. The objective of this study was to formulate, characterize and optimize CTX ODT which could overcome swallowing problem and improve patient compliance. Co-trimoxazole ODTs were prepared by direct compression technique using a semi synthetic super disintegrant (crospovidone) along with other excipients. Two taste masking techniques were employed, addition of sweetening agent, and solid dispersion by using a pH sensitive polymer, Eudragit E-100 at different ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3). Taste masking was determined by comparing taste threshold value and in vitro drug release. Preliminary study was used to investigate the effect of crospovidone, compression force (CF) and Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) on disintegration time, friability and wetting time (WT). Factorial design was used as it enables simultaneous evaluation of formulation variables and their interaction effect. From the preliminary study, the factors that were found significant were further optimized using central composite design. Design-Expert 8.0.7.1 software was employed to carry out the experimental design. The bitterness threshold concentration of Trimethoprim was found to be 150 μg/ml and the in vitro drug release of the three batches of drug to polymer ratio (F1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) was 2.80±0.05, 2.77±0.00 and 2.63±0.00 respectively. From the optimization study, the optimal concentration for the superdisintegrant was 8.60% w/w and a CF of 11.25 KN which gave a rapid disintegration and WT of 13.79 and 23.19 seconds respectively and a friability of 0.666%. Conclusion In this study, co-trimoxazole ODT was formulated successfully. Central composite design was effectively used to model and optimize friability, DT and WT. The method was found effective for estimating the effect of independent variables on the dependent variables by using polynomial equation and surface plots. Optimization of the response variables was possible by using both numerical and graphical optimization and the predicted optimal conditions were confirmed experimentally and were found to be in good agreement within 5% of the predicted responses. The results of the study showed that CTX ODT had significantly rapid disintegration, less than 1% friability and enhanced dissolution profiles. The successful formulation of CTX ODT can solve difficulty of swallowing of conventional tablets for some group of patients which are unable to swallow solid oral dosage form."
https://openalex.org/W3136090655,"Objective Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), one of the main public health concerns in mainland China, is a group of clinically similar diseases caused by hantaviruses. Statistical approaches have always been leveraged to forecast the future incidence rates of certain infectious diseases to effectively control their prevalence and outbreak potential. Compared to the use of one base model, model stacking can often produce better forecasting results. In this study, we fitted the monthly reported cases of HFRS in mainland China with a model stacking approach and compared its forecasting performance with those of five base models. Method We fitted the monthly reported cases of HFRS ranging from January 2004 to June 2019 in mainland China with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model; the Holt-Winter (HW) method, seasonal decomposition of the time series by LOESS (STL); a neural network autoregressive (NNAR) model; and an exponential smoothing state space model with a Box-Cox transformation; ARMA errors; and trend and seasonal components (TBATS), and we combined the forecasting results with the inverse rank approach. The forecasting performance was estimated based on several accuracy criteria for model prediction, including the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Result There was a slight downward trend and obvious seasonal periodicity inherent in the time series data for HFRS in mainland China. The model stacking method was selected as the best approach with the best performance in terms of both fitting (RMSE 128.19, MAE 85.63, MAPE 8.18) and prediction (RMSE 151.86, MAE 118.28, MAPE 13.16). Conclusion The results showed that model stacking by using the optimal mean forecasting weight of the five abovementioned models achieved the best performance in terms of predicting HFRS one year into the future. This study has corroborated the conclusion that model stacking is an easy way to enhance prediction accuracy when modeling HFRS."

Herein, GC-MS, headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were used to analyze the nonpolar organic components, volatile organic components, and sample similarities among different musks, respectively. Abundant steroid hormones and proteins were also found in the musk. The steroid hormone concentrations were detected using a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Proteins in the samples were hydrolyzed and the amino acids concentrations were detected. The steroid hormone and amino acid concentrations in white musk were significantly lower than in normal and black musks (p&lt;0.05). The components were subjected to NMDS analysis to understand the differences in components among different types of musk, with the results suggesting that white musk was different from normal and black musks."

Chi-square and t-tests were performed to compare those who did and did not endorse cancer diagnosis.Analysis of data from 1485 adults pursuing medical Cannabis certification, including 72 (4.8%) reporting a cancer diagnosis, indicated that those with cancer were older [mean age 53.4 years (SD = 10.5) vs. 44.7 years (SD = 13.0); p<0.001] than those without cancer. They also differed regarding employment status (p<0.001; working: 20.8% vs. 46.2%; disabled: 44.4% vs. 26.5% for those with vs. those without cancer, respectively). Those with cancer used less Cannabis (p = 0.033 for quantity used) and used Cannabis less often (p = 0.032 for frequency of use); they less frequently endorsed smoking Cannabis (80% vs 91%; p = 0.015). There was a non-significant trend to increased edible use in those with cancer (57% vs. 44%; p = 0.052).Patients with cancer who are seeking medical Cannabis are different from those seeking medical Cannabis without cancer, and they report using Cannabis differently.

Methods Transitional analysis of latent classes was used to analyze two cross-sections of the external evaluation of the PMAQ-AB (Cycle I: 2011–2012 and Cycle II: 2013–2014), identifying completeness classes for a structure and work process related to oral health. Consider three indicators of structure (presence of a dental surgeon, existence of a dental office and operating at minimum hours) and five of the work process (scheduling every day of the week, home visits, basic dental procedures, scheduling for spontaneous demand and continuation of treatment). Choropleth maps and hotspots were made. Results The proportion of elements that had one or more dentist (CD), dental office and operated at minimum hours varied from 65.56% to 67.13 between the two cycles of the PMAQ-AB. The number of teams that made appointments every day of the week increased 8.7% and those that made home visits varied from 44.51% to 52.88%. The reduction in the number of teams that reported guaranteeing the agenda for accommodating spontaneous demand, varying from 62.41% to 60.11% and in the continuity of treatment, varying from 63.41% to 61.11%. For the structure of health requirements, the predominant completeness profile was ""Best completeness"" in both cycles, comprising 71.0% of the sets at time 1 and 67.0% at time 2. The proportion of teams with ""Best completeness"" increased by 89.1%, the one with ""Worst completeness"" increased by 20%, while those with ""Average completeness"" decreased by 66.3%. Conclusion We identified positive changes in the indicators of potential access to oral health services, expanding the users’ ability to use them. However, some access attributes remain unsatisfactory, with organizational barriers persisting."

Aim This study sought to determine the population structure of clinical MTBC isolates from the Volta Region of Ghana. Methods The MTBC isolates obtained from collected sputum samples were identified by PCR detecting of IS6110 and genotyped using spoligotyping. Non-tuberculous mycobacterial isolates were characterized by amplification of the heat shock protein 65 ( hsp65 ) gene and sequencing. The drug susceptibility profiles of the MTBCs determined using GenoType MTBDRplus. Results One hundred and seventeen (117, 93.6%) out of 125 mycobacterial positive isolates were characterized as members of the MTBC of which M . tuberculosis sensu stricto (MTBss) and M . africanum (MAF) were respectively 94 (80.3%) and 23 (19.7%). In all, 39 distinct spoligotype patterns were obtained; 26 for MTBss and 13 for MAF lineages. Spoligotyping identified 89 (76%) Lineage 4, 16 (13.6%) Lineage 5, 7 (6.0%) Lineage 6, 3 (2.6%) Lineage 2, 1(0.9%) Lineage 3 and 1 (0.9%) Lineage 1. Among the Lineage 4 isolates, 62/89 (69.7%) belonged to Cameroon sub-lineage, 13 (14.7%) Ghana, 8 (9.0%) Haarlem, 2 (2.2%) LAM, 1 (1.1%) Uganda I, 1 (1.1%) X and the remaining two (2.2%) were orphan. Significant localization of MAF was found within the Ho municipality (n = 13, 29.5%) compared to the more cosmopolitan Ketu-South/Aflao (n = 3, 8.3%) (p-value = 0.017). Eight (8) non-tuberculous mycobacteria were characterized as M . abscessus (7) and M . fortuitum (1). Conclusion We confirmed the importance of M . africanum lineages as a cause of TB in the Volta region of Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3137148407,"The TB Portals program provides a publicly accessible repository of TB case data containing multi-modal information such as case clinical characteristics, pathogen genomics, and radiomics. The real-world resource contains over 3400 TB cases, primarily drug resistant cases, and CT images with radiologist annotations are available for many of these cases. The breadth of data collected offers a patient-centric view into the etiology of the disease including the temporal context of the available imaging information. Here, we analyze a cohort of new TB cases with available radiologist observations of CTs taken around the time of initial registration of the case into the database and with available follow up to treatment outcome of cured or died. Follow up ranged from 5 weeks to a little over 2 years consistent with the longest treatment regimens for drug resistant TB and cases were registered within the years 2008 to 2019. The radiologist observations were incorporated into machine learning pipelines to test various class balancing strategies on the performance of predictive models. The modeling results support that the radiologist observations are predictive of treatment outcome. Moreover, inferential statistical analysis identifies markers of TB disease spread as having an association with poor treatment outcome including presence of radiologist observations in both lungs, swollen lymph nodes, multiple cavities, and large cavities. While the initial results are promising, further data collection is needed to incorporate methods to mitigate potential confounding such as including additional model covariates or matching cohorts on covariates of interest (e.g. demographics, BMI, comorbidity, TB subtype, etc.). Nonetheless, the preliminary results highlight the utility of the resource for hypothesis generation and exploration of potential biomarkers of TB disease severity and support these additional data collection efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3137196486,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have poor sleep quality, longer time to sleep onset and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Poor sleep quality in COPD is associated with poor quality of life (QoL), increased exacerbations and increased mortality. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves functional status and QoL in COPD but effects on sleep are unclear. PR improves subjective sleep quality but there is paucity of objective actigraphy data. We hypothesized that actigraphy would demonstrate subjective and objective improvement in sleep following PR. Paired comparisons (t-test or Wilcoxon-signed-rank test) were performed before and after PR data on all variables.This retrospective study of COPD patients undergoing PR utilized actigraphy watch recordings before and after 8-weeks of PR to assess changes in sleep variables including total time in bed (TBT), total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) and total nocturnal awakenings. A change in Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was a secondary outcome. PSQI was performed before and after PR.Sixty-nine patients were included in the final analysis. Most participants were male (97%), non-obese (median BMI 27.5, IQR 24.3 to 32.4 kg/m2) with an average age of 69 ± 8 years and 71% had severe COPD (GOLD stage 3 or 4). Prevalence of poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥5) was 86%. Paired comparisons did not show improvement in actigraphic sleep parameters following 8-weeks PR despite improvements in 6-min-walk distance (6MWD, mean improvement 54 m, 95% CI 34 m to 74 m, p<0.0001) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores (SGRQ, mean improvement 7.7 points, 95% CI 5.2 to 10.2, p<0.0001). Stratified analysis of all sleep variables by severity of COPD, BMI, mood, mental status, 6-MWD and SGRQ did not show significant improvement after PR. In Veterans with poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 5), PR improved subjective sleep quality (PSQI, mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.40, p = 0.03).Pulmonary rehabilitation improved subjective sleep quality in Veterans who had poor sleep quality at the beginning of the PR but did not improve objective sleep parameters by actigraphy.

In general elections (in 2012 and 2016) for federal offices and the governorship and in primaries (in 2000, 2002, and 2004), evidence of primacy effects appeared in 86% of the 84 tests, including the 2016 presidential race, when Donald Trump gained 1.7 percentage points from first listing, and Hillary Clinton gained 1.5 percentage points. Consistent with theoretical predictions, primacy effects were larger in primaries and for major-party candidates in general elections than for non-major-party candidates in general elections, more pronounced in less publicized contests, and stronger in contests without an incumbent running. All of this constitutes evidence of the reliability and generalizability of evidence on candidate name order effects and their moderators."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of macaíba palm seed kernel on anxiety, memory, and oxidative stress in the brain of health and dyslipidemic rats. Forty rats were used, divided into 4 groups (n = 10 each): control (CONT), dyslipidemic (DG), kernel (KG), and Dyslipidemic kernel (DKG). Dyslipidemia was induced using a high fat emulsion for 14 days before treatment. KG and DKG received 1000 mg/kg of macaíba palm seed kernel per gavage for 28 days. After treatment, anxiety tests were carried out using the Open Field Test (OFT), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and the Object Recognition Test (ORT) to assess memory. In the animals’ brain tissue, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and total glutathione (GSH) were quantified to determine oxidative stress. The data were treated with Two Way ANOVA followed by Tukey (p &lt;0.05). Results demonstrated that the animals treated with kernel realized more rearing. DG and KG groomed less compared with CONT and DKG compared with all groups in OFT. KG spent more time in aversive open arms compared with CONT and DKG compared with all groups in EPM. Only DKG spent more time in the central area in EMP. KG and DKG showed a reduction in the exploration rate and MDA values (p &lt;0.05).

https://openalex.org/W3136981135,"Sequential movements are often grouped into several chunks, as evidenced by the modulation of the timing of each elemental movement. Even during synchronized tapping with a metronome, we sometimes feel subjective accent for every few taps. To examine whether motor segmentation emerges during synchronized movements, we trained monkeys to generate a series of predictive saccades synchronized with visual stimuli which sequentially appeared for a fixed interval (400 or 600 ms) at six circularly arranged landmark locations. We found two types of motor segmentations that featured periodic modulation of saccade timing. First, the intersaccadic interval (ISI) depended on the target location and saccade direction, indicating that particular combinations of saccades were integrated into motor chunks. Second, when a task-irrelevant rectangular contour surrounding three landmarks (""inducer"") was presented, the ISI significantly modulated depending on the relative target location to the inducer. All patterns of individual differences seen in monkeys were also observed in humans. Importantly, the effects of the inducer greatly decreased or disappeared when the animals were trained to generate only reactive saccades (latency >100 ms), indicating that the motor segmentation may depend on the internal rhythms. Thus, our results demonstrate two types of motor segmentation during synchronized movements: one is related to the hierarchical organization of sequential movements and the other is related to the spontaneous grouping of rhythmic events. This experimental paradigm can be used to investigate the underlying neural mechanism of temporal grouping during rhythm production."

School counselors completed a battery of three competency-based assessments to assess their levels of gender identity counselor competence, intersex counselor competence, and school counselor gender minority advocacy competence. They also completed a demographic form so that competency levels could be examined with demographic variables. Attitudes, school level placement, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity counselor competence, and intersex counselor competence were significantly related to advocacy for and with gender minority students. These findings have implications for the application of identity behavior theory to examine the experiences and behaviors of minoritized individuals and those who advocate for them. These advocates include school counselors and other helping professionals who work with gender minority students."

Methods Retrospective analysis of 14 eyes who underwent peeling surgery for idiopathic, symptomatic and progressive epiretinal membrane. The technique measures the shift in position of vascular crossings after surgery from a fixed point, which is the retinal pigmented epithelium. This shift is defined as the relaxation index (RI) and represents a measure of the postoperative movement of the retina due to released traction after surgery. Results Best-corrected visual acuity was significantly better than baseline at all follow ups while the RI had its maximum value at baseline. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between best-corrected visual acuity at 6 months and RI at baseline. Conclusion While all previous published methods focused on bi-dimensional changes observed in a small region, this study introduces a three-dimensional assessment of tractional forces. Future integration of RI into built-in processing software will allow systematic three-dimensional measurement of intraretinal traction."

This paper investigates whether the higher transplantation rates in opt-out systems translate into equally lower death rates among organ patients registered on a waiting list (i.e., organ-patient mortality rates). We show that the difference between consent systems regarding kidney- and liver-patient mortality rates is significantly smaller than the difference in deceased-donor transplantation rates. This is likely due to different incentives between the consent systems. We find empirical evidence that opt-out systems reduce incentives for living donations, which explains our findings for kidneys. The results imply that focusing on deceased-donor transplantation rates alone paints an incomplete picture of opt-out systems’ benefits, and that there are important differences between organs in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W3137420406,"In translational obesity research, objective assessment of adipocyte sizes and numbers is essential to characterize histomorphological alterations linked to obesity, and to evaluate the efficacies of experimental medicinal or dietetic interventions. Design-based quantitative stereological techniques based on the analysis of 2D-histological sections provide unbiased estimates of relevant 3D-parameters of adipocyte morphology, but often involve complex and time-consuming tissue processing and analysis steps. Here we report the application of direct 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) for effective and accurate analysis of adipocyte volumes and numbers in optically cleared adipose tissue samples from a porcine model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples from DIO-minipigs and lean controls were systematically randomly sampled, optically cleared with 3DISCO (3-dimensional imaging of solvent cleared organs), stained with eosin, and subjected to LSFM for detection of adipocyte cell membrane autofluorescence. Individual adipocytes were unbiasedly sampled in digital 3D reconstructions of the adipose tissue samples, and their individual cell volumes were directly measured by automated digital image analysis. Adipocyte numbers and mean volumes obtained by LSFM analysis did not significantly differ from the corresponding values obtained by unbiased quantitative stereological analysis techniques performed on the same samples, thus proving the applicability of LSFM for efficient analysis of relevant morphological adipocyte parameters. The results of the present study demonstrate an adipose tissue depot specific plasticity of adipocyte growth responses to nutrient oversupply. This was characterized by an exclusively hypertrophic growth of visceral adipocytes, whereas adipocytes in subcutaneous fat tissue depots also displayed a marked (hyperplastic) increase in cell number. LSFM allows for accurate and efficient determination of relevant quantitative morphological adipocyte parameters. The applied stereological methods and LSFM protocols are described in detail and can serve as a guideline for unbiased quantitative morphological analyses of adipocytes in other studies and species."
https://openalex.org/W3138009342,"It is known that virtually all inequality measures imply the existence of a ‘benchmark income’, above which adding incremental income increases inequality, and below which it decreases inequality. Benchmark incomes can be interpreted as social reference levels that identify the richest individual for whom it would be just to subsidize their income. Despite the intuitive appeal of benchmark incomes, there have been hardly any empirical applications to date. This paper provides the first estimates of benchmark incomes for a range of contrasting countries and different inequality measures. All benchmark incomes lie far above official national poverty lines. The results suggest that economic growth together with falling inequality need not necessarily be poverty reducing."
https://openalex.org/W3135957552,"Background On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew struck southwest Haiti as a category 4 storm. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of the hurricane on tuberculosis (TB) services and patient outcomes in the three severely affected departments–Sud, Grand’Anse, and Nippes–of southwest Haiti. Methods We developed a standard questionnaire to assess a convenience sample of health facilities in the affected areas, a patient tracking form, and a line list for tracking all patients with drug-susceptible TB registered in care six months before the hurricane. We analyzed data from the national TB electronic surveillance system to determine outcomes for all patients receiving anti-TB treatment in the affected areas. We used logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with treatment success. Results Of the 66 health facilities in the three affected departments, we assessed 31, accounting for 536 (45.7%) of 1,174 TB patients registered in care when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in Haiti. Three (9.7%) health facilities sustained moderate to severe damage, whereas 18 (58.1%) were closed for &lt;1 week, and five (16.1%) for ≥1 week. Four weeks after the hurricane, 398 (73.1%) of the 536 patients in the assessed facilities were located. Treatment success in the affected departments one year after the hurricane was 81.4%. Receiving care outside the municipality of residence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27–0.80) and HIV positivity (aOR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.19–0.51) or unknown HIV status (aOR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.33–0.74) were associated with significantly lower rates of treatment success. Conclusions Despite major challenges, a high percentage of patients receiving anti-TB treatment before the hurricane were located and successfully treated in southwest Haiti. The lessons learned and results presented here may help inform policies and guidelines in similar settings for effective TB control after a natural disaster."
