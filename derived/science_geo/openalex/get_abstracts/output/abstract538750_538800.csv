https://openalex.org/W1161474730,"Cognitive scientists have long been interested in the role that eye gaze plays in social interactions. Previous research suggests that gaze acts as a signaling mechanism and can be used to control turn-taking behaviour. However, early research on this topic employed methods of analysis that aggregated gaze information across an entire trial (or trials), which masks any temporal dynamics that may exist in social interactions. More recently, attempts have been made to understand the temporal characteristics of social gaze but little research has been conducted in a natural setting with two interacting participants. The present study combines a temporally sensitive analysis technique with modern eye tracking technology to 1) validate the overall results from earlier aggregated analyses and 2) provide insight into the specific moment-to-moment temporal characteristics of turn-taking behaviour in a natural setting. Dyads played two social guessing games (20 Questions and Heads Up) while their eyes were tracked. Our general results are in line with past aggregated data, and using cross-correlational analysis on the specific gaze and speech signals of both participants we found that 1) speakers end their turn with direct gaze at the listener and 2) the listener in turn begins to speak with averted gaze. Convergent with theoretical models of social interaction, our data suggest that eye gaze can be used to signal both the end and the beginning of a speaking turn during a social interaction. The present study offers insight into the temporal dynamics of live dyadic interactions and also provides a new method of analysis for eye gaze data when temporal relationships are of interest."
https://openalex.org/W1774995177,"Neuropathic pain from injury to the peripheral and CNS represents a major health care issue. We have investigated the role of IL-33/IL-33 receptor (ST2) signaling in experimental models of neuropathic pain in mice. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve induced IL-33 production in the spinal cord. IL-33/citrine reporter mice revealed that oligodendrocytes are the main cells expressing IL-33 within the spinal cord together with a minor expression by neurons, microglia. and astrocytes. CCI-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was reduced in IL-33R (ST2)(-/ -) mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Intrathecal treatment of WT mice with soluble IL-33 receptor (IL-33 decoy receptor) markedly reduced CCI-induced hyperalgesia. Consistent with these observations, intrathecal injection of IL-33 enhanced CCI hyperalgesia and induced hyperalgesia in naive mice. IL-33-mediated hyperalgesia during CCI was dependent on a reciprocal relationship with TNF-α and IL-1β. IL-33-induced hyperalgesia was markedly attenuated by inhibitors of PI3K, mammalian target of rapamycin, MAPKs (p38, ERK, and JNK), NF-κB, and also by the inhibitors of glial cells (microglia and astrocytes). Furthermore, targeting these signaling pathways and cells inhibited IL-33-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production in the spinal cord. Our study, therefore, reveals an important role of oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 in neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W1933593286,"Viruses are integral members of the human microbiome. Many of the viruses comprising the human virome have been identified as bacteriophage, and little is known about how they respond to perturbations within the human ecosystem. The intimate association of phage with their cellular hosts suggests their communities may change in response to shifts in bacterial community membership. Alterations to human bacterial biota can result in human disease including a reduction in the host's resilience to pathogens. Here we report the ecology of oral and fecal viral communities and their responses to long-term antibiotic therapy in a cohort of human subjects. We found significant differences between the viral communities of each body site with a more heterogeneous fecal virus community compared with viruses in saliva. We measured the relative diversity of viruses, and found that the oral viromes were significantly more diverse than fecal viromes. There were characteristic changes in the membership of oral and fecal bacterial communities in response to antibiotics, but changes in fecal viral communities were less distinguishing. In the oral cavity, an abundance of papillomaviruses found in subjects on antibiotics suggests an association between antibiotics and papillomavirus production. Despite the abundance of papillomaviruses identified, in neither the oral nor the fecal viromes did antibiotic therapy have any significant impact upon overall viral diversity. There was, however, an apparent expansion of the reservoir of genes putatively involved in resistance to numerous classes of antibiotics in fecal viromes that was not paralleled in oral viromes. The emergence of antibiotic resistance in fecal viromes in response to long-term antibiotic therapy in humans suggests that viruses play an important role in the resilience of human microbial communities to antibiotic disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W1894822386,"Pain is an important and distressing symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our aim was to determine the prevalence of pain, its various types and characteristics, as well as its impact on depression and quality of life (QoL) in patients with PD. How pain differs in early- and advanced-stage PD and male and female PD patients was of special interest. One hundred PD patients on dopaminergic medications had a neurological examination and participated in a structured interview on pain characteristics and completed standardized questionnaires. A total of 76% of the patients had pain. The following types of pain were present: musculoskeletal pain accounted for 41% of the total pain, dystonic pain for 17%, central neuropathic pain for 22%, radicular pain for 27%, and other pains (non-radicular low back pain, arthritic, and visceral pain) made up 24%. One type of pain affected 29% of all the subjects, two types 35%, three types 10%, and four types of pain were reported by 2%. All types of pain were more prevalent in advanced-stage PD subjects than in early-stage PD subjects, except for arthritic pain (subclassified under”other pain”). The frequency and intensity of actual, average, and worst experienced pain were significantly more severe in advanced-stage subjects. PD subjects with general pain and in advanced stages were more depressed and had poorer QoL. Depression correlated with worst pain in the last 24 hours and with pain periodicity (the worst depression score in patients with constant pain). QoL correlated with average pain in the last 7 days. Pain is a frequent problem in PD patients, and it worsens during the course of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1893402990,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating chemotherapeutic agent that prolongs the survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Despite that high TMZ potential, progression of disease and recurrence are still observed. Therefore a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this drug is necessary and may allow more durable benefit from its anti-glioma properties. Using nucleotide post-labelling method and separation on thin-layer chromatography we measured of global changes of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in DNA of glioma cells treated with TMZ. Although m5C is not a product of TMZ methylation reaction of DNA, we analysed the effects of the drug action on different glioma cell lines through global changes at the level of the DNA main epigenetic mark. The first effect of TMZ action we observed is DNA hypermethylation followed by global demethylation. Therefore an increase of DNA methylation and down regulation of some genes expression can be ascribed to activation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). On the other hand hypomethylation is induced by oxidative stress and causes uncontrolled expression of pathologic protein genes. The results of brain tumours treatment with TMZ suggest the new mechanism of modulation epigenetic marker in cancer cells. A high TMZ concentration induced a significant increase of m5C content in DNA in the short time, but a low TMZ concentration at longer time hypomethylation is observed for whole range of TMZ concentrations. Therefore TMZ administration with low doses of the drug and short time should be considered as optimal therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1893636323,"The intracellular Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) regulates the cardiac Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), and mutations in CaM cause arrhythmias such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and long QT syndrome. Here, we investigated the effect of CaM mutations causing CPVT (N53I), long QT syndrome (D95V and D129G), or both (CaM N97S) on RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release. All mutations increased Ca2+ release and rendered RyR2 more susceptible to store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) by lowering the threshold of store Ca2+ content at which SOICR occurred and the threshold at which SOICR terminated. To obtain mechanistic insights, we investigated the Ca2+ binding of the N- and C-terminal domains (N- and C-domain) of CaM in the presence of a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding domain of RyR2. The N53I mutation decreased the affinity of Ca2+ binding to the N-domain of CaM, relative to CaM WT, but did not affect the C-domain. Conversely, mutations N97S, D95V, and D129G had little or no effect on Ca2+ binding to the N-domain but markedly decreased the affinity of the C-domain for Ca2+. These results suggest that mutations D95V, N97S, and D129G alter the interaction between CaM and the CaMBD and thus RyR2 regulation. Because the N53I mutation minimally affected Ca2+ binding to the C-domain, it must cause aberrant regulation via a different mechanism. These results support aberrant RyR2 regulation as the disease mechanism for CPVT associated with CaM mutations and shows that CaM mutations not associated with CPVT can also affect RyR2. A model for the CaM-RyR2 interaction, where the Ca2+-saturated C-domain is constitutively bound to RyR2 and the N-domain senses increases in Ca2+ concentration, is proposed.

CaM is a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensing protein in vertebrates and confers its sensing of intracellular Ca2+ signals onto a multitude of protein targets, including ion channels and pumps responsible for excitation and contraction in cardiomyocytes (15Sorensen A.B. Søndergaard M.T. Overgaard M.T. Calmodulin in a heartbeat.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 5511-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although a cytosolic protein, CaM does affect the response of the RyR2 channel to [Ca2+]SR, most likely as part of an extensive allosteric regulation of RyR2 (14Tian X. Tang Y. Liu Y. Wang R. Chen S.R. Calmodulin modulates the termination threshold for cardiac ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release.Biochem. J. 2013; 455: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CaM consists of two domains (C- and N-domains, respectively) with a flexible linker between them that enables independent and correlated functions. Each domain is comprised of two structurally integrated EF hand motifs that each binds one Ca2+ ion (Fig. 1). Although highly homologous with extensive sequence identity, the two domains of CaM display distinct Ca2+ binding properties and both independent and correlated interactions with protein targets. CaM binds to RyR2 with a stoichiometry of four per channel, primarily via the CaM binding domain (CaMBD) (Arg3581–Pro3607, human RyR2) (15Sorensen A.B. Søndergaard M.T. Overgaard M.T.

In the Ca2+ saturated form, the CaM C-domain appears to bind RyR2 around Trp3587 in the CaMBD, and the CaM N-domain appears to bind RyR2 in the vicinity of Phe3603, although the CaM N-domain interaction is more promiscuous, especially at low free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]free) (18Lau K.

Also, an engineered CaM mutant (CaM E31A/E67A/E104A/E140A, CaM1234) defective in Ca2+ binding is a competitive inhibitor of the native regulation of RyR2 by the CaM WT (21Fruen B.R. Black D.J.

Hence, CaM binding to RyR2 and Ca2+ binding to CaM are each critical determinants of RyR2 regulation by CaM. Three genes (CALM1–3) in the human genome encode the exact same CaM protein, and we previously found that two separate mutations in the CALM1 gene (N53I and N97S, mature CaM numbering) each lead to dominantly inherited CPVT (22Nyegaard M.

In addition, a CaM F89L mutation was identified in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (25Venetucci L. Denegri M. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Inherited calcium channelopathies in the pathophysiology of arrhythmias.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2012; 9: 561-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Both CPVT and LQTS lead to perturbations of excitation-contraction cycles in cardiomyocytes, which in turn can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. CPVT is characterized by syncope or sudden cardiac death following exercise or acute emotion, whereas LQTS also affects the resting heart and with increasing effect upon adrenergic stimulation (25Venetucci L.

Thus, the aberrant regulation of RyR2 by CaM is a likely convergence point for the CaM N53I and N97S disease mechanisms causing CPVT (1Søndergaard M.T. Sorensen A.B. Skov L.L. Kjaer-Sorensen K.

This is also consistent with the observation that these CaM mutations increase spontaneous Ca2+ release in permeabilized cardiomyocytes (15Sorensen A.B. Søndergaard M.T. Overgaard M.T.

Conversely, LQTS is mainly associated with dysfunction of sarcolemmal voltage-gated Na+, Ca2+, or K+ channels in control of the action potential. Notably the activities of a majority of these channels are regulated by CaM, for example, CaM mutations N97S, D95V, F141L and D129G all confer reduced Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the cardiac L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (CaV1.2) (15Sorensen A.B.

In this study, we investigated the impact of CaM mutations linked to CPVT (N53I), LQTS (D95V and D129G), or both (N97S) on the CaM-dependent regulation of RyR2 channels. To this end, we monitored the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ dynamics in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells transfected with CaM WT or mutants. The RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release in this system is triggered by increasing the Ca2+ load in the ER, which mimics the store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) model for CPVT (14Tian X. Tang Y. Liu Y.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13062-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we investigated domain-specific interactions of CaM with Ca2+ in the presence of a peptide corresponding to the CaMBD of RyR2. Our results demonstrate that both CPVT and LQTS-associated CaM mutations alter RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release. Plasmid constructs based on the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) for recombinant expression and purification of native, full-length CaM were prepared as described previously (1Søndergaard M.T. Sorensen A.B. Skov L.L. Kjaer-Sorensen K. Bauer M.C. Nyegaard M. Linse S. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T.

Mutations in calmodulin cause ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 91: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For expression of CaM variants in HEK293 cells, CaM coding sequences from the pMAL vectors were PCR-amplified and the products ligated into pcDNA3.1 vectors (Invitrogen). Chemically competent Escherichia coli DH5a cells (in-house stock) were transformed with pcDNA3.1 vectors, and overnight cultures were used to prepare purified plasmid preparations using the Qiagen plasmid maxi kit. pcDNA3.1 vectors were eluted in double-distilled water, and Sanger sequencing verified the sequence of CaM encoding inserts in all plasmids. All fitting of data to mathematical models and statistical analyses was done using GraphPad Prism 6 for Mac (version 6.0f). Models and statistical method details are described below. Stable expression of murine RyR2 in HEK293 cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding CaM, and the D1ER Ca2+ probe was done as previously described (14Tian X. Tang Y. Liu Y. Wang R. Chen S.R. Calmodulin modulates the termination threshold for cardiac ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release.Biochem. J. 2013; 455: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, D1ER FRET signals reflecting ER luminal [Ca2+]free were monitored for individual cells in an epifluorescent microscope setting with perfusion (6Jiang D. Wang R. Xiao B. Kong H. Hunt D.J.

Each FRET signal trace was used to measure the Ca2+ release properties of the RyR2 channels relative to the ER Ca2+ content: the activation and termination thresholds (Fig. 2A) and their difference, the fractional Ca2+ release. The ER Ca2+ store capacities were calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum FRET signal (Fmax − Fmin). Experiments were also done with HEK293 cells expressing a RyR2 mutant with the CaMBD deleted (RyR2 ΔCaMBD, murine RyR2 ΔLys3583–Phe3603). Measured parameters were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Holm-Sidak multiple comparison test for all possible combinations and with p < 0.01 (against the CaM WT values) chosen as a conservative measure of significance. CaM was expressed from the pMAL (CaM N53I and N97S) or the pET15b (D95V and D129G) vector in E. coli Rosetta B cells (EMD Chemicals) or E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen), respectively, and purified as previously described (1Søndergaard M.T.

The identity, purity, and integrity of each protein preparation were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of trypsin-digested proteins. A peptide corresponding to the CaMBD of RyR2 (RyR2(Arg3581–Leu3611), human RyR2 3581RSKKAVWHKLLSKQRKRAVVACFRMAPLYNL3611) was purchased from Peptide 2.0 Inc. (Chantilly, VA) at >98% purity. Titration experiments were performed by mixing different volumes of pH- and Ca2+-buffered solution (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm nitrilotriacetic acid at pH 7.2 (25 °C)) with the same buffer spiked to 3, 7, or 22 mm CaCl2 to reach precalculated [Ca2+]free levels (5Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Expanding the range of free calcium regulation in biological solutions.Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In practice, ×1.5 concentrated buffer stocks were prepared and proteins, peptide, Ca2+ probes (final concentration, 0.75 μm), and reducing agent (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; final concentration, 16.5 μm) were added to the double distilled water used for diluting concentrated buffers. The calculated buffer ionic strength, which affects Ca2+ binding to CaM, was stable at 0.15 m. For all titration experiments, the [Ca2+]free was followed by including the Ca2+ probe Fura-2 or Fura-6F in solutions (Invitrogen) and indirectly via measuring of Ca2+ binding to CaM WT (1Søndergaard M.T.

Therefore, it would be an excellent host for producing high levels of therapeutic proteins at low cost. Developing a filamentous fungus to produce sensitive therapeutic proteins requires that protease secretion is drastically reduced. We have identified 13 major secreted proteases that are related to degradation of therapeutic antibodies, interferon alpha 2b, and insulin like growth factor. The major proteases observed were aspartic, glutamic, subtilisin-like, and trypsin-like proteases. The seven most problematic proteases were sequentially removed from a strain to develop it for producing therapeutic proteins. After this the protease activity in the supernatant was dramatically reduced down to 4% of the original level based upon a casein substrate. When antibody was incubated in the six protease deletion strain supernatant, the heavy chain remained fully intact and no degradation products were observed. Interferon alpha 2b and insulin like growth factor were less stable in the same supernatant, but full length proteins remained when incubated overnight, in contrast to the original strain. As additional benefits, the multiple protease deletions have led to faster strain growth and higher levels of total protein in the culture supernatant."

All organisms need to match growth and metabolism with the availability of nutrients. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several mechanisms of sensing of the carbon source present in the environment have evolved (see Refs. 1Santangelo G.M.

Nutrients, and in particular glucose, influence the yeast cell metabolic behavior through the activation of signaling pathways, which in turn finely tune transcription and enzymatic activities (4Zaman S.

Cell growth and cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: basic regulatory design and protein-protein interaction network.Biotechnol. Adv. 2012; 30: 52-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The main signaling pathway activated by glucose in yeast is the PKA pathway, which shows extensive involvement in growth, proliferation, and metabolism (2Broach J.R.

Acta. 2015; 1850: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The second messenger responsible for the activation of PKA is cAMP, which is synthesized by adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) upon stimulus from the G-proteins Gpa2 and the RAS pathway (1Santangelo G.M.

Novel sensing mechanisms and targets for the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). cAMP binds to a homodimer of PKA regulatory subunits Bcy1, causing its dissociation from the dimer of catalytic subunits (composed by two of the partially redundant proteins Tpk1, Tpk2, and Tpk3), thus activating the kinase (8Toda T.

During exponential growth and in the absence of stress, PKA phosphorylates the transcription factors Msn2,4, thus causing their confinement to the cytoplasm (9Görner W. Durchschlag E.

Msn2,4 activate the transcription of genes with promoters containing stress response element sequences, comprising genes coding for chaperones, antioxidant proteins, and proteases and, more in general, for elements necessary to respond to various stress types (10Gasch A.P.

Protein kinase A contributes to the negative control of Snf1 protein kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Eukaryot. Cell. 2012; 11: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the β subunit Sip1, preventing the localization of the Snf1 complex to the vacuole (32Hedbacker K. Townley R. Carlson M. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase regulates the subcellular localization of Snf1-Sip1 protein kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1836-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Snf1 and PKA share common downstream targets. PKA phosphorylates and deactivates Adr1, the transcriptional activator of several glucose repressed genes, whereas Snf1 indirectly causes its dephosphorylation and activation (33Cherry J.R. Johnson T.R. Dollard C. Shuster J.R. Denis C.L.

Kacherovsky N. Arms E. Young E.T. Snf1 controls the activity of Adr1 through dephosphorylation of Ser230.Genetics. 2009; 182: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both PKA and Snf1 act as repressors of the transcription factor Msn2, but, whereas PKA is the main regulator of this factor, Snf1 targets it only to shut off transcription of the stress response element regulon after prolonged stationary phase (9Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C.

A dual role for PP1 in shaping the Msn2-dependent transcriptional response to glucose starvation.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a direct regulation of the Snf1 orthologue AMPK by PKA has been demonstrated in human adipocytes, where PKA phosphorylates Ser173 of AMPK preventing the phosphorylation of residue Thr172, requested for activation (37Djouder N. Tuerk R.D. Suter M. Salvioni P. Thali R.F. Scholz R. Vaahtomeri K. Auchli Y. Rechsteiner H. Brunisholz R.A. Viollet B. Mäkelä T.P. Wallimann T. Neumann D. Krek W. PKA phosphorylates and inactivates AMPKα to promote efficient lipolysis.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both residues are conserved in S. cerevisiae (Thr210 and adjacent Ser211), thus a similar mechanism has been hypothesized in yeast (31Barrett L. Orlova M. Maziarz M. Kuchin S. Protein kinase A contributes to the negative control of Snf1 protein kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Eukaryot. Cell. 2012; 11: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we propose a novel cross-talk mechanism between Snf1/AMPK and PKA pathways. Seeking for new Snf1 targets, we identify adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) as a Snf1-interacting protein. We show that Cyr1 is a Snf1 target in vitro and that its phosphorylation pattern is altered in vivo in the snf1Δ mutant compared with the wild type. Strikingly, we demonstrate that constitutive activation of Snf1 reduces cAMP intracellular content and functionally impairs PKA activity as a regulator of glucose-repressed genes. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Synthetic medium contained 2, 5, or 0.05% glucose or 2% ethanol (as indicated in the figures), 6.7 g/liter of yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 50 mg/liter of required nutrients at standard pH (5.5).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this workStrainGenotypeOriginBY wtaIsogenic to BY4741.MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0Open BiosystemsSnf1ΔaIsogenic to BY4741.MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 snf1::HPHRef. 25Nicastro R.

Open table in a new tab Cell density of liquid cultures grown at 30 °C was determined with a Coulter counter on mildly sonicated and diluted samples or spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. All experiments were performed with cells in exponential phase of growth, at cell densities between A600 nm = 0.1 (2 × 106 cells/ml) and A600 nm = 0.7 (1.3 × 107 cells/ml). DNA manipulation and yeast transformations were carried out according to standard techniques. To obtain the tagged strains, proteins were tagged with a C-terminal 4HA or 9myc epitope by an in locus 3′ in-frame insertion. Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21(DE3)[pLysE] were used in cloning experiments and for expression of recombinant proteins, respectively. The HpaI-XhoI fragment of CYR1 from the YCplac33-CYR1 plasmid (38Vanhalewyn M. Dumortier F. Debast G. Colombo S. Ma P. Winderickx J. Van Dijck P. Thevelein J.M.

Mutant CYR1-4E (S435E,S527E,T631E,S645E) gene was obtained by synthesis of a custom HpaI-XhoI CYR1 fragment (Eurofins) and subcloning in the YCplac33-CYR1 plasmid. Samples of cells were harvested and lysed using ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) plus 1 mm PMSF, proteases inhibitor mix (Complete EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche), and phosphatase inhibitor mix (Sigma). An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) was added, and cells were broken by 20 vortex/ice cycles of 1 min each. Extracts were transferred to new tubes and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Crude protein extracts were incubated 2 h at 4 °C with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) to immunoprecipitate Snf1-HA protein complexes or with IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) to immunopurify Cyr1-TAP. The immunocomplexes obtained after removal of supernatants were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5. SDS sample buffer was then added to the beads, and the samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-TAP antibody (1:2500; Thermo Scientific, Open BioSystems), anti-HA antibody (1:1000, 12CA5; Roche), anti-myc antibody (1:1000, 9E10; Santa Cruz), anti-Cyr1 antibody (1:1000, yC-20, Santa Cruz), and anti-Swi6 (1:1000, kindly provided by L. Breeden). For the analysis of Snf1 interactors, Snf1-HA protein complexes were immunopurified from 270 mg of total protein extract and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with GelCodeTM blue stain reagent (Pierce) for MS analysis. Bands were excised and treated as reported in the section “Sample Preparation and Mass Spectrometry Techniques.” For the analysis of Cyr1 phosphorylation, Cyr1-TAP was immunopurified from 9 mg of total protein extract and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining, according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare).

In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant His6-Cyr1(335–1066) (4 μg of purified protein) was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgAc, using protein kinase Snf1-HA or Snf1-T210A-HA immunopurified from yeast cells growing in 2% glucose. The reaction was started by adding 0.24 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 2000 cpm/pmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS sample buffer and then heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated bands were visualized by autoradiography. The protein content of IP Snf1-HA sample and IP untagged control sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE, analyzed, and compared using a GS-800TM densitometer and Quantity One® analysis software. Each protein band was quantified by densitometric analysis. Only bands exclusively present on IP Snf1-HA sample or bands whose A value differed at least 0.1 in the comparison between IP Snf1-HA sample and IP untagged control sample were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W2132841883,"Male house mice (Mus musculus) emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during courtship, which attract females, and we aimed to test whether females use these vocalizations for species or subspecies recognition of potential mates. We recorded courtship USVs of males from different Mus species, Mus musculus subspecies, and populations (F1 offspring of wild-caught Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus domesticus (and F1 hybrid crosses), and Mus spicilegus), and we conducted playback experiments to measure female preferences for male USVs. Male vocalizations contained at least seven distinct syllable types, whose frequency of occurrence varied among species, subspecies, and populations. Detailed analyses of multiple common syllable types indicated that Mus musculus and Mus spicilegus could be discriminated based on spectral and temporal characteristics of their vocalizations, and populations of Mus musculus were also distinctive regardless of the classification model used. Females were able to discriminate USVs from different species, and showed assortative preferences for conspecific males. We found no evidence that females discriminate USVs of males from a different subspecies or separate populations of the same species, even though our spectral analyses identified acoustic features that differ between species, subspecies, and populations of the same species. Our results provide the first comparison of USVs between Mus species or between Mus musculus subspecies, and the first evidence that male USVs potentially facilitate species recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1914627644,"Studies in the literature have indicated that the timing of seasonal influenza epidemic varies across latitude, suggesting the involvement of meteorological and environmental conditions in the transmission of influenza. In this study, we investigated the link between meteorological parameters and influenza activity in 9 sub-national areas with temperate and subtropical climates: Berlin (Germany), Ljubljana (Slovenia), Castile and León (Spain) and all 6 districts in Israel.We estimated weekly influenza-associated influenza-like-illness (ILI) or Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) incidence to represent influenza activity using data from each country's sentinel surveillance during 2000-2011 (Spain) and 2006-2011 (all others). Meteorological data was obtained from ground stations, satellite and assimilated data. Two generalized additive models (GAM) were developed, with one using specific humidity as a covariate and another using minimum temperature. Precipitation and solar radiation were included as additional covariates in both models. The models were adjusted for previous weeks' influenza activity, and were trained separately for each study location.Influenza activity was inversely associated (p<0.05) with specific humidity in all locations. Minimum temperature was inversely associated with influenza in all 3 temperate locations, but not in all subtropical locations. Inverse associations between influenza and solar radiation were found in most locations. Associations with precipitation were location-dependent and inconclusive. We used the models to estimate influenza activity a week ahead for the 2010/2011 period which was not used in training the models. With exception of Ljubljana and Israel's Haifa District, the models could closely follow the observed data especially during the start and the end of epidemic period. In these locations, correlation coefficients between the observed and estimated ranged between 0.55 to 0.91and the model-estimated influenza peaks were within 3 weeks from the observations.Our study demonstrated the significant link between specific humidity and influenza activity across temperate and subtropical climates, and that inclusion of meteorological parameters in the surveillance system may further our understanding of influenza transmission patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1910219849,"A dominance hierarchy is an important feature of the social organisation of group living animals. Although formal and/or agonistic dominance has been found in captive wolves and free-ranging dogs, applicability of the dominance concept in domestic dogs is highly debated, and quantitative data are scarce. Therefore, we investigated 7 body postures and 24 behaviours in a group of domestic dogs for their suitability as formal status indicators. The results showed that high posture, displayed in most dyadic relationships, and muzzle bite, displayed exclusively by the highest ranking dogs, qualified best as formal dominance indicators. The best formal submission indicator was body tail wag, covering most relationships, and two low postures, covering two-thirds of the relationships. In addition, both mouth lick, as included in Schenkel's active submission, and pass under head qualified as formal submission indicators but were shown almost exclusively towards the highest ranking dogs. Furthermore, a status assessment based on changes in posture displays, i.e., lowering of posture (LoP) into half-low, low, low-on-back or on-back, was the best status indicator for most relationships as it showed good coverage (91% of the dyads), a nearly linear hierarchy (h' = 0.94, p<0.003) and strong unidirectionality (DCI = 0.97). The associated steepness of 0.79 (p<0.0001) indicated a tolerant dominance style for this dog group. No significant correlations of rank with age or weight were found. Strong co-variation between LoP, high posture, and body tail wag justified the use of dominance as an intervening variable. Our results are in line with previous findings for captive wolves and free-ranging dogs, for formal dominance with strong linearity based on submission but not aggression. They indicate that the ethogram for dogs is best redefined by distinguishing body postures from behavioural activities. A good insight into dominance hierarchies and its indicators will be helpful in properly interpreting dog-dog relationships and diagnosing problem behaviour in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W1914402363,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life, but the mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate indices of glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and arterial stiffness (as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)), in women with and without a history of GDM, using both the old WHO and new IADPSG diagnostic criteria, at 5 years after the index pregnancy. Dyslipidemia and PWV were used as surrogate markers for CVD risk. The population-based prospective cohort included 300 women from the original STORK study. All participants had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during pregnancy. Five years later, the OGTT was repeated along with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, lipid analysis, and PWV analysis. Measurements were compared between those women who did and did not have GDM based on both the WHO and IADPSG criteria. We found that women with GDM based on the old WHO criteria had higher CVD risk at 5 years than those without GDM, with markedly elevated PWV and more severe dyslipidemia (higher triglycerides (TG)/HDL cholesterol ratio). After adjusting for known risk factors, the most important predictors for elevated PWV and TG/HDL-C ratio at 5-year follow-up were maternal age, BMI, GDM, systolic blood pressure, and indices of glucose metabolism in the index pregnancy. In conclusion, we found a higher risk for CVD, based on the surrogate markers PWV and TG/HDL-C ratio, at 5-year follow-up in women diagnosed with GDM in the index pregnancy when using the old WHO diagnostic criteria."
https://openalex.org/W1879127868,"Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are used to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver. Accordingly, statins regulate nitric oxide (NO) and glutamate metabolism, inflammation, angiogenesis, immunity and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) functions. The function of EPCs are regulated by stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), etc. Even though the pharmacologic mechanisms by which statins affect the neovasculogenesis of circulating EPCs, it is still unknown whether statins affect the EPCs function through the regulation of CXCR4, a SDF-1 receptor expression. Therefore, we desired to explore the effects of statins on CXCR4 expression in EPC-mediated neovascularization by in vitro and in vivo analyses. In animal studies, we analyzed the effects of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin treatments in recovery of capillary density and blood flow, the expression of vWF and CXCR4 at ischemia sites in hindlimb ischemia ICR mice. Additionally, we analyzed whether the atorvastatin or rosuvastatin treatments increased the mobilization, homing, and CXCR4 expression of EPCs in hindlimb ischemia ICR mice that underwent bone marrow transplantation. The results indicated that statins treatment led to significantly more CXCR4-positive endothelial progenitor cells incorporated into ischemic sites and in the blood compared with control mice. In vivo, we isolated human EPCs and analyzed the effect of statins treatment on the vasculogenic ability of EPCs and the expression of CXCR4. Compared with the control groups, the neovascularization ability of EPCs was significantly improved in the atorvastatin or rosuvastatin group; this improvement was dependent on CXCR4 up-regulation. The efficacy of statins on improving EPC neovascularization was related to the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis and might be regulated by the NO. In conclusion, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin improved neovascularization in hindlimb ischemia mice; this effect may have been mediated by increased CXCR4 expression in EPCs."
https://openalex.org/W1809192024,"Background In Kasensero fishing community, home of the first recorded case of HIV in Uganda, HIV transmission is still very high with an incidence of 4.3 and 3.1 per 100 person-years in women and men, respectively, and an HIV prevalence of 44%, reaching up to 74% among female sex workers. We explored drivers for the high HIV transmission at Kasensero from the perspective of fishermen and other community members to inform future policy and preventive interventions. Methods 20 in-depth interviews including both HIV positive and HIV negative respondents, and 12 focus-group discussions involving a total of 92 respondents from the Kasensero fishing community were conducted during April-September 2014. Content analysis was performed to identify recurrent themes. Results The socio-economic risk factors for high HIV transmission in Kasensero fishing community cited were multiple and cross-cutting and categorized into the following themes: power of money, risk denial, environmental triggers and a predisposing lifestyle and alcoholism and drug abuse. Others were: peer pressure, poor housing and the search for financial support for both the men and women which made them vulnerable to HIV exposure and or risk behavior. Conclusions There is a need for context specific combination prevention interventions in Kasensero that includes the fisher folk and other influential community leaders. Such groups could be empowered with the knowledge and social mobilization skills to fight the negative and risky behaviors, perceptions, beliefs, misconceptions and submission attitudes to fate that exposes the community to high HIV transmission. There is also need for government/partners to ensure effective policy implementation, life jackets for all fishermen, improve the poor housing at the community so as to reduce overcrowding and other housing related predispositions to high HIV rates at the community. Work place AIDS-competence teams have been successfully used to address high HIV transmission in similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W1907753696,"Recent studies have reported that crustacean age determination is possible. We applied a direct ageing method (i.e. transverse cross sectioning of gastric ossicles) to a subtropical freshwater crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) sourced from an aquaculture population. Growth mark periodicity and the potential for chronological depositions were investigated by staining C. quadricarinatus with calcein and examining their ossicles a year later. Pterocardiac ossicles were superior to other ageing structures (i.e. other ossicles and eyestalks) and produced repeatable between-reader counts (87% were corroborated and 13% varied by ±1). C. quadricarinatus size-at-age data (for an aquaculture population) was described by a von Bertalanffy growth equation (L∞ = 32 mm occipital carapace length; K = 0.64; t0 = -0.18; R2 = 0.81). Ossicular growth marks did not correspond to moult history. The calcein stain was retained over an annual cycle comprising multiple moults, demonstrating that pterocardiac ossicles retain chronological information. The maximum age (3+) corroborated other indirectly-obtained longevity estimates for C. quadricarinatus. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the growth marks in C. quadricarinatus ossicles are probably deposited annually during winter. The ability to extract age information from subtropical decapods provides substantial opportunities for advancing fisheries and conservation research globally, but further research is needed to provide a definitive validation and elucidate the mechanism governing the accrual of ossicular growth marks."
https://openalex.org/W2147423010,"The pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is not completely understood. Recent evidence suggests a pivotal role for the endothelium in AKI. In experimental models of AKI, the endothelial specific receptor Tie2 with its ligands Angiopoietin (Ang) 1 and Ang2 are deranged. This study investigates their status after cardiac surgery, and a possible relation between angiopoietins and AKI.From a cohort of 541 patients that underwent cardiac surgery, blood and urine was collected at 5 predefined time points. From this cohort we identified 21 patients who had at least 50% post-operative serum creatinine increase (AKI). We constructed a control group (n = 21) using propensity matching. Systemic levels of Ang1, Ang2, and sTie2 were measured in plasma and the AKI markers albumin, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured in the urine.Ang2 plasma levels increased over time in AKI (from 4.2 to 11.6 ng/ml) and control patients (from 3.0 to 6.7 ng/ml). Ang2 levels increased 1.7-fold more in patients who developed AKI after cardiac surgery compared to matched control patients. Plasma levels of sTie2 decreased 1.6-fold and Ang1 decreased 3-fold over time in both groups, but were not different between AKI and controls (Ang1 P = 0.583 and sTie2 P = 0.679). Moreover, we found a positive correlation between plasma levels of Ang2 and urinary levels of NAG.The endothelial Ang/Tie2 system is in dysbalance in patients that develop AKI after cardiac surgery compared to matched control patients."

This study examined how relative age in a grade affects suicide rates of adolescents and young adults between 15 and 25 years of age using data from Japan.We examined individual death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan from 1989 to 2010. In contrast to other countries, late entry to primary school is not allowed in Japan. We took advantage of the school entry cutoff date to implement a regression discontinuity (RD) design, assuming that the timing of births around the school entry cutoff date was randomly determined and therefore that individuals who were born just before and after the cutoff date have similar baseline characteristics.We found that those who were born right before the school cutoff day and thus youngest in their cohort have higher mortality rates by suicide, compared to their peers who were born right after the cutoff date and thus older. We also found that those with relative age disadvantage tend to follow a different career path than those with relative age advantage, which may explain their higher suicide mortality rates.Relative age effects have broader consequences than was previously supposed. This study suggests that policy intervention that alleviates the relative age effect can be important."
https://openalex.org/W2101092068,"A large number of humans are stung by jellyfish all over the world. The stings cause acute pain followed by persistent pain and local inflammation. Harmful jellyfish species typically cause strong pain, whereas harmless jellyfish cause subtle or no pain. Jellyfish sting humans by injecting a tubule, contained in the nematocyst, the stinging organ of jellyfish. The tubule penetrates into the skin leading to venom injection. The detailed morphology of the nematocyst tubule and molecular structure of the venom in the nematocyst has been reported; however, the mechanism responsible for the difference in pain that is caused by harmful and harmless jellyfish sting has not yet been explored or explained. Therefore, we hypothesized that differences in the length of the nematocyst tubule leads to different degrees of epithelial damage. The initial acute pain might be generated by penetration of the tubule, which stimulates pain receptor neurons, whilst persistent pain might be caused by injection of venom into the epithelium. To test this hypothesis we compared the lengths of discharged nematocyst tubules from harmful and harmless jellyfish species and evaluated their ability to penetrate human skin. The results showed that the harmful jellyfish species, Chrysaora pacifica, Carybdea brevipedalia, and Chironex yamaguchii, causing moderate to severe pain, have nematocyst tubules longer than 200 μm, compared with a jellyfish species that cause little or no pain, Aurelia aurita. The majority of the tubules of harmful jellyfishes, C. yamaguchii and C. brevipedalia, were sufficiently long to penetrate the human epidermis and physically stimulate the free nerve endings of Aδ pain receptor fibers around plexuses to cause acute pain and inject the venom into the human skin epithelium to cause persistent pain and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1853324032,"Organic farming, a low intensity system, may offer benefits for a range of taxa, but what affects the extent of those benefits is imperfectly understood. We explored the effects of organic farming and landscape on the activity density and species density of spiders and carabid beetles, using a large sample of paired organic and conventional farms in the UK. Spider activity density and species density were influenced by both farming system and surrounding landscape. Hunting spiders, which tend to have lower dispersal capabilities, had higher activity density, and more species were captured, on organic compared to conventional farms. There was also evidence for an interaction, as the farming system effect was particularly marked in the cropped area before harvest and was more pronounced in complex landscapes (those with little arable land). There was no evidence for any effect of farming system or landscape on web-building spiders (which include the linyphiids, many of which have high dispersal capabilities). For carabid beetles, the farming system effects were inconsistent. Before harvest, higher activity densities were observed in the crops on organic farms compared with conventional farms. After harvest, no difference was detected in the cropped area, but more carabids were captured on conventional compared to organic boundaries. Carabids were more species-dense in complex landscapes, and farming system did not affect this. There was little evidence that non-cropped habitat differences explained the farming system effects for either spiders or carabid beetles. For spiders, the farming system effects in the cropped area were probably largely attributable to differences in crop management; reduced inputs of pesticides (herbicides and insecticides) and fertilisers are possible influences, and there was some evidence for an effect of non-crop plant species richness on hunting spider activity density. The benefits of organic farming may be greatest for taxa with lower dispersal abilities generally. The evidence for interactions among landscape and farming system in their effects on spiders highlights the importance of developing strategies for managing farmland at the landscape-scale for most effective conservation of biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W1151031465,"Talin (tln) binds and activates integrins to couple extracellular matrix-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton; however, its role in heart development is not well characterized. We identified the defective gene and the resulting cardiovascular phenotypes in zebrafish tln1(fl02k) mutants. The ethylnitrosourea-induced fl02k mutant showed heart failure, brain hemorrhage, and diminished cardiac and vessel lumens at 52 h post fertilization. Positional cloning revealed a nonsense mutation of tln1 in this mutant. tln1, but neither tln2 nor -2a, was dominantly expressed in the heart and vessels. Unlike tln1 and -2 in the mouse heart, the unique tln1 expression in the heart enabled us, for the first time, to determine the critical roles of Tln1 in the maintenance of cardiac sarcomeric Z-disks and endothelial/endocardial cell integrity, partly through regulating F-actin networks in zebrafish. The similar expression profiles of tln1 and integrin β1b (itgb1b) and synergistic function of the 2 genes revealed that itgb1b is a potential partner for tln1 in the stabilization of cardiac Z-disks and vessel lumens. Taken together, the results of this work suggest that Tln1-mediated Itgβ1b plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac sarcomeric Z-disks and endothelial/endocardial cell integrity in zebrafish and may also help to gain molecular insights into congenital heart diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1932271748,"Apex marine predators alter their foraging behavior in response to spatial and/or seasonal changes in natural prey distribution and abundance. However, few studies have identified the impacts of aquaculture that represents a spatially and temporally predictable and abundant resource on their foraging behavior. Using satellite telemetry and stable isotope analysis we examined the degree of spatial overlap between the South American sea lion (SASL) and salmon farms, and quantify the amount of native prey versus farmed salmonids in SASL diets. We instrumented eight SASL individuals with SRDL-GPS tags. Vibrissae, hair and skin samples were collected for δ13C and δ15N analyses from five of the tagged individuals and from four males captured in a haul-out located adjacent to salmon farms. Tracking results showed that almost all the foraging areas of SASL are within close proximity to salmon farms. The most important prey for the individuals analyzed was farmed salmonids, with an estimated median (±SD) contribution of 19.7 ± 13.5‰ and 15.3 ± 9.6‰ for hair and skin, respectively. Using vibrissae as a temporal record of diet for each individual, we observed a remarkable switch in diet composition in two SASL, from farmed salmonids to pelagic fishes, which coincided with the decrease of salmon production due to the infectious salmon anemia virus that affected salmon farms in Chile at the end of 2008. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of integrating stable isotope derived dietary data with movement patterns to characterize the impacts of a non-native prey on the foraging ecology of an apex marine predator, providing important applied implications in situations where interactions between aquaculture and wildlife are common."
https://openalex.org/W1945783633,"Both bacterial symbionts and pathogens rely on their host-sensing mechanisms to activate the biosynthetic pathways necessary for their invasion into host cells. The Gram-negative bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti relies on its RSI (ExoR-ExoS-ChvI) Invasion Switch to turn on the production of succinoglycan, an exopolysaccharide required for its host invasion. Recent whole-genome sequencing efforts have uncovered putative components of RSI-like invasion switches in many other symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. To explore the possibility of the existence of a common invasion switch, we have conducted a phylogenomic survey of orthologous ExoR, ExoS, and ChvI tripartite sets in more than ninety proteobacterial genomes. Our analyses suggest that functional orthologs of the RSI invasion switch co-exist in Rhizobiales, an order characterized by numerous invasive species, but not in the order’s close relatives. Phylogenomic analyses and reconstruction of orthologous sets of the three proteins in Alphaproteobacteria confirm Rhizobiales-specific gene synteny and congruent RSI evolutionary histories. Evolutionary analyses further revealed site-specific substitutions correlated specifically to either animal-bacteria or plant-bacteria associations. Lineage restricted conservation of any one specialized gene is in itself an indication of species adaptation. However, the orthologous phylogenetic co-occurrence of all interacting partners within this single signaling pathway strongly suggests that the development of the RSI switch was a key adaptive mechanism. The RSI invasion switch, originally found in S. meliloti, is a characteristic of the Rhizobiales, and potentially a conserved crucial activation step that may be targeted to control host invasion by pathogenic bacterial species."
https://openalex.org/W1759708757,"To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the success of female mosquitoes in their disposal of excess nitrogen, we investigated the role of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) in blood-fed Aedes aegypti. Transcript and protein levels from the 2 ALAT genes were analyzed in sucrose- and blood-fed A. aegypti tissues. ALAT1 and ALAT2 exhibit distinct expression patterns in tissues during the first gonotrophic cycle. Injection of female mosquitoes with either double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-ALAT1 or dsRNA ALAT2 significantly decreased mRNA and protein levels of ALAT1 or ALAT2 in fat body, thorax, and Malpighian tubules compared with dsRNA firefly luciferase-injected control mosquitoes. The silencing of either A. aegypti ALAT1 or ALAT2 caused unexpected phenotypes such as a delay in blood digestion, a massive accumulation of uric acid in the midgut posterior region, and a significant decrease of nitrogen waste excretion during the first 48 h after blood feeding. Concurrently, the expression of genes encoding xanthine dehydrogenase and ammonia transporter (Rhesus 50 glycoprotein) were significantly increased in tissues of both ALAT1- and ALAT2-deficient females. Moreover, perturbation of ALAT1 and ALAT2 in the female mosquitoes delayed oviposition and reduced egg production. These novel findings underscore the efficient mechanisms that blood-fed mosquitoes use to avoid ammonia toxicity and free radical damage.-Mazzalupo, S., Isoe, J., Belloni, V., Scaraffia, P. Y. Effective disposal of nitrogen waste in blood-fed Aedes aegypti mosquitoes requires alanine aminotransferase."

https://openalex.org/W1912165480,"Within the context of anthropogenic climate change, but also considering the Earth's natural climate variability, this paper explores the speculative possibility of large-scale active control of the Earth's radiative forcing. In particular, the paper revisits the concept of deploying a large sunshade or occulting disk at a static position near the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange equilibrium point. Among the solar radiation management methods that have been proposed thus far, space-based concepts are generally seen as the least timely, albeit also as one of the most efficient. Large occulting structures could potentially offset all of the global mean temperature increase due to greenhouse gas emissions. This paper investigates optimal configurations of orbiting occulting disks that not only offset a global temperature increase, but also mitigate regional differences such as latitudinal and seasonal difference of monthly mean temperature. A globally resolved energy balance model is used to provide insights into the coupling between the motion of the occulting disks and the Earth's climate. This allows us to revise previous studies, but also, for the first time, to search for families of orbits that improve the efficiency of occulting disks at offsetting climate change on both global and regional scales. Although natural orbits exist near the L1 equilibrium point, their period does not match that required for geoengineering purposes, thus forced orbits were designed that require small changes to the disk attitude in order to control its motion. Finally, configurations of two occulting disks are presented which provide the same shading area as previously published studies, but achieve reductions of residual latitudinal and seasonal temperature changes."
https://openalex.org/W1816878906,"Natural history collections house an enormous amount of plant and animal specimens, which constitute a promising source for molecular analyses. Storage conditions differ among taxa and can have a dramatic effect on the success of DNA work. Here, we analyze the feasibility of DNA extraction from ethanol preserved spiders (Araneae). We tested genotyping success using several hundred specimens of the wasp spider, Argiope bruennichi, deposited in two large German natural history collections. We tested the influence of different factors on the utility of specimens for genotyping. Our results show that not the specimen's age, but the museum collection is a major predictor of genotyping success. These results indicate that long term storage conditions should be optimized in natural history museums to assure the utility of collections for DNA work. Using historical material, we also traced historical genetic and morphological variation in the course of a poleward range expansion of A. bruennichi by comparing contemporary and historical specimens from a native and an invasive population in Germany. We show that the invasion of A. bruennichi is tightly correlated with an historical increase of genetic and phenotypic variation in the invasive population."
https://openalex.org/W2259204755,"Most exoplanetary systems in binary stars are of S--type, and consist of one or more planets orbiting a primary star with a wide binary stellar companion. Gravitational forcing of a single planet by a sufficiently inclined binary orbit can induce large amplitude oscillations of the planet's eccentricity and inclination through the Kozai-Lidov (KL) instability. KL cycling was invoked to explain: the large eccentricities of planetary orbits; the family of close--in hot Jupiters; and the retrograde planetary orbits in eccentric binary systems. However, several kinds of perturbations can quench the KL instability, by inducing fast periapse precessions which stabilize circular orbits of all inclinations: these could be a Jupiter--mass planet, a massive remnant disc or general relativistic precession. Indeed, mutual gravitational perturbations in multiplanet S--type systems can be strong enough to lend a certain dynamical rigidity to their orbital planes. Here we present a new and faster process that is driven by this very agent inhibiting KL cycling. Planetary perturbations enable secular oscillations of planetary eccentricities and inclinations, also called Laplace--Lagrange (LL) eigenmodes. Interactions with a remnant disc of planetesimals can make planets migrate, causing a drift of LL mode periods which can bring one or more LL modes into resonance with binary orbital motion. The results can be dramatic, ranging from excitation of large eccentricities and mutual inclinations to total disruption. Not requiring special physical or initial conditions, binary resonant driving is generic and could have profoundly altered the architecture of many S--type multiplanet systems. It can also weaken the multiplanet occurrence rate in wide binaries, and affect planet formation in close binaries."
https://openalex.org/W1829553045,"Context As life expectancy improves among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients, renal and cardiovascular diseases are increasingly prevalent in this population. Renal and cardiovascular disease are mutual risk factors and are characterized by albuminuria. Understanding the interactions between HIV, cardiovascular risk factors and renal disease is the first step in tackling this new therapeutic frontier in HIV. Methods In a rural primary health care centre, 903 HIV-infected adult patients were randomly selected and data on HIV-infection and cardiovascular risk factors were collected. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated. Albuminuria was defined as an Albumin-Creatinine-Ratio above 30 mg/g. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyse albuminuria and demographic, clinical and HIV-associated variables. Results The study population consisted of 903 HIV-infected patients, with a median age of 40 years (Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) 34–48 years), and included 625 (69%) women. The median duration since HIV diagnosis was 26 months (IQR 12–58 months) and 787 (87%) received antiretroviral therapy. Thirty-six (4%) of the subjects were shown to have diabetes and 205 (23%) hypertension. In the cohort, 21% had albuminuria and 2% an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Albuminuria was associated with hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–2.41; p<0.05), total cholesterol (aOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.11–1.54; p<0.05), eGFR (aOR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97–0.99; p<0.001) and detectable viral load (aOR 2.74; 95% CI 1.56–4.79; p<0.001). Hypertension was undertreated: 78% were not receiving treatment, while another 11% were inadequately treated. No patients were receiving lipid-lowering medication. Conclusion Glomerular filtration rate was well conserved, while albuminuria was common amongst HIV-infected patients in rural South Africa. Both cardiovascular and HIV-specific variables were associated with albuminuria. Improved cardiovascular risk prevention as well as adequate virus suppression might be the key to escape the vicious circle of renal failure and cardiovascular disease and improve the long-term prognosis of HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W1836453820,"We examine the effects of forest fragmentation on the structure and composition of tree assemblages within three seasonal and aseasonal forest types of southern Brazil, including evergreen, Araucaria, and deciduous forests. We sampled three southernmost Atlantic Forest landscapes, including the largest continuous forest protected areas within each forest type. Tree assemblages in each forest type were sampled within 10 plots of 0.1 ha in both continuous forests and 10 adjacent forest fragments. All trees within each plot were assigned to trait categories describing their regeneration strategy, vertical stratification, seed-dispersal mode, seed size, and wood density. We detected differences among both forest types and landscape contexts in terms of overall tree species richness, and the density and species richness of different functional groups in terms of regeneration strategy, seed dispersal mode and woody density. Overall, evergreen forest fragments exhibited the largest deviations from continuous forest plots in assemblage structure. Evergreen, Araucaria and deciduous forests diverge in the functional composition of tree floras, particularly in relation to regeneration strategy and stress tolerance. By supporting a more diversified light-demanding and stress-tolerant flora with reduced richness and abundance of shade-tolerant, old-growth species, both deciduous and Araucaria forest tree assemblages are more intrinsically resilient to contemporary human-disturbances, including fragmentation-induced edge effects, in terms of species erosion and functional shifts. We suggest that these intrinsic differences in the direction and magnitude of responses to changes in landscape structure between forest types should guide a wide range of conservation strategies in restoring fragmented tropical forest landscapes worldwide."

As for 4 and 5 having disubstituted 7-azaindoles in their molecule, the significant cytotoxicity was detected only for 4 against A2780 (IC50 = 4.8 μM), A2780R (IC50 = 3.8 μM) and HOS (IC50 = 4.3 μM), while 5 was evaluated as having only moderate antiproliferative effect against the mentioned cancer cell lines with IC50 = 33.4, 24.7 and 46.7 μM, respectively. All the studied complexes 1–5 effectively avoided the acquired resistance of ovarian carcinoma cell line. On the other hand, the complexes did not reveal any inhibition activity on the purified 20S proteasome from the A2780 cells. The representative complexes 3 and 5 showed low ability to be hydrolysed, but their stability was markedly lowered in the presence of physiological sulphur-containing biomolecule glutathione (GSH), as proved by the 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry studies. A rate of interaction of the studied complexes with GSH was affected by an addition of another mechanistically relevant biomolecule guanosine monophosphate. The differences in interactions of 3 and 5 with GSH correlate well with their different cytotoxicity profiles."
https://openalex.org/W1915336167,"Recent research suggests that the self-conscious emotions of embarrassment, shame, and pride have distinct, nonverbal expressions that can be recognized in the United States at above-chance levels. However, few studies have examined the recognition of these emotions in other cultures, and little research has been conducted in Asia. Consequently the cross-cultural generalizability of self-conscious emotions has not been firmly established. Additionally, there is no research that examines cultural variability in the recognition of the self-conscious emotions. Cultural values and exposure to Western culture have been identified as contributors to variability in recognition rates for the basic emotions; we sought to examine this for the self-conscious emotions using the University of California, Davis Set of Emotion Expressions (UCDSEE). The present research examined recognition of the self-conscious emotion expressions in South Korean college students and found that recognition rates were very high for pride, low but above chance for shame, and near zero for embarrassment. To examine what might be underlying the recognition rates we found in South Korea, recognition of self-conscious emotions and several cultural values were examined in a U.S. college student sample of European Americans, Asian Americans, and Asian-born individuals. Emotion recognition rates were generally similar between the European Americans and Asian Americans, and higher than emotion recognition rates for Asian-born individuals. These differences were not explained by cultural values in an interpretable manner, suggesting that exposure to Western culture is a more important mediator than values."
https://openalex.org/W1944340460,"There is increasing recognition of the importance for local biodiversity of post-mining sites, many of which lie near communities that have suffered significant social and economic deprivation as the result of mine closures. However, no studies to date have actively used the knowledge of local communities to relate the history and treatment of post-mining sites to their current ecological status. We report a study of two post-mining sites in the Yorkshire coalfield of the UK in which the local community were involved in developing site histories and assessing plant and invertebrate species composition. Site histories developed using participatory GIS revealed that the sites had a mixture of areas of spontaneous succession and technical reclamation, and identified that both planned management interventions and informal activities influenced habitat heterogeneity and ecological diversity. Two groups of informal activity were identified as being of particular importance. Firstly, there has been active protection by the community of flower-rich habitats of conservation value (e.g. calcareous grassland) and distinctive plant species (e.g. orchids) which has also provided important foraging resources for butterfly and bumblebee species. Secondly, disturbance by activities such as use of motorbikes, informal camping, and cutting of trees and shrubs for fuel, as well as planned management interventions such as spreading of brick rubble, has provided habitat for plant species of open waste ground and locally uncommon invertebrate species which require patches of bare ground. This study demonstrates the importance of informal, and often unrecorded, activities by the local community in providing diverse habitats and increased biodiversity within a post-mining site, and shows that active engagement with the local community and use of local knowledge can enhance ecological interpretation of such sites and provide a stronger basis for successful future management."

Cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies enhance viral infection, thereby exacerbating the disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Studying the epitopes targeted by these enhancing antibodies would improve the immune responses against DENV infection. In order to investigate the roles of antibodies in the pathogenesis of dengue, we generated a panel of 16 new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against DENV4. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), we examined the neutralizing activity of these mAbs. Furthermore, we used the in vitro and in vivo ADE assay to evaluate the enhancement of DENV infection by mAbs. The results indicate that the cross-reactive and poorly neutralizing mAbs, DD11-4 and DD18-5, strongly enhance DENV1-4 infection of K562 cells and increase mortality in AG129 mice. The epitope residues of these enhancing mAbs were identified using virus-like particle (VLP) mutants. W212 and E26 are the epitope residues of DD11-4 and DD18-5, respectively. In conclusion, we generated and characterized 16 new mAbs against DENV4. DD11-4 and D18-5 possessed non-neutralizing activities and enhanced viral infection. Moreover, we identified the epitope residues of enhancing mAbs on envelope protein. These results may provide useful information for development of safe dengue vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1885143931,"Studying genetic diversity of immunologically relevant molecules can improve our knowledge on their functional spectrum in normal immune responses and may also uncover a possible role of different variants in diseases. We characterized the c.503T>C polymorphism in the human KLRB1 gene (Killer cell lectin-like receptor, subfamily B, member 1) coding for the cell surface receptor CD161. CD161 is expressed by subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and the great majority of CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells, acting as inhibitory receptor in the latter population. Genotyping a cohort of 118 healthy individuals revealed 40% TT homozygotes, 46% TC heterozygotes, and 14% carriers of CC. There was no difference in the frequency of CD161 expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells between the different genotypes. However, the frequency of CD161+ NK cells was significantly decreased in CC carriers as compared to TT homozygotes. c.503T>C causes an amino acid exchange (p.Ile168Thr) in an extracellular loop of the CD161 receptor, which is regarded to be involved in binding of its ligand Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1). Binding studies using soluble LLT1-Fc on 293 transfectants over-expressing CD161 receptors from TT or CC carriers suggested diminished binding to the CC variant. Furthermore, triggering of CD161 either by LLT1 or anti-CD161 antibodies inhibited NK cell activation less effectively in cells from CC individuals than cells from TT carriers. These data suggest that the c.503T>C polymorphism is associated with structural alterations of the CD161 receptor. The regulation of NK cell homeostasis and activation apparently differs between carriers of the CC and TT variant of CD161."

In the commonly used subsurface twitching assay, the sub-population of P. aeruginosa with active twitching motility is difficult to harvest for high-throughput studies. Here we describe the development of a novel method that allows efficient isolation of bacterial sub-populations conducting highly active twitching motility. The transcription factor AmrZ regulates multiple P. aeruginosa virulence factors including twitching motility, yet the mechanism of this activation remains unclear. We therefore set out to understand this mechanism by defining the AmrZ regulon using DNA microarrays in combination with the newly developed twitching motility method. We discovered 112 genes in the AmrZ regulon and many encode virulence factors. One gene of interest and the subsequent focus was lecB, which encodes a fucose-binding lectin. DNA binding assays revealed that AmrZ activates lecB transcription by directly binding to its promoter. The lecB gene was previously shown to be required for twitching motility in P. aeruginosa strain PAK; however, our lecB deletion had no effect on twitching motility in strain PAO1. Collectively, in this study a novel condition was developed for quantitative studies of twitching motility, under which the AmrZ regulon was defined."
https://openalex.org/W1940145633,"Determining kinetic constants is important in the field of RNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes). Using todays conventional gel assays for DNAzyme assays is time-consuming and laborious. There have been previous attempts at producing new and improved assays; however these have drawbacks such as incompatibility with structured DNAzymes, enzyme or substrate modifications and increased cost. Here we present a new method for determining single-turnover kinetics of RNA-cleaving DNAzymes in real-time and in a high-throughput fashion. The assay is based on an intercalating fluorescent dye, PicoGreen, with high specificity for double-stranded DNA and heteroduplex DNA-RNA in this case formed between the DNAzyme and the target RNA. The fluorescence decreases as substrate is converted to product and is released from the enzyme. Using a Flexstation II multimode plate reader with built in liquid handling we could automate parts of the assay. This assay gives the possibility to determine single-turnover kinetics for up to 48 DNAzymes simultaneously. As the fluorescent probe is extrinsic there is no need for enzyme or substrate modifications, making this method less costly compared to other methods. The main novelty of this assay is the possibility of using full-length mRNA as the DNAzyme target."

However, plasmids containing mouse mdr1a cDNA display significant genetic instability during cloning in bacteria, indicating that mdr1a cDNA may be somehow toxic to bacteria, allowing only clones containing mutations that abrogate this toxicity to survive transformation. We demonstrate here the presence of a cryptic promoter in mouse mdr1a cDNA that causes mouse P-gp expression in bacteria. This expression may account for the observed toxicity of mdr1a DNA to bacteria. Sigma 70 binding site analysis and GFP reporter plasmids were used to identify sequences in the first 321 bps of mdr1a cDNA capable of initiating bacterial protein expression. An mdr1a M107L cDNA containing a single residue mutation at the proposed translational start site was shown to allow sub-cloning of mdr1a in E. coli while retaining transport properties similar to wild-type P-gp. This mutant mdr1a cDNA may prove useful for efficient cloning of mdr1a in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2294668721,"A long-term romantic relationship can offer many benefits to committed individuals. Thus, humans possess relationship maintenance mechanisms to protect against threats from those who serve as attractive alternatives or intrasexual rivals. Many studies have indicated that romantic love can act as a commitment device to activate these mechanisms. To examine the attentional bias associated with relationship maintenance among 108 college students (49 single and 59 committed females) in China, we used a semantic priming procedure to activate mental representations associated with romantic love and then asked participants to complete a dot-probe task for the purpose of making a distinction between the engage and disengage components of attention. No significant engaging effects toward attractive faces were observed among committed females, but the following significant disengaging effects were found: when primed with romantic love, single females showed increased attention toward and difficulty in disengaging from attractive male faces, whereas females already in a committed relationship did not alter their attention, remaining as inattentive to attractive alternatives as they were in the baseline condition. In addition, committed females responded to love priming by exhibiting difficulty in disengaging from attractive rivals. The present findings provide evidence in the Chinese cultural context for the existence of early-stage attentional processes in the domain of relationship maintenance that committed Chinese females protected an ongoing relationship by not only being inattentive to attractive males who could serve as attractive alternatives, but also being more attentive to attractive females who could be potential rivals when mental representations associated with romantic love were primed."
https://openalex.org/W2303959046,"Objective To evaluate the association of birthweight and weight gain during different periods in childhood with the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype (HWP). Methods In 1982, all hospitals births in Pelotas, South Brazil, were identified, and the 5914 liveborn were examined and their mothers interviewed. This population has been followed for several times. In 2004–05, we tried to follow the whole cohort and the subjects were interviewed, examined, and a blood sample was collected. HWP was defined as a triglycerides ≥ 2 mmol/L and a waist circumference ≥ 90 cm for men, and triglycerides ≥ 1.5 mmol/L and waist circumference ≥ 85 cm for woman. Poisson regression with robust adjustment of the variance was used to obtain adjusted estimates of the prevalence ratio. Results Subjects whose weight-for-age z-score at mean age of 42 months was one or more standard deviation above the mean, according to gender and age, were 8.77 (95% confidence interval: 2.60; 29.64) times more likely of presenting the HWP than those subjects whose weight-for-age z-score at 42 months was more than one standard deviation below the mean. Among those subjects whose birthweight was adequate-for-gestational age (AGA), conditional weight at 20 months was positively associated to the risk of HWP [relative risk: 1.59 (95%: confidence interval: 1.32; 1.92)], whereas for small for gestational age (SGA) subjects conditional weight was not associated with HWP [relative risk: 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 0.77; 1.43)], p-value for interaction 0.08. Conclusion Early weight gain among SGA infants, did not increase the risk of HWP in early adulthood, whereas among those who were AGA, early weight gain increased the risk of the having the phenotype in early adulthood."

We investigated the role of LytB (IspH) in M. tuberculosis; M. tuberculosis is unusual in that it has two homologs-LytB1 and LytB2. We were unable to delete the lytB2 gene unless we provided an additional copy elsewhere, demonstrating that this is the essential homolog. We expressed lytB1 from the lytB2 promoter and confirmed that this could not complement for loss of function of lytB2, despite LytB1 possessing all the previously described conserved critical residues. Interestingly the sole LytB homolog of Mycobacterium smegmatis was able to compensate for loss of LytB2 in M. tuberculosis. We tested translational fusions of LytB1 and LytB2 for functionality in M. tuberculosis, but only a fusion with 90% N-terminal LytB2 and 10% C-terminal LytB1 was functional. In order to identify the key difference between the two proteins, site directed mutagenesis was used to change LytB2 residues into their counterparts in LytB1. None of these amino acid substitutions was essential for function and all lytB2 mutant alleles were functional. In contrast, mutation of the key residues for [Fe4S4] cluster formation, as well as a catalytic residue in LytB1 did not result in functional complementation. Thus, although LytB1 and LytB2 are not genetically redundant, this is not dependent on small amino acid changes, but is likely to be a result of major overall structural differences."
https://openalex.org/W1912328919,"Potato virus Y (PVY) is an important plant virus and causes great losses every year. Viral infection often leads to abnormal chloroplasts. The first step of chloroplast division is the formation of FtsZ ring (Z-ring), and the placement of Z-ring is coordinated by the Min system in both bacteria and plants. In our lab, the helper-component proteinase (HC-Pro) of PVY was previously found to interact with the chloroplast division protein NtMinD through a yeast two-hybrid screening assay and a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in vivo. Here, we further investigated the biological significance of the NtMinD/HC-Pro interaction. We purified the NtMinD and HC-Pro proteins using a prokaryotic protein purification system and tested the effect of HC-Pro on the ATPase activity of NtMinD in vitro. We found that the ATPase activity of NtMinD was reduced in the presence of HC-Pro. In addition, another important chloroplast division related protein, NtMinE, was cloned from the cDNA of Nicotiana tabacum. And the NtMinD/NtMinE interaction site was mapped to the C-terminus of NtMinD, which overlaps the NtMinD/HC-Pro interaction site. Yeast three-hybrid assay demonstrated that HC-Pro competes with NtMinE for binding to NtMinD. HC-Pro was previously reported to accumulate in the chloroplasts of PVY-infected tobacco and we confirmed this result in our present work. The NtMinD/NtMinE interaction is very important in the regulation of chloroplast division. To demonstrate the influence of HC-Pro on chloroplast division, we generated HC-Pro transgenic tobacco with a transit peptide to retarget HC-Pro to the chloroplasts. The HC-Pro transgenic plants showed enlarged chloroplasts. Our present study demonstrated that the interaction between HC-Pro and NtMinD interfered with the function of NtMinD in chloroplast division, which results in enlarged chloroplasts in HC-Pro transgenic tobacco. The HC-Pro/NtMinD interaction may cause the formation of abnormal chloroplasts in PVY-infected plants."
https://openalex.org/W1907087188,"Three new species of Koonunga were discovered in surface and subterranean waters in southern Australia, and were defined using mtDNA analyses and morphology. The new species are: Koonunga hornei Leijs & King; K. tatiaraensis Leijs & King and K. allambiensis Leijs & King. Molecular clock analyses indicate that the divergence times of the species are older than the landscape that they currently inhabit. Different scenarios explaining this apparent discrepancy are discussed in the context of the palaeography of the area. A freshwater epigean origin for Koonunga is considered the most likely hypothesis, whereby some lineages made the transition to the subterranean environment within the last few million years influenced by significant climatic cooling/drying. We discuss the possibility that one stygobitic lineage secondarily regained some of its body pigmentation as adaptation to increased photic conditions after cave collapse and forming of cenotes during the last glacial maximum."
https://openalex.org/W1963345785,"Most existing statistical methods developed for calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data are based on Bayesian frameworks, and there does not exist any SNP caller that produces p-values for calling SNPs in a frequentist framework. To fill in this gap, we develop a new method MAFsnp, a Multiple-sample based Accurate and Flexible algorithm for calling SNPs with NGS data. MAFsnp is based on an estimated likelihood ratio test (eLRT) statistic. In practical situation, the involved parameter is very close to the boundary of the parametric space, so the standard large sample property is not suitable to evaluate the finite-sample distribution of the eLRT statistic. Observing that the distribution of the test statistic is a mixture of zero and a continuous part, we propose to model the test statistic with a novel two-parameter mixture distribution. Once the parameters in the mixture distribution are estimated, p-values can be easily calculated for detecting SNPs, and the multiple-testing corrected p-values can be used to control false discovery rate (FDR) at any pre-specified level. With simulated data, MAFsnp is shown to have much better control of FDR than the existing SNP callers. Through the application to two real datasets, MAFsnp is also shown to outperform the existing SNP callers in terms of calling accuracy. An R package “MAFsnp” implementing the new SNP caller is freely available at http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/zhangh/softwares/."
