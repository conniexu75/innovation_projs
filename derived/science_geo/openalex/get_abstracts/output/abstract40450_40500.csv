https://openalex.org/W2037512229,"Protein kinase C activity in rat hippocampal membranes and cytosol was determined 1 minute and 1 hour after induction of the synaptic plasticity of long-term potentiation. At 1 hour after long-term potentiation, but not at 1 minute, protein kinase C activity was increased twofold in membranes and decreased proportionately in cytosol, suggesting translocation of the activity. This time-dependent redistribution of enzyme activity was directly related to the persistence of synaptic plasticity, suggesting a novel mechanism regulating the strength of synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1606060992,"Rabbit brain capillary endothelial cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate produce the metalloproteinases, procollagenase and prostromelysin, as up to 20% of their total secreted protein. However, little or no catalytic activity of these enzymes can be found after treatment with either trypsin or an organomercurial agent, which are able to activate the proenzymes in the medium from stimulated rabbit fibroblasts. We now have shown that enzyme activities of procollagenase and prostromelysin are revealed after conditioned medium is analyzed by gel filtration chromatography or by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-substrate gels. In both systems, the metalloproteinases were separated from metalloproteinase inhibitors. The major inhibitor of Mr = 30,000 from capillary endothelial cells was immunologically identical with the rabbit tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. Two additional inhibitors of metalloproteinases at Mr = 22,000 and 19,000 were also observed. Inhibitors were present in the conditioned medium from rabbit fibroblasts in much lower quantities and were also qualitatively different. When gel filtration chromatography was used to remove the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases from medium conditioned by stimulated capillary endothelial cells, both activatable procollagenase and prostromelysin were readily demonstrable. These data suggest that endogenous inhibitors regulate the expression of metalloproteinases secreted by endothelial cells."

The central administration of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist alpha-helical ovine CRF residues 9 to 41 reversed the inhibitory action of stress. Neither its peripheral injection, nor the intraventricular injection of the inactive CRF analog des-Glu to Arg ovine CRF was effective. These results suggest that endogenous CRF may mediate some deleterious effects of noxious stimuli on reproduction."

Chem. 261, 3060-3067), we have demonstrated that anthracycline antibiotics are reduced to the semiquinone form at Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In the experiments presented in this study we examined the effects of doxorubicin (Adriamycin), daunorubicin, and related quinonoid anticancer agents on superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical production by preparations of beef heart submitochondrial particles. Superoxide anion formation was stimulated from (mean +/- S.E.) 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 69.6 +/- 2.7 or 32.1 +/- 1.5 nmol X min-1 X mg-1 by the addition of 90 microM doxorubicin or daunorubicin, respectively. However, the anthracycline 5-iminodaunorubicin, in which an imine group has been substituted in the C ring quinone moiety, did not increase superoxide production over control levels. In the presence of rotenone, initial rates of oxygen consumption and superoxide formation were identical under comparable experimental conditions. Furthermore, H2O2 production increased from undetectable control levels to 2.2 +/- 0.3 nmol X min-1 X mg-1 after treatment of submitochondrial particles with doxorubicin (200 microM). The hydroxyl radical, or a related chemical oxidant, was also detected after the addition of an anthracycline to this system by both ESR spectroscopy using the spin trap 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide and by gas chromatographic quantitation of CH4 produced from dimethyl sulfoxide. Hydroxyl radical production, which was iron-dependent in this system, occurred in a nonlinear fashion with an initial lag phase due to a requirement for H2O2 accumulation. We also found that two quinonoid anti-cancer agents which produce less cardiotoxicity than the anthracyclines, mitomycin C, and mitoxantrone, stimulated significantly less or no hydroxyl radical production by submitochondrial particles. These experiments suggest that injury to cardiac mitochondria which is produced by anthracycline antibiotics may result from the generation of the hydroxyl radical during anthracycline metabolism by NADH dehydrogenase."

In crosses of NOD mice with control C3H mice, the development of diabetes was dependent on homozygosity for the NOD mouse's unique major histocompatibility region."

https://openalex.org/W2091676399,"Partial amino acid sequence analysis of a purified lymphocyte homing receptor demonstrates the presence of two amino termini, one of which corresponds precisely to the amino terminus of ubiquitin. This observation extends the province of this conserved polypeptide to the cell surface and leads to a proposed model of the receptor complex as a core polypeptide modified by glycosylation and ubiquitination. Independent antibodies to ubiquitin serve to identify additional cell surface species, an indication that ubiquitination of cell surface proteins may be more general. It is proposed that functional binding of lymphocytes to lymph node high endothelial venules might involve the ubiquitinated region of the receptor; if true, cell surface ubiquitin could play a more general role in cell-cell interaction and adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2153709755,"Patients with rheumatic diseases often have circulating autoantibodies to nuclear components. The clinical significance of the antibodies is controversial, although in some cases they are valuable in the diagnosis of the disease. This report presents results of a study of Scl-70, an autoantigen recognized by sera of many patients with the most severe form of progressive systemic sclerosis. It was possible to show, by three independent criteria, that Scl-70 is the abundant nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase I. Therefore, antibody probes of high titer and high affinity are now available for the study of this important nuclear enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2084181643,"The incidence of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) among persons infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) was evaluated prospectively among 725 persons who were at high risk of AIDS and had enrolled before October 1982 in cohort studies of homosexual men, parenteral drug users, and hemophiliacs. A total of 276 (38.1 percent) of the subjects were either HTLV-III seropositive at enrollment or developed HTLV-III antibodies subsequently. AIDS had developed in 28 (10.1 percent) of the seropositive subjects before August 1985. By actuarial survival calculations, the 3-year incidence of AIDS among all HTLV-III seropositive subjects was 34.2 percent in the cohort of homosexual men in Manhattan, New York, and 14.9 percent (range 8.0 to 17.2 percent) in the four other cohorts. Out of 117 subjects followed for a mean of 31 months after documented seroconversion, five (all hemophiliacs) developed AIDS 28 to 62 months after the estimated date of seroconversion, supporting the hypothesis that there is a long latency between acquisition of viral infection and the development of clinical AIDS. This long latency could account for the significantly higher AIDS incidence in the New York cohort compared with other cohorts if the virus entered the New York homosexual population before it entered the populations from which the other cohorts were drawn. However, risk of AIDS development in different populations may also depend on the presence of as yet unidentified cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W2061286251,"When the human T-cell line A3.01 is infected with HTLV-III/LAV, the virus associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), most of the cells are killed. However, a small number of cells that lack the Leu-3 surface marker survive. Under normal conditions these surviving cells do not produce virus, nor can they be infected by the virus, but they can be induced to produce virus by treatment with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. This response can be induced for as long as 3 months after the initial infection, suggesting that the cells may harbor a latent form of HTLV-III/LAV."
https://openalex.org/W2027875921,"The intron of the mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (r1 intron) possesses a 235 codon long internal open reading frame (r1 ORF) whose translation product determines the duplicative transposition of that intron during crosses between intron-plus strains (omega+) and intron-minus ones (omega-). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have constructed a universal code equivalent of the r1 ORF that, under appropriate promoter control, allows the overexpression in E. coli of a protein identical to the mitochondrial intron encoded ""transposase"". This protein exhibits a double strand endonuclease activity specific for the omega- site. This finding demonstrates, for the first time, the enzymatic activity of an intron encoded protein whose function is to promote the spreading of that intron by generating double strand breaks at a specific sequence within a gene."
https://openalex.org/W1999059818,"Comparison of HTLV-III, the putative AIDS virus, with other related viruses, may help to reveal more about the origin of AIDS in humans. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the gag and pol genes of an equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) proviral DNA clone was determined. The sequence was compared with that of HTLV-III and of visna, a pathogenic lentivirus of sheep. The results show that these viruses constitute a family clearly distinct from that of the type C viruses or the BLV-HTLV-I and -II group. Within the family, EIAV, HTLV-III, and visna appear to be equally divergent from a common evolutionary ancestor."

https://openalex.org/W1523071123,"We have characterized the biosynthesis of two metalloproteinases, procollagenase and prostromelysin, by rabbit brain capillary endothelial cells (RBCE) by means of immunochemical, biosynthetic, and functional assays. Unstimulated RBCE secreted no detectable metalloproteinases. Secretion of both procollagenase and prostromelysin was induced within 6 h by treating the cells with 50 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In treated cells, the two proenzymes accounted for up to 20% of the [35S]methionine-labeled secreted proteins; about 15 micrograms of each protein was secreted in 48 h by 10(6) RBCE. Although RBCE secreted approximately as much procollagenase and prostromelysin as did rabbit fibroblasts, virtually no enzyme activity could be measured in RBCE-conditioned medium, even after activation of the proenzymes by trypsin or an organomercurial agent."
https://openalex.org/W2061680046,Seventeen base pairs of DNA from SV40 origin region I encode a tripartite binding site for a dimeric mass of SV40 large T antigen. Two binding components are the directly repeated pentanucleotide sequences 5′-GAGGC-3′/5′-GCCTC-3′. The third component is the asymmetric sequence 5′-TTTTTTG-3′/5′-CAAAAAA-3′ that separates the pentanucleotides. Nucleotide-specific features of this spacer element stabilize binding to the adjacent pentanucleotides. We report here that the spacer sequence determines a DNA conformation that correlates with high affinity binding of T antigen. The nature of the spacer sequence suggests that the DNA is bent. We propose that binding of T antigen to region I proceeds through monomer-pentanucleotide interactions and either protein-protein or protein-spacer interactions directed by the spacer-encoded structure.
https://openalex.org/W1998916083,"Gene fusion experiments were used to identify signals that direct imported precursor proteins to specific intramitochondrial locations in yeast. The amino terminus of alcohol dehydrogenase III (ADHIII, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme) transported attached mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, a cytosolic enzyme) into the mitochondrial matrix. The presequence of cytochrome c1 (a mitochondrial inner membrane protein protruding into the intermembrane space) transported attached DHFR into the intermembrane space. The first half of the cytochrome c1 presequence, which resembles the ADHIII presequence, is a matrix-targeting sequence: it transported attached DHFR into the matrix. The second half of the cytochrome c1 presequence contains a stretch of 19 uncharged amino acids and may thus be a stop-transfer sequence. We conclude that intramitochondrial sorting involves matrix-targeting and stop-transfer sequences within the cleavable presequence."
https://openalex.org/W1568167591,"Numerous hormones are known to rapidly activate polyphosphoinositide turnover in target cells by promoting phosphodiesteratic cleavage of the phospholipids; however, little is known about the enzymology of receptor-mediated phosphoinositide breakdown. In the present study, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation of polyphosphoinositide turnover has been characterized in electrically permeabilized, [3H]myoinositol-labeled GH3 cells. The permeable cells allow the influence of small molecular weight (Mr less than or equal to 1000) cofactors to be determined. We present evidence for the following: 1) TRH stimulates inositol phosphate generation in permeable cells; 2) optimal hormone-stimulated inositol phosphate generation requires Mg2+, ATP, and Ca2+; 3) Mg2+ and ATP requirements reflect polyphosphoinositide kinase reactions; 4) in the absence of MgATP, TRH stimulates the phosphodiesteratic breakdown of pre-existing polyphosphoinositides in a reaction which requires only low Ca2+ (10(-7) M); 5) hormone activation is potentiated in the presence of the stable guanine nucleotide, GTP gamma S; neither TRH-stimulated nor GTP gamma S-potentiated hydrolysis is inhibited by cholera or pertussis toxin treatment. These results demonstrate that hormone-induced phospholipid hydrolysis involves activation of a phosphoinositide phosphodiesterase; activation results in lowering the Ca2+ requirement of the phosphodiesterase such that maximal activity is observed at Ca2+ levels characteristic of a resting cell (10(-7) M). Furthermore, TRH regulation of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis is modulated by guanine nucleotides; however, nucleotide regulation appears to involve a GTP-binding factor (Np) other than Ns or Ni."
https://openalex.org/W2094808389,RNA transcripts encoding the complete human glucose transporter (GT) or fragments of GT corresponding to the NH2-terminal 340 amino acids (GT-N) or the COOH-terminal 148 amino acids (GT-C) were synthesized in vitro from SP6 plasmids. The corresponding polypeptides were synthesized in reticulocyte or wheat germ cell-free systems and their insertion into pancreatic microsomes was assessed by endoglycosidase H and trypsin digestion or alkaline extraction of membranes. The following observations were made: both GT and GT-N can insert posttranslationally into microsomes; GT contains at least two distinct signal sequences; both co- and posttranslational insertion of GT-N are mediated by a signal recognition particle (SRP)-SRP receptor-dependent mechanism; and SRP is required both for targeting the polypeptide to the membrane and for initiating the actual insertion process. We propose a model for the biosynthesis of GT and proteins of similar membrane topology which does not require a tight ribosome-membrane interaction.
https://openalex.org/W25867637,"A single exon in the gene for the receptor for plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) encodes a region of clustered serine and threonine residues that is immediately external to the membrane-spanning sequence. This region has been proposed as the site of clustered O-linked carbohydrate chains. In the current studies we have deleted the 144 base pairs (48 amino acids) that encode this serine- and threonine-rich region from the cDNA for the human LDL receptor. Upon transfection into receptor-deficient hamster fibroblasts, this mutated cDNA encoded a shortened receptor that no longer showed an anomalously high molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeling with [3H]glucosamine confirmed the lack of clustered O-linked sugars and further revealed that the shortened receptor and the normal receptor both contained isolated O-linked carbohydrate chains attached to the NH2-terminal portion of the protein. The ratio of clustered to isolated O-linked sugar chains in the normal receptor was estimated to be approximately 4-6 to 1. Despite the loss of clustered O-linked carbohydrate, the LDL receptor encoded by the deletion-bearing cDNA bound and internalized LDL normally. It also recycled normally and exhibited a normal half-life. We conclude that: 1) the serine- and threonine-rich region of the LDL receptor is the site for addition of clustered O-linked carbohydrates; 2) the receptor contains a small number of isolated chains of O-linked carbohydrates in addition to the clustered chains; and 3) the clustered O-linked carbohydrates are not essential for LDL receptor function in cultured hamster fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2002768000,"The lymphocyte cell surface receptor for the high endothelial venules (HEV's) of peripheral lymph nodes is specifically recognized by the monoclonal antibody MEL-14. Three independent complementary DNA (cDNA) clones, each of which encodes the protein ubiquitin, were detected by virtue of the expression of the MEL-14 antigenic determinant on cDNA-beta-galactosidase bacterial fusion proteins. The antigenic determinant defined by MEL-14 resides in the carboxyl terminal 13-amino-acid proteolytic peptide of ubiquitin, but is undetected in intact undenatured ubiquitin and other cellular ubiquitinated proteins. Antisera and monoclonal antibodies to ubiquitin determinants bind to the surface of both HEV-receptor positive and negative cell lines. The MEL-14-identified cDNA clones hydridize to RNA transcripts that encode tandemly repeated ubiquitins. Sequence analysis of these polyubiquitin cDNA's does not identify a leader sequence for export to the cell surface. The expression of the MEL-14 epitope of ubiquitin depends upon its local environment. The steady-state levels of expression of the ubiquitin messenger RNA's do not correlate with either the tissue derivation of the RNA or the expression of the lymphocyte HEV receptor. Regulation of the expression of the HEV receptor is not likely to reflect the transcriptional control of ubiquitin genes, but rather to reflect control of the expression of the HEV core polypeptide or its level or form of ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1536992430,"Stimulation of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) by a phospholipase C to produce inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol appears to be the initial step in signal transduction for a number of cell-surface interacting stimuli, including thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). In suspensions of membranes isolated from rat pituitary (GH3) cells that were prelabeled to isotopic steady state with [3H]inositol and incubated with ATP, [3H] PtdIns(4,5)P2, and [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, the polyphosphoinositides, and [3H]InsP3 and [3H]inositol bisphosphate, the inositol polyphosphates, accumulated. TRH and GTP stimulated the accumulation of [3H]inositol polyphosphates in time- and concentration-dependent manners; half-maximal effects occurred with 10-30 nM TRH and with 3 microM GTP. A nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP also stimulated [3H] inositol polyphosphate accumulation. Moreover, when TRH and GTP were added together their effects were more than additive. Fixing the free Ca2+ concentration in the incubation buffer at 20 nM, a value below that present in the cytoplasm in vivo did not inhibit stimulation by TRH and GTP of [3H]inositol polyphosphate accumulation. ATP was necessary for basal and stimulated accumulation of [3H]inositol polyphosphates, and a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP could not substitute for ATP. These data demonstrate that TRH and GTP act synergistically to stimulate the accumulation of InsP3 in suspensions of pituitary membranes and that ATP, most likely acting as substrate for polyphosphoinositide synthesis, was necessary for this effect. These findings suggest that a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein is involved in coupling the TRH receptor to a phospholipase C that hydrolyzes PtdIns(4,5)P2."
https://openalex.org/W2161270866,"Reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T (REV-T) is a highly oncogenic avian retrovirus that transforms early lymphoid cells in vivo and in vitro, but REV-T does not transform chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Using antisera to p59v-rel, the v-rel oncogene product of REV-T, we show that p59v-rel is expressed at equal levels and is a phosphoprotein in REV-T infected spleen cells and CEF. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence of REV-T infected nontransformed CEF show that p59v-rel is loosely associated with the nucleus. However, in REV-T transformed spleen cells p59v-rel is primarily a cytoplasmic protein. MSB-1 cells, a Marek's disease virus transformed T cell leukemic line, and E26 virus transformed myeloid cells show nuclear staining of p59v-rel when they are infected by REV-T. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between a cytoplasmic localization of p59v-rel and transformation by REV-T, and they suggest that p59v-rel cannot transform cells in which it assumes solely a nuclear location."
https://openalex.org/W1550626060,"The specificities of cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinases were studied using synthetic peptides corresponding to the phosphorylation site in 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/Fru-2,6-P2ase (Murray, K.J., El-Maghrabi, M.R., Kountz, P.D., Lukas, T.J., Soderling, T.R., and Pilkis, S.J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7673-7681) as substrates. The peptide Val-Leu-Gln-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ser-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase on predominantly the first of its 2 seryl residues. The Km (4 microM) and Vmax (14 mumol/min/mg) values were comparable to those for the phosphorylation of this site within native 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/Fru-2,6-P2ase. An analog peptide containing only two arginines was phosphorylated with poorer kinetic constants than was the parent peptide. These results suggest that the amino acid sequence at its site of phosphorylation is a major determinant that makes 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/Fru-2,6-P2ase an excellent substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Although 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/Fru-2,6-P2ase was not phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase, the synthetic peptide corresponding to the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site was a relatively good substrate (Km = 33 microM, Vmax = 1 mumol/min/mg). Thus, structures other than the primary sequence at the phosphorylation site must be responsible for the inability of cGMP-dependent protein kinase to phosphorylate native 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/Fru-2,6-P2ase. Peptides containing either a -Ser-Ser- or -Thr-Ser- moiety were all phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent kinase to 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide, but the phosphate was distributed between the two hydroxyamino acids. Substitution of a proline in place of the glycine between the three arginines and these phosphorylatable amino acids caused the protein kinase selectively to phosphorylate the threonyl or first seryl residue and also enhanced the Vmax values by 4-6-fold. These results are consistent with a role for proline in allowing an adjacent threonyl residue to be readily phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2087437369,"We sought to determine whether decreased in vitro GTPase activity is uniformly associated with ras p21 mutants possessing efficient transforming properties. Normal H-ras p21-[Gly12-Ala59] as well as an H-ras p21-[Gly12-Thr59] mutant exhibited in vitro GTPase activities at least fivefold higher than either H-ras p21-[Lys12-Ala59] or H-ras p21-[Arg12-Thr59] mutants. Microinjection of as much as 6 X 10(6) molecules/cell of bacterially expressed normal H-ras p21 induced no detectable alterations of NIH/3T3 cells. In contrast, inoculation of 4-5 X 10(5) molecules/cell of each p21 mutant induced morphologic alterations and stimulated DNA synthesis. Moreover, the transforming activity of each mutant expressed in a eukaryotic vector was similar and at least 100-fold greater than that of the normal H-ras gene. These findings establish that activation of efficient transforming properties by ras p21 proteins can occur by mechanisms not involving reduced in vitro GTPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1992870468,"Several acute transforming retroviruses encode tyrosine-specific protein kinases which possess structural and functional relationships to cell-surface receptors for certain growth factors1,2. One such tyrosine kinase is encoded by the onc gene, v-fgr, of Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma virus (GR-FeSV)3–6. Recently, we have isolated and characterized the human gene, c-fgr, corresponding to the viral onc sequence and have shown that c-fgr is a unique gene located on the short arm of chromosome 1 (ref. 7). Here we report that certain lymphomas (but not sarcomas or carcinomas) express fgr-related messenger RNA. This transcript is detected in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines naturally infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but not in EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Normal umbilical cord or peripheral blood lymphocyte lines established in vitro by EBV infection also contain detectable c-fgr mRNA. Moreover, a 50-fold increase of the steady-state c-fgr mRNA concentration is observed when uninfected Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines are deliberately infected with EBV. These findings demonstrate for the first time the induction of a proto-oncogene in response to infection by a DNA tumour virus."
https://openalex.org/W1913594771,"Interleukin 2 (IL 2) stimulated DNA synthesis of murine T lymphocytes (CT6) in a concentration-dependent manner, over a range of 1-1000 units/ml. This proliferative effect of IL 2 was attenuated by simultaneous exposure to prostaglandin E2 (PGE)2. In intact cells, IL 2 inhibited both basal and PGE2-stimulated cAMP production; the amount of cAMP generated was dependent upon the relative concentrations of IL 2 and PGE2. The effect of IL 2 on CT6 cell proliferation and cAMP production was mimicked by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which, like IL 2, causes a translocation and activation of protein kinase C. While PGE2 stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membrane preparations, neither IL 2 nor TPA inhibited either basal or stimulated membrane adenylate cyclase activity. However, when CT6 cells were pretreated with IL 2 or TPA and membranes incubated with calcium and ATP, both basal and PGE2-and NaF-stimulated membrane adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited. This inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was also observed if membranes from untreated cells were incubated with protein kinase C purified from CT6 lymphocytes in the presence of calcium and ATP. The data suggest that the decreased cAMP production which accompanies CT6 cell proliferation results from an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity mediated by protein kinase C and that these two distinct protein phosphorylating systems interact to modulate the physiological response to IL 2."
https://openalex.org/W1516808498,"Abstract The Schizosaccharomyces pombe acid phosphatase structural gene (PHO 1) was isolated by complementation of an S. pombe acid phosphatase mutant with a wild type S. pombe DNA recombinant plasmid library. Northern analysis indicates that acid phosphatase is encoded by a 1.4-kilobase mRNA of which approximately 100 bases are 3'-poly(A). The gene contains no introns and the 3' and 5' untranslated regions are short. According to DNA and amino acid sequence data, the S. pombe acid phosphatase has a molecular weight of 50,600. An 18-amino acid sequence at the N terminus was found that is similar to previously identified signal peptides in other eukaryotic secretory proteins. This signal peptide is apparently removed during secretion, since it is absent in the mature secreted acid phosphatase. The gene can be induced 2--3-fold by starvation for phosphate. The signals required for this induction are contained on the isolated DNA clone. Although the gene can be expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, secretion is abnormal."

https://openalex.org/W1604047450,"Quin 2-loaded isolated rabbit gastric glands and purified peptic cells were used to measure free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) during hormone stimulation. Rabbit gastric glands are composed of peptic and parietal cells with less than 1% endocrine cells. Although both cell types responded to the same hormones, they may be distinguished in terms of the source of Ca2+ bringing about the change in [Ca2+]i. Experiments were designed to assign changes in [Ca2+]i to either the peptic or parietal cells and to attempt to maintain these distinctions in the mixed cell population of gastric glands. It was shown that the peptide cholecystokinin octapeptide induced a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i of isolated peptic cells. This signal was independent of medium Ca2+ and insensitive to the Ca2+ channel blockers La3+ and nifedipine. In gastric glands, the Ca2+ outdependent increase in (Ca2+)i (the secondary transient) was slower and dose dependently blocked by La3+ and nifedipine. This allowed [Ca2+]i levels in the physiologically more intact rabbit gastric glands to be dissected and correlated with fluorescence changes of quin 2 in either cell type. The transient increase in [Ca2+]i coincided with a burst of pepsin but not acid secretion. A subsequent slower phase of pepsin secretion took place while the cells restored near resting [Ca2+]i. Using a combination of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and the protein kinase C activating phorbol ester 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol 13-acetate, the hormone response pattern of pepsin secretion could be mimicked. The intracellular Ca2+ stores of the peptic cells in the gastric gland remained depleted of Ca2+ until specific antagonists were added. The reloading of intracellular stores required medium Ca2+ although [Ca2+]i was maintained at resting level during the entire reloading period. Hence, a specialized pathway of Ca2+ reloading is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W154960530,"Forskolin is thought to be a highly specific activator of adenyl cyclase. However, when applied to rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells at concentrations of 1 microM or higher it caused an immediate, concentration-dependent inhibition of carbachol-stimulated uptake of 86Rb+ through the nicotinic receptors, which did not appear to be related to activation of adenyl cyclase. The inhibition of receptor activation occurred instantaneously whereas cellular cAMP content did not increase for a measureable period of time. Normal receptor function was recovered rapidly upon removal of forskolin. Additional evidence that this effect of forskolin was not related to cAMP was obtained when 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (an analog of forskolin which does not activate adenyl cyclase) also caused a rapid, concentration-dependent, rapidly reversible inhibition of receptor-mediated influx of 86Rb+ into the cells. An examination of the effect of forskolin on 86Rb+ uptake at various concentrations of carbachol showed that forskolin was not acting by competing with carbachol for the receptor activation site. Given the lipophilic nature of forskolin, it probably acts like a general anesthetic to perturb the plasma membrane lipid structure and alter the function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, possibly by increasing the rate of closure of open channels."

This fusion did not map in any of the known genes of the malA or malB region, but its expression was under control of malT, the positive regulator gene of the maltose regulon. The gene in which the fusion occurred mapped between xyl and mtl at 80 min on the linkage map and was transcribed clockwise. We define this gene as malS. The malS-lacZ fusion was transferred onto a phage lambda vector and the 5' portion of malS was subcloned into pBR322. The resulting plasmid was used as a probe to identify the intact malS gene in a lambda library of E. coli chromosomal HindIII fragments. The phage that hybridized with the probe contained a 12-kilobase insert. The malS containing portion was subcloned into pBR322 as a 4-kilobase ClaI-HindIII fragment. This plasmid directed the malT and maltose-dependent synthesis of a periplasmic protein of 66,000 apparent molecular weight. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed maltodextrins longer than maltose including cyclic dextrins. The primary products of hydrolysis were glucose, maltose, and maltotriose, even when maltotetraose was used as a substrate. These properties differentiate this periplasmic enzyme from the cytoplasmic amylomaltase and define it as an alpha-amylase."
https://openalex.org/W1515388283,"Resting human T-lymphocytes show an elevated intracellular concentration of ferritin, whereas transferrin receptors are not detectable. Stimulation by phytohemagglutinin markedly lowers their ferritin content, while inducing the synthesis of transferrin receptors. Addition of iron salts (ferric ammonium citrate) in activated T-lymphocyte cultures causes a marked enhancement of both [3H]uridine and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Nevertheless, it also induces a concentration-dependent decrease in transferrin receptor synthesis, associated with a marked rise of ferritin production. Hemin treatment exerts the same effects. Addition of picolinic acid in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cultures causes a decrease of [3H]thymidine incorporation, whereas transferrin expression is markedly enhanced. The action of iron salts and chelators is specific for transferrin receptors, since the expression of other membrane markers of activated human T-lymphocytes (interleukin-2 receptor, insulin receptor, and HLA-DR antigen) is not modified by treatment with iron or picolinic acid. These observations suggest that expression of transferrin receptors in activated T-lymphocytes is specifically modulated by their intracellular iron level, rather than their proliferative rate. Addition of picolinic acid to resting T-lymphocytes in the absence of mitogen induces a marked decrease of their ferritin content, but not the appearance of transferrin receptors. On the basis of these results, we suggest a three-step model: (a) in resting T-lymphocytes, the gene for transferrin receptor is apparently closed, in that it is not expressed under both normal conditions and following iron deprivation. (b) After mitogen stimulus, T-lymphocytes are reprogrammed into cell cycle progression, which necessarily entails synthesis of transferrin receptors (c) Expression of these receptors is modulated by the intracellular iron level, rather than the rate of proliferation per se."
https://openalex.org/W1558430307,"The binding of the competitive thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) antagonist (9,11-dimethylmethano-11, 12-methano-16-(3-aza-15 alpha beta-omega-tetranor-TXA2) ([125I]PTA-OH) to membranes prepared from human platelets was characterized. [125I]PTA-OH binding to membranes from human platelets was saturable, displaceable, and dependent on protein concentration. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding carried out at 30 degrees C revealed one class of binding sites with a Kd of 30 +/- 4 nM and a Bmax of 1.8 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg of protein (n = 5). Kinetic analysis of the binding of [125I]PTA-OH at 0 degrees C yielded a k1 of 1.35 X 10(6) M-1 min-1 and a k-1 of 0.032 min-1, Kd = k-1/k1 = 24 nM. The potencies of a series of TXA2/PGH2 antagonists as inhibitors of [125I]PTA-OH binding was correlated with their potencies as inhibitors of platelet aggregation induced by the TXA2/PGH2 mimetic, U46619 (1 microM) (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01). A series of TXA2/PGH2 mimetics also displaced [125I]PTA-OH from its binding site, and their potencies as inhibitors of [125I]PTA-OH binding were correlated with their potencies as stimulators of platelet aggregation (r = 0.91, p less than 0.05). The IC50 values for displacement of [125I]PTA-OH by PGF2 alpha, PGD2, and the stable PGI2 analog Iloprost were greater than 25 microM, suggesting that [125I]PTA-OH does not bind to other known platelet prostaglandin receptors. These data are consistent with the notion that this binding site may represent the platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptor."

The activity introduces a double-strand cut in the vicinity of the recombination site of immunoglobulin joining gene segments. The cleavage occurs at the dinucleotide pair TG-AC. This activity is a good candidate for the putative endonuclease involved in recombination of the immunoglobulin variable, diversity, and joining regions. It is distinct from the endonuclease activities previously reported by others."

(1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6284-6291). To determine whether the 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) receptor was localized to the nuclear matrix, we studied the subnuclear distribution of [125I]T3-receptor complexes after treatment of nuclei with DNase I and 2 M NaCl to facilitate removal of histones. After incubation with 5 nM [125I]T3 to exchange with 80-90% of nuclear T3 receptors, the nuclear matrix fraction contained less than 1% of nuclear DNA, 16.5% of nuclear protein, and 30-50% (mean, 40.0 +/- 2.3%) of specifically bound [125I]T3. Control experiments showed that nuclear matrix [125I]T3 did not appear exchangeable with added 5 nM T3 and did not result from release and nonspecific precipitation of [125I]T3 or [125I]T3-receptor complexes during nuclear matrix preparation. Studies with the T3 photoaffinity probe, N-2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyl-[125I]T3 resulted in the finding of limited capacity receptor forms, 58,000 and 46,000 kDa, in the nuclear matrix. These receptor forms were identical to those observed when N-2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyl-[125I]T3-labeled receptors were solubilized directly from nuclei. Lastly, limited capacity [125I]T3 binding was demonstrated in 0.4 M KCl buffer extracts of nuclear matrix. Binding displacement studies suggested that 46% of the binding activity solubilized from nuclear matrix exchanged with [125I]T3 and that the apparent equilibrium association constant of this binding activity was similar to that of 0.4 M KCl extracts of isolated nuclei. These results suggest that an appreciable fraction of nuclear T3 receptors is localized to the nuclear matrix and may influence the expression of thyroid hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W1711714748,"We have isolated and characterized a cDNA recombinant plasmid (pRLC429) specific for the rat heart myosin light chain 2 (MLC2). The cDNA insert consists of 446 base pairs, including a 72-base pair segment of the 3'-untranslated region. Additional 5'-sequence, not present in plasmid pRLC429, was obtained by primer extension of the cDNA. The extended cDNA sequence combined with the plasmid pRLC429 sequence provided the codon information for the entire MLC2 polypeptide and partial sequences for the 3'- and 5'-noncoding regions of MLC2 mRNA. The predicted amino acid sequence for rat heart MLC2 showed a high homology with the sequences available for the chicken (83%) and human heart (80%) MLC2s. However, the homology between rat heart MLC2 and its counterpart in rat skeletal muscle is relatively low (67%). On the basis of the nuclease S1 protection assay with uniformly labeled single-stranded pRLC429 DNA, subcloned into M13mp18 phage vector, we conclude that the rat atrial muscle also contains MLC2 of the ventricular type. In an attempt to ascertain whether structural variants of MLC2 are expressed in hypertrophic heart muscle, we examined the RNAs from spontaneously hypertensive rat where there is a natural progression of hypertrophy associated with an increase in blood pressure. The RNA isolated from 7-, 13-, and 18-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts protected the same length DNA against S1 nuclease as was observed with RNAs from the age-matched normal rat hearts, suggesting that there is a single MLC2 gene transcript expressed in both the normal and hypertrophic heart muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1587932385,"Cells of Vibrio costicola at pH 8.5 generate both membrane potential (inside negative) and delta pH (inside acidic) in the presence of a proton conductor, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). The generation of CCCP-resistant membrane potential was inhibited by 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide that is known to inhibit the Na+-motive NADH oxidase of Vibrio alginolyticus. NADH oxidase, but not lactate oxidase, of inverted membrane vesicles prepared from V. costicola required Na+ for a maximum activity and was inhibited by 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide. By the oxidation of NADH, inverted membrane vesicles generated concentration gradients of Na+ across the membrane, whose magnitude was always larger than that of delta pH by about 50 mV. In contrast, magnitudes of delta pH and Na+ concentration gradients generated by the oxidation of lactate were similar. Na+ translocation in the presence of lactate was inhibited by CCCP but little affected by valinomycin. On the other hand, Na+ translocation in the presence of NADH was resistant to CCCP and stimulated by valinomycin. Amiloride, an inhibitor for a eucaryotic Na+/H+ antiport system, inhibited the lactate-dependent Na+ translocation but had little effect on the NADH-dependent Na+ translocation. These results indicate that a primary event of lactate oxidation is the translocation of H+, which then causes the generation of Na+ concentration gradients via the secondary Na+/H+ antiport system. We conclude that the NADH oxidase of V. costicola translocates Na+ as an immediate result of respiration, leading to the generation of Na+ electrochemical potential."

Hybridization studies with viral and cellular DNA clones confirm that the viral and cellular proteins are related. Following RPV infection, the Pol II subunit is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic virosomes, then packaged into mature virus, and is found associated with the viral RNA polymerase purified from virions. The results suggest that the cellular Pol II subunit may be directly involved in the transcription of viral genes."
https://openalex.org/W1542058929,"The phosphorylation activity associated with a neurofilament-enriched cytoskeletal preparation isolated from the squid giant axon has been studied and compared to the phosphorylation activities in intact squid axoplasm. The high molecular weight (greater than 300 kDa) and 220-kDa neurofilament proteins are the major endogenous substrates for the kinases in the axoplasm and the neurofilament preparation, whereas 95- and less than 60-kDa proteins are the major phosphoproteins in the ganglion cell preparation. The squid axon neurofilament (SANF) protein kinase activity appeared to be both cAMP and Ca2+ independent and could phosphorylate both casein (Km = 40 microM) and histone (Km = 180 microM). The SANF protein kinase could utilize either ATP or GTP in the phosphotransferase reaction, with a Km for ATP of 58 microM and 129.4 microM for GTP when casein was used as the exogenous substrate; and 25 and 98.1 microM for ATP and GTP, respectively, when the endogenous neurofilament proteins were used as substrates. The SANF protein kinase activity was only slightly inhibited by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and various polyamines at high concentrations and was poorly inhibited by heparin (34% inhibition at 100 micrograms/ml). The failures of heparin to significantly inhibit and the polyamines to stimulate the SANF protein kinase indicate that it is not a casein type II kinase. The relative efficacy of GTP as a phosphate donor indicates that SANF protein kinase differs from known casein type I kinases. Phosphorylated (32P-labeled) neurofilament proteins were only slightly dephosphorylated in the presence of axoplasm or stellate ganglion cell supernatants, and the neurofilament-enriched preparation did not dephosphorylate 32P-labeled neurofilament proteins. The axoplasm and neurofilament preparations had no detectable protein kinase inhibitor activity, but a strong inhibitor activity, which was not dialyzable but was heat inactivatable, was found in ganglion cells. This inhibitor activity may account for the low phosphorylation activity found in the stellate ganglion cells and may indicate inhibitory regulation of SANF protein kinase activity in the ganglion cell bodies."
https://openalex.org/W1554705329,"Recently published data indicate that the alpha-subunit of Na,K-ATPase, a transmembrane protein of animal cell plasma membranes, is synthesized as a precursor. In the present experiments we demonstrate that an apparent soluble form can indeed be detected in crude cytosolic fractions prepared by centrifugation from MDCK cells disrupted by sonication. We find, however, that this form has no precursor-product relationship with membrane-associated alpha-subunit. The quantity of unsedimentable alpha-subunit can be greatly diminished by increasing the centrifugal field employed to remove membranous vesicles from the cytosol fraction. Sonication of membrane pellets generates alpha-subunit which, like the soluble form, resists pelleting. Finally, cytosol fractions prepared from cells disrupted by sonication contain membrane-bound vesicles which can be immunoadsorbed on Staphylococcus aureus cells coated with a monoclonal antibody directed against alpha-subunit. We find, therefore, that the previously observed precursor of alpha-subunit is actually a component of small unpelleted membrane vesicles generated by harsh disruption conditions. When cells are disrupted by less violent techniques no newly synthesized alpha-subunit can be detected in the cytosol fraction. We calculate that to escape detection under our experimental conditions a bona fide precursor of alpha-subunit must have a cytosolic t1/2 less than 20 s. We conclude that the alpha-subunit is most probably inserted into the bilayer cotranslationally."
https://openalex.org/W1565185359,"An S-S cross-linking reagent, Cu2+-o-phenanthroline, increased the 36Cl-/Cl- exchange rate across the hog gastric vesicle membrane, which contains H,K-ATPase, but did not affect the 86Rb+/Rb+ exchange rate. The results show that closed Cl- conductance can be opened by S-S cross-linking. Gastric vesicles with opened Cl- conductance could take up H+ upon addition of MgATP without prolonged preincubation in a solution containing K+. Preincubation of gastric vesicles with picoprazole, which is a specific inhibitor of H,K-ATPase and binds to 100-kDa polypeptides of the enzyme, dose dependently inhibited opening of the Cl- conductance by Cu2+-o-phenanthroline, indicating that the Cl- conductance is part of the function of the H,K-ATPase. The effect of picoprazole was greater at alkaline pH than at acidic pH. Another H,K-ATPase inhibitor, 2-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxy)-pyridylmethylsulfinyl] (5-methoxycarbonyl-6-methyl)-benzimidazole (H compound), had a similar but stronger effect on the Cl- conductance than that of picoprazole. A pungent ingredient of curry, allylisothiocyanate, caused similar pH-dependent inhibition to that of picoprazole. However, another substituted benzimidazole, omeprazole, did not inhibit Cl- conductance. Substituted benzimidazoles, such as picoprazole, H compound, and omeprazole, inhibited the H,K-ATPase activity progressively with a decrease in pH of the medium. This pH dependence was the reverse of that in inhibition of Cl- conductance, suggesting that the inhibitory site of Cl- conductance is different from that of the H,K-ATPase activity and that the conformational states of the two sites change in different ways with change in pH of the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1562879984,"Nitrendipine binding has been evaluated in a highly enriched sarcolemma preparation isolated from canine ventricle. The binding was found to be specific, saturable, rapid, and reversible. The dissociation constant (Kd) determined by equilibrium binding studies at 20 degrees C was 0.0880 nM. The Kd increased to 0.670 nM at 37 degrees C. The maximal binding capacity of this preparation ranged from 437 to 1775 fmol/mg protein and was not significantly affected by changes in temperature between 20 and 37 degrees C. The Kd, determined kinetically from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (k-1/k1), was 0.112 and 0.285 nM at 20 and 37 degrees C, respectively. In order to test the hypothesis that nitrendipine binding changes with membrane potential potassium, Nernst potentials were developed, in the presence of valinomycin, by the establishment of potassium gradients across the vesicular membrane. Evaluation of the rates of dissociation of [3H]nitrendipine from the sarcolemma preparation identified a component of binding that was rapidly lost when the transmembrane potential was polarized to inside-negative values. The magnitude of the loss of nitrendipine binding was 25-27% at the most negative potentials examined. Evaluation of the rate of association of nitrendipine revealed that the component of binding that was rapidly lost upon hyperpolarization of the membrane returned over a time course similar to the rate of dissipation of the membrane potential, suggesting that the effects of potential on nitrendipine binding are reversible. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that nitrendipine binding affinity changes with membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1541513319,"The effects of insulin on the ability of the specific intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase antagonist, the Rp diastereomer of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate, to inhibit glycogenolysis induced by the Sp diastereomer was studied in hepatocytes isolated from fed rats. Addition of the cAMP agonist, (Sp)-cAMPS, to hepatocytes resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in glycogenolytic glucose production concomitant with the cAMP-dependent activation of phosphorylase and inhibition of glycogen synthase. Activity curves were shifted to the right in the presence of the cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS. Preincubation of the hepatocytes with a maximally effective concentration of insulin did not affect the concentration of (Sp)-cAMPS required for half-maximal activation of phosphorylase but did result in a 10-fold shift in the concentration of (Sp)-cAMPS required for half-maximal inactivation of glycogen synthase. Preincubation of hepatocytes with a combination of the cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS, and insulin resulted in synergistic inhibition of (Sp)-cAMPS-induced phosphorylase activation, glycogen synthase inactivation, and glycogenolytic glucose production. Since neither phosphorothioate diastereomer was hydrolyzed significantly during the course of the experiments, the synergistic effects of insulin are postulated to be working through a mechanism subsequent to the phosphodiesterase activation step."
https://openalex.org/W1510471614,"To investigate the role of evolutionarily invariant leucine 32 of horse cytochrome c, analogs of residues 28-38, (28-38), each containing a substituted amino acid at positions 32 or 35 were synthesized using Merrifield's method. Position 35 is leucine in horse cytochrome c but replaced by nonpolar amino acids in some species. The ability of the analogs to bind to the two-fragment complex of ferri- or ferro heme fragment (1-25)H and apofragment (39-104) was measured using gel filtration and equilibrium dialysis. Replacement of leucine 32 with isoleucine, for example, increased the dissociation constant by more than 400-fold for the ferrous complex. In contrast, replacement of leucine 35 with isoleucine seems to increase it only by a small degree. Since both leucine 32 and leucine 35 are completely buried within the structure, hydrophobic interaction would not explain this striking difference. However, thermodynamic analyses and absorption spectra of the ferric complex have indicated that replacement with norvaline of leucine 32 increases both delta H and delta S (more positive) associated with formation of an intermediate three-fragment complex and decreases both delta H and delta S (more negative) associated with transformation from the intermediate to the ground state, resulting in weakening the methionine 80--S--heme-Fe bond formed in the latter step. Taking the results together with the fragment exchange studies on the ferrous complex and available evidence, we suggest that the interaction involving leucine 32 would be coupled not only with the methionine 80--S--heme-Fe bond but also with the energy state of other distant residues such as tryptophan 59, generating extra energy for modulating the binding of the complex, i.e. the force of folding. In contrast, leucine 35 would be less important even if it were involved in such coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1544185128,"The influence of replacing external Na+ by choline+ on Li+ uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes was studied. Tetraphenylphosphonium+ and methylamine distribution techniques were used to estimate the plasma membrane potential and the transmembrane H+ gradients, respectively. H+ efflux was monitored by automatic titration in the pH-stat mode. In the Na+- and K+-free medium, synaptosomes concentrated Li+ about 10-fold at 1 mM Li+o in the presence of ouabain. Varying external free Ca2+ between 13 and 300 microM, or addition of MgCl2 had no effect on Li+ uptake. Ouabain-insensitive Li+ transport was separated into two components: 1) non-saturable Li+ influx with a rate constant of 0.6/min; 2) saturable uptake, which obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km, 2.0 mM Li+; Vmax, 7.3 mmol of Li+/liter and min). Li+ uptake was competitively inhibited by amiloride (Ki, 3.2 microM; Hill coefficient, 1.0) and external Na+ (Ki, 5.8 mM). External Li+ scarcely accelerated Na+ efflux and phloretin failed to inhibit Li+ uptake, indicating that Li+ uptake was not directly coupled to Na+ gradient. Because of a reversal of the H+ transport by the pHi-regulating system, synaptosomes accumulated acid in the Na+-free medium. Li+ influx was electroneutral, but impaired H+ gradients and was coupled to the simultaneous release of stoichiometric amounts of H+ at less than 3 mM Li+o. Uptake of Li+ was linearly related to H+ gradients imposed onto the plasma membrane by varying external pH. In the steady state, internal Li+ was close to the value predicted for passive distribution. It is concluded that in Na+-free media Li+ uptake at low external Li+ is predominantly driven by transmembrane H+ gradients. The stoichiometric exchange of Li+ for H+ is mediated by the Na+/H+ antiporter. The Li+ distribution ratio is close to the electrochemical activity coefficient since protons are passively distributed across the synaptosomal plasma membrane in the absence of external Na+."
https://openalex.org/W2152739800,"We have investigated the effect of the rho-115 mutation on the catalytic properties of the Escherichia coli termination protein, rho. Comparison of the primary and secondary polynucleotide binding sites activities reveals dramatic differences between the mutant and wild-type molecules. Wild-type rho must bind single-stranded polynucleotides to activate its nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) activity, and either poly(C), or poly(dC) plus oligo(C), will suffice. In contrast, attempted activation of the rho-115 NTPase with poly(C) in the presence of poly(dC) showed the latter to be a potent inhibitor. Inclusion of small oligonucleotides such as oligo(C) in the activation assay does not inhibit the poly(C)-induced NTPase reaction of either wild-type rho or rho-115. This would indicate, in the two polynucleotide binding site model for rho proposed by Richardson (Richardson, J.P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5760-5766), that the mutation in rho-115 affects the primary polynucleotide binding site. Transcription termination in vitro at the rho-dependent site trp t' showed dramatically reduced termination with rho-115 protein compared to wild-type rho. In the presence of rho-115, the transcript is longer and termination occurs over a narrower range of nucleotides than with wild-type rho. This suggests that the primary polynucleotide binding site is important not only for efficient termination of transcription but may also be involved in determining the terminal end point of the transcript itself."
https://openalex.org/W11784850,"The binding of Mn2+ and Ca2+ to tetrameric lima bean lectin has been examined by equilibrium dialysis and magnetic resonance techniques. Demetalized lectin prepared by acid treatment binds either 1 Mn2+ or 2 Ca2+/monomer. When demetalized lectin is presaturated with Ca2+, only 1 Mn2+ binds per dimer. Water proton relaxation rate enhancements and Mn2+ electron spin resonance spectra were used to monitor metal ion association processes. Following Mn2+ binding to demetalized lectin, a conformational change with activation energy of 16 kcal/mol was detected; this is similar in magnitude to that observed for a conformational change with the lectin concanavalin A. The pH dependence suggests that a histidine residue is involved. ESR spectroscopy shows clearly that 1 Mn2+ binds to each demetalized subunit, but that Ca2+ induces dissociation of half the Mn2+; this result is in agreement with the equilibrium dialysis studies."
