https://openalex.org/W3122175919,"In vivo real-time epifluorescence imaging of mouse hindlimb vasculatures in the second near-infrared region (NIR-II, 1.1~1.4 microns) is performed using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as fluorophores. Both high spatial resolution (~30 microns) and temporal resolution (<200 ms/frame) for small vessel imaging are achieved 1-3 mm deep in the tissue owing to the beneficial NIR-II optical window that affords deep anatomical penetration and low scattering. This spatial resolution is unattainable by traditional NIR imaging (NIR-I, 0.75~0.9 microns) or microscopic computed tomography (micro-CT), while the temporal resolution far exceeds scanning microscopic imaging techniques. Arterial and venous vessels are unambiguously differentiated using a dynamic contrast-enhanced NIR-II imaging technique based on their distinct hemodynamics. Further, the deep tissue penetration, high spatial and temporal resolution of NIR-II imaging allow for precise quantifications of blood velocity in both normal and ischemic femoral arteries, which are beyond the capability of ultrasonography at lower blood velocity."

We report a map of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (O, S, K, and M) on the human genome during the first 48 hr of reprogramming fibroblasts to pluripotency. Three striking aspects of the initial chromatin binding events include an unexpected role for c-Myc in facilitating OSK chromatin engagement, the primacy of O, S, and K as pioneer factors at enhancers of genes that promote reprogramming, and megabase-scale chromatin domains spanned by H3K9me3, including many genes required for pluripotency, that prevent initial OSKM binding and impede the efficiency of reprogramming. We find diverse aspects of initial factor binding that must be overcome in the minority of cells that become reprogrammed."

The piRNA pathway silences transposons in animal gonads, yet how this is achieved molecularly remains controversial. Here, we show that the HMG protein Maelstrom is essential for Piwi-mediated silencing in Drosophila. Genome-wide assays revealed highly correlated changes in RNA polymerase II recruitment, nascent RNA output, and steady-state RNA levels of transposons upon loss of Piwi or Maelstrom. Our data demonstrate piRNA-mediated trans-silencing of hundreds of transposon copies at the transcriptional level. We show that Piwi is required to establish heterochromatic H3K9me3 marks on transposons and their genomic surroundings. In contrast, loss of Maelstrom affects transposon H3K9me3 patterns only mildly yet leads to increased heterochromatin spreading, suggesting that Maelstrom acts downstream of or in parallel to H3K9me3. Our work illustrates the widespread influence of transposons and the piRNA pathway on chromatin patterns and gene expression.

Transposable elements (TEs) are threatening genomic stability due to their mobile character and their creating repetitive sequence islands that can initiate ectopic recombination (Kazazian, 2004Kazazian Jr., H.H. Mobile elements: drivers of genome evolution.Science. 2004; 303: 1626-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Small-RNA-based silencing pathways are universally employed by eukaryotes to silence TEs (Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007Slotkin R.K. Martienssen R. Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 272-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). In animals, this is of particular importance in germ cells. The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway serves as the main line of defense in the animal gonad, and defects in it result in TE derepression, genomic instability, and sterility (Malone and Hannon, 2009Malone C.D. Hannon G.J. Small RNAs as guardians of the genome.Cell. 2009; 136: 656-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar; Siomi et al., 2011Siomi M.C. Sato K. Pezic D. Aravin A.A. PIWI-interacting small RNAs: the vanguard of genome defence.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). At the core of the pathway is the piRNA-induced silencing complex (pi-RISC) that consists of a single-stranded piRNA bound by a PIWI family protein. piRNAs are typically processed from TE RNAs and so-called piRNA cluster transcripts that are enriched in TE sequences. Thus, by virtue of their sequence, piRNAs guide the specific silencing of TEs. (Senti and Brennecke, 2010Senti K.A. Brennecke J.

Conceptually, two major silencing modes are distinguished, namely transcriptional silencing (TGS) and posttranscriptional silencing (PTGS). Most animals express multiple PIWI proteins, and these might employ different silencing modes. The Drosophila genome encodes the PIWI proteins Piwi, Aubergine (Aub), and Argonaute 3 (AGO3). Aub and AGO3 piRISCs are cytoplasmic, possess slicer activity, and are the major players in a piRNA amplification loop that requires reciprocal cleavage of TE RNAs and piRNA cluster transcripts (Senti and Brennecke, 2010Senti K.A. Brennecke J.

As TE sense RNAs are consumed during this amplification loop, Aub/AGO3-mediated silencing represents a PTGS process. The third family member Piwi, however, is enriched in the nucleus, and its silencing mode is much less understood. Genetically, Piwi-mediated TE silencing depends on its nuclear localization, but not on its slicer activity (Klenov et al., 2011Klenov M.S. Sokolova O.A. Yakushev E.Y. Stolyarenko A.D. Mikhaleva E.A. Lavrov S.A. Gvozdev V.A. Separation of stem cell maintenance and transposon silencing functions of Piwi protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Roles for the Yb body components Armitage and Yb in primary piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that Piwi might induce TGS via triggering repressive chromatin modifications. Indeed, changes in chromatin marks and nascent RNA levels have been observed for some TEs in piRNA pathway mutants (Klenov et al., 2011Klenov M.S. Sokolova O.A. Yakushev E.Y. Stolyarenko A.D. Mikhaleva E.A. Lavrov S.A. Gvozdev V.A. Separation of stem cell maintenance and transposon silencing functions of Piwi protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2011; 108: 21164-21169Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a specific chromatin association of PIWI proteins in germ cells has not been demonstrated. Some studies even challenge a role for Piwi in chromatin regulation. For example, no significant changes in heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) occupancy on TEs were observed upon Piwi knockdown (KD) (Moshkovich and Lei, 2010Moshkovich N. Lei E.P. HP1 recruitment in the absence of argonaute proteins in Drosophila.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1000880Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a genetic study in flies concluded that Piwi triggers PTGS rather than TGS (Dufourt et al., 2011Dufourt J. Brasset E. Desset S. Pouchin P. Vaury C. Polycomb group-dependent, heterochromatin protein 1-independent, chromatin structures silence retrotransposons in somatic tissues outside ovaries.DNA Res. 2011; 18: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A systematic understanding of the silencing mode employed by nuclear PIWI proteins is therefore a major open question in the field. All three Drosophila PIWI family proteins are coexpressed in germline cells. Due to their interdependence in terms of piRNA biogenesis and TE silencing, the precise genetic and mechanistic dissection of Piwi's nuclear role is challenging. Somatic support cells of the ovary, however, express a simplified piRNA pathway based exclusively on nuclear Piwi. Importantly, a stable cell line derived from ovarian somatic cells (these cultured cells are called OSSs or OSCs) has been established (Niki et al., 2006Niki Y. Yamaguchi T. Mahowald A.P. Establishment of stable cell lines of Drosophila germ-line stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 16325-16330Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; Saito et al., 2009Saito K. Inagaki S. Mituyama T. Kawamura Y. Ono Y. Sakota E. Kotani H. Asai K. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. A regulatory circuit for piwi by the large Maf gene traffic jam in Drosophila.Nature. 2009; 461: 1296-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). These cells harbor a piRNA pathway that, in every aspect analyzed, mirrors the pathway acting in ovarian somatic cells. In OSCs, piRNAs antisense to TEs are derived from piRNA clusters such as flamenco. piRNA biogenesis depends on several cytoplasmic factors, and defects in it result in loss of Piwi, presumably due to destabilization of unloaded Piwi (Siomi et al., 2011Siomi M.C. Sato K. Pezic D. Aravin A.A. PIWI-interacting small RNAs: the vanguard of genome defence.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Upon loss of Piwi-RISC, several TEs, which are normally silenced by the piRNA pathway, are derepressed. We took advantage of this linear piRNA pathway and dissected the underlying silencing process in detail. Our data demonstrate that Piwi-RISC mediates TE silencing at the transcriptional level and that this is accompanied by local heterochromatin formation. Remarkably, most euchromatic H3K9me3 islands are due to piRNA-mediated silencing of TE insertions, and spreading of this heterochromatic mark into flanking genomic regions has striking effects on the expression of nearby genes. While the process of piRNA biogenesis within the somatic pathway is being increasingly dissected at the molecular level and multiple involved factors are known, not a single protein has been linked to Piwi-mediated silencing in the nucleus. To identify such factors, we utilized an assay system based on transgenic RNAi and a lacZ reporter that monitors silencing of the gypsy TE in follicle cells (Figure 1A; Olivieri et al., 2010Olivieri D. Sykora M.M. Sachidanandam R. Mechtler K. Brennecke J.

Evidence for a piwi-dependent RNA silencing of the gypsy endogenous retrovirus by the Drosophila melanogaster flamenco gene.Genetics. 2004; 166: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily conserved maelstrom (mael) gene scored strongly in this assay (Figure 1A). This came as a surprise, as Mael levels are low in ovarian somatic cells (Findley et al., 2003Findley S.D. Tamanaha M. Clegg N.J. Ruohola-Baker H. Maelstrom, a Drosophila spindle-class gene, encodes a protein that colocalizes with Vasa and RDE1/AGO1 homolog, Aubergine, in nuage.Development. 2003; 130: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and a recent study indicated that mael is dispensable for TE silencing in ovarian somatic cells (Klenov et al., 2011Klenov M.S. Sokolova O.A. Yakushev E.Y. Stolyarenko A.D. Mikhaleva E.A. Lavrov S.A. Gvozdev V.A. Separation of stem cell maintenance and transposon silencing functions of Piwi protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 18760-18765Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To support the gypsy-lacZ results, we induced tissue-specific mael RNAi in soma or germline and analyzed RNA levels of several marker TEs. In both cell types, mael KD resulted in desilencing of TEs to extents comparable to KD of the essential piRNA biogenesis factor Armitage (Armi) (Figures 1B and 1C). Ovaries from mael loss-of-function flies also exhibited derepression of soma and germline transposons (Figure S1A available online; note that Klenov et al., 2011Klenov M.S. Sokolova O.A.

To identify the level at which Mael acts in the piRNA pathway, we monitored Piwi in clones of mael KD cells in the follicular epithelium. Defective piRNA biogenesis (e.g., armi KD) triggers loss of Piwi, presumably as unloaded Piwi is unstable (Figure 1D). In contrast, depletion of Mael had no impact on nuclear Piwi levels (Figure 1E). Similarly, levels and localizations of all PIWI proteins were unaffected in soma and germline of mael null ovaries (Figure S1B). This suggested that Mael does not act in piRNA biogenesis. To test this, we monitored TE expression and piRNA levels in OSCs upon mael KD or armi KD (Figures 1F–1I). Both KDs resulted in derepression of the TEs mdg1 and 412, but not of the germline-specific element HeT-A (Figure 1G), demonstrating an essential role for Mael in the OSC piRNA pathway. However, whereas loss of Armi resulted in reduced Piwi protein (Figure 1F; but not mRNA: Figure S1C) as well as in reduced piRNA levels (Figure 1H), loss of Mael did not. The size of Piwi-bound piRNAs was also unaffected upon mael KD (Figure 1I). We finally sequenced piRNAs from mael mutant ovaries and compared them to heterozygous controls. In agreement with the OSC data and in contrast to known primary biogenesis factors, loss of Mael did not affect piRNAs derived from the soma-dominant flamenco cluster or the traffic jam 3′UTR (Figure 1J). For the global pool of ovarian piRNAs (soma and germline), we observed a slight shift toward sense piRNAs, probably due to abundant derepressed TE messages (Figures S1D and S1E). piRNAs derived from the germline-dominant 42AB cluster were moderately reduced (Figure S1F). At the level of most individual TEs, loss of Mael had only mild impacts on antisense piRNA populations from soma-dominant, intermediate, and many germline-dominant TEs (Figure S1G). The most notable exceptions were the telomeric TEs HeT-A, TAHRE, and TART that exhibited strong piRNA losses. We speculate that desilencing of these TEs interferes with piRNA precursor transcription at the same loci, therefore blocking piRNA production. Taken together, Mael is not required for biogenesis or nuclear accumulation of the Piwi-RISC yet is essential for Piwi-mediated TE silencing. The subcellular localization of the Piwi-RISC suggests a nuclear silencing process. Indeed, experiments in OSCs indicated that Piwi's nuclear localization, but not its slicer activity, is required for silencing (Saito et al., 2010Saito K. Ishizu H. Komai M. Kotani H. Kawamura Y. Nishida K.M. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Roles for the Yb body components Armitage and Yb in primary piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Also in flies, N terminally truncated Piwi is cytoplasmic and piwi[ΔN] flies are defective in TE silencing (Klenov et al., 2011Klenov M.S. Sokolova O.A. Yakushev E.Y. Stolyarenko A.D. Mikhaleva E.A. Lavrov S.A. Gvozdev V.A. Separation of stem cell maintenance and transposon silencing functions of Piwi protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 18760-18765Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We reconstructed these findings in vivo by complementing piwi[1]/piwi[2] mutant flies with various GFP-tagged genomic piwi rescue constructs. A nine-amino-acid deletion at the N terminus (ΔNLS) largely prevented nuclear accumulation of Piwi-GFP, whereas both slicer mutant GFP-Piwis (ADK or DAK) localized like wild-type GFP-Piwi to the nucleus (Figures 2A and 2B ; efficient loading of all variants with piRNAs verified by IP-CIP-kinase experiments). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of TE RNA levels showed derepression of soma- and germline-specific TEs in piwi[ΔNLS], but not in piwi[ADK] or piwi[DAK] ovaries (Figure 2C). Moreover, both slicer mutant flies resembled wild-type flies in fertility, whereas only some eggs laid by piwi[ΔNLS] flies developed into larvae and adults. An involvement of Mael in the silencing process predicts a nuclear localization for this protein. In ovaries, endogenous Mael, as well as GFP-tagged Mael expressed under the mael control regions, is abundant in germline cells and localizes to cytoplasm, nuage, and nucleus (Figures 2D and 2E, upper left; Findley et al., 2003Findley S.D. Tamanaha M. Clegg N.J. Ruohola-Baker H. Maelstrom, a Drosophila spindle-class gene, encodes a protein that colocalizes with Vasa and RDE1/AGO1 homolog, Aubergine, in nuage.Development. 2003; 130: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As levels in follicle cells were low, we turned to OSCs in which endogenous Mael, as well as N- and C-tagged GFP-Mael, localized throughout the cell but were clearly enriched in the nucleus (Figure 2E, upper right; data not shown). Based on Mael's domain architecture, we tested the requirement of HMG and MAEL domains for nuclear localization and TE silencing in complementation assays using mael loss-of-function alleles and GFP-tagged mael rescue constructs. Whereas the wild-type construct rescued sterility and TE derepression nearly completely, two constructs harboring point mutations in conserved residues of the MAEL domain (Zhang et al., 2008aZhang D. Xiong H. Shan J. Xia X. Trudeau V.L. Functional insight into Maelstrom in the germline piRNA pathway: a unique domain homologous to the DnaQ-H 3′-5′ exonuclease, its lineage-specific expansion/loss and evolutionarily active site switch.Biol. Direct. 2008; 3: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) did not (Figures 2F and 2G). In both cases, nuclear accumulation of mutant Mael was strongly reduced in ovaries and OSCs (Figure 2E). Loss of the HMG domain had only mild effects on Mael's subcellular localization (Figure 2E). mael[ΔHMG] flies did lay eggs, but these displayed defects in egg asymmetry, presumably as TE silencing was only partially rescued in these flies (Figures 2F and 2G). We conclude that Piwi-mediated silencing is a nuclear process that is independent of Piwi's slicer activity but requires Mael and, in particular, its MAEL domain. To dissect at which step of TE expression Piwi mediates silencing, we took advantage of cultured OSCs. These cells express a functional linear piRNA pathway and allow gene knockdowns using siRNAs. We profiled gene expression at three hierarchical levels in cells treated with GFP siRNAs (control KD) or with siRNAs targeting key pathway factors (piwi KD, armi KD, mael KD; Figure 3A). We first defined the set of TEs that are repressed by the piRNA pathway by comparing steady-state RNA levels (RNA-seq) between control KD and piRNA pathway KD cells. We then determined transcription rates by measuring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy (Rpb3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq); Adelman et al., 2005Adelman K. Marr M.T. Werner J.

In contrast, several out of the 125 annotated D. melanogaster TE families showed strong increases in RNA levels (Figure 3B). For example, the LTR elements mdg1 or gypsy increased by >200- or >30-fold upon piwi KD, respectively. With RPKM values of >1,000, both TEs were among the most abundant coding transcripts in OSCs (Figure S2C). Almost identical results were obtained upon knockdown of Armi (Figure S2D; Pearson correlation coefficient piwi KD/armi KD 0.99). Thus, loss of the Piwi-RISC led to highly reproducible increases in the RNA levels of a subset of TEs. Based on these data, we classified TEs into four groups (Figure 3B). Group I elements exhibited RNA increases >10-fold; group II elements. 3- to 10-fold; group III elements, <3-fold; and group IV elements were expressed below an RPKM cutoff of five in any of the analyzed libraries (no or very low expression and not further analyzed). Knockdown of Mael resulted in slightly weaker but otherwise very similar derepression of TEs at the RNA level (Figures 3C and S2E). This strongly supports the notion that Mael is an integral piRNA pathway factor. Indeed, piwi+mael double-KD cells exhibited TE derepression similar to piwi KD cells, indicating that both proteins act in the same pathway (Figure S2F). Strikingly, changes in steady-state RNA levels were highly correlated with changes in RNA Pol II occupancy (Pol II ChIP-seq; piwi KD and mael KD), as well as with changes in nascent RNA levels (GRO-seq; piwi KD; Figure 3D). Upon piRNA pathway KD, both measures indicative of active transcription were strongly increased in the LTR regions (containing the TSS), as well as in the internal portions of regulated TEs, but not of nonregulated TEs (Figure 3E). For example, overall Pol II occupancy and nascent RNA levels for mdg1 increased 6.5-fold and 22-fold, respectively. For all three assays, the respective controls (antisense reads for RNA-seq; input for Pol II ChIP-seq; antisense reads for GRO-seq) showed no difference among the three TE groups (Figures 3F–3H and S2G). This argues against a general increase in repeat or heterochromatin transcription upon pathway loss"
https://openalex.org/W2100424218,"The complete extent to which the human genome is translated into polypeptides is of fundamental importance. We report a peptidomic strategy to detect short open reading frame (sORF)-encoded polypeptides (SEPs) in human cells. We identify 90 SEPs, 86 of which are previously uncharacterized, which is the largest number of human SEPs ever reported. SEP abundances range from 10-1,000 molecules per cell, identical to abundances of known proteins. SEPs arise from sORFs in noncoding RNAs as well as multicistronic mRNAs, and many SEPs initiate with non-AUG start codons, indicating that noncanonical translation may be more widespread in mammals than previously thought. In addition, coding sORFs are present in a small fraction (8 out of 1,866) of long intergenic noncoding RNAs. Together, these results provide strong evidence that the human proteome is more complex than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2166422604,"Current neural prostheses can translate neural activity into control signals for guiding prosthetic devices, but poor performance limits practical application. Here the authors present a new cursor-control algorithm that approaches native arm control speed and accuracy, permits sustained uninterrupted use for hours, generalizes to more challenging tasks and provides repeatable high performance for years after implantation, thereby increasing the clinical viability of neural prostheses. Neural prostheses translate neural activity from the brain into control signals for guiding prosthetic devices, such as computer cursors and robotic limbs, and thus offer individuals with disabilities greater interaction with the world. However, relatively low performance remains a critical barrier to successful clinical translation; current neural prostheses are considerably slower, with less accurate control, than the native arm. Here we present a new control algorithm, the recalibrated feedback intention–trained Kalman filter (ReFIT-KF) that incorporates assumptions about the nature of closed-loop neural prosthetic control. When tested in rhesus monkeys implanted with motor cortical electrode arrays, the ReFIT-KF algorithm outperformed existing neural prosthetic algorithms in all measured domains and halved target acquisition time. This control algorithm permits sustained, uninterrupted use for hours and generalizes to more challenging tasks without retraining. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate repeatable high performance for years after implantation in two monkeys, thereby increasing the clinical viability of neural prostheses."

https://openalex.org/W1978684572,"Microparticles coated with encephalitogenic peptides are effective at treating multiple sclerosis in a mouse model. Aberrant T-cell activation underlies many autoimmune disorders, yet most attempts to induce T-cell tolerance have failed. Building on previous strategies for tolerance induction that exploited natural mechanisms for clearing apoptotic debris, we show that antigen-decorated microparticles (500-nm diameter) induce long-term T-cell tolerance in mice with relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Specifically, intravenous infusion of either polystyrene or biodegradable poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles bearing encephalitogenic peptides prevents the onset and modifies the course of the disease. These beneficial effects require microparticle uptake by marginal zone macrophages expressing the scavenger receptor MARCO and are mediated in part by the activity of regulatory T cells, abortive T-cell activation and T-cell anergy. Together these data highlight the potential for using microparticles to target natural apoptotic clearance pathways to inactivate pathogenic T cells and halt the disease process in autoimmunity."

Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a novel system for modeling human genetic disease and could provide a source of cells for large-scale drug-discovery screens. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of performing a primary screen in neural crest precursors derived from iPSCs that were generated from individuals with familial dysautonomia (FD), a rare, fatal genetic disorder affecting neural crest lineages. We tested 6,912 small-molecule compounds and characterized eight that rescued expression of IKBKAP, the gene responsible for FD. One of the hits, SKF-86466, was found to induce IKBKAP transcription through modulation of intracellular cAMP levels and PKA-dependent CREB phosphorylation. SKF-86466 also rescued IKAP protein expression and the disease-specific loss of autonomic neuronal marker expression. Our data implicate alpha-2 adrenergic receptor activity in regulating IKBKAP expression and demonstrate that small-molecule discovery using an iPSC-based disease model can identify candidate drugs for potential therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2168699664,"Emotionally important events are well remembered. Although memories of emotional experiences are known to be mediated and modulated by stress hormones such as glucocorticoids, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors that are critically engaged during the formation of long-term inhibitory avoidance memory in rats were coupled to the activation of CaMKIIα, TrkB, ERK, Akt, PLCγ and CREB, as well as a to a substantial induction of Arc and synaptic GluA1. Most of these changes, which are initiated by a nongenomic effect of glucocorticoid receptors, were also downstream of the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Hippocampal administration of BDNF, but not of other neurotrophins, selectively rescued both the amnesia and the molecular impairments produced by glucocorticoid receptor inhibition. Thus, glucocorticoid receptors mediate long-term memory formation by recruiting the CaMKIIα-BDNF-CREB-dependent neural plasticity pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2004945550,"Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to rapid necrosis of cardiac myocytes. To achieve tissue integrity and function, inflammatory cells are activated, including monocytes/macrophages. However, the effect of monocyte/macrophage recruitment after MI remains poorly defined. After experimental MI, monocytes and macrophages were depleted through serial injections of clodronate-containing liposomes. Monocyte/macrophage infiltration was reduced in the myocardium after MI by active treatment. Mortality was increased due to thromboembolic events in monocyte- and macrophage-depleted animals (92 vs. 33%; P<0.01). Left ventricular thrombi were detectable as early as 24 h after MI; this was reproduced in a genetic model of monocyte/macrophage ablation. A general prothrombotic state, increased infarct expansion, and deficient neovascularization were not observed. Severely compromised extracellular matrix remodeling (collagen I, placebo liposome vs. clodronate liposome, 2.4±0.2 vs. 0.8±0.2 arbitrary units; P<0.001) and locally lost integrity of the endocardium after MI are potential mechanisms. Patients with a left ventricular thrombus had a relative decrease of CD14+CD16+ monocyte/macrophage subsets in the peripheral blood after MI (no thrombus vs. thrombus, 14.2±0.9 vs. 7.80±0.4%; P<0.05). In summary, monocytes/macrophages are of central importance for healing after MI. Impaired monocyte/macrophage function appears to be an unrecognized new pathophysiological mechanism for left ventricular thrombus development after MI.—Frantz, S., Hofmann, U., Fraccarollo, D., Schäfer, A., Kranepuhl, S., Hagedorn, I., Nieswandt, B., Nahrendorf, M., Wagner, H., Bayer, B., Pachel, C., Schön, M.P., Kneitz, S., Bobinger, T., Weidemann, F., Ertl, G., Bauersachs, J.

https://openalex.org/W2067022225,"Nature has exploited medium-sized 8- to 11-membered rings in a variety of natural products to address diverse and challenging biological targets. However, owing to the limitations of conventional cyclization-based approaches to medium-ring synthesis, these structures remain severely underrepresented in current probe and drug discovery efforts. To address this problem, we have established an alternative, biomimetic ring expansion approach to the diversity-oriented synthesis of medium-ring libraries. Oxidative dearomatization of bicyclic phenols affords polycyclic cyclohexadienones that undergo efficient ring expansion to form benzannulated medium-ring scaffolds found in natural products. The ring expansion reaction can be induced using three complementary reagents that avoid competing dienone-phenol rearrangements and is driven by rearomatization of a phenol ring adjacent to the scissile bond. Cheminformatic analysis of the resulting first-generation library confirms that these molecules occupy chemical space overlapping with medium-ring natural products and distinct from that of synthetic drugs and drug-like libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2156679895,"Much evidence indicates that men experienced an evolutionary history of physical competition, both one-on-one and in coalitions. We thus hypothesized that, compared to girls and women, boys and men will possess a greater motivational predisposition to be interested in sports, especially team sports. According to most scholars, advocacy groups, and the United States courts, however, this hypothesis is challenged by modest sex differences in organized school sports participation in the contemporary U.S., where females comprise 42% of high school participants and 43% of intercollegiate participants. We conducted three studies to test whether organized school sports participation data underestimate the actual sex difference in sports participation. Study 1 analyzed the American Time Use Survey, which interviewed 112,000 individuals regarding their activities during one day. Females accounted for 51% of exercise (i.e., non-competitive) participations, 24% of total sports participations, and 20% of team sports participations. These sex differences were similar for older and younger age groups. Study 2 was based on systematic observations of sports and exercise at 41 public parks in four states. Females accounted for 37% of exercise participations, 19% of individual sports participations, and 10% of team sports participations. Study 3 involved surveying colleges and universities about intramural sports, which primarily consist of undergraduate participation in team sports. Across 34 institutions, females accounted for 26% of registrations. Nine institutions provided historical data, and these did not indicate that the sex difference is diminishing. Therefore, although efforts to ensure more equitable access to sports in the U.S. (i.e., Title IX) have produced many benefits, patterns of sports participation do not challenge the hypothesis of a large sex difference in interest and participation in physical competition."

They identify risk loci near BMP2 on chromosome 20 and within BBS9 on chromosome 7. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common form of craniosynostosis, affecting approximately one in 5,000 newborns. We conducted, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide association study for nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis (sNSC) using 130 non-Hispanic case-parent trios of European ancestry (NHW). We found robust associations in a 120-kb region downstream of BMP2 flanked by rs1884302 (P = 1.13 × 10−14, odds ratio (OR) = 4.58) and rs6140226 (P = 3.40 × 10−11, OR = 0.24) and within a 167-kb region of BBS9 between rs10262453 (P = 1.61 × 10−10, OR = 0.19) and rs17724206 (P = 1.50 × 10−8, OR = 0.22).

https://openalex.org/W2148393306,"Hydrocephalus is a common neurological disorder that leads to expansion of the cerebral ventricles and is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Most neonatal cases are of unknown etiology and are likely to have complex inheritance involving multiple genes and environmental factors. Identifying molecular mechanisms for neonatal hydrocephalus and developing noninvasive treatment modalities are high priorities. Here we use a hydrocephalic mouse model of the human ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) and identify a role for neural progenitors in the pathogenesis of neonatal hydrocephalus. We found that hydrocephalus in this mouse model is caused by aberrant platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFR-α) signaling, resulting in increased apoptosis and impaired proliferation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (also known as neuron-glial antigen 2 or NG2)(+)PDGFR-α(+) neural progenitors. Targeting this pathway with lithium treatment rescued NG2(+)PDGFR-α(+) progenitor cell proliferation in BBS mutant mice, reducing their ventricular volume. Our findings demonstrate that neural progenitors are crucial in the pathogenesis of neonatal hydrocephalus, and we identify new therapeutic targets for this common neurological disorder."

The identified differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in transcriptional regulation, transport, cellular homeostasis, and stress response. The predominant transcription factor gene families responsive to heat stress were Hsf, NAC, AP2/ERF, WRKY, MYB, and C(2)H(2). KMC analysis discovered the time-dependent gene expression pattern under heat stress. The motif co-occurrence analysis on the promoters of genes from an early up-regulated cluster showed the important roles of GCC box, HSE, ABRE, and CE3 in response to heat stress. The regulation model central to ROS combined with transcriptome and ROS quantification data in rice panicle indicated the great importance to maintain ROS balance and the existence of wide cross-talk in heat response. The present study increased our understanding of the heat response in rice panicle and provided good candidate genes for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2023423471,"Animals housed in impoverished cages are often labelled 'bored'. They have also been called 'apathetic' or 'depressed', particularly when profoundly inactive. However, these terms are rarely operationally defined and validated. As a negative state caused by under-stimulation, boredom should increase interest in stimuli of all kinds. Apathy (lack of interest), by contrast, should manifest as decreased interest in all stimuli, while anhedonia (loss of pleasure, a depressive symptom) should specifically decrease interest in normally rewarding stimuli. We tested the hypotheses that mink, a model carnivore, experience more boredom, depression-like apathy, or anhedonia in non-enriched (NE) cages than in complex, enriched (E) cages. We exposed 29 subjects (13 E, 16 NE) to ten stimuli categorized a priori as aversive (e.g. air puffs), rewarding (e.g. evoking chasing) or ambiguous/neutral (e.g. candles). Interest in stimuli was assessed via latencies to contact, contact durations, and durations oriented to stimuli. NE mink contacted all stimuli faster (P = 0.003) than E mink, and spent longer oriented to/in contact with them, albeit only significantly so for ambiguous ones (treatment*type P<0.013). With stimulus category removed from statistical models, interest in all stimuli was consistently higher among NE mink (P<0.0001 for all measures). NE mink also consumed more food rewards (P = 0.037). Finally, we investigated whether lying down while awake and stereotypic behaviour (both increased by NE housing) predicted these responses. Lying awake positively co-varied with certain measures of increased exploration. In contrast, stereotypic 'scrabbling' or locomotion (e.g. pacing) did not. Overall, NE mink showed no evidence of apathy or depression, but instead a heightened investigation of diverse stimuli consistent with boredom. This state was potentially indicated by spending much time lying still but awake (although this result requires replication). Boredom can thus be operationalized and assessed empirically in non-human animals. It can also be reduced by environmental enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W2068928390,"Excessive land use and suburbanisation around densely populated urban areas has gone hand in hand with a growth in overall transportation and discussions about causality of traffic congestions. The objective of this paper is to gain new insight regarding the composition of traffic flows, and to reveal how and to what extent suburbanites' travelling affects rush hour traffic. We put forward an alternative methodological approach using call detail records of mobile phones to assess the composition of traffic flows during the evening rush hour in Tallinn, Estonia. We found that daily commuting and suburbanites influence transportation demand by amplifying the evening rush hour traffic, although daily commuting trips comprises only 31% of all movement at that time. The geography of the Friday evening rush hour is distinctive from other working days, presumably in connection with domestic tourism and leisure time activities. This suggests that the rise of the overall mobility of individuals due to societal changes may play a greater role in evening rush hour traffic conditions than does the impact of suburbanisation."
https://openalex.org/W2130024981,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility has been attributed to a leaky sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) caused by missense mutations in RYR1 or CACNA1S, and the MH crisis has been attributed solely to massive self-sustaining release of Ca(2+) from SR stores elicited by triggering agents. Here, we show in muscle cells from MH-RyR1(R163C) knock-in mice that increased passive SR Ca(2+) leak causes an enlarged basal influx of sarcolemmal Ca(2+) that results in chronically elevated myoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) at rest. We discovered that Gd(+3) and GsMTx-4 were more effective than BTP2 or expression of the dominant-negative Orai1(E190Q) in reducing both Ca(2+) entry and [Ca(2+)]i, implicating a non-STIM1/Orai1 SOCE pathway in resetting resting [Ca(2+)]i. Indeed, two nonselective cationic channels, TRPC3 and TRPC6, are overexpressed, and [Na]i is chronically elevated in MH-RyR1(R163C) muscle cells. [Ca(2+)]i and [Na(+)]i are persistently elevated in vivo and further increased by halothane in MH-RyR1(R163C/WT) muscle. These increases are markedly attenuated by local perfusion of Gd(+3) or GsMTx-4 and completely suppressed by dantrolene. These results contribute a new paradigm for understanding MH pathophysiology by demonstrating that nonselective sarcolemmal cation channel activity plays a critical role in causing myoplasmic Ca(2+) and Na(+) overload both at rest and during the MH crisis.-Eltit, J.

https://openalex.org/W2079816973,"Background American Creole cattle presumably descend from animals imported from the Iberian Peninsula during the period of colonization and settlement, through different migration routes, and may have also suffered the influence of cattle directly imported from Africa. The introduction of European cattle, which began in the 18th century, and later of Zebu from India, has threatened the survival of Creole populations, some of which have nearly disappeared or were admixed with exotic breeds. Assessment of the genetic status of Creole cattle is essential for the establishment of conservation programs of these historical resources. Methodology/Principal Findings We sampled 27 Creole populations, 39 Iberian, 9 European and 6 Zebu breeds. We used microsatellite markers to assess the origins of Creole cattle, and to investigate the influence of different breeds on their genetic make-up. The major ancestral contributions are from breeds of southern Spain and Portugal, in agreement with the historical ports of departure of ships sailing towards the Western Hemisphere. This Iberian contribution to Creoles may also include some African influence, given the influential role that African cattle have had in the development of Iberian breeds, but the possibility of a direct influence on Creoles of African cattle imported to America can not be discarded. In addition to the Iberian influence, the admixture with other European breeds was minor. The Creoles from tropical areas, especially those from the Caribbean, show clear signs of admixture with Zebu. Conclusions/Significance Nearly five centuries since cattle were first brought to the Americas, Creoles still show a strong and predominant signature of their Iberian ancestors. Creole breeds differ widely from each other, both in genetic structure and influences from other breeds. Efforts are needed to avoid their extinction or further genetic erosion, which would compromise centuries of selective adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions."

Cre-lox technology was used to generate smooth muscle (sm)-targeted STIM1-, STIM2-, and double STIM1/STIM2-knockout (KO) mouse models, which reveal the essential role of STIM proteins in Ca2+ homeostasis and their crucial role in controlling function, growth, and development of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Compared to Cre+/– littermates, sm-STIM1-KO mice showed high mortality (50% by 30 d) and reduced bodyweight. While sm-STIM2-KO was without detectable phenotype, the STIM1/STIM double-KO was perinatally lethal, revealing an essential role of STIM1 partially rescued by STIM2. Vascular and intestinal smooth muscle tissues from sm-STIM1-KO mice developed abnormally with distended, thinned morphology. While depolarization-induced aortic contraction was unchanged in sm-STIM1-KO mice, α1-adrenergic-mediated contraction was 26% reduced, and store-dependent contraction almost eliminated. Neointimal formation induced by carotid artery ligation was suppressed by 54%, and in vitro PDGF-induced proliferation was greatly reduced (79%) in sm-STIM1-KO. Notably, the Ca2+ store-refilling rate in STIM1-KO SMCs was substantially reduced, and sustained PDGF-induced Ca2+ entry was abolished. This defective Ca2+ homeostasis prevents PDGF-induced NFAT activation in both contractile and proliferating SMCs.

We examined the effect of the FTO minor allele (A) at rs9939609 on eating behaviour, impulsivity and control in young children, thus before the BMI effect becomes apparent. This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort from fetal life onwards. 1,718 children of European descent were genotyped for FTO at rs9939609. With logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model, we examined the association between the FTO minor allele and eating behaviour, impulsivity and control in preschool children. There was no relation between FTO at rs9939609 and child BMI at this age. The A allele at rs9939609 was associated with increased food responsiveness (OR 1.21, p = 0.03). Also, children with the A allele were less likely to have symptoms of ADHD (OR 0.74, p = 0.01) and showed more emotional control (OR 0.64, p = 0.01) compared to children without the A allele. Our findings suggest that before the association between FTO and BMI becomes apparent, the FTO minor allele at rs9939609 leads to increased food responsiveness, a decreased risk for symptoms of ADHD and better emotional control.

Recently miRNAs emerged as diagnostic biomarkers and innovative therapeutic targets, while high-throughput arrays are opening new opportunities to evaluate whether they can predict clinical outcome. The present study evaluated whether comprehensive miRNA expression profiling correlated with overall survival (OS) in resected PDAC patients. Methodology/Principal Findings High-resolution miRNA profiles were obtained with the Toray's 3D-Gene™-miRNA-chip, detecting more than 1200 human miRNAs. RNA was successfully isolated from paraffin-embedded primary tumors of 19 out of 26 stage-pT3N1 homogeneously treated patients (adjuvant gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2/day, days-1/8/15, every 28days), carefully selected according to their outcome (OS<12 (N = 13) vs. OS>30 months (N = 6), i.e. short/long-OS). Highly stringent statistics included t-test, distance matrix with Spearman-ranked correlation, and iterative approaches. Unsupervised hierarchical analysis revealed that PDACs clustered according to their short/long-OS classification, while the feature selection algorithm RELIEF identified the top 4 discriminating miRNAs between the two groups. These miRNAs target more than 1500 transcripts, including 169 targeted by two or more. MiR-211 emerged as the best discriminating miRNA, with significantly higher expression in long- vs. short-OS patients. The expression of this miRNA was subsequently assessed by quantitative-PCR in an independent cohort of laser-microdissected PDACs from 60 resected patients treated with the same gemcitabine regimen. Patients with low miR-211 expression according to median value had a significantly shorter median OS (14.8, 95%CI = 13.1–16.5, vs. 25.7 months, 95%CI = 16.2–35.1, log-rank-P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low miR-211 expression was an independent factor of poor prognosis (hazard ratio 2.3, P = 0.03) after adjusting for all the factors influencing outcome. Conclusions/Significance Through comprehensive microarray analysis and PCR validation we identified miR-211 as a prognostic factor in resected PDAC. These results prompt further prospective studies and research on the biological role of miR-211 in PDAC."

HLA-A2/IGRP tetramer staining revealed a higher frequency of IGRP-specific CD8 T-cells in the peripheral blood of recent onset human individuals than of healthy donors. IGRP265–273-specific CD8 T-cells that were cloned from the peripheral blood of a recent onset T1D individual were shown to secrete IFNγ and Granzyme B after antigen-specific activation and lyse HLA-A2-expressing murine islets in-vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2049415080,"Huge amounts of high-throughput screening (HTS) data for probe and drug development projects are being generated in the pharmaceutical industry and more recently in the public sector. The resulting experimental datasets are increasingly being disseminated via publically accessible repositories. However, existing repositories lack sufficient metadata to describe the experiments and are often difficult to navigate by non-experts. The lack of standardized descriptions and semantics of biological assays and screening results hinder targeted data retrieval, integration, aggregation, and analyses across different HTS datasets, for example to infer mechanisms of action of small molecule perturbagens. To address these limitations, we created the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). BAO has been developed with a focus on data integration and analysis enabling the classification of assays and screening results by concepts that relate to format, assay design, technology, target, and endpoint. Previously, we reported on the higher-level design of BAO and on the semantic querying capabilities offered by the ontology-indexed triple store of HTS data. Here, we report on our detailed design, annotation pipeline, substantially enlarged annotation knowledgebase, and analysis results.

BAO is publically available from the NCBO BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1533. BAO provides controlled terminology and uniform scope to report probe and drug discovery screening assays and results. BAO leverages description logic to formalize the domain knowledge and facilitate the semantic integration with diverse other resources. As a consequence, BAO offers the potential to infer new knowledge from a corpus of assay results, for example molecular mechanisms of action of perturbagens."
https://openalex.org/W2086555418,"We here present an efficient, precise and reliable method to isolate and cultivate healthy and viable single Crithidia bombi cells from bumblebee faeces using flow cytometry. We report a precision of >99% in obtaining single trypanosomatid cells for further culture and analysis (""cloning""). In the study, we have investigated the use of different liquid media to cultivate C. bombi and present an optimal medium for obtaining viable clones from all tested, infected host donors. We show that this method can be applied to genotype a collection of clones from natural infections. Furthermore, we show how to cryo-preserve C. bombi cells to be revived to become infective clones after at least 4 years of storage. Considering the high prevalence of infections in natural populations, our method provides a powerful tool in studying the level and diversity of these infections, and thus enriches the current methodology for the studies of complex host-parasite interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2004647516,"The in vivo aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils suggests that cellular mechanisms that normally prevent or reverse this aggregation have failed. The small heat-shock molecular chaperone protein αB-crystallin (αB-c) inhibits amyloid formation and colocalizes with amyloid plaques; however, the physiological reason for this localization remains unexplored. Here, using apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) as a model fibril-forming system, we show that αB-c binds directly to mature amyloid fibrils (Kd 5.4 ± 0.5 μM). In doing so, αB-c stabilized the fibrils from dilution-induced fragmentation, halted elongation of partially formed fibrils, and promoted the dissociation of mature fibrils into soluble monomers. Moreover, in the absence of dilution, the association of αB-c with apoC-II fibrils induced a 14-fold increase in average aggregate size, resulting in large fibrillar tangles reminiscent of protein inclusions. We propose that the binding of αB-c to fibrils prevents fragmentation and mediates the lateral association of fibrils into large inclusions. We further postulate that transient interactions of apoC-II with αB-c induce a fibril-incompetent monomeric apoC-II form, preventing oligomerization and promoting fibril dissociation. This work reveals previously unrecognized mechanisms of αB-c chaperone action in amyloid assembly and fibril dynamics, and provides a rationale for the in vivo colocalization of small heat-shock proteins with amyloid deposits.-Binger, K.

https://openalex.org/W2043289589,"The appearance, progression, and potential role for circadian rhythms during early development have previously focused mainly on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peri- and postnatal expression of canonical clock genes. More recently, gene expression studies in embryonic stem cells have shown that some clock genes are expressed in undifferentiated cells; however rhythmicity was only established when cells are directed toward a neural fate. These studies also concluded that a functional clock is not present in ESCs, based solely on their gene expression. The null hypothesis underlying the present study is that embryonic stem cells become rhythmic in both clock gene expression and glucose utilization only when allowed to spontaneously differentiate. Undifferentiated stem cells (ESCs, n = 6 cultures/timepoint for all experiments) were either maintained in their pluripotent state or released into differentiation (dESCs, n = 6 cultures/timepoint for all experiments). Glucose utilization was assayed through 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurement, and clock gene and glucose transporter expression was assayed every 4 hours for 2 days in ESCs and dESCs by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the same cell lysates. Undifferentiated stem cells expressed a self-sustained rhythm in glucose uptake that was not coincident with rhythmic expression of clock genes. This physiological rhythm was paralleled by glucose transporter mRNA expression. Upon differentiation, circadian patterns of some but not all clock genes were expressed, and the amplitude of the glucose utilization rhythm was enhanced in dESCs. These data provide the earliest evidence of a functional circadian clock, in addition to further challenging the idea that rhythmic transcription of clock genes are necessary for rhythmic physiological output and suggest a role for a clock-controlled physiology in the earliest stages of development."
https://openalex.org/W2052256261,"Elevated endothelial microparticle (MP) levels are observed in numerous diseases, increasingly supporting roles as effectors and valuable markers of vascular dysfunction. While a contractile role for the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in vesiculation, i.e., MP production, the precise interactions and mechanisms of its constituents, β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins, is unknown. Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated with known agonists, and vesiculation development was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and flow cytometry. These data in combination provide new insight into the kinetics, patterns of vesiculating cell recruitment, and degrees of response specific to stimuli. Reorganization of β-and γ-actins, F-actin, vinculin, and talin accompanied significant MP release. β-Actin redistribution into basal stress fibers following stimulation was associated with increased apically situated actin-rich particulate structures, which in turn directly correlated with electron-lucent membrane protrusions observed by SEM. Y-27632 Rho-kinase inhibition abolished basal β-actin fiber formation, minimizing apically associated actin-rich structures, significantly reducing membrane protrusions and MP release to near basal levels. Cytoskeletal protein expression and distribution varied between MPs and mother cells, as determined by Western blot. These data strongly suggest that β-actin plays an active facilitative role in agonist-induced protuberance formation, through mechanical interactions with newly described actin-rich structures.—Latham, S.

https://openalex.org/W1988735436,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. At present, the etiology of breast cancer is unknown; however the possibility of a distinct cell of origin, i.e. a cancer stem cell, is a heavily investigated area of research. Influencing signals from the tissue niche are known to affect stem cells. Literature has shown that cancer cells lose their tumorigenic potential and display ‘normal’ behavior when placed into ‘normal’ ontogenic environments. Therefore, it may be the case that the tissue microenvironment is able to generate signals to redirect cancer cell fate. Previously, we showed that pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma cells could be redirected by the regenerating mammary gland microenvironment to contribute epithelial progeny for ‘normal’ gland development in-vivo. Here, we show that that human metastatic, non-metastatic, and metastasis-suppressed breast cancer cells proliferate and contribute to normal mammary gland development in-vivo without tumor formation. Immunochemistry for human-specific mitochondria, keratin 8 and 14, as well as human-specific milk proteins (alpha-lactalbumin, impregnated transplant hosts) confirmed the presence of human cell progeny. Features consistent with normal mammary gland development as seen in intact hosts (duct, lumen formation, development of secretory acini) were recapitulated in both primary and secondary outgrowths from chimeric implants. These results suggest the dominance of the tissue microenvironment over cancer cell fate. This work demonstrates that cultured human breast cancer cells (metastatic and non-metastatic) respond developmentally to signals generated by the mouse mammary gland microenvironment during gland regeneration in-vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2050752925,"Evidence for decline or threat of wild populations typically comes from multiple sources and methods that allow optimal integration of the available information, representing a major advance in planning management actions. We used integrated population modelling and perturbation analyses to assess the demographic consequences of the illegal use of poison for an insular population of Red Kites, Milvus milvus. We first pooled into a single statistical framework the annual census of breeding pairs, the available individual-based data, the average productivity and the number of birds admitted annually to the local rehabilitation centre. By combining these four types of information we were able to increase estimate precision and to obtain an estimate of the proportion of breeding adults, an important parameter that was not directly measured in the field and that is often difficult to assess. Subsequently, we used perturbation analyses to measure the expected change in the population growth rate due to a change in poison-related mortality. We found that poison accounted for 0.43 to 0.76 of the total mortality, for yearlings and older birds, respectively. Results from the deterministic population model indicated that this mortality suppressed the population growth rate by 20%. Despite this, the population was estimated to increase, albeit slowly. This positive trend was likely maintained by a very high productivity (1.83 fledglings per breeding pair) possibly promoted by supplementary feeding, a situation which is likely to be common to many large obligate or facultative European scavengers. Under this hypothetical scenario of double societal costs (poisoning of a threatened species and feeding programs), increasing poison control would help to lower the public cost of maintaining supplementary feeding stations."
https://openalex.org/W2005419876,"MEF2s transcription factors and class IIa HDACs compose a fundamental axis for several differentiation pathways. Functional relationships between this axis and cancer are largely unexplored. We have found that class IIa HDACs are heterogeneously expressed and display redundant activities in breast cancer cells. Applying gene set enrichment analysis to compare the expression profile of a list of putative MEF2 target genes, we have discovered a correlation between the down-regulation of the MEF2 signature and the aggressiveness of ER+ breast tumors. Kaplan-Meier analysis in ER+ breast tumors evidenced an association between increased class IIa HDACs expression and reduced survival. The important role of the MEF2-HDAC axis in ER+ breast cancer was confirmed in cultured cells. MCF7 ER+ cells were susceptible to silencing of class IIa HDACs in terms of both MEF2-dependent transcription and apoptosis. Conversely, in ER– MDA-MB-231 cells, the repressive influence of class IIa HDACs was dispensable. Similarly, a class IIa HDAC-specific inhibitor preferentially promoted the up-regulation of several MEF2 target genes and apoptosis in ER+ cell lines. The prosurvival function of class IIa HDACs could be explained by the repression of NR4A1/Nur77, a proapoptotic MEF2 target. In summary, our studies underscore a contribution of class IIa HDACs to aggressiveness of ER+ tumors.—Clocchiatti, A., Di Giorgio, E., Ingrao, S., Meyer-Almes, F.-J., Tripodo, C., Brancolini, C.

https://openalex.org/W1989728022,"Purpose We aimed to characterize the cardiovascular, lactate and perceived exertion responses in relation to performance during competition in junior and senior elite synchronized swimmers. Methods 34 high level senior (21.4±3.6 years) and junior (15.9±1.0) synchronized swimmers were monitored while performing a total of 96 routines during an official national championship in the technical and free solo, duet and team competitive programs. Heart rate was continuously monitored. Peak blood lactate was obtained from serial capillary samples during recovery. Post-exercise rate of perceived exertion was assessed using the Borg CR-10 scale. Total competition scores were obtained from official records. Results Data collection was complete in 54 cases. Pre-exercise mean heart rate (beats·min−1) was 129.1±13.1, and quickly increased during the exercise to attain mean peak values of 191.7±8.7, with interspersed bradycardic events down to 88.8±28.5. Mean peak blood lactate (mmol·L−1) was highest in the free solo (8.5±1.8) and free duet (7.6±1.8) and lowest at the free team (6.2±1.9). Mean RPE (0–10+) was higher in juniors (7.8±0.9) than in seniors (7.1±1.4). Multivariate analysis revealed that heart rate before and minimum heart rate during the routine predicted 26% of variability in final total score. Conclusions Cardiovascular responses during competition are characterized by intense anticipatory pre-activation and rapidly developing tachycardia up to maximal levels with interspersed periods of marked bradycardia during the exercise bouts performed in apnea. Moderate blood lactate accumulation suggests an adaptive metabolic response as a result of the specific training adaptations attributed to influence of the diving response in synchronized swimmers. Competitive routines are perceived as very to extremely intense, particularly in the free solo and duets. The magnitude of anticipatory heart rate activation and bradycardic response appear to be related to performance variability."
https://openalex.org/W2024495586,"Sperm are the most diverse cell type known: varying not only among- and within- species, but also among- and within-ejaculates of a single male. Recently, the causes and consequences of variability in sperm phenotypes have received much attention, but the importance of within-ejaculate variability remains largely unknown. Correlative evidence suggests that reduced within-ejaculate variation in sperm phenotype increases a male’s fertilization success in competitive conditions; but the transgenerational consequences of within-ejaculate variation in sperm phenotype remain relatively unexplored. Here we examine the relationship between sperm longevity and offspring performance in a marine invertebrate with external fertilization, Styela plicata. Offspring sired by longer-lived sperm had higher performance compared to offspring sired by freshly-extracted sperm of the same ejaculate, both in the laboratory and the field. This indicates that within-ejaculate differences in sperm longevity can influence offspring fitness – a source of variability in offspring phenotypes that has not previously been considered. Links between sperm phenotype and offspring performance may constrain responses to selection on either sperm or offspring traits, with broad ecological and evolutionary implications."
https://openalex.org/W2156049718,"Background Previous transcriptome profiling studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms of pollen and anther development, and identified many genes involved in these processes. However, only 51 anther ESTs of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were found in NCBI and there have been no reports of transcriptome profiling analyzing anther development in Upland cotton, a major fiber crop in the word. Methodology/Principal Finding Ninety-eight hundred and ninety-six high quality ESTs were sequenced from their 3′-ends and assembled into 6,643 unigenes from a normalized, full-length anther cDNA library of Upland cotton. Combined with previous sequenced anther-related ESTs, 12,244 unigenes were generated as the reference genes for digital gene expression (DGE) analysis. The DGE was conducted on anthers that were isolated at tetrad pollen (TTP), uninucleate pollen (UNP), binucleate pollen (BNP) and mature pollen (MTP) periods along with four other tissues, i.e., roots (RO), stems (ST), leaves (LV) and embryos (EB). Through transcriptome profiling analysis, we identified 1,165 genes that were enriched at certain anther development periods, and many of them were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversion, flavonoid biosynthesis, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Conclusions/Significance We first generated a normalized, full-length cDNA library from anthers and performed transcriptome profiling analysis of anther development in Upland cotton. From these results, 10,178 anther expressed genes were identified, among which 1,165 genes were stage-enriched in anthers. And many of these stage-enriched genes were involved in some important processes regulating anther development."
https://openalex.org/W1964447653,"Sotos syndrome (SoS) is characterized by tall stature, characteristic craniofacial features and mental retardation. It is caused by haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene. In this study, our objective was to identify downstream effectors of NSD1 and to map these effectors in signaling pathways associated with growth. Genome-wide expression studies were performed on dermal fibroblasts from SoS patients with a confirmed NSD1 abnormality. To substantiate those results, phosphorylation, siRNA and transfection experiments were performed. A significant association was demonstrated with the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. Members of the fibroblast growth factor family such as FGF4 and FGF13 contributed strongly to the differential expression in this pathway. In addition, a diminished activity state of the MAPK/ERK pathway was demonstrated in SoS. The Ras Interacting Protein 1 (RASIP1) was identified to exhibit upregulated expression in SoS. It was shown that RASIP1 dose-dependently potentiated bFGF induced expression of the MAPK responsive SBE reporter providing further support for a link between NSD1 and the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Additionally, we demonstrated NSD1 expression in the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes of normal human epiphyseal growth plates. In short stature syndromes such as hypochondroplasia and Noonan syndrome, the activation level of the FGF-MAPK/ERK-pathway in epiphyseal growth plates is a determining factor for statural growth. In analogy, we propose that deregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in SoS results in altered hypertrophic differentiation of NSD1 expressing chondrocytes and may be a determining factor in statural overgrowth and accelerated skeletal maturation in SoS."

The use of cardiac allografts for transplantation from donors after acute poisoning is still under discussion while acute ethanol intoxication is associated with myocardial functional and morphological changes. The aims of this work were 1) to evaluate in rats the time-course cardiac effects of acute ethanol-exposure and 2) to explore how its abuse by donors might affect recipients in cardiac pump function after transplantation.Rats received saline or ethanol (3.45 g/kg, ip). We evaluated both the mechanical and electrical aspects of cardiac function 1 h, 6 h or 24 h after injection. Plasma cardiac troponin-T and glucose-levels were measured and histological examination of the myocardium was performed. In addition, heart transplantation was performed, in which donors received ethanol 6 h or 24 h prior to explantation. Graft function was measured 1 h or 24 h after transplantation. Myocardial TBARS-concentration was measured; mRNA and protein expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.Ethanol administration resulted in decreased load-dependent (-34 ± 9%) and load-independent (-33 ± 12%) contractility parameters, LV end-diastolic pressure and elevated blood glucose levels at 1 h, which were reversed to the level of controls after 6 h and 24 h. In contrast to systolic dysfunction, active relaxation and passive stiffness are slowly recovered or sustained during 24 h. Moreover, troponin-T-levels were increased at 1 h, 6 h and 24 h after ethanol injection. ST-segment elevation (+47 ± 10%), elongated QT-interval (+38 ± 4%), enlarged cardiomyocyte, DNA-strand breaks, increased both mRNA and protein levels of superoxide dismutase-1, glutathione peroxydase-4, cytochrome-c-oxidase and metalloproteinase-9 were observed 24 h following ethanol-exposure. After heart transplantation, decreased myocardial contractility and relaxation, oxidative stress and altered protein expression were observed.These results demonstrate acute alcohol abuse increases the susceptibility of donor hearts to ischemia/reperfusion in a rat heart transplant model even though the global contractile function recovers 6 h after ethanol-administration."
https://openalex.org/W2006345615,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a unique, network-like morphology. The ER structures are composed of tubules, cisternae, and three-way junctions. This morphology is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but the molecular mechanism that maintains ER morphology has not yet been elucidated. In addition, certain Brassicaceae plants develop a unique ER-derived organelle called the ER body. This organelle accumulates large amounts of PYK10, a β-glucosidase, but its physiological functions are still obscure. We aimed to identify a novel factor required for maintaining the morphology of the ER, including ER bodies, and employed a forward-genetic approach using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (GFP-h) with fluorescently-labeled ER. We isolated and investigated a mutant (designated endoplasmic reticulum morphology3, ermo3) with huge aggregates and abnormal punctate structures of ER. ERMO3 encodes a GDSL-lipase/esterase family protein, also known as MVP1. Here, we showed that, although ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 was expressed ubiquitously, the morphological defects of ermo3 were specifically seen in a certain type of cells where ER bodies developed. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis combined with mass spectrometry revealed that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 interacts with the PYK10 complex, a huge protein complex that is thought to be important for ER body-related defense systems. We also found that the depletion of transcription factor NAI1, a master regulator for ER body formation, suppressed the formation of ER-aggregates in ermo3 cells, suggesting that NAI1 expression plays an important role in the abnormal aggregation of ER. Our results suggest that ERMO3/MVP1/GOLD36 is required for preventing ER and other organelles from abnormal aggregation and for maintaining proper ER morphology in a coordinated manner with NAI1."
https://openalex.org/W2025961714,"Quiescent cells are considered to be dormant. However, recent studies suggest that quiescent fibroblasts possess active metabolic profile and certain functional characteristics. We previously observed that serum-starved quiescent fibroblasts respond to proinflammatory stimuli by robust expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which declines after the quiescent fibroblasts are driven to proliferation. In this study, we elucidated the underlying signaling and transcriptional mechanism and identified by microarray genes with similar differential expression. By using pharmacological inhibitors coupled with gene silencing, we uncovered the key role of protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) and extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling in mediating COX-2 expression in quiescent cells. Surprisingly, COX-2 expression in proliferative cells was not blocked by PKCδ or ERK1/2 inhibitors due to intrinsic inhibition of PKCδ and ERK1/2 in proliferative cells. Restrained COX-2 transcription in proliferative cells was attributable to reduced NF-κB binding. Microarray analysis identified 35 genes whose expressions were more robust in quiescent than in proliferative cells. A majority of those genes belong to proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesive molecules and metalloproteinases, which require NF-κB for transcription. Quiescent fibroblasts had a higher migratory activity than proliferative fibroblasts as determined by the transwell assay. Selective COX-2 inhibition reduced migration which was restored by prostaglandin E(2). As COX-2 and inflammatory mediators induce DNA oxidation, we measured 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in quiescent vs. proliferative fibroblasts. PMA-induced 8-OHdG accumulation was significantly higher in quiescent than in proliferative fibroblasts. These findings indicate that quiescent fibroblasts (and probably other quiescent cells) are at the forefront in mounting inflammatory responses through expression of an array of proinflammatory genes via the PKCδ/ERK1/2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2054277280,"Animated movements of simple geometric shapes can readily be interpreted as depicting social events in which animate agents are engaged in intentional activity. However, the brain regions associated with such intention have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, intentional bias was manipulated using shape and pattern animations while measuring associated brain activity using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-five higher-intention involved and twenty-five lower-intention involved animations were presented to participants. Behavioral results showed that the degree of agency attribution of the mental state increased as intentional involvement increased. fMRI results revealed that the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), premotor, temporal pole, supramarginal gyrus, and superior parietal lobule (SPL) were activated while participants viewed the high-intention animations. In contrast, occipital, lingual, and middle frontal gyri were activated while the participants viewed the low-intention animations. These findings suggest that as agent attribution increases, the visual brain changes its functional role to the intentional brain and becomes a flexible network for processing information about social interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1976052388,"Abnormal amplification of centrosomes could lead to improper chromosome segregation and aneuploidy and is implicated in cancer development. Here, we demonstrate that Axin, a scaffolding protein in Wnt signaling, is phosphorylated by PLK1 during mitosis. Phosphorylation of Axin Ser-157 by PLK1 abolished Axin association with γ-tubulin, while substitution of Ser-157 with alanine exhibited sustained interaction with γ-tubulin. In addition, overexpression of Axin-S157A significantly increased the number of cells with multi-centrosomes. These results suggest that the phosphorylation status of Axin, mediated by PLK1, dynamically regulates its association with γ-tubulin and centrosome formation and segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2036177517,"There is a surging interest in the evolution, ecology and physiology of personality differences. However, most of the studies in this research area have been performed in adult animals. Trait variations expressed early in development and how they are related to the ontogeny of an animal’s personality are far less studied. Genetic differences as well as environmental factors causing functional variability of the central serotonergic system have been related to personality differences in vertebrates, including humans. Such gene-environment interplay suggests that the central serotonergic system plays an important role in the ontogeny of personality traits. In salmonid fishes, the timing of emergence from spawning nests is related to energy reserves, aggression, and social dominance. However, it is currently unknown how the size of the yolk reserve is reflected on aggression and dominance, or if these traits are linked to differences in serotonergic transmission in newly emerged larvae. In this study we investigated the relationship between yolk reserves, social dominance, and serotonergic transmission in newly emerged rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) larvae. This was conducted by allowing larvae with the same emergence time, but with different yolk sizes, to interact in pairs for 24 h. The results show that individuals with larger yolks performed more aggressive acts, resulting in a suppression of aggression in individuals with smaller yolks. A higher brain serotonergic activity confirmed subordination in larvae with small yolks. The relationship between social dominance and yolk size was present in siblings, demonstrating a link between interfamily variation in energy reserves and aggression, and suggests that larger yolk reserves fuel a more aggressive personality during the initial territorial establishment in salmonid fishes. Furthermore, socially naïve larvae with big yolks had lower serotonin levels, suggesting that other factors than the social environment causes variation in serotonergic transmission, underlying individual variation in aggressive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2116172285,"The Meishan pig breed exhibits increased prolificacy and reduced neonatal mortality compared to commercial breeds, such as the Large White, prompting breeders to introduce the Meishan genotype into commercial herds. Commercial piglets are highly susceptible to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and death, potentially due to limited lipid stores and/or delayed hepatic metabolic ability. We therefore hypothesized that variation in hepatic development and lipid metabolism could contribute to the differences in neonatal mortality between breeds. Liver samples were obtained from piglets of each breed on days 0, 7, and 21 of postnatal age and subjected to molecular and biochemical analysis. At birth, both breeds exhibited similar hepatic glycogen contents, despite Meishan piglets having significantly lower body weight. The livers from newborn Meishan piglets exhibited increased C18∶1n9C and C20∶1n9 but lower C18∶0, C20∶4n6, and C22∶6n3 fatty acid content. Furthermore, by using an unsupervised machine learning approach, we detected an interaction between C18∶1n9C and glycogen content in newborn Meishan piglets. Bioinformatic analysis could identify unique age-based clusters from the lipid profiles in Meishan piglets that were not apparent in the commercial offspring. Examination of the fatty acid signature during the neonatal period provides novel insights into the body composition of Meishan piglets that may facilitate liver responses that prevent hypoglycaemia and reduce offspring mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2050085957,"The goal of this research is to determine if different gender-preferred social styles can be observed within the user interactions at an online cancer community. To achieve this goal, we identify and measure variables that pertain to each gender-specific social style.We perform social network and statistical analysis on the communication flow of 8,388 members at six different cancer forums over eight years. Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to measure the difference between the number of intimate (and highly intimate) dyads, relationship length, and number of communications. We determine that two patients are more likely to form an intimate bond on a gender-specific cancer forum (ovarian P = <0.0001, breast P = 0.0089, prostate P = 0.0021). Two female patients are more likely to form a highly intimate bond on a female-specific cancer forum (Ovarian P<0.0001, Breast P<0.01). Typically a male patient communicates with more members than a female patient (Ovarian forum P = 0.0406, Breast forum P = 0.0013). A relationship between two patients is longer on the gender-specific cancer forums than a connection between two members not identified as patients (ovarian forum P = 0.00406, breast forum P = 0.00013, prostate forum P = .0.0003).The high level of interconnectedness among the prostate patients supports the hypothesis that men prefer to socialize in large, interconnected, less-intimate groups. A female patient is more likely to form a highly intimate connection with another female patient; this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that woman prefer fewer, more intimate connections. The relationships of same-gender cancer patients last longer than other relationships; this finding demonstrates homophily within these online communities. Our findings regarding online communication preferences are in agreement with research findings from person-to-person communication preference studies. These findings should be considered when designing online communities as well as designing and evaluating psychosocial and educational interventions for cancer patients."

Genome-wide expression patterns of uncultured peripheral blood cells are useful to understanding of DS-associated immune dysfunction. We used a Human Exon microarray to characterize gene expression in uncultured peripheral blood cells derived from DS individuals and age-matched controls from two age groups: neonate (N) and child (C). A total of 174 transcript clusters (gene-level) with eight located on Hsa21 in N group and 383 transcript clusters including 56 on Hsa21 in C group were significantly dysregulated in DS individuals. Microarray data were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Functional analysis revealed that the dysregulated genes in DS were significantly enriched in two and six KEGG pathways in N and C group, respectively. These pathways included leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, B cell receptor signaling pathway and primary immunodeficiency, etc., which causally implicated dysfunctional immunity in DS. Our results provided a comprehensive picture of gene expression patterns in DS at the two developmental stages and pointed towards candidate genes and molecular pathways potentially associated with the immune dysfunction in DS."
https://openalex.org/W2058376752,"We introduce a statistical method for evaluating atomic level 3D interaction patterns of protein-ligand contacts. Such patterns can be used for fast separation of likely ligand and ligand binding site combinations out of all those that are geometrically possible. The practical purpose of this probabilistic method is for molecular docking and scoring, as an essential part of a scoring function. Probabilities of interaction patterns are calculated conditional on structural x-ray data and predefined chemical classification of molecular fragment types. Spatial coordinates of atoms are modeled using a Bayesian statistical framework with parametric 3D probability densities. The parameters are given distributions a priori, which provides the possibility to update the densities of model parameters with new structural data and use the parameter estimates to create a contact hierarchy. The contact preferences can be defined for any spatial area around a specified type of fragment. We compared calculated contact point hierarchies with the number of contact atoms found near the contact point in a reference set of x-ray data, and found that these were in general in a close agreement. Additionally, using substrate binding site in cathechol-O-methyltransferase and 27 small potential binder molecules, it was demonstrated that these probabilities together with auxiliary parameters separate well ligands from decoys (true positive rate 0.75, false positive rate 0). A particularly useful feature of the proposed Bayesian framework is that it also characterizes predictive uncertainty in terms of probabilities, which have an intuitive interpretation from the applied perspective."
