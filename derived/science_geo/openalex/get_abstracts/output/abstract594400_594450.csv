Wright et al. analyzed leaf data for 7670 plant species, along with climatic data, from 682 sites worldwide. Their findings reveal consistent patterns and explain why earlier predictions from energy balance theory had only limited success. The authors provide a fully quantitative explanation for the latitudinal gradient in leaf size, with implications for plant ecology and physiology, vegetation modeling, and paleobotany.

However, single-cell sequencing reveals cellular heterogeneity and rare cell types. At the onset of gastrulation, the fly embryo consists of about 6000 cells with distinct gene expression profiles. Karaiskos et al. developed an algorithm to generate an interactive three-dimensional (3D) “virtual embryo,” with the expression of more than 8000 genes per cell measured for most cells (see the Perspective by Stadler and Eisen). The virtual embryo offers insights into developmental mechanisms—from local expression of regulators such as transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs to spatial modulation of signaling pathways.

Mittal et al. ran a small-molecule screen to identify compounds that regulate levels of SNCA expression and found that several β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) agonists reduced them (see the Perspective by Snyder). These compounds modulated epigenetic marks at the SNCA gene, effectively suppressing SNCA transcription. The authors looked at the pharmaceutical history of more than 4 million Norwegians over an 11-year period and found a reduced risk of PD among those that were taking one of the β2AR agonists for other medical problems.

Working in mice, Wang et al. found that an epithelial cell circadian transcription factor, NFIL3, is involved in regulating body composition through lipid uptake. Flagellin and lipopolysaccharide produced by certain microbes tuned the amplitude of oscillation of NFIL3 through innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) signaling, STAT3, and the epithelial cell clock. Such interactions may help to explain why circadian clock disruptions in humans, arising from shift work or international travel, frequently track with metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

In searching for the enzyme responsible, Sorigué et al. found a glucose-methanolcholine oxidoreductase (see the Perspective by Scrutton). Expression of the enzyme in Escherichia coli showed that hydrocarbon production requires visible light. In fact, the enzyme requires a constant input of blue photons to carry out its catalytic reaction. A long hydrophobic tunnel in the enzyme stabilizes the fatty acid substrates in proximity to the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. Science , this issue p. 903 ; see also p. 872"

https://openalex.org/W2751205196,"Background Microorganisms in the human intestine (i.e. the gut microbiome) have an increasingly recognized impact on human health, including brain functioning. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission and deficits in reward processing and its underlying neuro-circuitry including the ventral striatum. The microbiome might contribute to ADHD etiology via the gut-brain axis. In this pilot study, we investigated potential differences in the microbiome between ADHD cases and undiagnosed controls, as well as its relation to neural reward processing. Methods We used 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing (16S) to identify bacterial taxa and their predicted gene functions in 19 ADHD and 77 control participants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we interrogated the effect of observed microbiome differences in neural reward responses in a subset of 28 participants, independent of diagnosis. Results For the first time, we describe gut microbial makeup of adolescents and adults diagnosed with ADHD. We found that the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa differed between cases and controls, albeit marginally significant. A nominal increase in the Bifidobacterium genus was observed in ADHD cases. In a hypothesis-driven approach, we found that the observed increase was linked to significantly enhanced 16S-based predicted bacterial gene functionality encoding cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in cases relative to controls. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine, a precursor of dopamine. Increased relative abundance of this functionality was significantly associated with decreased ventral striatal fMRI responses during reward anticipation, independent of ADHD diagnosis and age. Conclusions Our results show increases in gut microbiome predicted function of dopamine precursor synthesis between ADHD cases and controls. This increase in microbiome function relates to decreased neural responses to reward anticipation. Decreased neural reward anticipation constitutes one of the hallmarks of ADHD."

Hainmueller et al. developed a quasi-experimental protocol to address this complicated question. They selected mothers who had birthdates either just before or just after the cutoff for the United States' Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Children whose mothers were protected from deportation by DACA had 50% fewer diagnoses of adjustment and anxiety disorder than children with mothers whose birthdates, by coincidence, preceded the cutoff and who thus were not protected.

https://openalex.org/W2751066035,"The clinical outcomes and therapeutic strategies for infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) are not uniform. The primary objectives of this study were to identify the differences in the clinical characteristics and prognoses between ILC and IDC, and identify the high-risk population based on the hormone receptor status and metastasis sites. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database was searched and patients diagnosed with ILC or IDC from 1990 to 2013 were identified. In total,796,335 patients were analyzed, including 85,048 withILC (10.7%) and 711,287 withIDC (89.3%). The ILC group was correlatedwith older age, larger tumor size, later stage, lower grade, metastasis disease(M1) disease, and greater counts ofpositive lymph nodesandestrogen-receptor-positive (ER)/progesterone receptor-positive (PR) positive nodes. The overall survival showed an early advantage for ILC but a worse outcome after 5 years. Regarding the disease-specific survival, the IDC cohort had advantages over the ILC group, both during the early years and long-term. In hormone status and metastasis site subgroup analyses, the ER+/PR+ subgroup had the best survival, while the ER+/PR- subgroup had the worst outcome, especially the ILC cohort. ILC and IDC had different metastasis patterns. The proportion of bone metastasis was higher in the ILC group (91.52%) than that in the IDC (76.04%), and the ILC group was more likely to have multiple metastasis sites. Survival analyses showed patients with ILC had a higher risk of liver metastasis (disease-specific survival[DSS]; P = 0.046), but had a better overall survival than the bone metastasis group (P<0.0001). We concluded that the long-term prognosis for ILC was poorer than that for IDC, and the ER+/PR- subgroup had the worst outcome. Therefore, the metastasis pattern and prognosis must be seriously evaluated, and a combination of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy should be considered."

Although the centrosome organizes the microtubule cytoskeleton in most animal cells, this organelle is absent in early development. Using live-cell imaging, Zenker et al. found that the cells of the early mouse embryo are connected by stable microtubule bridges to direct the growth of microtubules within them. Microtubules emanating from the bridges help to guide transport of key proteins, including E-cadherin, to the cell membrane to control cell polarization during early development.

https://openalex.org/W2753479285,"Aberrant activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a common feature of pathological cascades observed in diverse disorders, such as cancer, fibrosis, immune dysregulation, and neurodegenerative diseases. MMP-9, in particular, is highly dynamically regulated in several pathological processes. Development of MMP inhibitors has therefore been an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention. However, a long history of failed clinical trials has demonstrated that broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors have limited clinical utility, which has spurred the development of inhibitors selective for individual MMPs. Attaining selectivity has been technically challenging because of sequence and structural conservation across the various MMPs. Here, through a biochemical and structural screening paradigm, we have identified JNJ0966, a highly selective compound that inhibited activation of MMP-9 zymogen and subsequent generation of catalytically active enzyme. JNJ0966 had no effect on MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, or MMP-14 catalytic activity and did not inhibit activation of the highly related MMP-2 zymogen. The molecular basis for this activity was characterized as an interaction of JNJ0966 with a structural pocket in proximity to the MMP-9 zymogen cleavage site near Arg-106, which is distinct from the catalytic domain. JNJ0966 was efficacious in reducing disease severity in a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, demonstrating the viability of this therapeutic approach. This discovery reveals an unprecedented pharmacological approach to MMP inhibition, providing an opportunity to improve selectivity of future clinical drug candidates.

Currently, ∼23 MMPs have been identified, comprising secreted and membrane-bound forms, and different family members share some common structural and functional domains and have varying degrees of substrate specificity. Abnormal expression and activation of MMPs has been implicated in the pathogenesis and pathological progression of several different human diseases that are centered in many different tissues in the periphery and central nervous system (2Fingleton B.

Despite intensive efforts over many years to develop synthetic MMP inhibitors, only a single MMP inhibitor, Periostat, a tetracycline derivative used in periodontal disease, has progressed into regular clinical use (4Golub L.M. Sorsa T. Lee H.M. Ciancio S. Sorbi D. Ramamurthy N.S. Gruber B. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Doxycycline inhibits neutrophil (PMN)-type matrix metalloproteinases in human adult periodontitis gingiva.J. Clin. Periodontol. 1995; 22: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Of the ∼50 other clinical trials conducted with active site MMP inhibitors, all have failed due to the onset of significant dose-limiting musculoskeletal toxicity or lack of efficacy (5Skiles J.W. Gonnella N.C. Jeng A.Y. The design, structure, and clinical update of small molecular weight matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors.Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 2911-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These compounds were based on hydroxamic acid or related chelator chemistry that acts to perturb the critical coordinating zinc in the catalytic domain, which results in loss of enzymatic activity. The high degree of sequence conservation and structural similarity in the catalytic domain across MMPs contributes to the broad-spectrum, nonspecific nature of these compounds. Among the aforementioned clinical studies that did not meet their primary efficacy end points, there have been results that demonstrate some biological proof of concept for a therapeutic effect of MMP inhibition. In an oncology trial using the MMP active site inhibitor marimastat, patients who developed treatment-related musculoskeletal adverse events had significantly better survival rates as compared with those who did not manifest these adverse events (6King J. Zhao J. Clingan P. Morris D. Randomised double blind placebo control study of adjuvant treatment with the metalloproteinase inhibitor, Marimastat in patients with inoperable colorectal hepatic metastases: significant survival advantage in patients with musculoskeletal side-effects.Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 639-645PubMed Google Scholar). These data confirm the biological hypothesis that attaining a therapeutic exposure of an MMP inhibitor can be efficacious in treating human disease but also highlight the observation that significant dose- and exposure-limiting side effects of broad-spectrum inhibitors limit their clinical utility. Although the molecular basis for MMP inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal toxicity is probably complex and not fully understood, it has been hypothesized that the poor selectivity of active site inhibitors contributes to their side effect profile. Therefore, if selective and tolerable MMP inhibitors could be developed, these therapeutic agents could provide powerful tools for the treatment of many debilitating and often terminal diseases. Several alternative mechanisms for targeting MMPs have been utilized in which the catalytic zinc is not targeted (7Pirard B.

Although these new approaches hold promise due to enhanced selectivity, the clinical utility of these compounds and others employing alternative inhibitory strategies has not yet been determined. The activity of MMP-9 (also known as gelatinase B, 92-kDa gelatinase) is typically associated with the breakdown of type IV and V collagens during tissue remodeling. MMP-9 is also significantly up-regulated in many human diseases, and this aberrant activity is thought to contribute to pathological processes (2Fingleton B.

MMP-9–selective inhibitors could prove useful in ameliorating the pathology associated with these diseases. As described herein, we have discovered a novel pharmacological approach for highly selective inhibition of MMP-9. This approach has identified a small molecule, known as JNJ0966, which prevents conversion of the MMP-9 zymogen, or proenzyme, into the catalytically active enzyme. We have characterized the molecular mechanism of MMP-9 inhibition through a series of biochemical and structural studies, revealing that the compound interacts directly with the MMP-9 zymogen. The specificity of JNJ0966 for inhibiting MMP-9 activation was also explored, as was potential clinical utility in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an in vivo model for human neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Inhibitors of MMP-9 activation were identified by high-throughput screening using the ThermoFluor® platform to identify compounds that bound to MMP-9 and modified the protein’s thermal stability profile (34Cummings M.D. Farnum M.A. Nelen M.I. Universal screening methods and applications of ThermoFluor.J. Biomol. Screen. 2006; 11: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Screening against catalytically inactive human MMP-9 (Fig. 1A, amino acids 20–445, termed proMMP-9) purified from bacteria identified several compounds that bound the recombinant protein with varying affinities, one of which, designated JNJ0966 (Fig. 1B), exhibited a ThermoFluor®-determined affinity (KD) of 5.0 μm and was selected for additional profiling. To evaluate the effects of JNJ0966 on proMMP-9 activation, a putative endogenous activation mechanism was utilized, reacting recombinant human proMMP-9 with catalytically active matrix metalloproteinase-3 (catMMP-3). The resultant MMP-9 enzymatic activity was measured by monitoring cleavage of a fluorescent MMP-9–specific substrate, DQ-gelatin, which was not cleaved to a great extent by catMMP-3 or proMMP-9 alone (Fig. 1A). Incubating proMMP-9 with catMMP-3 significantly increased the cleavage of DQ-gelatin relative to proMMP-9 or catMMP-3 alone, indicating that active MMP-9 was generated. However, adding 10 μm JNJ0966 to the reaction before the addition of catMMP-3 significantly reduced subsequent DQ-gelatin cleavage. To evaluate the concentration-response profile of JNJ0966, compound was titrated with a constant concentration of proMMP-9 and catMMP-3, demonstrating an IC50 of 440 nm (95% confidence interval (CI) 341–567 nm) under these assay conditions (Fig. 1C). To exclude the possibility that the effects of JNJ0966 could be explained through a direct inhibition of MMP-3 and/or MMP-9 enzymatic activity, the effects of JNJ0966 on catMMP-3 and active MMP-9 were evaluated. Active MMP-9 (catMMP-9) was generated by first reacting proMMP-9 with catMMP-3. Whereas enzymatic activity could be blocked in both assays by GM6001, a potent, non-selective active site MMP inhibitor (catMMP-3 IC50 = 7.2 nm, 95% CI 6.8–7.7 nm; catMMP-9 IC50 = 0.45 nm, 95% CI 0.42–0.49 nm), JNJ0966 did not exhibit any inhibition of either active enzyme (Fig. 1, D and E). Taken together, these data indicate that JNJ0966 inhibited the conversion of proMMP-9 to active MMP-9 but was not a direct inhibitor of MMP-9 or MMP-3 enzymatic activity. The utility of this novel mechanism for MMP inhibition resides in the potential for specificity, as the physiologic pathways for activation of different MMPs appear to be distinct (35Ra H.J. Parks W.C. Control of matrix metalloproteinase catalytic activity.Matrix Biol. 2007; 26: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To test the selectivity of JNJ0966 for proMMP-9 versus other MMP family members, proenzyme versions of MMP-1 (proMMP-1), MMP-3 (proMMP-3), and proMMP-9 zymogens were reacted with trypsin as an alternative activating enzyme, and the proenzyme of MMP-2 (proMMP-2) was reacted with a catalytic fragment of MMP-14 (36Hernandez-Barrantes S.

In this assay, the activations of proMMP-1, proMMP-2, and proMMP-3 were not significantly different in the presence or absence of 10 μm JNJ0966, whereas proMMP-9 activation by trypsin was significantly attenuated (Fig. 1F). Additional concentration-response studies demonstrated that JNJ0966 inhibited trypsin-dependent proMMP-9 activation to an extent similar to that observed for inhibition of proMMP-9 activation by catMMP-3 (IC50 = 429 nm, 95% CI 405–602 nm; Fig. 1G). These data also indicate that JNJ0966 at 10 μm did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of MMP-1, MMP-2, or MMP-14. To explore the consequences of inhibiting proMMP-9 activation in a functional cellular context, we utilized an invasion assay with HT1080 cells. Cellular invasion through a MatrigelTM extracellular matrix layer was measured in control cells or in cells treated with increasing concentrations of JNJ0966, GM6001, or doxycycline, the latter of which is a low-potency, non-selective MMP inhibitor. Doxycycline inhibited the invasion of HT1080 cells across the MatrigelTM layer (IC50 = 21.4 μm, 95% CI 13.7–33.5 μm); however, JNJ0966 (IC50 = 1.0 μm, 95% CI 0.8–1.4 μm) and GM6001 (IC50 = 1.4 μm, 95% CI 0.7–2.8 μm) were 21- and 15-fold more potent, respectively (Fig. 1, H and I). These results were consistent with previous reports demonstrating reduced invasion through simulated extracellular matrices in cells with reduced MMP-9 catalytic activity (38Björklund M. Heikkilä P.

Activation of proMMP-9 is a sequential two-step process in which the full-length proenzyme (92 kDa) is cleaved at Glu-59 to an intermediate form (86 kDa), followed by a second cleavage event at Arg-106 to generate the mature, lower-molecular mass (82 kDa) catalytically active enzyme (41Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinase 3 (stromelysin) activates the precursor for the human matrix metalloproteinase 9.J. Biol.

To confirm and extend the observed biochemical and functional effects of JNJ0966, the activation of proMMP-9 was characterized utilizing a parallel approach, with simultaneous analysis of replicate samples by gelatin zymography, immunoblotting, and DQ-gelatin activity assays measured over time. The immunoblotting studies utilized an antibody that bound to all forms of the protein (pan-MMP-9, or total MMP-9) and antibodies that specifically recognized only proMMP-9, the intermediate form, or fully processed MMP-9. The latter two antibodies were generated against the N-terminal neo-epitopes generated after each of the proMMP-9 cleavage events at Glu-59 and Arg-106 and were specific to those forms, respectively. The anti-proMMP-9 antibody was generated against an epitope residing at the N terminus only in the intact full-length protein. In the absence of JNJ0966, incubating proMMP-9 with catMMP-3 resulted in a time-dependent conversion of proMMP-9 to the intermediate and fully processed forms (Fig. 2, A–E). The addition of JNJ0966 to in the reaction resulted in a significant reduction in fully processed MMP-9 (Fig. 2, A, B, and E) and an apparent accumulation of the intermediate species (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). Analyzing replicate samples in a DQ-gelatin activity assay demonstrated increasing amounts of MMP-9 activity in control conditions that correlated with the accumulation of fully processed MMP-9, whereas in samples that contained JNJ0966, a significant reduction in this lower molecular weight species and enzymatic activity was observed (Fig. 2, E and F). To fully explore the kinetics of MMP-9 maturation in the presence and absence of 10 μm JNJ0966, a more detailed time course was conducted, and the relative abundance of different MMP-9 species was quantified by densitometry of a gelatin zymogram (Fig. 3, A–D). Processing of the 92-kDa full-length proMMP-9 form was reduced by JNJ0966, as more of this species remained at each time point relative to the controls; however, after an initial delay in processing, the conversion from 92-kDa proMMP-9 appeared to proceed at a similar rate in both control and JNJ0966-containing conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). In control conditions, abundance of the 86-kDa intermediate form peaked at the 10-min time point and then declined thereafter; however, in the presence of JNJ0966, the intermediate form accumulated over time (Fig. 3, A and C). The 82-kDa fully processed form of MMP-9 accumulated over time in control conditions, whereas in the presence of JNJ0966, the rate of accumulation was substantially reduced (Fig. 3, A and D). These results indicated that JNJ0966 had a minor effect on reducing the initial processing step in proMMP-9 activation (from 92 to 86 kDa); however, a more robust effect was observed on inhibiting the processing of the intermediate form to the catalytically active species (from 86 to 82 kDa). Interestingly, in ThermoFluor studies, the affinity (KD) of JNJ0966 for proMMP-9 improved from 5 to 0.33 μm when a shorter construct containing amino acids 67–445 was utilized as compared with the longer construct containing amino acids 20–445. No binding of JNJ0966 to catalytically active MMP-9 could be detected. Together, these data indicate that JNJ0966 binds preferentially to the intermediate MMP-9 species and with a reduced affinity for the unprocessed full-length zymogen. In an effort to characterize the mechanistic basis for JNJ0966 inhibitory activity, crystallization experiments were initiated on proMMP-9 with and without the addition of JNJ0966. A construct was designed starting after the first observable electron density seen in previous MMP-9 structures and extending to the end of the metalloproteinase domain (amino acids 29–444) (43Elkins P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2753061054,"Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. CRISPR mediated, template-dependent homology-directed gene editing has been used to correct the most common mutation, c.1521_1523delCTT / p.Phe508del (F508del) which affects ~70% of individuals, but the efficiency was relatively low. Here, we describe a high efficiency strategy for editing of three different rare CFTR mutations which together account for about 3% of individuals with Cystic Fibrosis. The mutations cause aberrant splicing of CFTR mRNA due to the creation of cryptic splice signals that result in the formation of pseudoexons containing premature stop codons c.1679+1634A>G (1811+1.6kbA>G) and c.3718-2477C>T (3849+10kbC>T), or an out-of-frame 5’ extension to an existing exon c.3140-26A>G (3272-26A>G). We designed pairs of Cas9 guide RNAs to create targeted double-stranded breaks in CFTR either side of each mutation which resulted in high efficiency excision of the target genomic regions via non-homologous end-joining repair. When evaluated in a mini-gene splicing assay, we showed that targeted excision restored normal splicing for all three mutations. This approach could be used to correct aberrant splicing signals or remove disruptive transcription regulatory motifs caused by deep-intronic mutations in a range of other genetic disorders."

Methods A sample set of 100 eyes from 49 subjects (41 eyes with crystalline lenses and 59 eyes with IOLs) were imaged using second generation AS-OCT (CASIA2, TOMEY) in June and July 2016 at Okayama University. Both mydriatic and non-mydriatic images were obtained, and the tilt and decentration of the crystalline lens and the IOL were quantified. The effects of pupil dilation on measurements were also assessed. Results The crystalline lens showed an average tilt of 5.15° towards the inferotemporal direction relative to the corneal topographic axis under non-mydriatic conditions and 5.25° under mydriatic conditions. Additionally, an average decentration of 0.11 mm towards the temporal direction was observed under non-mydriatic conditions and 0.08 mm under mydriatic conditions. The average tilt for the IOL was 4.31° towards the inferotemporal direction relative to the corneal topographic axis under non-mydriatic conditions and 4.65° in the same direction under mydriatic conditions. The average decentration was 0.05 mm towards the temporal direction under non-mydriatic conditions and 0.08 mm in the same direction under mydriatic conditions. A strong correlation was found between the average tilt and decentration values of the crystalline lens and the IOL under both non-mydriatic and mydriatic conditions (all Spearman correlation coefficients, r ≥ 0.800; all P < 0.001). Conclusion When measured using second generation AS-OCT, both the crystalline lens and the IOL showed an average tilt of 4–6° toward the inferotemporal direction relative to the corneal topographic axis and an average decentration of less than 0.12 mm towards the temporal direction. These results were not influenced by pupil dilation and they showed good repeatability."

H. jecorina Cel7A, cellobiohydrolase I, from glycoside hydrolase family 7, is the workhorse enzyme of the process. However, the thermal stability of Cel7A limits its use to processes where temperatures are no higher than 50 °C. Enhanced thermal stability is desirable to enable the use of higher processing temperatures and to improve the economic feasibility of industrial biomass conversion. Here, we enhanced the thermal stability of Cel7A through directed evolution. Sites with increased thermal stability properties were combined, and a Cel7A variant (FCA398) was obtained, which exhibited a 10.4 °C increase in Tm and a 44-fold greater half-life compared with the wild-type enzyme. This Cel7A variant contains 18 mutated sites and is active under application conditions up to at least 75 °C. The X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain was determined at 2.1 Å resolution and showed that the effects of the mutations are local and do not introduce major backbone conformational changes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the catalytic domain of wild-type Cel7A and the FCA398 variant exhibit similar behavior at 300 K, whereas at elevated temperature (475 and 525 K), the FCA398 variant fluctuates less and maintains more native contacts over time.

The latter two approaches rely on the ability to both express the enzyme in a microorganism and assay it using high-throughput screening methods. However, heterologous expression of Cel7A from H. jecorina in Escherichia coli, a traditional high-throughput expression host, has notoriously failed to produce either soluble or active enzyme. In yeast, expression levels are low, and the properties of expressed Cel7s have been unpredictable (31Godbole S. Decker S.R. Nieves R.A. Adney W.S. Vinzant T.B. Baker J.O. Thomas S.R. Himmel M.E.

The latter obstacle is probably a result of both the lack of N-terminal glutamine cyclization of Cel7A expressed in yeast and the significant variation in protein glycosylation (35Dana C.M.

The variant, which was reported to contain an average of 42 unspecified mutations, retained some hydrolytic activity on soluble cellulose at temperatures up to 70 °C. In a follow-up study, the inclusion of an additional eight mutations improved the T50 (temperature at which a 10-min incubation without substrate results in loss of half of the activity) to 72.1 °C (37Komor R.S.

In a similar approach, chimeric libraries of Cel7A (not including H. jecorina Cel7A) were expressed in S. cerevisiae and found to contain stabilized variants (38Dana C.M. Saija P. Kal S.M. Bryan M.B.

Although these studies demonstrate that GH7 enzyme thermal stability can be improved through a variety of protein engineering approaches, we do not yet understand why these mutations, either singular or multiple, result in improved stability. Moreover, there has only been one report of improved thermal stability of H. jecorina Cel7A in the scientific literature (41Smith M.A. Bedbrook C.N. Wu T. Arnold F.H. Hypocrea jecorina cellobiohydrolase I stabilizing mutations identified using noncontiguous recombination.ACS Synth. Biol. 2013; 2: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As part of a large, broad campaign to find stabilizing mutations in H. jecorina Cel7A (42Day A. Goedegebuur F. Gualfetti P. Mitchinson C. Neefe P. Sandgren M. Shaw A. Stahlberg J. Variant Hypocrea jecorina CBH1 cellulases.January 28 2014Google Scholar), we developed a host/vector system for heterologous expression of Cel7A in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger var. awamori AP4, using a constitutive promoter to limit the background of host proteins and potential interference from other carbohydrases. We demonstrated the successful expression of GH7 CBHs from various fungi in the A. niger AP4 system (20Momeni M.H. Goedegebuur F. Hansson H. Karkehabadi S. Askarieh G. Mitchinson C. Larenas E.A.

Crystallogr. 2014; 70: 2356-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using approaches i, ii, and iii above, a collection of H. jecorina Cel7A variants was generated and found to be stable by thermal inactivation screening (42Day A. Goedegebuur F. Gualfetti P. Mitchinson C. Neefe P. Sandgren M. Shaw A. Stahlberg J. Variant Hypocrea jecorina CBH1 cellulases.January 28 2014Google Scholar). In this paper we characterize the most stable of those variants, assessing their thermal stability, residual activity after incubation at elevated temperatures using a model substrate, and activity on amorphous cellulose. We also study combinations of the variants with further improvements in stability. This combinatorial approach has proven effective in other systems (43Kanaya S.

To address the fundamental gap in understanding of structural and dynamic contributions to GH7 thermal stability, specifically that of H. jecorina Cel7A, we focus on the most stable Cel7A variant, FCA398, with 18 mutations, solving its crystal structure and using high-temperature molecular simulation to evaluate changes in its structural dynamics compared with wild type. Overall, our study reveals that it is possible to make significant improvements to the thermal stability of H. jecorina Cel7A by the accumulation of many mutations, and through a combination of structural and dynamic approaches, we develop rationales for the beneficial effects of most of the mutations made. To improve the thermal stability of H. jecorina Cel7A, mutations have been introduced in the protein molecule using protein engineering. Following high-throughput fungal expression and screening, a large set of point mutations resulting in enhanced residual activity after incubation at elevated temperature was identified (42Day A. Goedegebuur F. Gualfetti P. Mitchinson C. Neefe P. Sandgren M. Shaw A. Stahlberg J. Variant Hypocrea jecorina CBH1 cellulases.January 28 2014Google Scholar). In the present study, a group of these were chosen for larger-scale expression in A. niger var. awamori AP4 and purification for more detailed analyses (Table 1), including wild-type Cel7A (FCA301) as a control. Site-specific combination mutants were then generated, expressed, and screened, leading to a Cel7A variant (FCA398) with 18 mutations and substantially improved thermal stability. Herein, we present the results for the most thermally stable Cel7A variant, FCA398, and key variants in its development (Table 2).Table 1Protein Tm for selected variants of H. jecorina Cel7AVariantMutationsTmaTm is unfolding temperature, measured by CD spectroscopy; ΔTm is Tm value minus the Tm value of FCA301 (wild-type Cel7A).ΔTmaTm is unfolding temperature, measured by CD spectroscopy; ΔTm is Tm value minus the Tm value of FCA301 (wild-type Cel7A).°C°CFCA301None62.50FCA330S8P63.7+1.2FCA328G22D/S278P/T296P63.6+1.1FCA335T41I64.2+1.7FCA332N49S63.7+1.2FCA347A68T63.7+1.2FCA377N89D63.5+1.0FCA374S92T64.4+1.9FCA326S113N64.0+1.5FCA375S196T/S411F65.3+2.8FCA334P227L65.2+2.7FCA373P227A64.8+2.3FCA349D249K64.0+1.5FCA376T255P64.4+1.9FCA384E295K64.0+1.5FCA372S297L/V403D/T462I64.5+2.0FCA468N301R63.0+0.5FCA369T332Y63.3+0.8a Tm is unfolding temperature, measured by CD spectroscopy; ΔTm is Tm value minus the Tm value of FCA301 (wild-type Cel7A).

Open table in a new tab Thermal stability was assessed by monitoring the irreversible thermal denaturation of the purified Cel7A variants with CD spectroscopy for determination of protein Tm. The obtained Tm values and ΔTm, compared with wild type, are shown in Table 1, Table 2. For comparison, Tm was also determined for Cel7A wild type isolated from a native H. jecorina culture; the Tm of natively expressed Cel7A, 62.4 ± 0.3 °C, was the same as that of FCA301 (wild-type Cel7A expressed in A. niger var. awamori), 62.5 ± 0.3 °C. All the analyzed variants exhibited higher Tm than the wild-type enzyme, as expected from their identification as more thermally stable in the residual activity screening. In general, the stabilizing effect of individual point mutations was small, where ΔTm was in the range of +1 to +2 °C for a majority, up to +2.7 °C for P227L (FCA334), and +2.8 °C for S196F/S411F (FCA375) (Table 1). When a larger number of sites were combined, a significant enhancement of Tm was achieved, as exemplified by FCA353, FCA367, and FCA398 in which 6, 11, and 18 mutations, respectively, increased the Tm by 3.4, 7.4 and 10.4 °C (Table 2). The contribution of single-site variants to the thermal stability of the corresponding multi-site combinations was not simply additive. That is, the ΔTm of combinatorial variants was consistently lower than the direct sum of ΔTm values for the contributing single-site variants. For instance, one of our best intermediate variants (supplemental Fig. S1), FCA367, with 11 mutations, had a measured ΔTm of +7.4 °C, whereas the summative ΔTm of the individual 11 mutations would be +11.4 °C if thermal stability gains were purely additive. To rule out the possibility that some mutations may counteract thermal stability when combined with each other, all 11 sites of FCA367 were recombined using QuikChange, generating a library of Cel7A mutants with different combinations of these sites. Around 2000 clones, with an average of 8 mutations/clone (990 possibilities), were screened for retention of activity at high temperature. The most thermally stable clone contained all 11 sites, suggesting that all of the point mutations of FCA367 contribute to increased thermal stability. FCA367 was further improved by the addition or substitution of stability-associated mutations using fusion PCR techniques to generate site-specific combination mutants with enhanced thermal stability. The most improved variant was FCA398, which exhibits a Tm value of 72.9 °C (i.e. 10.4 °C higher than wild-type Cel7A) (Table 2). Residual activity measurements were further used to determine inactivation t½ for the site-combined variants FCA353, FCA367, and FCA398 compared with wild-type FCA301. The activity of the purified enzymes on 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-lactoside (MUL) was measured at 50 °C, before and after incubation at elevated temperatures, 62, 66, and 69 °C. Samples were taken at regular time points up to 20 h for activity measurements on MUL. This experimental design measured irreversible thermal inactivation. The half-life is defined as the time taken for a decrease of activity to 50% of the initial activity. The results show that the Cel7A variants were more stable than wild type, in agreement with measured Tm values. Even a seemingly small increase in Tm substantially improves the lifetime of the enzyme at high temperature (in the case of FCA353), and for FCA398, the most stable variant, we see large improvements (Table 2); the half-life is 44-, 34-, and 9-fold enhanced compared with wild type at 62, 66, and 69 °C, respectively. Wild-type FCA301 and the most stable Cel7A variant, FCA398, were incubated at 53, 65, and 75 °C with 1% PASC as substrate, and the cellulose degradation was monitored over the course of 3 days (72 h) by quantification of released soluble sugar by HPLC (Fig. 1). FCA398 is clearly more active and gave higher sugar yields at all three temperatures than did FCA301 at any temperature. For FCA301, the activity was highest at 53 °C and slightly lower at 65 °C, whereas the enzyme was practically inactive at 75 °C. FCA398 retained relatively high activity even at 75 °C, leveling off after ∼48 h, and its highest activity was observed at 65 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2750786467,"The inhibition of host innate immunity pathways is essential for the persistence of attaching and effacing pathogens such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Citrobacter rodentium during mammalian infections. To subvert these pathways and suppress the antimicrobial response, attaching and effacing pathogens use type III secretion systems to introduce effectors targeting key signaling pathways in host cells. One such effector is the arginine glycosyltransferase NleB1 (NleBCR in C. rodentium) that modifies conserved arginine residues in death domain-containing host proteins with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), thereby blocking extrinsic apoptosis signaling. Ectopically expressed NleB1 modifies the host proteins Fas-associated via death domain (FADD), TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain (TRADD), and receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). However, the full repertoire of arginine GlcNAcylation induced by pathogen-delivered NleB1 is unknown. Using an affinity proteomic approach for measuring arginine-GlcNAcylated glycopeptides, we assessed the global profile of arginine GlcNAcylation during ectopic expression of NleB1, EPEC infection in vitro, or C. rodentium infection in vivo. NleB overexpression resulted in arginine GlcNAcylation of multiple host proteins. However, NleB delivery during EPEC and C. rodentium infection caused rapid and preferential modification of Arg117 in FADD. This FADD modification was extremely stable and insensitive to physiological temperatures, glycosidases, or host cell degradation. Despite its stability and effect on the inhibition of apoptosis, arginine GlcNAcylation did not elicit any proteomic changes, even in response to prolonged NleB1 expression. We conclude that, at normal levels of expression during bacterial infection, NleB1/NleBCR antagonizes death receptor-induced apoptosis of infected cells by modifying FADD in an irreversible manner."

In the reduced state, the NiFe catalytic center in SH has the same ligand coordination as in other [NiFe]-hydrogenases.

Previous studies identified myomaker (Tmem8c) as a muscle-specific membrane protein essential for fusion. However, the specific function of myomaker and how its function is regulated are unknown. To explore these questions, we first examined the cellular localization of endogenous myomaker. Two independent antibodies showed that whereas myomaker does localize to the plasma membrane in cultured myoblasts, the protein also resides in the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles. These results raised questions regarding the precise cellular location of myomaker function and mechanisms that govern myomaker trafficking between these cellular compartments. Using a synchronized fusion assay, we demonstrated that myomaker functions at the plasma membrane to drive fusion. Trafficking of myomaker is regulated by palmitoylation of C-terminal cysteine residues that allows Golgi localization. Moreover, dissection of the C terminus revealed that palmitoylation was not sufficient for complete fusogenic activity suggesting a function for other amino acids within this C-terminal region. Indeed, C-terminal mutagenesis analysis highlighted the importance of a C-terminal leucine for function.

https://openalex.org/W2750765370,"Preservation of insulin-secreting β-cells is an important goal for therapies aimed at restoring normoglycemia in patients with diabetes. One approach, the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), has been reported to suppress pancreatic islet inflammation and β-cell apoptosis in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate the efficacy of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) in vivo. We show that daily administration of BRD3308, an isoform-selective HDAC3 inhibitor, for 2 weeks to female nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, beginning at 3 weeks of age, followed by twice-weekly injections until age 25 weeks, protects the animals from diabetes. The preservation of β-cells was because of a significant decrease in islet infiltration of mononuclear cells. Moreover, the BRD3308 treatment increased basal insulin secretion from islets cultured in vitro. All metabolic tissues tested in vehicle- or BRD3308-treated groups showed virtually no sign of immune cell infiltration, except minimal infiltration in white adipose tissue in animals treated with the highest BRD3308 dose (10 mg/kg), providing additional evidence of protection from immune attack in the treated groups. Furthermore, pancreata from animals treated with 10 mg/kg BRD3308 exhibited significantly decreased numbers of apoptotic β-cells compared with those treated with vehicle or low-dose BRD3308. Finally, animals treated with 1 or 10 mg/kg BRD3308 had enhanced β-cell proliferation. These in vivo results point to the potential use of selective HDAC3 inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to suppress pancreatic islet infiltration and prevent β-cell death with the long-term goal of limiting the progression of type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2752679580,"Objectives This study sought to investigate the genome-wide transcriptional effects of a combination of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARD; methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) in synovial tissues obtained from early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. While combination DMARD strategies have been investigated for clinical efficacy, very little data exists on the potential molecular mechanism of action. We hypothesized that tDMARD would impact multiple biological pathways, but the specific pathways were unknown. Methods Paired synovial biopsy samples from early RA patients before and after 6 months of tDMARD therapy were collected by arthroscopy (n = 19). These biopsies as well as those from subjects with normal synovium (n = 28) were profiled by total RNA sequencing. Results Large differences in gene expression between RA and control biopsies (over 5000 genes) were identified. Despite clinical efficacy, the expression of a restricted set of less than 300 genes was reversed after 6 months of treatment. Many genes remained elevated, even in patients who achieved low disease activity. Interestingly, tDMARD downregulated genes included those involved in T cell activation and signaling and plasmablast/plasma cell differentiation and function. Conclusions We have identified transcriptomic signatures that characterize synovial tissue from RA patients with early disease. Analysis after 6 months of tDMARD treatment highlight consistent alterations in expression of genes related to T cell activation and plasmablast/plasma cell differentiation. These results provide novel insight into the biology of early RA and the mechanism of tDMARD action and may help identify novel drug targets to improve rates of treatment-induced disease remission."

A molecular ensemble comprising more than 20 molecules is involved in collagen biosynthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two proteins, heat shock protein 47 (Hsp47/SERPINH1) and 65-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP65/FKBP10), have been shown to play important roles in this ensemble. In humans, autosomal recessive mutations in both genes cause similar osteogenesis imperfecta phenotypes. Whereas it has been proposed that Hsp47 and FKBP65 interact in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, there is neither clear evidence for this interaction nor any data regarding their binding affinities for each other. In this study using purified endogenous proteins, we examined the interaction between Hsp47, FKBP65, and collagen and also determined their binding affinities and functions in vitro. Hsp47 and FKBP65 show a direct but weak interaction, and FKBP65 prefers to interact with Hsp47 rather than type I collagen. Our results suggest that a weak interaction between Hsp47 and FKBP65 confers mutual molecular stability and also allows for a synergistic effect during collagen folding. We also propose that Hsp47 likely acts as a hub molecule during collagen folding and secretion by directing other molecules to reach their target sites on collagens.

In this study using purified endogenous proteins, we examined the interaction between Hsp47, FKBP65, and collagen and also determined their binding affinities and functions in vitro. Hsp47 and FKBP65 show a direct but weak interaction, and FKBP65 prefers to interact with Hsp47 rather than type I collagen. Our results suggest that a weak interaction between Hsp47 and FKBP65 confers mutual molecular stability and also allows for a synergistic effect during collagen folding. We also propose that Hsp47 likely acts as a hub molecule during collagen folding and secretion by directing other molecules to reach their target sites on collagens. Our findings may explain why osteogenesis imperfecta-causing mutations in both genes result in similar phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2753568024,"Bone atrophy and its related fragility fractures are frequent, late side effects of radiotherapy in cancer survivors and have a detrimental impact on their quality of life. In another study, we showed that parathyroid hormone 1-34 and anti-sclerostin antibody attenuates radiation-induced bone damage by accelerating DNA repair in osteoblasts. DNA damage responses are partially regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In the current study, we examined whether proteasome inhibitors have similar bone-protective effects against radiation damage. MG132 treatment greatly reduced radiation-induced apoptosis in cultured osteoblastic cells. This survival effect was owing to accelerated DNA repair as revealed by γH2AX foci and comet assays and to the up-regulation of Ku70 and DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit, essential DNA repair proteins in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Administration of bortezomib (Bzb) reversed the loss of trabecular bone structure and strength in mice at 4 wk after focal radiation. Histomorphometry revealed that Bzb significantly increased the number of osteoblasts and activity in the irradiated area and suppressed the number and activity of osteoclasts, regardless of irradiation. Two weeks of Bzb treatment accelerated DNA repair in bone-lining osteoblasts and thus promoted their survival. Meanwhile, it also inhibited bone marrow adiposity. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel role of proteasome inhibitors in treating radiation-induced osteoporosis.-Chandra, A., Wang, L., Young, T., Zhong, L., Tseng, W.-J., Levine, M.

An association may exist between endothelial dysfunction and several clinical manifestations of SCA. The present study aims to evaluate the links between changes in endothelial function and clinical and laboratory parameters in children and adolescents with SCA.This study included 40 children and adolescents with stable SCA as well as 25 healthy children; aged 6-18 years. All study subjects were evaluated for endothelial function using Doppler ultrasonography. In addition, a number of laboratory assays were performed, including reticulocyte and leukocyte counts as well as measurement of circulating levels of total bilirubin, C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, lipoproteins and peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation. These parameters were also compared between SCA patients who were undertaking hydroxyurea (HU) and those who were not.Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) values were found to be reduced in SCA patients compared with those detected in healthy controls. SCA individuals with lower FMD values exhibited higher number of hospital admissions due to vaso-occlusive events. Additional analyses revealed that patients who had decreased FMD values exhibited higher odds of acute chest syndrome (ACS) episodes. A preliminary analysis with limited number of individuals failed to demonstrate significant differences in FMD values between SCA individuals who were treated with HU and those who were not.Children and adolescents with SCA exhibit impaired endothelial function. Reductions in FMD values are associated with ACS. These findings underline the potential use of FMD as screening strategy of SCA patients with severe prognosis at early stages."

Venue-to-venue comparisons, as well as comparisons between Boston and other WMM races, with and without factors of temperature, humidity and altitude change were examined.Performance from 2005 to 2014 in the WMM races was found to improve at a rate of ~1% each 7 years. Despite its higher variability, comparison between Boston's estimated mean finishing time and all other venues revealed moderate positive differences, indicating the Boston event to be typically slower than other venues.Across the 10-year study period, performance times improved ~1% each 7 years for both genders for the WMM, with the Boston Marathon being slower on average than other WMM venues. Weather rather than course metrics appeared to impact performance times most."
https://openalex.org/W2752656201,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group A (XPA) is an essential scaffolding protein in the multiprotein nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. The interaction of XPA with DNA is a core function of this protein; a number of mutations in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) are associated with XP disease. Although structures of the central globular domain of human XPA and data on binding of DNA substrates have been reported, the structural basis for XPA's DNA-binding activity remains unknown. X-ray crystal structures of the central globular domain of yeast XPA (Rad14) with lesion-containing DNA duplexes have provided valuable insights, but the DNA substrates used for this study do not correspond to the substrates of XPA as it functions within the NER machinery. To better understand the DNA-binding activity of human XPA in NER, we used NMR to investigate the interaction of its DBD with a range of DNA substrates. We found that XPA binds different single-stranded/double-stranded junction DNA substrates with a common surface. Comparisons of our NMR-based mapping of binding residues with the previously reported Rad14-DNA crystal structures revealed similarities and differences in substrate binding between XPA and Rad14. This includes direct evidence for DNA contacts to the residues extending C-terminally from the globular core, which are lacking in the Rad14 construct. Moreover, mutation of the XPA residue corresponding to Phe-262 in Rad14, previously reported as being critical for DNA binding, had only a moderate effect on the DNA-binding activity of XPA. The DNA-binding properties of several disease-associated mutations in the DBD were investigated. These results suggest that for XPA mutants exhibiting altered DNA-binding properties, a correlation exists between the extent of reduction in DNA-binding affinity and the severity of symptoms in XP patients.

However, we and others have shown that the globular core of human XPA (XPA98–219) does not bind NER model DNA substrates with appreciable affinity and that additional C-terminal residues are required for full binding affinity (39Sugitani N.

Consequently, the high binding affinity for the two lesion-containing duplexes of the Rad14 globular core that lacks additional C-terminal residues is confounding and suggests that in the two studies, the Rad14 and XPA DBDs are not functioning in an equivalent manner biochemically and structurally.

Using the XPA98–239 construct (XPA DBD) that we previously reported to exhibit full DNA-binding affinity (39Sugitani N. Shell S.M. Soss S.E. Chazin W.J. Redefining the DNA-binding domain of human XPA.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 10830-10833Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we report here an investigation of the interaction of human XPA with model NER bubble substrates. We used NMR and DNA affinity measurements to define the binding site of XPA DBD for model NER substrates and compared our findings to the structures of Rad14-DNA complexes (36Koch S.C. Kuper J.

U.S.A. 2015; 112: 8272-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To confirm our findings, we determined the effect on DNA binding of selected structure-based and disease-associated mutants. Our results show human XPA and yeast Rad14 use similar DNA-binding surfaces, but XPA interactions in the context of NER are different from those observed for Rad14 interactions with high affinity lesion-containing duplexes (36Koch S.C.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 8272-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This study also provides insight into the molecular basis for the disease association of certain XPA mutations. It had been established previously that XPA binds to a ss-dsDNA junction in the NER bubble (51Yang Z. Roginskaya M. Colis L.C. Basu A.K. Shell S.M. Liu Y. Musich P.R. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Zou Y. Specific and efficient binding of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A to double-strand/single-strand DNA junctions with 3′- and/or 5′-ssDNA branches.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15921-15930Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although controversy remains over whether it is the 5′ or 3′ junction. Moreover, the footprint of XPA on the junction remains unclear. To address these issues, we measured the affinities of the XPA DBD for different junction structures and lengths. We have previously used a DNA fluorescence anisotropy assay to characterize affinities, but turned instead here to microscale thermophoresis (MST) to avoid the tendency of XPA-DNA complexes to aggregate in the 384-well plates during the course of fluorescence anisotropy experiments. Comparisons of the values obtained by the two methods revealed the same trends among substrates but higher dissociation constants (Kd) for MST by ∼5-fold. The systematically weaker binding in the MST experiments is attributable to the higher ionic strength of the buffer. We first confirmed that XPA Y binds to a previously characterized 8/12 splayed-arm substrate (Fig. 1, diagram 1, Y-shaped junction substrate with an 8-bp duplex and 12-nucleotide (nt) 5′ and 3′ overhangs) with high affinity (39Sugitani N. Shell S.M. Soss S.E. Chazin W.J. Redefining the DNA-binding domain of human XPA.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 10830-10833Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In NER incision complexes, RPA coats the undamaged ssDNA opposite the damage-containing strand, so Y-shaped junctions with overhangs on both sides are not likely to represent the relevant substrate in a NER complex. Therefore, we next sought to find a junction DNA substrate that is optimized in length and shape so that it interacts with XPA in a manner that avoids nonspecific secondary binding to the substrate. To systematically screen the types of junction and the length of overhangs, a series of DNA substrates were designed containing a GC-rich duplex (sealed with a 4-nt hairpin (HP) for stability) and oligo(dT) overhangs (Fig. 1, diagrams 2–9). We found a modest but clearly significant difference in affinity for different nucleotide sequences (supplemental Fig. S1), as has been observed for other sequence nonspecific DNA-binding proteins such as RPA (52Mou T.C. Shen M. Abdalla S. Delamora D. Bochkareva E. Bochkarev A. Gray D.M. Effects of ssDNA sequence on non-sequence-specific protein binding.Chirality. 2006; 18: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The data show that XPA DBD binds both 3′ and 5′ overhang substrates with approximately the same affinity as Y-shaped substrates (Fig. 2A and Table 1). It is interesting that the length of the overhang could be shortened to 4 nt without any significant effect on the affinity for substrate (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The shorter overhang was advantageous for NMR studies, so we selected an 8/4 5′ overhang substrate for detailed analysis.Table 1The affinity of XPA DBD for ss-ds junction DNA substratesSubstrateKdμm8/12 HP splayed arm (3)3.0 ± 0.18/12 HP 5′ overhang (5)5.2 ± 0.28/12 HP 3′ overhang (4)8.2 ± 0.58/10 HP 5′ overhang (6)5.9 ± 0.28/8 HP 5′ overhang (7)4.6 ± 0.18/6 HP 5′ overhang (8)4.2 ± 0.28/4 HP 5′ overhang (9)3.5 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab The binding of DNA substrates by XPA DBD (XPA98–239) was investigated using NMR spectroscopy. The first step in any detailed NMR analysis is the assignment of the signals (resonances) to specific atoms within the molecule. The NMR backbone resonance assignments for XPA DBD were obtained using a standard series of double and triple resonance 2D and 3D experiments (53Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C.

Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). This analysis produced assignments for 98, 98, 94, 98, and 97% of the 15N, 1H, 13CO, 13Cα, and 13Cβ resonances, respectively (supplemental Table S1). Fig. 3 shows the 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectrum labeled with the corresponding backbone resonance assignments used for the titration analyses of the binding of DNA substrates. Because of the extensive overlap and some highly dynamic peak intensities in the spectrum, assignment of the stretch of residues between Gln-208 to Arg-228 was challenging. In this region, there are groups of residues whose connectivity is unambiguously established, however, there are breaks in between that create uncertainty in exactly how they fit to the sequence. The final assignments were made to maximize internal consistency, in conjunction with the NMR titrations, and the mutational analysis described below. The results from NMR titrations of 15N-enriched XPA DBD with different DNA substrates were used to map the interaction surface of XPA DBD (supplemental Fig. S2). Overall, the trends in chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were the same for the different substrates. Major perturbations were found in the globular core between residues 130 and 210 and in residues extending C-terminally from the core between residues 215 and 232 (supplemental Fig. S2). The N-terminal region of the globular core containing a zinc finger remained mostly unaffected. Although th"

Although the N-terminal SH3 domain is important for p130Cas localization, it has also been reported that the C-terminal region is involved in p130Cas FA targeting. The C-terminal region of p130Cas or Cas family homology domain (CCHD) has been reported to adopt a structure similar to that of the focal adhesion kinase C-terminal focal adhesion-targeting domain. The mechanism by which the CCHD promotes FA targeting of p130Cas, however, remains unclear. In this study, using a calorimetry approach, we identified the first LD motif (LD1) of the FA-associated protein paxillin as the binding partner of the p130Cas CCHD (in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a Kd ∼4.2 μm) and elucidated the structure of the p130Cas CCHD in complex with the paxillin LD1 motif by X-ray crystallography. Of note, a comparison of the CCHD/LD1 complex with a previously solved structure of CCHD in complex with the SH2-containing protein NSP3 revealed that LD1 had almost identical positioning of key hydrophobic and acidic residues relative to NSP3. Because paxillin is one of the key scaffold molecules in FAs, we propose that the interaction between the p130Cas CCHD and the LD1 motif of paxillin plays an important role in p130Cas FA targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2751544109,"Transfection is one of the most frequently used techniques in molecular biology that is also applicable for gene therapy studies in humans. One of the biggest challenges to investigate the protein function and interaction in gene therapy studies is to have reliable monospecific detection reagents, particularly antibodies, for all human gene products. Thus, a reliable method that can optimize transfection efficiency based on not only expression of the target protein of interest but also the uptake of the nucleic acid plasmid, can be an important tool in molecular biology. Here, we present a simple, rapid and robust flow cytometric method that can be used as a tool to optimize transfection efficiency at the single cell level while overcoming limitations of prior established methods that quantify transfection efficiency. By using optimized ratios of transfection reagent and a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) vector directly labeled with a fluorochrome, this method can be used as a tool to simultaneously quantify cellular toxicity of different transfection reagents, the amount of nucleic acid plasmid that cells have taken up during transfection as well as the amount of the encoded expressed protein. Finally, we demonstrate that this method is reproducible, can be standardized and can reliably and rapidly quantify transfection efficiency, reducing assay costs and increasing throughput while increasing data robustness."

The present experiment was designed to explore what brain regions and brain activity are associated with these components of strategic monitoring in time-based PM tasks.24 participants were asked to reset a clock every four minutes, while performing a foreground ongoing word categorisation task. EEG activity was recorded and data were decomposed into source-resolved activity using Independent Component Analysis. Common brain regions across participants, associated with retrieval mode and target checking, were found using Measure Projection Analysis.Participants decreased their performance on the ongoing task when concurrently performed with the time-based PM task, reflecting an active retrieval mode that relied on withdrawal of limited resources from the ongoing task. Brain activity, with its source in or near the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), showed changes associated with an active retrieval mode including greater negative ERP deflections, decreased theta synchronization, and increased alpha suppression for events locked to the ongoing task while maintaining a time-based intention. Activity in the ACC was also associated with time-checks and found consistently across participants; however, we did not find an association with time perception processing per se.The involvement of the ACC in both aspects of time-based PM monitoring may be related to different functions that have been attributed to it: strategic control of attention during the retrieval mode (distributing attentional resources between the ongoing task and the time-based task) and anticipatory/decision making processing associated with clock-checks."

The growth and development of plants are regulated by a variety of hormones and environmental factors, as detected by specific receptors, including membrane hybrid histidine kinases (HKs). 4The abbreviations used are: HKhistidine kinaseRDreceiver domainRRresponse regulatorMSPmultistep phosphorelayAHPArabidopsis histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteinCPMGCarr-Purcell-Meiboom-GillPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceAICAkaike's Information Criterion. Following ligand recognition by the input domain, a histidine residue in the cytosolic HK domain of the hybrid HK receptor is autophosphorylated. The phosphate group is subsequently transferred to the conserved aspartate of the receiver domain (RD), which initiates the downstream (trans)phosphorylation cascade. The phosphorelay is triggered by the RD-mediated phosphorylation of small soluble histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins that transfer the phosphates to the nucleus. Here, the transphosphorylation of the aspartate-containing response regulators (RRs), the final phosphate acceptors, takes place, regulating different cellular events, in most cases the transcription of target genes (1Schaller G.E.

This pathway, known as multistep phosphorelay (MSP), is unique to plants, lower eukaryotes, and bacteria. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, eight canonical hybrid HK sensors involved in MSP (AHK1/AtHK1, AHK2, AHK3, AHK4/CRE1, AHK5/CKI2, ETR1, ERS1, and CKI1), five histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1–AHP5), and 23 RRs were identified. The plant MSP seems to have developed from its bacterial ancestor, two-component signaling.

CKI1RD is structurally similar to RDs of bacterial RRs and studied thoroughly by analyzing crystal and solution structures, NMR relaxation, and computer simulations. However, the knowledge of the bacterial systems cannot be readily extrapolated to the signaling mediated by CKI1RD. RDs of plant hybrid HKs and of bacterial RRs fulfill very different physiological functions in different molecular contexts. CKI1RD is a C-terminal domain of a large transmembrane protein, but bacterial RDs are N-terminal portions of RRs or separate domains. RDs of RRs involved in the highly specific bacterial two-component systems do not transfer phosphate to downstream acceptors, but directly activate their effector domains, interact with separate effector proteins, or dimerize (oligomerize) using the α4–β5–α5 face, distant from the phosphorylation site. In contrast, CKI1RD (and other RDs of hybrid HKs involved in MSP) transfers phosphate from the donating CKI1HK domain to several accepting AHP proteins, using the binding interface surrounding the phosphorylated aspartate. Interactions involving the α4–β5–α5 face have not been reported for CKI1RD. Therefore, we decided to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the CKI1RD-mediated phosphorelay experimentally by comparing all three relevant forms of this protein: free CKI1RD; its complex with Mg2+; and a stable analogue of the phosphorylated form, a beryllofluoride complex. We solved crystal structures of two CKI1RD active-site mutants and of the beryllofluoridated CKI1RD wild type, monitored conformational behavior of the individual CKI1RD forms using NMR spectroscopy, and showed functional relevance of the observed changes of the conformational ensembles in vivo and in vitro. To mimic the formation of the active state of CKI1RD, a beryllofluoride (BeF3−) moiety was used as a phosphate group analogue. It has been reported previously that this analogue can mimic the phosphorylation-induced structural changes of bacterial RDs (3Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M.

Open table in a new tab The beryllofluoridated CKI1RD structure revealed an octahedral coordination sphere of Mg2+ that is formed by the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Gln-1052, the side-chain carboxyl oxygens of Asp-1050 and Asp-993, a fluorine atom of BeF3−, and the oxygens of two water molecules (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Table S1). Asp-992, involved in the water-mediated coordination of the Mg2+ ion in the Mg2+-bound form (PDB code 3MMN), is involved in the coordination in the beryllofluoridated CKI1RD form as well (polar contact between Oδ1 and OH2O at a distance of 2.6 Å). Small differences in the distances for Mg2+ coordination indicate a slight deformation of the octahedral arrangement. Furthermore, the side chain of Lys-1105 is involved in the formation of a salt bridge with a fluorine atom of BeF3− (distance N–F3, 2.39 Å), which is additionally stabilized by polar contact with Asp-992 (distance N–Oδ2, 2.9 Å; Fig. 1B). The 2FoFc and the lack of FoFc density maps confirmed the presence of Mg2+ and BeF3− complex non-covalently bound to the active site Asp-1050 (distance Oδ1-Be, 1.76 Å; Fig. 1C).

Conformation of the Lys-1105 side chain depends on the formation of a polar contact with either Asp-1050 (in metal-free or Mg2+-bound CKI1RD) or a fluorine atom of beryllofluoride (Fig. 3). This suggests that the reorientation of the carboxylic group of Asp-1050 in the Mg2+-bound form induces the reorientation of Lys-1105 needed for an effective stabilization of the RD phosphorylation.Figure 3A, active site (stick representation) of CKI1RD wild-type in the metal-free (blue), Mg2+-bound (red), and beryllofluoridated (green) forms.

The obtained spectra (supplemental Fig. S1) allowed us to analyze relaxation of 74, 78, and 69 residues of the free, Mg2+-bound, and beryllofluoridated forms of CKI1RD (consisting of 127 non-proline amino acids), respectively (supplemental Table S2 and supplemental Fig. S2; see under “Experimental procedures” for details). The obtained parameters describing the fast internal motions (order parameters S2 and SS2 and correlation times τe and τs) were very similar for all three forms of CKI1RD (Fig. 4). The flexible residues Met-944–Gly-985 form a linker that connects the receiver domain to CKI1 and is expected to be disordered in the native protein. The receiver domain itself (residues Lys-986–Glu-1116) exhibited dynamics typical for well-structured proteins, with the higher flexibility in loops resulting in somewhat lower order parameters. In the most flexible α2–β3 loop, the model-free analysis preferred two modes of the internal motion with well-defined correlation time of the slow motion close to 1 ns. The binding of Mg2+ cations did not significantly change the fast dynamics, and only a small S2 increase in loops close to the phosphorylation site was observed after beryllofluoridation, indicating that the presence of BeF3− makes the structure slightly more compact. The most significant differences between the CKI1RD samples were observed on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. These slower events are considered biologically more important (14Volkman B.F.

However, the broadening of peaks of residues in the β3–α3 loop provides strong evidence of an extensive conformational exchange in this region (supplemental Fig. S3). The binding of Mg2+ was shown to have a dramatic effect on the slow dynamics of the β3–α3 loop (Fig. 5, B–D). The peaks of the β3–α3 loop residues of Mg2+-bound CKI1RD were observable in the 15N-relaxation spectra, indicating the reduction of the conformational exchange of the loop. The model-free analysis showed that the β3–α3 loop is the only region of Mg2+-bound CKI1RD with significant slow dynamics (Rex between 15 and 20 s−1 at 600 MHz). Peak heights of Met-1053, Met-1056, and Asp-1057 were fitted to a two-state exchange model using the Relax program. The Met-1053 data showed, with a good precision, that the exchange rate was 6000 s−1 and the minor state population was 2% (Table 2). The rate of formation of the minor state kA→B calculated from these values is ∼120 s−1, comparable with rate constants of phosphotransfer to receiver domains of the yeast osmoregulatory system; phosphate is transferred from histidine transfer protein YPD1 to the receiver domains of hybrid histidine kinase SLN1 and of response regulator SSK1 with rate constants of 230 and 160 s−1, respectively (20Janiak-Spens F. Cook P.F. West A.H. Kinetic analysis of YPD1-dependent phosphotransfer reactions in the yeast osmoregulatory phosphorelay system.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The value of kA→B cannot be currently correlated with the rate of phosphorylation of CKI1RD by CKI1HK because the kinetics of this signaling step are not known. The fits for Met-1056 and Met-1057 peaks were less precise, but showed the same time scale of the exchange (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S5). It should be noted that the calculated exchange rates are relatively high, which makes the separation of the exchange parameters difficult. Additionally, the actual slow dynamics of the β3–α3 loop may be more complex than described by the two-state models. Data obtained at 1 mm MgCl2 concentration (data not shown) reveal that the chemical exchange (dissociation and association of Mg2+) does not contribute significantly to the relaxation dispersion obtained at 30 mm MgCl2 concentration.Table 2The fit of CPMG relaxation dispersion data of CKI1RD to a two-state modelSampleResiduekex/s−1pAΔω/ppmWild-type, Mg2+-boundMet-10536,100 ± 1,1000.98 ± 0.018.0 ± 1.1Wild-type, Mg2+-boundMet-105610,100 ± 3,1000.96 ± 0.136.4 ± 3.3Wild-type, Mg2+-boundAsp-10576,800 ± 4,1000.99 ± 0.078.6 ± 3.9D1050AMet-10537,300 ± 1,4000.988 ± 0.00211.1 ± 1.5D1050EMet-10536,600 ± 1,1000.990 ± 0.0049.0 ± 1.3 Open table in a new tab The exchange contribution in the β3–α3 loop disappeared after beryllofluoridation, suggesting that the loop conformation was constrained (Fig. 5, C and D). However, several residues in the C-terminal region showed an increase in Rex (Fig. 5A). The most affected residue was shown to be Lys-1105 (Rex = 16 s−1 at 600 MHz), whose side chain directly coordinates BeF3− in the X-ray structure (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the Lys-1105 peak was too low to analyze the relaxation dispersion curves quantitatively (supplemental Figs. S4–S6). An increased exchange contribution at a beryllofluoride concentration equal to its dissociation constant (5 mm, data not shown) indicated that the other residues are influenced by a chemical exchange because beryllofluoridated CKI1RD cannot be studied at complete saturation due to the high dissociation constant of the phosphate analogue. The discussed results of the NMR relaxation and relaxation dispersion analyses do not correlate with the crystallographic B factors (supplemental Fig. S7), indicating that the crystal structures do not reflect the dynamics of CKI1RD in solution. In summary, both Mg2+ and BeF3− greatly affect slow the conformational dynamics of the β3–α3 loop in solution, but they do not influence the backbone conformation in the crystal structures. To further probe dynamics of the β3–α3 loop and its dependence on the phosphorylation state of CKI1RD, we perturbed the loop by mutating the phosphoaccepting Asp-1050 to non-phosphorylatable alanine and phosphorylation-mimicking glutamic acid. The effects of the mutation were local, and the number of assigned peaks in NMR spectra was similar to the wild-type samples. Selective methionine labeling confirmed that the mutations of Asp-1050 affected only the methionines of the loop. CPMG experiments showed that conformational exchange of Met-1053 was eliminated, and the exchange of Met-1056 was reduced to the extent observed in Mg2+-bound wild-type CKI1RD (Fig. 5, C and D). Another mutation probing conformational behavior of the β3–α3 loop was based on a comparison with the RD of the ethylene receptor ETR1 (ETR1RD). ETR1RD is structurally similar to CKI1RD, except for the β3–α3 loop. The loop adopts different orientations in the crystal structure (21Müller-Dieckmann H.J. Grantz A.A. Kim S.H. The structure of the signal receiver domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene receptor ETR1.Structure. 1999; 7: 1547-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) from those observed in the CKI1RD X-ray structures. Furthermore, no severe NMR line-broadening was reported, suggesting its lower conformational flexibility in comparison with RDs of bacterial HKs (22Hung Y.L. Jiang I. Lee Y.Z. Wen C.K. Sue S.C. NMR study reveals the receiver domain of Arabidopsis ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 ethylene receptor as an atypical type response regulator.PLOS ONE. 2016; 11: e0160598Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We confirmed the published results by acquiring CPMG data for ETR1RD at 950 MHz. In our experiment, none of the signals exhibited conformational exchange comparable with CKI1RD. Among the well-resolved peaks of Gly-664, Val-665, Glu-666, Asn-667, and Gln-669 of the β3–α3 loop, the highest exchange contribution at 950 MHz did not exceed values corresponding to 5 s−1 at 600 MHz (supplemental Fig. S8). Comparison of the β3–α3 loop sequences reveals that the β3–α3 loop of ETR1 (VCMPGVEN) differs from the consensus sequence XXMPXΦDG, where X is a variable amino acid and Φ represents a bulky hydrophobic residue (supplemental Table S3). A highly conserved pair DG at the C terminus of the loop is replaced by EN in ETR1RD. Substitution of the conformationally least restricted amino acid, glycine, by asparagine, is expected to influence conformational dynamics of the β3–α3 loop significantly. We mutated the corresponding residues in CKI1RD to mimic the ETR1 sequence. NMR spectra showed that the mutation of Asp-1057 and Gly-1058 perturbed the conformation in the region surrounding the β3–α3 loop, including the α2 and α3 helices, the β3 strand, and the β2–α2 loop (cf. Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S9A). Met-1049 (preceding the active site) and Met-1099 in the α4–β5 loop were affected in spectra of the selective methionine-labeled double mutant, in addition to the methionines in the β3–α3 loop (data not shown). Weak peak intensities in spectra of the uniformly labeled sample did not allow us to assign residues most affected by the mutation, whereas more distant regions were assigned reliably. Signs of two conformers in a slow exchange were also observed, most obviously in the methionine methyl region of 1H-13C HSQC spectra but also for some well-resolved peaks in the 1H-15N spectra (supplemental Fig. S9, B–E). Changes in NMR spectra observed during titration by MgCl2 and NaF/BeCl2 indicate that the Asp-1057 and Gly-1058 mutant is able to bind Mg2+ (Kd = 6 mm) but not BeF3−. Altogether, mutations of phosphoaccepting Asp-1050 influence conformational exchange of the β3–α3 loop with marginal effect on other regions of CKI1RD. Replacing Asp-1057 and Gly-1058 by the corresponding residues of ETR1 results in much more dramatic changes of the β3–α3 loop conformations, affecting regions surrounding the β3–α3 loop but not perturbing the overall fold of CKI1RD. Screening of crystallization conditions was performed for the point mutants D1050A and D1050E and for the double mutant D1057E/G1058N. The double mutant did not crystallize under the conditions tested, presumably due to the mentioned conformational heterogeneity, but well-diffracting crystals of the point mutants were obtained and X-ray structures solved (PDB code 5LNN, 5LNM; Table 1). A structural comparison of the mutants with the beryllofluoridated CKI1RD revealed that the backbone conformation remained intact. The overall r.m.s.d. (Cα) between beryllofluoridated CKI1RD wild type and D1050A and D1050E mutants were 0.237 and 0.190 Å, respectively. With the exception of the mutated residues, the mutant structures differed from the wild type in the orientation of the Phe-1102 side chain that was rotated by ∼80° and exposed as inactive RDs of bacterial RRs. Furthermore, we detected slight displacements of the backbone atoms of residues 1104–1106 of ∼2 Å and variations of some torsion angles between Lys-1105 and Phe-1102 (φ and ψ of Asp-1104 and ψ of Leu-103 changed by ∼25° and ψ of Phe-1102 changed by 15° by the mutations, Fig. 3, B–D). The ϵ amine of Lys-1105 directly interacts with the active site in the crystal structures. Orientations of the side chains of residues surrounding Phe-1102 in the crystal were not changed by the mutations. Presumably, minor perturbations introduced by mutating or coordinating Asp-1050 are propagated through the Lys-1105 side chain and backbone of residues Asp-1104 and Leu-1103 and alter the populations of the Phe-1102 rotamers in favor of the buried state in the mutants. To sum up, whereas wild-type CKI1RD exhibits the “active” side-chain orientation of Phe-1102, mutations in phosphoaccepting Asp-1050 change its orientation to the position found in most bacterial RRs in their inactive state. In contrast to RDs of bacterial RRs, no biological role has been assigned to the reorientation of Phe-1102 in CKI1RD. No significant changes in fast or slow dynamics we"

https://openalex.org/W2752570786,"Previous studies, mainly using a first-person perspective (1PP), have shown that the judgments of the hand laterality judgment (HLJ) task are dependent on biomechanical constraints (BC). Specifically, differing reaction times (RT) for hand pictures rotated medially or laterally around the mid sagittal plane are attributed to the BC effect on motor imagery. In contrast, we investigated whether the HLJ task is also subject to BC when performed from a third-person perspective (3PP) as well as 1PP using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure the brain activity of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in right-handed participants assigned to 1PP or 3PP groups. The 1PP group judged whether a presented hand was their own left or right hand, and the 3PP group whether it was the other's left or right hand. Using their HLJ task error rates, the 1PP and 3PP groups were subdivided into an Error Group (EG) and No Error Group (NEG). For the 1PP group, both EG and NEG showed a significant Hand Laterality × Orientation interaction for RT, indicating the BC effect on motor imagery. For the 3PP group, however, neither EG nor NEG showed the interaction, even though EG showed a significantly longer RT than NEG. These results suggest that the 3PP EG appropriately followed the 3PP task instruction, while the NEG might have taken 1PP. However, the 3PP EG NIRS profile of left PFC showed a significant Hand Laterality × Orientation interaction, while the 1PP EG did not. More noteworthy is that the left PFC activation of EG showed an interaction between the 1PP and 3PP groups when the left hand was presented. Furthermore, in the NEG, the PFC activation was not influenced by the BC in either the 1PP or 3PP condition. These results indicate that BC interferes with the HLJ task performed from the 1PP and 3PP."

https://openalex.org/W2753748324,"In the auditory pathway, the inferior colliculus (IC) receives and integrates excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the lower auditory nuclei, contralateral IC, and auditory cortex (AC), and then uploads these inputs to the thalamus and cortex. Meanwhile, the AC modulates the sound signal processing of IC neurons, including their latency (i.e., first-spike latency). Excitatory and inhibitory corticofugal projections to the IC may shorten and prolong the latency of IC neurons, respectively. However, the synaptic mechanisms underlying the corticofugal latency modulation of IC neurons remain unclear. Thus, this study probed these mechanisms via in vivo intracellular recording and acoustic and focal electric stimulation. The AC latency modulation of IC neurons is possibly mediated by pre-spike depolarization duration, pre-spike hyperpolarization duration, and spike onset time. This study suggests an effective strategy for the timing sequence determination of auditory information uploaded to the thalamus and cortex."

Our results support the presence of only one of these two species in the overlapping area, rejecting the existence of such an area of sympatry between the two species. We discuss alternative hypotheses that could explain the historically reported distribution pattern: 1) an error in the single existing historical record; 2) a possible local extinction of the species and 3) the past existence of interspecific competition that has since been resolved under the principle of competitive exclusion.
