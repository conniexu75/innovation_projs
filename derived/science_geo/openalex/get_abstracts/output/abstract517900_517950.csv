However, current methods cannot distinguish between inflation from a true polygenic signal and bias. We have developed an approach, LD Score regression, that quantifies the contribution of each by examining the relationship between test statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD). The LD Score regression intercept can be used to estimate a more powerful and accurate correction factor than genomic control. We find strong evidence that polygenicity accounts for the majority of the inflation in test statistics in many GWAS of large sample size."
https://openalex.org/W1966775465,"Linear mixed models are a powerful statistical tool for identifying genetic associations and avoiding confounding. However, existing methods are computationally intractable in large cohorts and may not optimize power. All existing methods require time cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an infinitesimal genetic architecture in which effect sizes are normally distributed, which can limit power. Here we present a far more efficient mixed-model association method, BOLT-LMM, which requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in 23,294 samples from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) and observed significant increases in power, consistent with simulations. Theory and simulations show that the boost in power increases with cohort size, making BOLT-LMM appealing for genome-wide association studies in large cohorts."

Each receptor type signals through a different adapter protein. These signals activate the protein kinase TBK1 and the transcription factor IRF3, which tells cells to secrete interferon proteins (IFNs) important for host defense. Liu et al. now report a common signaling mechanism used by all three types of innate immune receptor-adaptor protein pairs to activate IRF3 and generate IFNs.

https://openalex.org/W2085220756,"Functional micropeptides can be concealed within RNAs that appear to be noncoding. We discovered a conserved micropeptide, which we named myoregulin (MLN), encoded by a skeletal muscle-specific RNA annotated as a putative long noncoding RNA. MLN shares structural and functional similarity with phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), which inhibit SERCA, the membrane pump that controls muscle relaxation by regulating Ca(2+) uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). MLN interacts directly with SERCA and impedes Ca(2+) uptake into the SR. In contrast to PLN and SLN, which are expressed in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle in mice, MLN is robustly expressed in all skeletal muscle. Genetic deletion of MLN in mice enhances Ca(2+) handling in skeletal muscle and improves exercise performance. These findings identify MLN as an important regulator of skeletal muscle physiology and highlight the possibility that additional micropeptides are encoded in the many RNAs currently annotated as noncoding."

Yet, taxonomic characterization of the human microbiota is often limited to the species level or to previously sequenced strains, and accordingly, the prevalence of intra-species variation, its functional role, and its relation to host health remain unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive large-scale analysis of intra-species copy-number variation in the gut microbiome, introducing a rigorous computational pipeline for detecting such variation directly from shotgun metagenomic data. We uncover a large set of variable genes in numerous species and demonstrate that this variation has significant functional and clinically relevant implications. We additionally infer intra-species compositional profiles, identifying population structure shifts and the presence of yet uncharacterized variants. Our results highlight the complex relationship between microbiome composition and functional capacity, linking metagenome-level compositional shifts to strain-level variation."
https://openalex.org/W2029608563,"TRPA1 and TRPV1 are crucial pain mediators, but how their interaction contributes to persistent pain is unknown. Here, we identify Tmem100 as a potentiating modulator of TRPA1-V1 complexes. Tmem100 is coexpressed and forms a complex with TRPA1 and TRPV1 in DRG neurons. Tmem100-deficient mice show a reduction in inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia and TRPA1- but not TRPV1-mediated pain. Single-channel recording in a heterologous system reveals that Tmem100 selectively potentiates TRPA1 activity in a TRPV1-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Tmem100 weakens the association of TRPA1 and TRPV1, thereby releasing the inhibition of TRPA1 by TRPV1. A Tmem100 mutant, Tmem100-3Q, exerts the opposite effect; i.e., it enhances the association of TRPA1 and TRPV1 and strongly inhibits TRPA1. Strikingly, a cell-permeable peptide (CPP) containing the C-terminal sequence of Tmem100-3Q mimics its effect and inhibits persistent pain. Our study unveils a context-dependent modulation of the TRPA1-V1 complex, and Tmem100-3Q CPP is a promising pain therapy."

Although some B cells acquired only one fate, others differentiated into all three.

https://openalex.org/W2142450582,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cellular sensor that controls cytosolic DNA-activated innate immune signaling. We have previously demonstrated that STING-deficient mice are resistant to carcinogen-induced skin cancer, similar to myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) deficient mice, since the production of STING-dependent DNA-damage-induced proinflammatory cytokines, that likely require MyD88 signaling to exert their growth-promoting activity, are prevented. In contrast, MyD88-deficient mice are sensitive to colitis-associated cancer (CAC), since selected cytokines generated following DNA-damage also activate repair pathways, which can help prevent tumor development. Here, we demonstrate that STING signaling facilitates wound repair processes and that analogous to MyD88-deficient mice, STING-deficient mice (SKO) are prone to CAC induced by DNA-damaging agents. SKO mice harboring tumors exhibited low levels of tumor-suppressive interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) compared to normal mice, a cytokine considered critical for preventing colon-related cancer. Our data indicate that STING constitutes a critical component of the host early response to intestinal damage and is essential for invigorating tissue repair pathways that may help prevent tumorigenesis."

Here we show with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that these two behavioral functions of values are encoded in distinct regions of the human brain. In the medial prefrontal cortex, value-related activity is enhanced when subjective value becomes choice-relevant, and the magnitude of this increase relates directly to the outcome and reliability of the value-based choice. In contrast, activity in the posterior cingulate cortex represents values similarly when they are relevant or irrelevant for the present choice, and the strength of this representation predicts attentional capture by choice-irrelevant values. Our results suggest that distinct components of the brain’s valuation network encode value in context-dependent manners that serve fundamentally different behavioral aims.

Our results suggest that distinct components of the brain’s valuation network encode value in context-dependent manners that serve fundamentally different behavioral aims. Any decision based on personal preferences rests on the subjective value (SV) of the choice options, for example, when deciding which food to eat or whether to buy a product at a given price (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979Kahneman D.

Elucidating the neural mechanisms by which such SVs are represented is therefore paramount for understanding both healthy and maladaptive choice behavior (Bickel et al., 2007Bickel W.K. Miller M.L.

To address this issue, numerous laboratory studies have correlated SVs during value-based choices with brain activity and have identified a valuation system comprising several regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the ventral striatum (VS) (for recent meta-analyses see Bartra et al., 2013Bartra O.

Critically, these studies have typically examined value representations during choices in which the goal is to maximize the personal benefit of the agent and which are therefore taken based on the SVs (anticipated reward and costs) of the choice options. In these situations, participants naturally focus their attention on the choice-relevant SVs. However, there is growing evidence that SVs can also influence behavior when they are currently choice-irrelevant and therefore outside the focus of attention (Della Libera and Chelazzi, 2006Della Libera C. Chelazzi L. Visual selective attention and the effects of monetary rewards.Psychol. Sci. 2006; 17: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, Hickey et al., 2011Hickey C. Chelazzi L.

Reward grabs the eye: oculomotor capture by rewarding stimuli.Vision Res. 2012; 74: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). More specifically, the presence of a task-irrelevant item that was previously coupled with a reward can slow down performance of purely perceptual decisions performed on non-value-related stimulus dimensions (Anderson, 2013Anderson B.A. A value-driven mechanism of attentional selection.J. Vis. 2013; 13: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Awh et al., 2012Awh E. Belopolsky A.V. Theeuwes J. Top-down versus bottom-up attentional control: a failed theoretical dichotomy.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). This phenomenon—termed value-based attentional capture—is thought to reflect a brain mechanism that constantly monitors the environment for behaviorally relevant stimuli that may warrant a new course of action (Anderson, 2013Anderson B.A. A value-driven mechanism of attentional selection.J. Vis. 2013; 13: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Pearson et al., 2011Pearson J.M. Heilbronner S.R. Barack D.L. Hayden B.Y. Platt M.L.

This mechanism may allow the agent to notice valuable unattended alternative stimuli and enable behavioral engagement when this is beneficial. Very little is known about how task-irrelevant SVs are represented in the brain and how they may exert their influence on behavior. Only few studies have examined correlations of brain activity with choice-irrelevant SVs, but crucially, the relationship between these signals and the behavioral slowing of non-value-based choices has not yet been established. This is primarily due to the fact that automatic or task-irrelevant SV signals have been investigated with paradigms that involved no choice at all (Levy et al., 2011Levy I. Lazzaro S.C. Rutledge R.B. Glimcher P.W. Choice from non-choice: predicting consumer preferences from blood oxygenation level-dependent signals obtained during passive viewing.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), forced actions (Plassmann et al., 2007Plassmann H. O’Doherty J. Rangel A. Orbitofrontal cortex encodes willingness to pay in everyday economic transactions.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9984-9988Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), or hypothetical choices (Tusche et al., 2010Tusche A. Bode S. Haynes J.D. Neural responses to unattended products predict later consumer choices.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8024-8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), thereby precluding quantitative assessment of how choice-irrelevant SVs impact on task performance during value-unrelated decisions. Moreover, it is an open question whether any such automatic SV representations are functionally overlapping with, or distinct from, choice-dependent SV signals, as previous studies that have assessed automatic SV coding during value-unrelated tasks have either focused on only one region (Kim et al., 2007Kim H. Adolphs R. O’Doherty J.P. Shimojo S. Temporal isolation of neural processes underlying face preference decisions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18253-18258Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or have pooled activity across several brain areas (Lebreton et al., 2009Lebreton M. Jorge S. Michel V. Thirion B. Pessiglione M. An automatic valuation system in the human brain: evidence from functional neuroimaging.Neuron. 2009; 64: 431-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether different regions of the brain’s valuation circuitry contain functionally distinct SV representations that differentially relate to value-based choices or value-based attentional capture. To address this issue, we developed a choice task in which human participants alternated between purchasing decisions (for which SVs are directly choice-relevant) or perceptual decisions (for which SVs are unrelated to the current choice). Both types of choices were taken based on identical visual stimuli and motor responses. This paradigm is ideally suited for various hypothesis tests that can identify brain regions where SV representations predominantly relate to value-based choices or to value-based attentional capture. First, we hypothesize that if a brain region specifically represents choice-relevant SV, then value coding should be enhanced in the context of purchasing compared to perceptual choices. This prediction stems from the well-documented effect that directing attention toward a specific stimulus feature enhances the sensitivity of visual neurons selective for that feature, typically by sharpening the neuronal tuning curve (Knudsen, 2007Knudsen E.I. Fundamental components of attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 57-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004Martinez-Trujillo J.C. Treue S.

Biol. 2004; 14: 744-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L. Attentional modulation of visual processing.Annu. Rev.

Increased attention enhances both behavioral and neuronal performance.Science. 1988; 240: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This mechanism is thought to strengthen the neuronal representation of task-relevant features relative to background activity, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and increasing the reliability of the neural signal used to control behavior (Kastner et al., 1999Kastner S. Pinsk M.A. De Weerd P. Desimone R. Ungerleider L.G.

Desimone R. Attention increases sensitivity of V4 neurons.Neuron. 2000; 26: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesize that a similar mechanism may boost neural SV representations when these become choice-relevant. Any region in the brain representing predominantly choice-relevant SVs should exhibit a significantly steeper slope of the regression of neural activity on increasing SVs during purchasing compared to perceptual choices. Second, we expect that these enhancements of neural SV representations are a critical determinant of the choice outcome. In general, attention-related activity modulations in functionally specialized regions are thought to result in higher reliability of the choice-relevant signals, thereby decreasing trial-to-trial variability of behavior for any constant stimulus (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J. Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar, Knudsen, 2007Knudsen E.I.

Ford M.A. Bridging the gap between monkey neurophysiology and human perception: an ambiguity resolution theory of visual selective attention.Cognit. Psychol. 1997; 33: 64-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that the strength of the increase in SV representations during purchasing choices compared to the perceptual task will correlate with higher SV consistency across choices. SV consistency in this context means that if an item A is assigned a higher value than monetary amount X on a first occasion, then item A is also assigned a value higher than X when evaluated at a later time point (Rangel et al., 2008Rangel A. Camerer C. Montague P.R. A framework for studying the neurobiology of value-based decision making.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). In addition, we expect based on previous findings (Knutson et al., 2007Knutson B. Rick S. Wimmer G.E. Prelec D. Loewenstein G. Neural predictors of purchases.Neuron. 2007; 53: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) that regions implementing choice-relevant SV representations should contain signals that predict the actual purchasing choice. In contrast to these hypotheses about choice-relevant SV representations, we expect that brain activity in regions representing SVs automatically (i.e., even when these are choice-irrelevant) will show a constant relationship to SVs for both purchasing and perceptual choices. This is because such regions encode SVs of potential choice options without being affected by the current task, and therefore in a similar fashion for both types of decisions (Kim et al., 2007Kim H. Adolphs R. O’Doherty J.P. Shimojo S. Temporal isolation of neural processes underlying face preference decisions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18253-18258Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Lebreton et al., 2009Lebreton M. Jorge S. Michel V. Thirion B. Pessiglione M. An automatic valuation system in the human brain: evidence from functional neuroimaging.Neuron. 2009; 64: 431-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, the strength of this automatic SV-related activity should relate to the degree of value-driven attentional capture for perceptual choices. That is, we expect that the strength of neural activity in any region representing SVs in an automatic fashion should correlate with the reaction time (RT) slowing observed during perceptual choices. This effect is thought to reflect that these neural SV representations automatically capture attention and therefore systematically slow down the unrelated perceptual choice (Anderson et al., 2011Anderson B.A. Laurent P.A. Yantis S. Value-driven attentional capture.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 10367-10371Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, Awh et al., 2012Awh E. Belopolsky A.V. Theeuwes J. Top-down versus bottom-up attentional control: a failed theoretical dichotomy.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). We directly tested these hypotheses for all putative valuation regions of the human brain, using fMRI in a sample of 26 healthy volunteers who took purchasing or perceptual choices on identical visual stimuli. This allowed us to measure and compare the neural response profiles for SVs when these were choice-relevant (during purchasing choices) or unrelated to the present decision (for perceptual choices). Moreover, we could directly relate the strength of these two types of value representations to SV consistency and choice outcome for value-based choices, or to value-based attentional capture during perceptual choices. Both types of decisions were based on the same visual stimuli (DVD movie covers, each presented only once per decision type; Figures 1A and 1B) and were carefully matched for identical motor responses and RTs (Figures 1D–1F). RTs in both tasks did not significantly differ (t25 = −0.17, p = 0.86, paired t test; Figures 1D and 1E) but were strongly correlated across participants, indicating that both types of choices did not entail fundamentally different processing demands (r = 0.82, p < 0.001; Figure 1F). SV for each movie was quantified by willingness-to-pay ratings (Becker et al., 1964Becker G.M. DeGroot M.H. Marschak J. Measuring utility by a single-response sequential method.Behav. Sci. 1964; 9: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) (between 0 and 20 Swiss francs for 672 movies)—a standard method widely used in behavioral economics and neuroeconomics (Krajbich et al., 2010Krajbich I. Armel C. Rangel A. Visual fixations and the computation and comparison of value in simple choice.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, Plassmann et al., 2007Plassmann H. O’Doherty J. Rangel A. Orbitofrontal cortex encodes willingness to pay in everyday economic transactions.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9984-9988Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar)—which were provided by each participant 1–3 days prior to fMRI. During scanning, SVs were directly relevant for the purchasing decisions, which required the participants to choose whether or not to buy the depicted movie at an aurally presented price that varied around the predetermined SV. In contrast, SVs were irrelevant for the matched perceptual decisions (Polanía et al., 2014Polanía R. Krajbich I. Grueschow M. Ruff C.C. Neural oscillations and synchronization differentially support evidence accumulation in perceptual and value-based decision making.Neuron. 2014; 82: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), in which participants judged whether the numbers of faces (FV) present on the DVD cover matched an aurally presented number that varied around the actual FV (see Experimental Procedures for details). Importantly, SV and FV were uncorrelated in both tasks (t25 = −1.34, p = 0.19; Figure 1C), therefore allowing unbiased analyses of how SVs are neurally represented during both types of choices. We confirmed that SV was indeed choice-relevant for purchasing decisions and choice-irrelevant for perceptual decisions using multiple logistic regression analyses of participants’ behavioral responses. This showed that the difference between SV and the aurally presented price strongly affected accept/reject purchasing choices (t25 = 9.24, p = 1.5 × 10−9; Figure 2A; one-sample t test; see Experimental Procedures), but not perceptual choices (t25 = −1.62, p = 0.12; Figure 2B). Conversely, the absolute difference between FV and the aurally presented number strongly affected perceptual choices (t25 = −16.03, p = 1.1 × 10−14; Figure 2B), but not purchasing choices (t25 = 1.37, p = 0.18; Figure 2A). These analyses thus confirm that participants indeed based their choices exclusively on SVs for value-based choices and on FVs for perceptual decisions. To test whether our data also exhibit the predicted value-driven attentional capture effect (i.e., slowing of perceptual choices with increasing choice-irrelevant SV) (Anderson et al., 2011Anderson B.A. Laurent P.A. Yantis S. Value-driven attentional capture.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 10367-10371Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), we regressed RTs of perceptual decisions on the trial-wise SV and FV (Figure 2D). Unsurprisingly, we found that RTs increased with an increasing number of faces participants had to match (FV; t25 = 14.35, p = 1.4 × 10−13), but crucially, we also found a significant RT increase proportional to the choice-irrelevant SVs of the DVDs (t25 = 3.66, p = 1.2 × 10−3). This confirms that a value-driven attentional capture mechanism is engaged during perceptual choices. The speed of purchasing decisions was also affected by choice-relevant SV (t25 = 2.22, p = 0.036; Figure 2C), but not by the number of faces on the cover (t25 = 0.76, p = 0.45; Figure 2C), thereby further confirming that participants were only affected by SVs (and not FVs) when taking value-based choices. The primary aim of the fMRI analyses was to compare how automatic and choice-dependent value representations are implemented in the human brain. To this end, we took great care to ensure that experimental stimulation (visual/auditory), RTs, and motor responses were identical across both types of choices. This precise match in sensory and motor-related neural processing between both types of decisions was reflected in the substantial overlap of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity in audio-, visual-, and motor-associated regions common to both types of choices (conjunction analysis all p < 0.05, FWE-corrected; Figure 3A; see Table S1). Nevertheless, purchasing and perceptual choices strongly differed in how they recruited value-related or perceptual processing: when comparing mean BOLD activity between both types of choices (averaging across all levels of SV and FV), we found regions routinely associated with subjective valuation (such as the mPFC and PCC; see Bartra et al., 2013Bartra O.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (8637) Google Scholar) as well as the lateral occipital complex (LOC) were significantly more activated during perceptual as compared to purchasing choices (all p < 0.05, FWE-corrected; Figure 3B; see Table S2). These results confirm that despite their identical sensory and motor demands, the two types of decisions in our paradigm flexibly recruited regions that are functionally specialized for processing the information relevant for the current choice. To distinguish choice-related versus automatic value computations in the human brain, we tested for neural activity that either represented SVs predominantly when these were task-relevant or that coded value irrespective of current behavioral goals. For this purpose, we regressed BOLD signals against the trial-wise SV of the DVDs during purchasing decisions—when the choice strongly depended on SV—and during perceptual decisions, in which SVs were irrelevant for the current choice. This analysis revealed that both types of SV representations are encoded in the brain, but in clearly dissociated regions of the valuation system. On the one hand, BOLD signals in mPFC (Figures 4A, 4C, 4E, and 4G) and bilateral VS (Figure S1; Table S3) significantly correlated with SVs during purchasing decisions, but not during perceptual decisions, suggesting that both these regions mainly represent values when these are choice-relevant. Importantly, a direct contrast between purchasing and perceptual decisions confirmed that activity in both mPFC and VS showed significantly stronger correlations with SVs during purchasing decisions compared to perceptual decisions (Figures 4C, 4E, 4G, and S1B–S1D). We also note that this BOLD signal enhancement during purchasing choices was indeed related to the SVs of the DVDs and did not reflect the varying levels of prices presented alongside the items (see Supplemental Results for the relevant control analyses). In contrast to mPFC and VS, BOLD signals in the PCC (Figures 4B, 4D, 4F, and 4H) showed similar positive correlations with both choice-relevant SV during purchasing decisions and choice-irrelevant SV during perceptual decisions. Note that correlations with SV during perceptual choices were also found for other areas such as bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and bilateral parietal lobule (Figure S2; Table S3). This may possibly index a function of these areas in the filtering of distracting stimuli during perceptual choice (Friedman-Hill et al., 2003Friedman-Hill S.R. Robertson L.C. Desimone R.

However, the PCC was the only region that represented SVs both when these were relevant and irrelevant for the current decision (Figures 4D, 4F, and 4H), thereby fulfilling our requirements for an area that contains truly automatic, choice-independent value representations. Our data therefore demonstrate a functional dissociation between brain regions consistently linked to value processing (Bartra et al., 2013Bartra O. McGuire J.T. Kable J.W.

While the PCC represents SV in an automatic fashion that is invariant to current behavioral aims, the mPFC and VS represent SV predominantly when it is relevant for the current choice. We next tested whether the strength of the choice-dependent SV representations related to the behavioral consistency of value-based choices. Consistency here refers to how well the participants’ choices in the scanner agreed with their Becker-DeGroot-Marshak (BDM) auction rating for each DVD provided 1–3 days prior to scanning (Becker et al., 1964Becker G.M.

That is, a choice is SV-consistent if participants purchase a DVD when its price is less than or equal to the value they stated previously, or if they decline to purchase a DVD when its price is above their previously stated value. We expected a relation between SV consistency and neural SV representations because stronger neural choice-relevant value responses result in an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and thus more reliable behavioral readout of the values across both testing occasions. We tested for such a consistency effect with a linear mixed-effects regression of the proportion of consistent choices on the average strength of the neural choice-relevant value responses (this analysis was conducted across value quintiles, see Experimental Procedures for details).

Two of these, MALAT1 and Menβ, generate a tRNA-like small RNA in addition to the mature lncRNA. The stability of these tRNA-like small RNAs and bona fide tRNAs is monitored by the CCA-adding enzyme. Whereas CCA is added to stable tRNAs and tRNA-like transcripts, a second CCA repeat is added to certain unstable transcripts to initiate their degradation. Here, we characterize how these two scenarios are distinguished. Following the first CCA addition cycle, nucleotide binding to the active site triggers a clockwise screw motion, producing torque on the RNA. This ejects stable RNAs, whereas unstable RNAs are refolded while bound to the enzyme and subjected to a second CCA catalytic cycle. Intriguingly, with the CCA-adding enzyme acting as a molecular vise, the RNAs proofread themselves through differential responses to its interrogation between stable and unstable substrates."

Rats are highly social animals that often engage in social facial touch with their conspecifics (Wolfe et al., 2011Wolfe J. Mende C. Brecht M. Social facial touch in rats.Behav. Neurosci. 2011; 125: 900-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They do so by their mobile whiskers, which also sense the environment, obstacles, gaps, and different textures or objects (Diamond et al., 2008Diamond M.E. von Heimendahl M. Knutsen P.M. Kleinfeld D.

Many studies investigated sensory responses in barrel cortex. Most studies, however, used simple stimuli such as single whisker deflections or a pole presented to a head-fixed animal (Knutsen et al., 2006Knutsen P.M. Pietr M. Ahissar E.

In addition, membrane potential (Vm) dynamics during different behavioral states of the animal have been studied in detail in the somatosensory cortex (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

Social facial interactions involve multisensory signaling (Brecht and Freiwald, 2012Brecht M. Freiwald W.A. The many facets of facial interactions in mammals.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but we know little about the impact of such social interactions on cortical activity, as only few studies analyzed responses in interacting animals (Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent studies strengthen the assumption that social touch modulates responses in somatosensory cortex. A human fMRI study showed that activity in somatosensory cortex depended on the gender that the tested person thought they were caressed by (Gazzola et al., 2012Gazzola V. Spezio M.L. Etzel J.A. Castelli F. Adolphs R. Keysers C. Primary somatosensory cortex discriminates affective significance in social touch.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E1657-E1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Further, the barrel cortex of rats showed differential responses between sexes and were dependent on the phase of estrus cycle in females (Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the impact of social facial touch on Vm dynamics in barrel cortex neurons, we performed whole-cell recordings in head-restrained rats while interacting with stimulus rats of different sexes. Unlike our previous work, which focused on firing rate effects of social touch (Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), here we focus on Vm dynamics and rely on the excellent time resolution of whole-cell recordings. In the current study, we ask the following questions: (1) Do Vm dynamics during social whisking differ from free whisking? (2) If so, how do such differences arise? (3) How do Vm dynamics during social touch compare with responses to passive social touch in anaesthetized animals? (4) Do Vm dynamics differ between social touch and nonconspecific touch? We assessed Vm trajectories during social facial touch and free whisking episodes by whole-cell recordings in barrel cortex neurons of awake head-restrained rats (referred to as subject rat; Figure 1A). Subject animals were on average P32 at the day of recording. It is known that female rats enter puberty at the age of P34–P38, whereas in males puberty is reached a couple of days later (P39–P47) (Engelbregt et al., 2000Engelbregt M.J.T. Houdijk M.E. Popp-Snijders C. Delemarre-van de Waal H.A. The effects of intra-uterine growth retardation and postnatal undernutrition on onset of puberty in male and female rats.Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, our animals were sexually immature and in prepuberty. We recorded from 47 barrel cortex neurons, of which 23 cells were obtained from female and 24 from male subject rats. After the whole-cell configuration was established, the head-fixed experimental animal was allowed to interact with stimulus rats of different sexes held by the experimenter (Figure 1A). This procedure allowed multiple episodes of social facial touch during a recording. Social touch behavior in these staged interactions was qualitatively similar to interaction patterns observed previously (Wolfe et al., 2011Wolfe J. Mende C. Brecht M. Social facial touch in rats.Behav. Neurosci. 2011; 125: 900-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but differed quantitatively from those in freely interacting animals. Whisking was less intense and interaction episodes were shorter in the head-fixed configuration. Additionally, the head-fixed subject rat whisked with smaller amplitudes and also tended to emit fewer ultrasonic vocalizations (0.06 ± 0.08 SD calls per second) than head-free stimulus animals (0.76 ± 0.42 SD calls per second), suggesting that head-fixation affected interaction patterns. Social facial interactions started with whisker overlap and also included nose-to-nose touch, as described previously (Wolfe et al., 2011Wolfe J. Mende C. Brecht M. Social facial touch in rats.Behav. Neurosci. 2011; 125: 900-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whisker movements of subject and stimulus rat were tracked using high- and low-speed videography (Figure 1A). A layer 2/3 pyramidal cell (Figure 1B) showed strong and reproducible Vm fluctuations during social touch, which were characterized by large amplitude changes of up to 12 mV (Figure 1C, top and bottom). During free whisking, a different pattern of Vm fluctuations was observed (Figure 1D, top and bottom). Averaging the Vm triggered to the beginning of whisker protraction of the subject rat revealed strong locking of Vm to whisking during social facial touch (Figure 1E). However, during free whisking, when animals performed spontaneous whisking bouts in free air, the correlation of Vm to whisking was much less prominent and less consistent (Figure 1F). In addition, the average modulation depth of Vm, measured by subtracting the minimum from the maximum (see bars in Figures 1E and F), was larger during social touch than free whisking for the example episodes shown in Figures 1C and D. Across multiple episodes for the representative cell in Figure 1B, we observed a significant difference in modulation depth between free whisking and social touch (Figure 1G, Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.024). Population data for all cells (n = 20) showed similar results (Figure 1H, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.002). In 47 neurons, we could monitor 256 social facial touch episodes. In 20 of 47 cells, we were able to analyze free whisking episodes (n = 49). Average modulation depth across episodes is plotted for these cells in Figure 1H, where both social touch and free whisking episodes could be recorded. To assess whether whisker motion parameters had an influence on the resulting cell responses during social touch and free whisking, we quantified whisking amplitude and set angle. We found no difference when whisking parameters were compared between social touch and free whisking (Figures S1A and S1C available online; mean whisking amplitude was 13.4° ± 0.9°, and mean set angle was 91.4° ± 3° during free whisking; during social touch, mean whisking amplitude was 12.2° ± 1.3° and mean set angle, 89.5° ± 3.6°; p = 0.601 for whisking amplitude and p = 0.989 for set angle, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). It is clear from these data that both free whisking and social touch resulted in fairly variable whisking patterns under our conditions. We did not observe a correlation of Vm to whisking amplitude or set angle during social facial touch or free whisking (Figures S1B and S1D, Pearson correlation test). When plotting the Vm modulation depth during social touch against the Vm modulation depth during free whisking, no clear relationship between these two measurements was observed (Figure S1E, p = 0.137, Pearson correlation test). These observations argue against the idea that differences in social facial touch and free whisking originated from differential whisker motion patterns (Figures S1B and S1D). Behavioral state influences Vm dynamics. Whereas slow, large Vm fluctuations are observed during quiet wakefulness, there is a shift in brain state during explorative whisking, causing a reduction of slow Vm fluctuations and a depolarization in the cells (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat.

Fernandez L.M. Crochet S. Petersen C.C. Thalamic control of cortical states.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To assess such changes in our data, we calculated mean Vm values and firing rates for the three different states, during which we monitored cell activity: quiet wakefulness, free whisking, and social touch. Averaging the Vm over episodes revealed a significant depolarization, occurring during social touch compared with free whisking (mean Vm during social touch was −47.5 ± 2.7 mV and during free whisking −51.8 ± 2.6 mV, p = 0.002) and quiet wakefulness (mean Vm during quiet wakefulness was −52.9 ± 2.3 mV, p = 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test, data not plotted). No difference in the mean Vm was found between quiet wakefulness and free whisking (p = 0.806, Mann-Whitney U test). Further, a decrease in firing rate was observed when animals started to move their whiskers (mean firing rate during quiet awake was 1.1 ± 0.5 Hz and during free whisking 0.8 ± 0.4 Hz, p = 0.034). Finally, neurons fired with higher rates during social touch compared to free whisking (p = 0.024, mean firing rate during social touch was 1.8 ± 0.8 Hz, data not plotted). This initial dataset indicates that social touch induces Vm changes compared to quiet wakefulness and free whisking. In the following sections, we outline, how these changes evolve over time and what factors might contribute to such Vm changes. We next analyzed the evolution of Vm fluctuations around social interactions. To this end, we tracked whisker movements of the subject rat prior, during, and after the social facial touch episodes and analyzed whether the Vm trajectories (Figure 2A, upper panel) locked to these movements (Figure 2A, lower panel). From this analysis it became clear that the Vm dynamics changed even before the animals touch each other (referred to as “pre-contact period”) and that evoked responses continued after the social interaction was terminated (referred to as “post-contact period”). In contrast, Vm changes were not observed in free whisking episodes (recording traces from the same cell, Figure 2B). Protraction triggered Vm averages for the episodes shown in Figures 2A and 2B reveal a locking of Vm to whisker motion before and after social touch (Figure 2C). Such locking was significantly weaker during free whisking (Figure 2D). Modulation depth of Vm was stronger for pre-contact, post-contact, and social touch compared with free whisking in the example episode (Figures 2C and 2D). Population data confirm these findings (n = 19 cells). Protraction triggered Vm changes were small during free whisking and significantly different from protraction triggered Vm changes before (p < 0.0001), during (p = 0.002) and after social touch (p = 0.012; Figure 2E, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA also reported a significant difference between free whisking, pre-contact, post-contact and social touch (p = 0.003). Finally, we asked, whether the observed socially triggered changes in Vm were related to the mechanics of whisking. There was no clear correlation between modulation depth and whisking amplitude for either free whisking (p = 0.069) or precontact interaction periods (p = 0.348, Pearson correlation test, Figure 2F), suggesting that the Vm dynamics during pre-contact do not simply reflect whisker movement. Taken together, these data suggest that social facial interactions result in substantial Vm changes and that these changes in Vm are already apparent prior to the onset of facial contact. In order to better understand the origin of responses in social touch, we performed whole-cell recordings in barrel cortex neurons of anaesthetized rats. As soon as a stable recording was obtained, we presented stimulus rats to these anaesthetized subject rats. Thus, under these conditions, there is no active touch of the subject rat, but responses are evoked by passive touch, i.e., by whisking and sniffing of the stimulus rat on the anaesthetized subject rat. We recorded from 25 barrel cortex neurons in anaesthetized animals and monitored 182 passive touch episodes. To assess whether Vm fluctuations during pre-contact periods were due to whisking patterns, we quantified mean Vm and firing rates before, during, and after passive social touch and compared these to ongoing activity (no stimulus rat present). Characteristic up and down states were observed during anaesthetized recordings (Figure 3A, left), which persisted while stimulus rats were presented (Figure 3A, right). In addition, a significant depolarization was observed during passive touch compared to ongoing activity in the given example cell (p = 0.032, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Figure 3B). Unlike the awake animals, however, this depolarization did not occur before the stimulus rat was approaching the anaesthetized subject rat. As shown in Figure 3C for a recording from an awake animal, the Vm of the neuron depolarizes prior to contact and this effect was robust across episodes (Figure 3D). Population data for all cells recorded (n = 33) indicate the same conclusion. While there is no pre-contact depolarization relative to ongoing activity in anaesthetized animals (Figure 3E), there was a significant pre-contact depolarization in cells recorded in awake animals (Figure 3F). To test whether there was indeed a significant effect of wakefulness on the pre-contact depolarization, we compared the difference between ongoing and pre-contact Vm in awake and anaesthetized animals. We found that, there was indeed a significantly larger pre-contact depolarization in awake animals (p = 0.004, Mann-Whitney U test). These findings indicate that the mere presence of a stimulus animal is not sufficient to induce the pre-contact depolarization, but that it results from mechanisms related to the active sensing of conspecifics. Strong engagement of barrel cortex during active touch has been reported using voltage sensitive dye imaging (Ferezou et al., 2006Ferezou I. Bolea S. Petersen C.C.H. Visualizing the cortical representation of whisker touch: voltage-sensitive dye imaging in freely moving mice.Neuron. 2006; 50: 617-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered to what extent the observed modulation in the Vm in our study was specific for social interactions with an alive stimulus rat. To address this issue we compared responses of barrel cortex neurons during interactions with awake conspecifics (Figures 4A and 4B ) with inanimate stimuli, such as stuffed rats (Figures 4C and 4D), objects (Figures 4F and 4G), and responses in the Vm to the experimenter’s hand alone (Figures 4I and 4J). Whole-cell recordings were obtained and the different stimuli were presented in a random order to the head-fixed subject rat. Figures 4A, 4C, 4F, and 4I show Vm traces with the corresponding whisker movements during interactions with an alive stimulus rat (Figure 4A, right), a stuffed rat (Figure 4C, right), an object (Figure 4F, right) and the experimenter’s hand (Figure 4I, right). All traces were obtained from the same barrel cortex neuron. Figures 4B, 4D, 4G, and 4J show the protraction triggered Vm curves for the given episodes. This neuron showed the strongest locking to the subject whisking and biggest Vm modulation during a social interaction with a stimulus rat. Nonconspecific stimuli (Figure 4D, stuffed rat; Figure 4G, object; and Figure 4J, experimenter’s hand) elicit much smaller modulation depths. These differences evoked by conspecific and non-specific stimuli in the modulation depth relative to subject whisking were seen in all cells recorded. We observed significant differences between modulation depths evoked by social touch (with an alive conspecific) when compared with each nonconspecific stimuli: stuffed rats (Figure 4E, n = 8 cells, p = 0.008), objects (Figure 4H, n = 7 cells, p = 0.016) and the experimenter’s hand (Figure 4K, n = 8 cells, p = 0.016). Whisking parameters during social touch and interactions with non-conspecific stimuli were similar. Figure S2 shows the whisking amplitude (upper) and the set angle (lower) during interactions with a stuffed rat (Figure S2A), an object (Figure S2B) and the experimenter’s hand (Figure S2C) compared with social touch interactions. No differences were found in motion parameters, when social touch and interactions with inanimate stimuli were compared. This result differs from findings we obtained previously in freely moving animals, where robust whisker movement differences were observed between object touch and social touch (Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E.

Thus, our findings show that large Vm modulations and Vm locking to the whisking of the subject rat are physiological characteristics specific to social touch. Previous measurements using extracellular recordings described firing rate effects associated with social touch in barrel cortex (Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We extend these findings by describing Vm dynamics during social facial touch in interacting animals. Whole-cell recordings in awake, head-restrained rats revealed the impact of social facial touch at the level of subthreshold dynamics. Social touch led to large amplitude Vm fluctuations, which were not observed in free whisking. Relatively weak Vm modulation during free whisking was observed as previously described (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.

Active touch led to larger responses than free whisking in the studies of Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.

Synaptic mechanisms underlying sparse coding of active touch.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1160-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, an observation similar to our results on social touch. A recent study described the representation of social facial touch in terms of firing rate changes in the barrel cortex (Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A major advance of the present work is contributed by the precise time resolution of whole-cell recordings, which made it possible to characterize the locking of the Vm to the subject animal’s whisking during social facial touch. We found that active social touch initiated changes in the Vm dynamics even before whisker contact occurred. This finding was not seen in the study of firing rates by Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. Vm locked to whisking of the subject rat and cells depolarized and increased their firing rate prior to whisker contact. To the best of our knowledge, such strong Vm responses prior to tactile stimulation have not been previously described. Barrel cortex activity has been extensively studied in head-restrained animals that have been trained for simple task, such as object localization (Knutsen et al., 2006Knutsen P.M. Pietr M. Ahissar E. Haptic object localization in the vibrissal system: behavior and performance.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8451-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, O’Connor et al., 2010O’Connor D.H.

Neural activity in barrel cortex underlying vibrissa-based object localization in mice.Neuron. 2010; 67: 1048-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) or whisker-based tactile tasks (Sachidhanandam et al., 2013Sachidhanandam S. Sreenivasan V. Kyriakatos A. Kremer Y. Petersen C.C. Membrane potential correlates of sensory perception in mouse barrel cortex.Nat. Neurosc. 2013; 16: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, we know little about responses to natural stimuli (Brecht, 2007Brecht M. Barrel cortex and whisker-mediated behaviors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and none of these studies reported an activity in barrel cortex neurons prior to tactile input. In addition, the changes in Vm dynamics prior to contact were independent of whisking parameters such as whisking amplitude and set angle, as these parameters turned out to be similar during pre-contact, social touch, and free whisking. We note, however, that our observations do not rule out the possibility of subtle differences in motor patterns or other variables, such as changes in the blood pressure of the follicle sinus. Future work should clarify whether the observed effects are related to arousal. The pre-contact depolarization that was observed during awake social touch and not during passive touch in anesthetized animals is consistent with the idea that arousal might play a role. Alertness and arousal are known to affect the whisker system. In primary vibrissa somatosensory cortex, it was shown that whisker stimuli lead to smaller responses in animals during free whisking than during quiet waking (Ferezou et al., 2006Ferezou I. Bolea S. Petersen C.C.H. Visualizing the cortical representation of whisker touch: voltage-sensitive dye imaging in freely moving mice.Neuron. 2006; 50: 617-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Moreover, cholinergic and noradrenergic afferents are known to influence the activity of the barrel cortex. Constantinople and Bruno, 2011Constantinople C.M. Bruno R.M. Effects and mechanisms of wakefulness on local cortical networks.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar showed that acetylcholine is not responsible for changing the brain state from wakefulness patterns to synaptic quiescence, but that the response to whisker stimulation increases due to acetylcholine. However, we note that single arousal variable is unlikely to account for the observations we report here. For example, in the rat hippocampus we found that object contacts evoke stronger rate effects than social stimuli (von Heimendahl et al., 2012von Heimendahl M. Rao R.P. Brecht M. Weak and nondiscriminative responses to conspecifics in the rat hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 2129-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). From this observation, one can conclude that there is not a brain-wide increase of neural activity as a result of social interaction. To test whether the response patterns observed were specific to social stimuli, we analyzed whether the touch of a stuffed rat, an object, or the experimenter’s hand alone induced the same Vm modulations as observed during interaction with an alive rat. We found that the locking of Vm and the subject’s whisking that occurred during social touch was significantly smaller during touch of nonconspecific stimuli than during whisking on an awake conspecific. This agrees with the results of Bobrov et al., 2014Bobrov E. Wolfe J. Rao R.P. Brecht M. The representation of social facial touch in rat barrel cortex.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, which described smaller firing rate responses in object touch compared with social touch. Taken together, these findings support the idea that the response patterns observed in our study are specific to social touch. Social facial interactions are known to involve multisensory signaling (Brecht and Freiwald, 2012Brecht M. Freiwald W.A. The many facets of facial interactions in mammals.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the pre-contact depolarization and whisker locking observed here is generated by multisensory mechanisms. A candidate mechanism might be socially induced sniffing. Whisking is correlated with sniffing in rodents (Deschênes et al., 2012Deschênes M. Moore J. Kleinfeld D. Sniffing and whisking in rodents.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which predestine sniffing as an important factor during a social interaction. There is ample evidence for socially induced sniffing in rats. Subordinate rats, for example, decrease their sniffing during an interaction with a dominant conspecific in order to avoid aggressive behavior (Wesson, 2013Wesson D.W. Sniffing behavior communicates social hierarchy.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 575-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, future work should address the role of sniffing in social touch. Sniffing-related effects on neural activity in barrel cortex are plausible, since Ito et al., 2014Ito J. Roy S. Liu Y. Cao Y. Fletcher M. Lu L. Boughter J.D. Grün S. Heck D.H. Whisker barrel cortex delta oscillations and gamma power in the awake mouse are linked to respiration.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3572PubMed Google Scholar showed phase locking of barrel cortex activity to respiration. We therefore assume that olfactory cues and potentially sniffing might play an important role in the observed interaction patterns. Recent fMRI work in humans also suggests that multisensory cues and anticipation shape responses in somatosensory cortex. In the work of Gazzola et al., 2012Gazzola V. Spezio M.L. Etzel J.A. Castelli F. Adolphs R. Keysers C. Primary somatosensory cortex discriminates affective significance in social touch.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E1657-E1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, responses in somatosensory cortex changed as a function of movies of the touching interaction partner, even when the actual touch was the same. In social encounters, rodents transmit pheromonal signals (Kannan and Archunan, 2001Kannan S. Archunan G. Rat cheek gland compounds: behavioural response to identified compounds.Indian J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 39: 887-891PubMed Google Scholar), as well as visual and auditory cues in form of ultrasonic vocalization (reviewed in Wöhr and Schwarting, 2013Wöhr M. Schwarting R.K. Affective communication in rodents: ultrasonic vocalizations as a tool for research on emotion and motivation.Cell Tissue Res. 2013; 354: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We find that while calling rates of our head-fixed animals were low, stimulus animals called at higher rates similar to interacting animals (data not shown; Rao et al., 2014Rao R.P. Mielke F. Bobrov E. Brecht M. Vocalization-whisking coordination and multisensory integration of social signals in rat auditory cortex.eLife. 2014; 3: e03185Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hence, ultrasonic vocalizations could also contribute to the pre-contact effects seen in our interactions. The relatively weak responses to stuffed animals indicate that the pure sight of a stimulus animal is not sufficient to evoke full-blown social responses. Our data on Vm responses to social touch show a surprising amount of high-level nontactile information in barrel cortex activity. Thus, Vm modulations started prior to contact and were different compared with interactions with inanimate stimuli and alive stimulus rats. The pre-contact depolarization was not observed during passive touch in anesthetized animals, suggesting that active processing within the brain of the conscious subject rat is needed. Our data suggest that the earliest stages of somatosensory cortical processing do not merely reflect the mechanics of tactile stimuli. Instead, the active sensing of conspecifics evokes differential barrel cortex activity and a representation of social information in prominent whisking-locked Vm fluctuations."

The function of beclin 1 in cancer has been attributed primarily to its role in the degradative process of macroautophagy. However, beclin 1 is a core component of the vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34)/class III phosphatidylinositoI-3 kinase (PI3KC3) and Vps15/p150 complex that regulates multiple membrane-trafficking events. In the current study, we describe an alternative mechanism of action for beclin 1 in breast cancer involving its control of growth factor receptor signaling. We identify a specific stage of early endosome maturation that is regulated by beclin 1, the transition of APPL1-containing phosphatidyIinositol 3-phosphate-negative (PI3P−) endosomes to PI3P+ endosomes. Beclin 1 regulates PI3P production in response to growth factor stimulation to control the residency time of growth factor receptors in the PI3P−/APPL+-signaling-competent compartment. As a result, suppression of BECN1 sustains growth factor-stimulated AKT and ERK activation resulting in increased breast carcinoma cell invasion. In human breast tumors, beclin 1 expression is inversely correlated with AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Our data identify a novel role for beclin 1 in regulating growth factor signaling and reveal a mechanism by which loss of beclin 1 expression would enhance breast cancer progression."

YAP has a well-described role in promoting cell proliferation and survival, but the precise mechanisms and transcriptional targets that underlie these properties are still unclear and likely context-dependent. We found, using siRNA-mediated knockdown, that YAP is required for proliferation in endothelial cells but not HeLa cells. Specifically, YAP is required for S-phase entry and its absence causes cells to accumulate in G1. Microarray analysis suggests that YAP mediates this effect by regulating the transcription of genes involved in the assembly and/or firing of replication origins and homologous recombination of DNA. These findings thus provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which YAP regulates cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2015111689,"The initiation and maintenance of a malignant phenotype requires complex and synergistic interactions of multiple oncogenic signals. The Hedgehog (HH)/GLI pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancer entities and targeted pathway inhibition is of therapeutic relevance. Signal cross-talk with other cancer pathways including PI3K/AKT modulates HH/GLI signal strength and its oncogenicity. In this study, we addressed the role of HH/GLI and its putative interaction with the PI3K/AKT cascade in the initiation and maintenance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using transgenic mouse models, we show that B-cell-specific constitutive activation of HH/GLI signaling either at the level of the HH effector and drug target Smoothened or at the level of the GLI transcription factors does not suffice to initiate a CLL-like phenotype characterized by the accumulation of CD5(+) B cells in the lymphatic system and peripheral blood. Furthermore, Hh/Gli activation in Pten-deficient B cells with activated Pi3K/Akt signaling failed to enhance the expansion of leukemic CD5(+) B cells, suggesting that genetic or epigenetic alterations leading to aberrant HH/GLI signaling in B cells do not suffice to elicit a CLL-like phenotype in mice. By contrast, we identify a critical role of GLI and PI3K signaling for the survival of human primary CLL cells. We show that combined targeting of GLI and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling can have a synergistic therapeutic effect in cells from a subgroup of CLL patients, thereby providing a basis for the evaluation of future combination therapies targeting HH/GLI and PI3K signaling in this common hematopoietic malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2093021664,"The Smoothened (Smo) receptor, a member of class F G protein-coupled receptors, is the main transducer of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway implicated in a wide range of developmental and adult processes. Smo is the target of anticancer drugs that bind to a long and narrow cavity in the 7-transmembrane (7TM) domain. X-ray structures of human Smo (hSmo) bound to several ligands have revealed 2 types of 7TM-directed antagonists: those binding mostly to extracellular loops (site 1, e.g., LY2940680) and those penetrating deeply in the 7TM cavity (site 2, e.g., SANT-1). Here we report the development of the acylguanidine MRT-92, which displays subnanomolar antagonist activity against Smo in various Hh cell-based assays. MRT-92 inhibits rodent cerebellar granule cell proliferation induced by Hh pathway activation through pharmacologic (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 0.4 nM) or genetic manipulation. Using [3H]MRT-92 (Kd = 0.3 nM for hSmo), we created a comprehensive framework for the interaction of small molecule modulators with hSmo and for understanding chemoresistance linked to hSmo mutations. Guided by molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis data, our work convincingly confirms that MRT-92 simultaneously recognized and occupied both sites 1 and 2. Our data demonstrate the existence of a third type of Smo antagonists, those entirely filling the Smo binding cavity from the upper extracellular part to the lower cytoplasmicproximal subpocket.

https://openalex.org/W1980811308,"Despite ionizing radiation (IR) is being widely used as a standard treatment for lung cancer, many evidences suggest that IR paradoxically promotes cancer malignancy. However, its molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced cancer progression remain obscure. Here, we report that exposure to fractionated radiation (2 Gy per day for 3 days) induces the secretion of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that has been commonly used in cancer therapies to ameliorate neutropenia. Intriguingly, radiation-induced G-CSF promoted the migratory and invasive properties by triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) in non-small-cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs). By irradiation, G-CSF was upregulated transcriptionally by β-catenin/TCF4 complex that binds to the promoter region of G-CSF as a transcription factor. Importantly, irradiation increased the stability of β-catenin through the activation of PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT), thereby upregulating the expression of G-CSF. Radiation-induced G-CSF is recognized by G-CSFR and transduced its intracellular signaling JAK/STAT3 (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription), thereby triggering EMT program in NSCLCs. Taken together, our findings suggest that the application of G-CSF in cancer therapies to ameliorate neutropenia should be reconsidered owing to its effect on cancer progression, and G-CSF could be a novel therapeutic target to mitigate the harmful effect of radiotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2045848743,"HMG20A is a high mobility group (HMG) domain containing protein homologous to HMG20B, a core subunit of the Lys-specific demethylase 1/REST co-repressor 1 (LSD1-CoREST) histone demethylase complex. Here, we show that HMG20A can replace HMG20B and, therefore, they are mutually exclusive subunits of the complex. Both proteins interact through a coiled-coil domain with BHC80, another subunit of the LSD1-CoREST complex. To investigate the functional differences between the two proteins, we performed transcriptomic analysis of HMG20A- and HMG20B-depleted cells. Analysis of the misregulated genes in HMG20A-knockdown cells evidenced a high proportion of genes related to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. EMT occurs during embryonic development or during the course of malignant cancer progression and consists in the dynamic and reversible transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. We show that HMG20A together with LSD1 are required for SNAI1-dependent repression of epithelial genes and for (transforming growth factor β) TGF-β-triggered EMT. Importantly, HMG20A-depleted cells displayed reduced binding of LSD1 to epithelial gene promoters and increased methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3, suggesting a role of HMG20A in recruiting or in stabilizing the complex at the chromatin. SNAI1 and the TGF-β-related transcription factor SMAD4 were found to be associated with the LSD1-CoREST complex containing HMG20A. Furthermore, we show that HMG20A-depleted cells displayed reduced motility and invasion activity. Finally, we show that expression of HMG20A correlates positively with mesenchymal markers and negatively with epithelial markers in human tumor samples. Taken together, our data demonstrate that HMG20A is essential for the mesenchymal phenotype."

Here, we investigated whether the targeting of this pathway with a novel pharmacological inhibitor ICG-001 would result in an anti-tumor effect and improvement of chemosensitivity in MM. As expected, ICG-001 specifically down-regulated β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription in MM cells. Treatment with ICG-001 resulted in growth arrest and apoptosis in MM cell lines and primary MM cells. Moreover, ICG-001 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin and melphalan and abrogated chemoresistance of MM cells to these chemotherapeutics induced by bone marrow stroma. The cytotoxic effect of ICG-001 was caspase-dependent and mediated through transcriptional up-regulation of BH3-only pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family Noxa and Puma but not through inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. ICG-001 selectively induced apoptosis in primary MM cells but did not affect non-MM cells of the bone marrow microenvironment. Experiments using a xenograft model of MM showed substantial anti-tumor effects of this compound in vivo. Thus, our study demonstrated that the small molecule inhibitor ICG-001 has strong anti-MM effects and could be developed further for therapeutic intervention in this disease."

A recent population-based Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Diseases (TESAOD) has indicated that the low serum CC16 concentration is closely linked with the smoke-related mortality, particularly that driven by the lung cancer. However, the study of CC16 expression in well-defined smoke exposure models has been lacking, and there is no experimental support for the potential causal link between CC16 and CS-induced pathophysiological changes in the lung. In the present study, we have found that airway CC16 expression was significantly repressed in COPD patients, in monkey CS exposure model, and in CS-induced mouse model of COPD. Additionally, the lack of CC16 exacerbated airway inflammation and alveolar loss in the mouse model. Therefore, CC16 may play an important protective role in CS-related diseases."

Here we report that platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), a type of G-protein-coupled receptor, was upregulated in ESCC tumors and cell lines, compared with controls; PAFR levels were positively correlated with ESCC clinical stages and survival time. Overexpression of PAFR promoted the malignant development of ESCC in vitro and in vivo, whereas depletion of PAFR suppressed these effects. Interestingly, PAFR was observed to activate PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT) through the upregulation of FAK kinase activity. AKT-triggered nuclear factor-κB transcriptionally activated PAFR expression. This mutual positive regulation between PAFR and AKT was required for the aggressiveness of ESCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, treating mice bearing ESCC tumors with cholesterol-conjugated PAFR small interfering RNA effectively inhibited tumor progression and the expression of AKT-mediated oncogenic proteins.

Some click beetles in larval form, known as wireworms, are destructive agricultural pests. Morphological identification of click beetles is generally difficult and requires taxonomic expertise. This study reports on the DNA barcoding of Japanese click beetles to enable their rapid and accurate identification. We collected and assembled 762 cytochrome oxidase subunit I barcode sequences from 275 species, which cover approximately 75% of the common species found on the Japanese main island, Honshu. This barcode library also contains 20 out of the 21 potential pest species recorded in Japan. Our analysis shows that most morphologically identified species form distinct phylogenetic clusters separated from each other by large molecular distances. This supports the general usefulness of the DNA barcoding approach for quick and reliable identification of Japanese elaterid species for environmental impact assessment, agricultural pest control, and biodiversity analysis. On the other hand, the taxonomic boundary in dozens of species did not agree with the boundary of barcode index numbers (a criterion for sequence-based species delimitation).

Here we investigate how two chemically distinct compounds, glibenclamide and carbamazepine, correct biogenesis defects in ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and Kir6.2. We present evidence that despite structural differences, carbamazepine and glibenclamide compete for binding to KATP channels, and both drugs share a binding pocket in SUR1 to exert their effects. Moreover, both compounds engage Kir6.2, in particular the distal N terminus of Kir6.2, which is involved in normal channel biogenesis, for their chaperoning effects on SUR1 mutants. Conversely, both drugs can correct channel biogenesis defects caused by Kir6.2 mutations in a SUR1-dependent manner. Using an unnatural, photocross-linkable amino acid, azidophenylalanine, genetically encoded in Kir6.2, we demonstrate in living cells that both drugs promote interactions between the distal N terminus of Kir6.2 and SUR1. These findings reveal a converging pharmacological chaperoning mechanism wherein glibenclamide and carbamazepine stabilize the heteromeric subunit interface critical for channel biogenesis to overcome defective biogenesis caused by mutations in individual subunits."

Herein we demonstrate the mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of an RNA aptamer (Apt) conjugated to gefitinib-loaded poly (lactic co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (GNPs). Apt was selected through Cell-SELEX (systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process against gefitinib-resistant H1975 lung cancer cells. The selected aptamer exhibited high specificity toward H1975 cells, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Software analysis using the MATCH tool predicted Ets1, a proto-oncoprotein, to be the target of the selected aptamer. Interestingly, the localization of identified aptamer varied in descending order of Ets1 expression, wherein maximum localization was observed in H1975 cells than in MDA-MB231, DU-145, H23, H460, A431, A549 and MCF-7 cells, and minimum in L132 cells. Furthermore, Apt-GNP bio-conjugate showed augmented anticancer activity specifically in Ets1-overexpressing cells. In addition, partial depletion of Ets1 in H1975 cells and overexpression of Ets1 in L132 cells reversed the targeting efficacy of the aptamer. Notably, a single intratumoral injection of the Apt-GNP bio-conjugate abrogated the growth of tumor in H1975 xenograft nude mice. Altogether, we present a pioneering platform, involving aptamers, which can be clinically used as a diagnostic marker for metastasis as well as an effective delivery system to escort the pharmaceutical cargo specifically to Ets1-overexpressing highly progressive tumors."

Despite myosin's essential function in fly development and homeostasis, its kinetic features remain elusive. The purpose of this in vitro study is a detailed steady-state and presteady-state kinetic characterization of the Drosophila nonmuscle myosin-2 motor domain. Kinetic features are a slow steady-state ATPase activity, high affinities for F-actin and ADP, and a low duty ratio. Comparative analysis of the overall enzymatic signatures across the nonmuscle myosin-2 complement from model organisms indicates that the Drosophila protein resembles nonmuscle myosin-2s from metazoa rather than protozoa, though modulatory aspects of myosin motor function are distinct. Drosophila nonmuscle myosin-2 is uniquely insensitive toward blebbistatin, a commonly used myosin-2 inhibitor. An in silico modeling approach together with kinetic studies indicate that the nonconsensus amino acid Met466 in the Drosophila nonmuscle myosin-2 active-site loop switch-2 acts as blebbistatin desensitizer. Introduction of the M466I mutation sensitized the protein for blebbistatin, resulting in a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 36.3 ± 4.1 µM. Together, these data show that Drosophila nonmuscle myosin-2 is a bona fide molecular motor and establish an important link between switch-2 and blebbistatin sensitivity."

This reaction is catalyzed by VPS4, an AAA-ATPase whose activity is tightly regulated by a host of proteins, including LIP5 and the ESCRT-III proteins. Here, we present structural and functional analyses of molecular interactions between human VPS4, LIP5, and the ESCRT-III proteins. The N-terminal domain of LIP5 (LIP5NTD) is required for LIP5-mediated stimulation of VPS4, and the ESCRT-III protein CHMP5 strongly inhibits the stimulation. Both of these observations are distinct from what was previously described for homologous yeast proteins. The crystal structure of LIP5NTD in complex with the MIT (microtubule-interacting and transport)-interacting motifs of CHMP5 and a second ESCRT-III protein, CHMP1B, was determined at 1 A resolution. It reveals an ESCRT-III binding induced moderate conformational change in LIP5NTD, which results from insertion of a conserved CHMP5 tyrosine residue (Tyr(182)) at the core of LIP5NTD structure. Mutation of Tyr(182) partially relieves the inhibition displayed by CHMP5. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of VPS4 regulation in metazoans, where CHMP5 functions as a negative allosteric switch to control LIP5-mediated stimulation of VPS4."

Methods The study comprised 3,580 patients who were treated with curative intent either by laparoscopic gastrectomy (2,041 patients) or open gastrectomy (1,539 patents) between January 2005 and October 2013. The surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results Laparoscopic gastrectomy was associated with significantly less blood loss, transfused patient number, time to ground activities, and post-operative hospital stay, but with similar operation time, time to first flatus, and time to resumption of diet, compared with the open gastrectomy. No significant difference in the number of lymph nodes dissected was observed between these two groups. The morbidity and mortality rates of the LG group were comparable to those of the OG group (13.6% vs. 14.4%, P = 0.526, and 0.3% vs. 0.2%, P = 0.740). The 3-year disease-free and overall survival rates between the two groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). According to the UICC TNM classification of gastric cancer, the 3-year disease-free and overall survival rates were not statistically different at each stage. Conclusions Our single-center study of a large patient series revealed that LG for gastric cancer yields comparable surgical outcomes. This result was also true of local advanced gastric cancer (AGC). A well-designed randomized controlled trial comparing surgical outcomes between LG and OG in a larger number of patients for AGC can be carried out."
https://openalex.org/W1985919364,"Flotillins are universally conserved proteins that are present in all kingdoms of life. Recently it was demonstrated that the B. subtilis flotillin YuaG (FloT) has a direct influence on membrane domain formation by orchestrating lipid domains. Thereby it allocates a proper environment for diverse cellular machineries. YuaG creates platforms for signal transduction, processes crucial for biofilm formation, sporulation, competence, secretion, and others. Even though, flotillins are an emerging topic of research in the field of microbiology little is known about the molecular architecture of prokaryotic flotillins. All flotillins share common structural elements and are tethered to the membrane N’- terminally, followed by a so called PHB domain and a flotillin domain. We show here that prokaryotic flotillins are, similarly to eukaryotic flotillins, tethered to the membrane via a hairpin loop. Further it is demonstrated by sedimentation assays that B. subtilis flotillins do not bind to the membrane via their PHB domain contrary to eukaryotic flotillins. Size exclusion chromatography experiments, blue native PAGE and cross linking experiments revealed that B. subtilis YuaG can oligomerize into large clusters via the PHB domain. This illustrates an important difference in the setup of prokaryotic flotillins compared to the organization of eukaryotic flotillins."
https://openalex.org/W2012284888,"In this study, we tested the hypothesis that phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is a plausible mediator of phospholipid (PL) transfer to the N-terminal 1000 residues of apoB (apoB:1000) leading to the initiation of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly. To this end, primary hepatocytes from wild type (WT) and PLTP knock-out (KO) mice were transduced with adenovirus-apoB:1000 with or without co-transduction with adenovirus-PLTP, and the assembly and secretion of apoB:1000-containing lipoproteins were assessed. PLTP deficiency resulted in a 65 and 72% reduction in the protein and lipid content, respectively, of secreted apoB:1000-containing lipoproteins. Particles secreted by WT hepatocytes contained 69% PL, 9% diacylglycerol (DAG), and 23% triacylglycerol (TAG) with a stoichiometry of 46 PL, 6 DAG, and 15 TAG molecules per apoB:1000. PLTP absence drastically altered the lipid composition of apoB:1000 lipoproteins; these particles contained 46% PL, 13% DAG, and 41% TAG with a stoichiometry of 27 PL, 10 DAG, and 23 TAG molecules per apoB:1000. Reintroduction of Pltp gene into PLTP-KO hepatocytes stimulated the lipidation and secretion of apoB:1000-containing lipoproteins by ∼3-fold; the lipid composition and stoichiometry of these particles were identical to those secreted by WT hepatocytes. In contrast to the WT, apoB:1000 in PLTP-KO hepatocytes was susceptible to intracellular degradation predominantly in the post-endoplasmic reticulum, presecretory compartment. Reintroduction of Pltp gene into PLTP-KO hepatocytes restored the stability of apoB:1000. These results provide compelling evidence that in hepatocytes initial recruitment of PL by apoB:1000 leading to the formation of the PL-rich apoB-containing initiation complex is mediated to a large extent by PLTP.

https://openalex.org/W2016970194,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the principle causes of chronic liver disease. Successful treatment significantly decreases the risk of hepatic morbidity and mortality. Current standard of care achieves sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 40-80%; however, the HCV therapy landscape is rapidly evolving. The objective of this study was to quantify the clinical and economic benefit associated with increasing levels of SVR.A published Markov model (MONARCH) that simulates the natural history of hepatitis C over a lifetime horizon was used. Discounted and non-discounted life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost of complication management were estimated for various plausible SVR rates. To demonstrate the robustness of projections obtained, the model was validated to ten UK-specific HCV studies.QALY estimates ranged from 18.0 years for those treated successfully in fibrosis stage F0 to 7.5 years (discounted) for patients in fibrosis stage F4 who remain untreated. Predicted QALY gains per 10% improvement in SVR ranged from 0.23 (F0) to 0.64 (F4) and 0.58 (F0) to 1.35 (F4) in 40 year old patients (discounted and non-discounted results respectively). In those aged 40, projected discounted HCV-related costs are minimised with successful treatment in F0/F1 (at approximately £ 300), increasing to £ 49,300 in F4 patients who remain untreated. Validation of the model to published UK cost-effectiveness studies produce R2 goodness of fit statistics of 0.988, 0.978 and of 0.973 for total costs, QALYs and incremental cost effectiveness ratios, respectively.Projecting the long-term clinical and economic consequences associated with chronic hepatitis C is a necessary requirement for the evaluation of new treatments. The principle analysis demonstrates the significant impact on expected costs, LYs and QALYs associated with increasing SVR. A validation analysis demonstrated the robustness of the results reported."
https://openalex.org/W2011613963,"Upon encystment induction, Azotobacter vinelandii produces the phenolic lipids alkylresorcinols (ARs) that are structural components of the cysts. The enzymes responsible for the ARs synthesis are encoded in the arsABCD operon, whose expression is activated by ArpR. The transcription of arpR is initiated from an RpoS dependent promoter. The nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system (PTS(Ntr)) is a global regulatory system present in Gram negative bacteria. It comprises the EI(Ntr), NPr and EIIA(Ntr) proteins encoded by ptsP, ptsO and ptsN genes respectively. These proteins participate in a phosphoryl-group transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to protein EIIA(Ntr) via the phosphotransferases EI(Ntr) and NPr. In A. vinelandii, the non-phosphorylated form of EIIA(Ntr) was previously shown to repress the synthesis of poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate. In this work, we show that PTS(Ntr) also regulates the synthesis of ARs. In a strain that carries unphosphorylated EIIA(Ntr), the expression of arpR was reduced, while synthesis of ARs and transcription of arsA were almost abrogated. The expression of arpR from an RpoS-independent promoter in this strain restored the ARs synthesis. Taken together these results indicate that unphosphorylated EIIA(Ntr) negatively affects activation of arpR transcription by RpoS."
https://openalex.org/W2130663132,"DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) catalyzes cytosine methylation of mammalian genomic DNA. In addition to myeloid malignancies, mutations in DNMT3A have been recently reported in T-cell lymphoma and leukemia, implying a possible involvement in the pathogenesis of human diseases. However, the role of Dnmt3a in T-cell transformation in vivo is poorly understood. Here we analyzed the functional consequences of Dnmt3a inactivation in a mouse model of MYC-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis (MTCL). Loss of Dnmt3a delayed tumorigenesis by suppressing cellular proliferation during disease progression. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis identified upregulation of 17 putative tumor suppressor genes, including DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b, in Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas as molecular events potentially responsible for the delayed lymphomagenesis in Dnmt3a(Δ/Δ) mice. Interestingly, promoter and gene body methylation of these genes was not substantially changed between control and Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas, suggesting that Dnmt3a may inhibit their expression in a methylation-independent manner. Re-expression of both wild type and catalytically inactive Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a(Δ/Δ) lymphoma cells in vitro inhibited Dnmt3b expression, indicating that Dnmt3b upregulation may be directly repressed by Dnmt3a. Importantly, genetic inactivation of Dnmt3b accelerated lymphomagenesis in Dnmt3a(Δ/Δ) mice, demonstrating that upregulation of Dnmt3b is a relevant molecular change in Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas that inhibits disease progression. Collectively, our data demonstrate an unexpected oncogenic role for Dnmt3a in MTCL through methylation-independent repression of Dnmt3b and possibly other tumor suppressor genes."
https://openalex.org/W1996463617,"Background Conventional cytology (Pap) and visual inspection after the application of acetic acid (VIA) are currently used in primary screening in Peru. Studies suggest that the quality of VIA is highly variable. Over 36 000 women were screened with Pap and VIA in the TATI (Tamizaje y Tratamiento Inmediato de Lesiones Cervico-uterinas) project conducted in Amazonian Peru. Within a nested study to compare several screening techniques (C-TATI), a total of 5435 women were additionally screened with liquid-based cytology (LBC) and high-risk human papillomavirus testing (HR-HPV). We investigate the variation of positivity rates of VIA, Pap, LBC and HR-HPV in C-TATI and of VIA in the full TATI intervention. Methods At the screening visit, midwives collected three cervical samples for Pap, LBC and HC2 before performing VIA. The dispersion factor “D” (D = Pearson chi-square value/degrees-of-freedom) was used to measure the variability of tests results. Within C-TATI, the variability of positivity rates of VIA, Pap, LBC and HR-HPV was also graphically assessed with box- and scatter plots by midwife and month of screening. Funnel plots and smoothed scatter plots were used to correlate the variation of VIA by the number of examinations performed by each midwife over the full TATI intervention. Results Consistently over TATI, VIA results were highly variable, independently of the examiner, the time when the test was performed and the number of tests the examiner performed (D>6, p-values<0.001). In C-TATI, VIA results varied the most while those of HR-HPV varied the least (Ds>25, p-values<0.001 for VIA, Ds<1.6, p-values>0.05 for HR-HPV). No evidence for correlation between the number of VIAs done per midwife and the variability of VIA results was observed. Conclusion The lack of over-dispersion for HR-HPV detection suggests that the variable VIA results do not reflect true variation in underlying disease, but a lack of consistency in human judgement."
https://openalex.org/W1995558873,"CHIP, a co-chaperone protein that interacts with Hsc/Hsp70, has been shown to be under-expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and has demonstrated a potential tumor suppressor property. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of CHIP regulation in pancreatic cancer cells remain unknown. In this study, we found that miR-1178 decreased the translation of the CHIP protein by targeting the 3′-UTR region. We observed that over-expression of miR-1178 facilitated the proliferation, G1/S transition, migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Conversely, the inhibition of miR-1178 expression significantly suppressed these phenotypes. Furthermore, CHIP over-expression abrogated miR-1178-induced cell proliferation and invasion. Our data suggest that miR-1178 acts as an oncomiR in pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting CHIP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2031837781,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) has been shown reproducibly in genome-wide association studies to be associated with increased breast cancer risk. Here we show that mouse mammary tumor virus-neu mice develop breast carcinomas with FGFR2 immunoreactivity that parallels HER2 expression. FGFR2 signaling promotes HER2 shedding through the metalloprotease ADAM10 leading to intracellular accumulation of the truncated p95HER2 protein. This is accompanied by enhanced HER2 signaling and diminished sensitivity to trastuzumab. Functionally, FGFR2 facilitates HER2-mediated cell proliferation, acinar growth in three-dimensional morphogenesis assays and promotes tumor progression in mouse xenografts. These data implicate FGFR2 in a novel mechanism of ErbB activation and demonstrate an important interaction between FGFR2 and HER2 in promoting breast cancer progression.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 February 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.440."
https://openalex.org/W1989769230,"Melanoma tissues and cell lines are heterogeneous, and include cells with invasive, proliferative, stem cell-like, and differentiated properties. Such heterogeneity likely contributes to the aggressiveness of the disease and resistance to therapy. One model suggests that heterogeneity arises from rare cancer stem cells (CSCs) that produce distinct cancer cell lineages. Another model suggests that heterogeneity arises through reversible cellular plasticity, or phenotype-switching. Recent work indicates that phenotype-switching may include the ability of cancer cells to dedifferentiate to a stem cell-like state. We set out to investigate the phenotype-switching capabilities of melanoma cells, and used unbiased methods to identify genes that may control such switching. We developed a system to reversibly synchronize melanoma cells between 2D-monolayer and 3D-stem cell-like growth states. Melanoma cells maintained in the stem cell-like state showed a striking upregulation of a gene set related to development and neural stem cell biology, which included SRY-box 2 (SOX2) and Inhibitor of DNA Binding 4 (ID4). A gene set related to cancer cell motility and invasiveness was concomitantly downregulated. Intense and pervasive ID4 protein expression was detected in human melanoma tissue samples, suggesting disease relevance for this protein. SiRNA knockdown of ID4 inhibited switching from monolayer to 3D-stem cell-like growth, and instead promoted switching to a highly differentiated, neuronal-like morphology. We suggest that ID4 is upregulated in melanoma as part of a stem cell-like program that facilitates further adaptive plasticity. ID4 may contribute to disease by preventing stem cell-like melanoma cells from progressing to a normal differentiated state. This interpretation is guided by the known role of ID4 as a differentiation inhibitor during normal development. The melanoma stem cell-like state may be protected by factors such as ID4, thereby potentially identifying a new therapeutic vulnerability to drive differentiation to the normal cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2085249173,"We examined whether social priming of cognitive states affects the inhibitory process in elderly adults, as aging is related to deficits in inhibitory control. Forty-eight elderly adults and 45 young adults were assigned to three groups and performed a cognitive control task (Simon task), which was followed by 3 different manipulations of social priming (i.e., thinking about an 82 year-old person): 1) negative--characterized by poor cognitive abilities, 2) neutral--characterized by acts irrelevant to cognitive abilities, and 3) positive--excellent cognitive abilities. After the manipulation, the Simon task was performed again. Results showed improvement in cognitive control effects in seniors after the positive manipulation, indicated by a significant decrease in the magnitude of the Simon and interference effects, but not after the neutral and negative manipulations. Furthermore, a healthy pattern of sequential effect (Gratton) that was absent before the manipulation in all 3 groups appeared after the positive manipulation. Namely, the Simon effect was only present after congruent but not after incongruent trials for the positive manipulation group. No influence of manipulations was found in young adults. These meaningful results were replicated in a second experiment and suggest a decrease in conflict interference resulting from positive cognitive state priming. Our study provides evidence that an implicit social concept of a positive cognitive condition in old age can affect the control process of the elderly and improve cognitive abilities."

The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of both elevated hs-cTn levels and dynamic changes in hospitalized patients.We conducted a retrospective study identifying all patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine Division of Rabin Medical Center, Israel between January 2011 to December 2011, for whom at least one hs-cTn T (hs-cTnT) measurement was obtained. Collected data included patient demographics, acute and chronic diagnosis, hs-cTnT and creatinine levels and date of death. Hs-cTnT levels were obtained in 5,696 admissions and was above the 99th percentile (> = 13 ng/L) in 61.6% of the measurements. A relative change of 50% or higher was observed in 24% of the admissions. Among those with elevated hs-cTnT levels, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) accounted for only 6.1% of acute diagnoses. Maximal hs-cTnT levels above 100 ng/L but not dynamic changes discriminated between ACS and non-ACS conditions (positive and negative predictive values of 12% and 96% respectively). The frequency of elevated hs-cTnT levels was age-dependent and over 75% of patients aged >70 years-old had levels above the 99th percentile. Multivariate analysis identified hs-cTnT levels higher than the 99th percentile, as an independent, strong predictor for 30-day mortality (OR 4.58 [2.8, 7.49], p<0.0001).Elevated hs-cTnT levels together with dynamic changes are frequent findings among hospitalized patients and in most cases, are not related to the ACS diagnosis. These findings highlight the diagnostic challenge of ACS in this complex population. Further studies are needed in order to optimize the use of hs-cTnT measurements in hospitalized patients."

Here we delineate the nuclear import pathway responsible for nuclear targeting of α-DB for the first time, together with the importance of nuclear α-DB in determining nuclear morphology. We map key residues of the nuclear localization signal of α-DB within the zinc finger domain (ZZ) using various truncated versions of the protein, and site-directed mutagenesis. Pulldown, immunoprecipitation, and AlphaScreen assays showed that the importin (IMP) α2/β1 heterodimer interacts with high affinity with the ZZ domain of α-DB. In vitro nuclear import assays using antibodies to specific importins, as well as in vivo studies using siRNA or a dominant negative importin construct, confirmed the key role of IMPα2/β1in α-DB nuclear translocation. Knockdown of α-DB expression perturbed cell cycle progression in C2C12 myoblasts, with decreased accumulation of cells in S phase and, significantly, altered localization of lamins A/C, B1, and B2 with accompanying gross nuclear morphology defects. Because α-DB interacts specifically with lamin B1 in vivo and in vitro, nuclear α-DB would appear to play a key role in nuclear shape maintenance through association with the nuclear lamina.—Aguilar, A., Wagstaff, K.

https://openalex.org/W2135208102,"Background Children discharged from hospitals in developing countries are at high risk of morbidity and mortality. However, few data describe these outcomes among children seen and discharged from rural outpatient centers. Objective The objective of this exploratory study was to identify predictors of immediate and follow-up morbidity and mortality among children visiting a rural health center in Uganda. Methods Subjects 0–12 years of age seeking care with a caregiver were consecutively enrolled from a single rural health center in Southwestern Uganda. Baseline variables were collected by research nurses and outcomes of referral, admission or death were recorded (immediate events). Death, hospital admission and health seeking occurring during the 30 days following the clinic visit were also determined (follow-up events). Univariate logistic regression was performed to identify baseline variables associated with immediate outcome and follow-up outcomes. Results Over the four-month recruitment period 717 subjects were enrolled. There were 85 (11.9%) immediate events (10.1% were admitted, 2.2% were referred, none died). Forty-seven (7.8%) events occurred within 30 days after the visit (7.3% sought care from a health provider, 1.5% were admitted and 0.5% died). Variables associated with immediate events included living more than 30 minutes from the health center, age older than 5 years, having received an antimalarial prior to the visit, having seen a community health worker prior to the visit, elevated respiratory rate or temperature, and depressed weight-for-age z score or decreased oxygen saturation. These variables were not associated with follow-up events. Conclusions Sick-child visits at a rural health center in South Western Uganda were associated with rates of mortality and subsequent admission of less than 2% in the period following the sick child visits. Other types of health seeking behavior occurred in approximately 7% of subjects during this same period. Several variables were associated with immediate events but there were no reliable predictors of follow-up events, possibly due to low statistical power."
https://openalex.org/W2065635951,"We studied potential changes in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) stem cell niche of the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAM-P8) aging model. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assays with longtime survival revealed a lower number of label-retaining stem cells in the SAM-P8 SVZ compared with the SAM-Resistant 1 (SAM-R1) control strain. We also found that in SAM-P8 niche signaling is attenuated and the stem cell pool is less responsive to the self-renewal niche factor pigmented epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Protein analysis demonstrated stable amounts of the PEDF ligand in the SAM-P8 SVZ niche; however, SAM-P8 stem cells present a significant expression decrease of patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 2, a receptor for PEDF (PNPLA2-PEDF) receptor, but not of laminin receptor (LR), a receptor for PEDF (LR-PEDF) receptor. We observed changes in self-renewal related genes (hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes5), Sox2] and report that although these genes are down-regulated in SAM-P8, differentiation genes (Pax6) are up-regulated and neurogenesis is increased. Finally, sheltering mammalian telomere complexes might be also involved given a down-regulation of telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (Terf1) expression was observed in SAM-P8 at young age periods.

In many extraneurally inoculated models of prion disease this PrPC misfolding event occurs in lymphoid tissues prior to neuroinvasion. The primary objective of this study was to compare levels of total PrPC in hamster lymphoid tissues involved in the early pathogenesis of prion disease. Lymphoid tissues were collected from golden Syrian hamsters and Western blot analysis was performed to quantify PrPC levels. PrPC immunohistochemistry (IHC) of paraffin embedded tissue sections was performed to identify PrPC distribution in tissues of the lymphoreticular system. Nasal associated lymphoid tissue contained the highest amount of total PrPC followed by Peyer’s patches, mesenteric and submandibular lymph nodes, and spleen. The relative levels of PrPC expression in IHC processed tissue correlated strongly with the Western blot data, with high levels of PrPC corresponding with a higher percentage of PrPC positive B cell follicles. High levels of PrPC in lymphoid tissues closely associated with the nasal cavity could contribute to the relative increased efficiency of the nasal route of entry of prions, compared to other routes of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1978463061,"Bordetella bronchiseptica is a pathogenic bacterium causing respiratory infections in a broad range of mammals. Recently, we determined the whole genome sequence of B. bronchiseptica S798 strain isolated from a pig infected with atrophic rhinitis and found four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions -129, -72, +22, and +38 in the region upstream of dnt encoding dermonecrotic toxin (DNT), when compared with a rabbit isolate, RB50. DNT is known to be involved in turbinate atrophy observed in atrophic rhinitis. Immunoblotting, quantitative real-time PCR, and β-galactosidase reporter assay revealed that these SNPs resulted in the increased promoter activity of dnt and conferred the increased ability to produce DNT on the bacteria. Similar or identical SNPs were also found in other pig isolates kept in our laboratory, all of which produce a larger amount of DNT than RB50. Our analysis revealed that substitution of at least two of the four bases, at positions -72 and +22, influenced the promoter activity for dnt. These results imply that these SNPs are involved in the pathogenicity of bordetellae specific to pig diseases."
