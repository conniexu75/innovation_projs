https://openalex.org/W2001648286,"Damaged mitochondria can be eliminated by autophagy, i.e. mitophagy, which is important for cellular homeostasis and cell survival. Despite the fact that a number of factors have been found to be important for mitophagy in mammalian cells, their individual roles in the process had not been clearly defined. Parkin is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase able to translocate to the mitochondria that are to be removed. We showed here in a chemical hypoxia model of mitophagy induced by an uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) that Parkin translocation resulted in mitochondrial ubiquitination and p62 recruitment to the mitochondria. Small inhibitory RNA-mediated knockdown of p62 significantly diminished mitochondrial recognition by the autophagy machinery and the subsequent elimination. Thus Parkin, ubiquitin, and p62 function in preparing mitochondria for mitophagy, here referred to as mitochondrial priming. However, these molecules were not required for the induction of autophagy machinery. Neither Parkin nor p62 seemed to affect autophagy induction by CCCP. Instead, we found that Nix was required for the autophagy induction. Nix promoted CCCP-induced mitochondrial depolarization and reactive oxygen species generation, which inhibited mTOR signaling and activated autophagy. Nix also contributed to mitochondrial priming by controlling the mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, although reactive oxygen species generation was not involved in this step. Deletion of the C-terminal membrane targeting sequence but not mutations in the BH3 domain disabled Nix for these functions. Our work thus distinguished the molecular events responsible for the different phases of mitophagy and placed Nix upstream of the events."
https://openalex.org/W2003563405,"Injury to the primary visual cortex (V1) leads to the loss of visual experience. Nonetheless, careful testing shows that certain visually guided behaviours can persist even in the absence of visual awareness. The neural circuits supporting this phenomenon, which is often termed blindsight, remain uncertain. Here we demonstrate that the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information. By comparing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioural measures with and without temporary LGN inactivation, we assessed the contribution of the LGN to visual functions of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with chronic V1 lesions. Before LGN inactivation, high-contrast stimuli presented to the lesion-affected visual field (scotoma) produced significant V1-independent fMRI activation in the extrastriate cortical areas V2, V3, V4, V5/middle temporal (MT), fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the animals correctly located the stimuli in a detection task. However, following reversible inactivation of the LGN in the V1-lesioned hemisphere, fMRI responses and behavioural detection were abolished. These results demonstrate that direct LGN projections to the extrastriate cortex have a critical functional contribution to blindsight. They suggest a viable pathway to mediate fast detection during normal vision."
https://openalex.org/W2170623915,"Large-conductance Ca(2+)-gated K(+) (BK) channels are essential for many biological processes such as smooth muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release. This group of channels can be activated synergistically by both voltage and intracellular Ca(2+), with the large carboxy-terminal intracellular portion being responsible for Ca(2+) sensing. Here we present the crystal structure of the entire cytoplasmic region of the human BK channel in a Ca(2+)-free state. The structure reveals four intracellular subunits, each comprising two tandem RCK domains, assembled into a gating ring similar to that seen in the MthK channel and probably representing its physiological assembly. Three Ca(2+) binding sites including the Ca(2+) bowl are mapped onto the structure based on mutagenesis data. The Ca(2+) bowl, located within the second RCK domain, forms an EF-hand-like motif and is strategically positioned close to the assembly interface between two subunits. The other two Ca(2+) (or Mg(2+)) binding sites, Asp 367 and Glu 374/Glu 399, are located on the first RCK domain. The Asp 367 site has high Ca(2+) sensitivity and is positioned in the groove between the amino- and carboxy-terminal subdomains of RCK1, whereas the low-affinity Mg(2+)-binding Glu 374/Glu 399 site is positioned on the upper plateau of the gating ring and close to the membrane. Our structure also contains the linker connecting the transmembrane and intracellular domains, allowing us to dock a voltage-gated K(+) channel pore of known structure onto the gating ring with reasonable accuracy and generate a structural model for the full BK channel."
https://openalex.org/W2123129285,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that regulate cell homeostasis by inhibiting translation or degrading mRNA of target genes, and thereby can act as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. The role of microRNAs in medulloblastoma has only recently been addressed. We hypothesized that microRNAs differentially expressed during normal CNS development might be abnormally regulated in medulloblastoma and are functionally important for medulloblastoma cell growth.We examined the expression of microRNAs in medulloblastoma and then investigated the functional role of one specific one, miR-128a, in regulating medulloblastoma cell growth. We found that many microRNAs associated with normal neuronal differentiation are significantly down regulated in medulloblastoma. One of these, miR-128a, inhibits growth of medulloblastoma cells by targeting the Bmi-1 oncogene. In addition, miR-128a alters the intracellular redox state of the tumor cells and promotes cellular senescence.Here we report the novel regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by microRNA 128a via the specific inhibition of the Bmi-1 oncogene. We demonstrate that miR-128a has growth suppressive activity in medulloblastoma and that this activity is partially mediated by targeting Bmi-1. This data has implications for the modulation of redox states in cancer stem cells, which are thought to be resistant to therapy due to their low ROS states."
https://openalex.org/W2021969219,"Increasing evidence has been provided for a connection between retinoid metabolism and the activity of peroxisome proliferator receptors (Ppars) in the control of body fat reserves. Two different precursors for retinoids exist in the diet as preformed vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) and provitamin A (β,β-carotene). For retinoid production, β,β-carotene is converted to retinaldehyde by β,β-carotene monooxygenase 1 (Bcmo1). Previous analysis showed that Bcmo1 knock-out mice develop dyslipidemia and are more susceptible to diet-induced obesity. However, the role of Bcmo1 for adipocyte retinoid metabolism has yet not been well defined. Here, we showed that Bcmo1 mRNA and protein expression are induced during adipogenesis in NIH 3T3-L1 cells. In mature adipocytes, β,β-carotene but not all-trans-retinol was metabolized to retinoic acid (RA). RA decreased the expression of Pparγ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, key lipogenic transcription factors, and reduced the lipid content of mature adipocytes. This process was inhibited by the retinoic acid receptor antagonist LE450, showing that it involves canonical retinoid signaling. Accordingly, gavage of β,β-carotene but not all-trans-retinol induced retinoid signaling and decreased Pparγ expression in white adipose tissue of vitamin A-deficient mice. Our study identifies β,β-carotene as a critical physiological precursor for RA production in adipocytes and implicates provitamin A as a dietary regulator of body fat reserves.

Among the many functions attributed to retinoids, its putative role in adipocyte biology and the regulation of body fat reserves have generated clinical and scientific interest (reviewed in Refs. 1Bonet M.L.

Rars are transcription factors that act in conjunction with retinoid X receptors (Rxrs) (17Petkovich M. Brand N.J. Krust A. Chambon P. Nature. 1987; 330: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) to regulate the expression of numerous target genes in response to RA binding. Additionally, some effects of RA appear to arise from the activation of Pparβ and -δ (8Berry D.C. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RA precursor retinaldehyde is present in fat in vivo and can inhibit Pparγ-induced adipogenesis (18Ziouzenkova O. Orasanu G. Sharlach M. Akiyama T.E. Berger J.P. Viereck J.

A prerequisite for the initiation of vitamin A-dependent physiological processes is the production of these biologically active retinoids from dietary precursors. Surprisingly, high dose supplementation with preformed vitamin A does not affect body adiposity in mice (19Felipe F. Bonet M.L. Ribot J. Palou A. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hence, it is yet not clear whether dietary vitamin A can influence physiological energy balance and fat storage. Besides preformed vitamin A, β,β-carotene (BC) is a dietary source for retinoids. BC is oxidatively converted to RAL by the action of BC monooxygenase 1 (Bcmo1), an enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the intestine, liver, and adipocytes (20Paik J. During A.

However, the roles and relationships of Bcmo1 and Pparγ in adipocyte biology and the regulation of fat reserves have yet to been further advanced. Recent studies in knock-out mice indicate that Bcmo1 is the key enzyme for vitamin A production (26Hessel S. Eichinger A. Isken A. Amengual J. Hunzelmann S. Hoeller U. Elste V. Hunziker W.

Importantly, these abnormalities were noted in Bcmo1-deficient mice well supplied with vitamin A, indicating an important role of Bcmo1 for the regulation of lipid metabolism. Here, we here analyzed the role of Bcmo1 for retinoid metabolism of adipocytes by using both the NIH 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell culture system and mouse models. All chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma. All reagents for cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) were purchased from Applied BioSystems (Foster City, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Invitrogen. The M-PER mammalian protein isolation reagent, BCA, Bradford protein assay kits, and the ECL reagents were purchased from Pierce. The triacylglycerol assay kit (catalog no. TG-1-NC) was purchased from Zen Bio (Research Triangle Park, NC). Primary antibodies against PPARγ and Fabp4/aP2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Primary antibody against Ras-regulated nuclear protein (Ran) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Mouse preadipocyte NIH 3T3-L1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To induce differentiation, 2 days after reaching confluence (day 0), cells were placed in differentiation media consisting of DMEM, 10% serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 0.25 mm dexamethasone for 3 days. On day 3, cells were incubated with DMEM containing 10% serum and 10 μg/ml insulin for 2 more days. Medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS, and cells were allowed to differentiate further. Stock solutions of BC, all-trans-retinol (ROL), and citral were prepared in appropriate reagents as suggested by the manufacturer (Sigma). BC was from Wild (Germany), and fenretinide was from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada). With the exception of citral (10 μm), all other metabolites were prepared at a final concentration of 2 μm in tetrahydrofuran (THF) for delivery to cells. Final concentrations of the solvent in cell culture media were always 0.1% (v/v). Control cells were treated with complete medium containing 0.1% THF (v/v). For experimental treatments, the appropriate metabolite was added to mature NIH 3T3-L1 cells in THF on day 5. Treated cells then were incubated for 24 h before harvesting. Harvested cells were either processed immediately for RNA, protein, or HPLC analyses or frozen at −80 °C until needed. For the RAR pan-antagonist LE540 experiment, mature NIH 3T3-L1 cells were pretreated with 1 μm of LE540 for 1 h prior to addition of BC (2 μm), and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. After harvesting, cells were processed for total RNA. mRNA expression of relevant genes was determined by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) with gene-specific probe sets (Applied BioSystems). RNA was isolated from mouse adipose tissue or cultured adipocytes (± indicated treatments) with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), purified by using the RNeasy system (Qiagen), and then quantified spectrophotometrically, as described previously (28Lobo G. Hessel S. Eichinger A. Noy N. Moise A.R. Wyss A. Palczewski K. von Lintig J. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). About 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit and following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied BioSystems). q-PCR was carried out with TaqMan chemistry, namely TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix and Assays on Demand probes (Applied BioSystems) for mouse Pparγ (Mm01184323_m1), mouse Bcmo1 (Mm00502437_m1), mouse Fabp4/aP2 (Mm0044588_m1), mouse C/Ebpα (Mm00514283_s1), mouse Cyp26a1 (Mm00514486_m1), mouse Raldh1 (Mm00657317_m1), and mouse Adh1 (Mm00507711_m1). The 18 S rRNA (4319413E) probe set (Applied BioSystems) was used as the endogenous control. All real time experiments were done with the Applied BioSystems Step-One Plus qRT-PCR machine. To control for between-sample variability, mRNA levels were normalized to 18 S rRNA for each sample by subtracting the Ct for 18 S rRNA from the Ct for the gene of interest, thereby producing a ΔCt value. The ΔCt for each treatment sample was compared with the mean ΔCt for control samples by using the relative quantitation 2−(ΔΔCt) method to determine fold-changes (Applied BioSystems Technical Bulletin No. 2). Total RNA was isolated from control or experimental NIH 3T3-L1 cells, and first-strand cDNA synthesis was achieved by using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied BioSystems). Semi-quantitative PCR was performed with primers as follows: mouse Fabp4/aP2 (adipocyte lipid-binding protein), 5′-GAACCTGGAAGCTTGTCTTCG-3′ and 5′-ACCAGCTTGTCACCATCTCG-3′; mouse Bcmo1, 5′-TGTTTCTGGAGCAGCCTTTT-3′ and 5′-CGTAGGCATTGACATGATGG-3′; mouse retinol saturase, 5′-TGCCAGATGTGAAGAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGGGGAATGTGTTCTGGA-3′; and mouse cyclophilin (Cyc) 5′-TCCAAAGACAGCAGAAAACTTTCG-3′ and 5′-TCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGCCATTCC-3′. The PCR program included denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 60 s (for a total of 25 cycles). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% (w/v) agarose gels. Total protein from mouse adipose tissue or cultured cells was isolated as described previously (28Lobo G. Hessel S. Eichinger A. Noy N. Moise A.R. Wyss A. Palczewski K. von Lintig J. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) at indicated time points by using the M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Appropriate adipose tissues were collected, rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mouse adipose tissue (∼100 mg) was then homogenized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and transferred directly into M-PER buffer (500 μl) containing protease inhibitors and further processed as outlined by the manufacturer (Pierce). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein content in the supernatant was determined by using either the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) reagent (Pierce) or the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (30–50 μg) were fractionated on 4–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with the Bio-Rad mini-gel system and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). Equal protein loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining and by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Ran. PVDF membranes were blocked by either 5% milk prepared in Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl, containing 0.05% Tween (TBS-T) or Super-block (Pierce) for 2–4 h and then immunoblotted with either anti-Pparγ, anti-FABP4/aP2, anti-Bcmo1 (1:1000 dilution), or anti-RAN antibody (1:5000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. After multiple washes with TBS-T, membranes were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature before being visualized with the ECL detection system (Pierce). Measurements of signal intensity on PVDF membranes after immunoblotting with various antibodies were performed by using an AlphaImager densitometer with the AlphaEaseFC image processing and analysis software (Alpha Innotech). For statistical analyses, all data were expressed as integrated density values, which were calculated as the density values of specific protein bands/RAN density values and expressed as percentages of the control. All figures showing quantitative analyses include data obtained from at least three independent experiments. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for a minimum of 1 h at room temperature, and then stained for 2 h with Oil Red-O solution (0.5% Oil Red-O in 100% isopropyl alcohol). After staining, cells were washed twice with PBS and visualized with an inverted microscope. Quantification of Oil Red-O stain from stained cells was performed by eluting the stain from cells with 1 ml of 100% isopropyl alcohol and then measuring the absorbance of the stain against a blank (100% isopropyl alcohol at 500 nm). This experiment was repeated three times and performed with at least four replicates per treatment. To determine the extent of lipid accumulation of experimental cells as compared with controls, we made use of the TG assay kit (Zen-Bio) and followed the manufacturer's instructions. The reagent allows measurement of the concentration of glycerol released after lysing the cells and hydrolyzing the TG molecules. The TG concentration can then be determined from the glycerol values. For this experiment, mature adipocytes were treated with either 0.1% THF (vehicle control) or test compounds for 24 h, and the free glycerol released was assayed by using the TG assay kit for NIH 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Zen-Bio) and following the manufacturer's instructions. The experiment was repeated twice with at least four replicates for each condition. Retinoids and carotenoids were extracted from serum under a dim red safety light (600 nm) as described previously (26Hessel S. Eichinger A. Isken A. Amengual J. Hunzelmann S. Hoeller U. Elste V.

Adipose tissue (∼40 mg) was incubated with 100 μl of 12% pyrogallol in ethanol, 200 μl of 30% KOH in water, and 1 ml of ethanol for 2 h at 37 °C. After saponification, 1 ml of H2O was added. Retinoids were extracted twice with 3 ml of ether/hexane (2:1, stabilized with 1% ethanol) and diluted with 2 ml of H2O and 2 ml ethanol. After centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g, the organic layer was collected. The extract was evaporated in a SpeedVac, and the residue was dissolved in HPLC solvent. For extraction of nonpolar and polar retinoids, 25 mg of NIH 3T3-L1 cells were homogenized in 200 μl of 2 m hydroxylamine (pH 6.8) and 400 μl of methanol. After 10 min, 10 μl of 5 m KOH were added. Nonpolar retinoids were extracted with 750 μl of hexane, and the organic phase was collected. Then 600 μl of 4 n HCl and 30 μl of saturated NaCl solution were added to the aqueous phase. After acidification, polar retinoids were extracted with 750 μl of hexane. Organic phases were dried in a SpeedVac. Polar retinoids were dissolved in HPLC solvent 1 (81% hexane, 19% ethyl acetate, 12.5 μl of acetic acid per 100 ml), and nonpolar retinoids and BC were dissolved in HPLC solvent 2 (99.5% hexane and 0.5% ethanol). HPLC separation of BC and different retinoids and quantification of peak integrals were performed as described previously (29von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Isken A. Holzschuh J. Lampert J.M. Fischer L. Oberhauser V. Palczewski K. von Lintig J. J. Biol.

The polar retinoid extract was injected onto a Zorbax Sil column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equilibrated with 81% hexane, 19% ethyl acetate, and 12.5 μl of acetic acid per 100 ml. The eluant was directed into LXQ mass spectrometer through an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) working in a positive mode. Retinoic acid was identified based on its molecular mass (m/z = 301 [MH]+) and a fragmentation pattern of the parent ion identical with that of a synthetic standard (Sigma). Recombinant Bcmo1 was expressed in Escherichia coli. Protein preparation and tests for enzymatic activity were conducted as described previously (31Oberhauser V. Voolstra O. Bangert A. von Lintig J. Vogt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19000-19005Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fenretinide (FHR) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemical (Toronto, Canada) and was dissolved in ethanol and delivered together with the BC substrate in n-octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside micelles (3% w/v). Animal experiments were performed in accordance with United States animal protection laws by the guidelines of the local veterinary authorities. The lecithin-retinol acyltransferase-deficient mice (Lrat−/−) were kept in a room with controlled conditions (24 °C, 12:12-h light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. In the first experiment, 8-week-old Lrat−/− mice (n = 5 animals per group) were fed for 3 weeks with a vitamin A-sufficient diet, containing 15,000 IU/kg or vitamin A-deficient diet (VAD) (AIN-93G Growing Rodent Diet With or without Added vitamin A; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). After this period, animals were sacrificed, and the liver and inguinal white adipose tissues (iWAT) were excised in their entirety, weighed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. To analyze the effects of BC on iWAT, Lrat−/− mice were fed for 10 days with the VAD diet based on a AIN-93G formulation (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). HPLC analysis revealed that BC was below detection levels in this diet (data not shown). After this period, animals (n = 3 per group) were gavaged one time with 0.5 mg of BC (DSM Nutritional Products, Sisseln, Switzerland) or 0.5 mg of ROL (Sigma) dissolved in 100 μl of corn oil. As control, animals were gavaged with vehicle only. After 24 h, animals were sacrificed, and the liver and iWAT were removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further analyses. In an additional experiment, Lrat−/− mice were fed for 10 days with the VAD diet. The animals (n = 5 per group) were gavaged three times, 24 h apart, with 0.5 mg of BC (DSM Nutritional Products, Sisseln, Switzerland) or 0.5 mg of ROL (Sigma) dissolved in 100 μl of corn oil. After 24 h, animals were sacrificed, and the liver and iWAT were removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further analyses. In all experiments, animals had free access to water and food and were sacrificed in the fed state. Mouse adipose tissues were fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and processed routinely into paraffin blocks, and representative histological sections (10 μm) of each specimen were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Merck) according to the described standard staining protocol being used at the Histology Core Facility (Institute of Pathology, Visual Sciences Research Center, University Hospitals, Cleveland, OH). Images were collected through an Olympus BX 60 microscope equipped with a ×20 objective and a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Adipocyte images then were analyzed with Metamorph Imaging Software (Molecular Devices, Downington, PA). Approximately 600 individual adipocytes were sized per condition. Average areas of adipocytes are expressed in square microns. Results are presented as means ± S.D., and the number of experiments is indicated in the figure legends. For each experiment, all determinations were performed at least in triplicate. Statistical significance was assessed by using the two-tailed Student's t test. The murine Bcmo1 promoter contains a DR1-type peroxisome proliferator-response element (supplemental Fig. S1A) that binds Pparγ/Rxr heterodimers (23Boulanger A. McLemore P. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Yu S.S. Gentleman S. Redmond T.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), prompting us to examine expression patterns of Bcmo1 during adipocyte differentiation in the well established mouse NIH 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell culture model. Adipocyte differentiation was monitored by using Oil Red-O staining to assess lipid accumulation (supplemental Fig. S1B) and by following the mRNA expression of adipose marker genes, i.e. Pparγ, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FabP4/aP2), and retinol saturase (RetSat). Semi-quantitative PCR analysis revealed that Bcmo1 mRNA expression increased during adipocyte differentiation and achieved maximal levels in mature NIH 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1A). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that Bcmo1 mRNA levels were 5-fold elevated in mature adipocytes as compared with preadipocytes (supplemental Fig. S1C). Immunoblotting revealed a 7-fold increase of Bcmo1 at the protein level upon adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1D). Thus, as expected for a Pparγ-inducible target gene, Bcmo1 expression increased during adipocyte differentiation at both the mRNA and protein levels. We next tested whether the Bcmo1 substrate BC can impact adipocyte biology by treating mature NIH 3T3-L1 adipocytes with either 2.0 μm BC or vehicle alone (control cells). Additionally, cells were treated with 2 μm ROL, the other circulating precursor of biologically active retinoids. After 24 h, cells were fixed, and Oil Red-O staining for lipids was performed. BC-treated cells showed less staining for lipids compared with ROL-treated and control cells (Fig. 1C). Microscopic inspection revealed that lipid droplets were reduced in size and number in BC-treated compared with control or ROL-treated cells (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Spectrophotometric quantification indicated that BC-treated cells displayed a 2.8-fold reduced staining with Oil Red-O compared with nontreated and ROL-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S1E). Likewise, the triacylglycerol (TG) content of adipocytes was 2.7-fold reduced upon BC but not ROL treatment of these differentiated cells (Fig. 1D). Our study showed that BC can reduce TG content in mature NIH 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To discriminate between the effects of parent BC and its retinoid derivatives, we needed a highly selective inhibitor of Bcmo1 enzymatic activity. Positively charged retinoids such as retinylamine selectively block the activity of the retinoid isomerase Rpe65 (32Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that is structurally related to Bcmo1. Retinylamine can be converted to retinylamides (33Golczak M. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V.

A compound that combines the chemical properties of retinylamine and aromatic amides is FHR. To test whether FHR inhibits Bcmo1 activity, we expressed murine Bcmo1 in E. coli and delivered BC in n-octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside micelles. Recombinant Bcmo1 metabolized BC to RAL, and the reaction was linear for 10 min (Fig. 2A). We then delivered BC in n-octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside micelles in the presence of increasing amounts of FHR. As shown in Fig. 2B, FHR inhibited the activity of recombinant Bcmo1 in a dose-dependent manner. So we the"

https://openalex.org/W2061443977,"Dramatic changes in gene expression occur in response to extracellular stimuli and during differentiation. Although transcriptional effects are important, alterations in mRNA decay also play a major role in achieving rapid and massive changes in mRNA abundance. Moreover, just as transcription factor activity varies between different cell types, the factors influencing mRNA decay are also cell-type specific.We have established the rates of decay for over 7000 transcripts expressed in mouse C2C12 myoblasts. We found that GU-rich (GRE) and AU-rich (ARE) elements are over-represented in the 3'UTRs of short-lived mRNAs and that these mRNAs tend to encode factors involved in cell cycle and transcription regulation. Stabilizing elements were also identified. By comparing mRNA decay rates in C2C12 cells with those previously measured for pluripotent and differentiating embryonic stem (ES) cells, we identified several groups of transcripts that exhibit cell-type specific decay rates. Further, whereas in C2C12 cells the impact of GREs on mRNA decay appears to be greater than that of AREs, AREs are more significant in ES cells, supporting the idea that cis elements make a cell-specific contribution to mRNA stability. GREs are recognized by CUGBP1, an RNA-binding protein and instability factor whose function is affected in several neuromuscular diseases. We therefore utilized RNA immunoprecipitation followed by microarray (RIP-Chip) to identify CUGBP1-associated transcripts. These mRNAs also showed dramatic enrichment of GREs in their 3'UTRs and encode proteins linked with cell cycle, and intracellular transport. Interestingly several CUGBP1 substrate mRNAs, including those encoding the myogenic transcription factors Myod1 and Myog, are also bound by the stabilizing factor HuR in C2C12 cells. Finally, we show that several CUGBP1-associated mRNAs containing 3'UTR GREs, including Myod1, are stabilized in cells depleted of CUGBP1, consistent with the role of CUGBP1 as a destabilizing factor.Taken together, our results systematically establish cis-acting determinants of mRNA decay rates in C2C12 myoblast cells and demonstrate that CUGBP1 associates with GREs to regulate decay of a wide range of mRNAs including several that are critical for muscle development."
https://openalex.org/W2154598471,"Influenza viruses of the H2N2 subtype have not circulated among humans in over 40 years. The occasional isolation of avian H2 strains from swine and avian species coupled with waning population immunity to H2 hemagglutinin (HA) warrants investigation of this subtype due to its pandemic potential. In this study we examined the transmissibility of representative human H2N2 viruses, A/Albany/6/58 (Alb/58) and A/El Salvador/2/57 (ElSalv/57), isolated during the 1957/58 pandemic, in the ferret model. The receptor binding properties of these H2N2 viruses was analyzed using dose-dependent direct glycan array-binding assays. Alb/58 virus, which contains the 226L/228S amino acid combination in the HA and displayed dual binding to both alpha 2,6 and alpha 2,3 glycan receptors, transmitted efficiently to naïve ferrets by respiratory droplets. Inefficient transmission was observed with ElSalv/57 virus, which contains the 226Q/228G amino acid combination and preferentially binds alpha 2,3 over alpha 2,6 glycan receptors. However, a unique transmission event with the ElSalv/57 virus occurred which produced a 226L/228G H2N2 natural variant virus that displayed an increase in binding specificity to alpha 2,6 glycan receptors and enhanced respiratory droplet transmissibility. Our studies provide a correlation between binding affinity to glycan receptors with terminal alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid and the efficiency of respiratory droplet transmission for pandemic H2N2 influenza viruses."

In the present study we directly probe for the accessibility of cholesterol in purified ER membranes. Using a soluble cholesterol-binding bacterial toxin, perfringolysin O, we show that cholesterol accessibility increases abruptly at ∼5 mol % ER cholesterol, the same concentration at which SREBP-2 activation is halted. This switch-like change in cholesterol accessibility is observed not only in purified ER membranes but also in liposomes made from ER lipid extracts.

https://openalex.org/W1982226368,"Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, activates receptors coupled to membrane depolarization and Ca(2+) influx that mediates functional responses of neurons including processes such as learning and memory. Here we show that reversible nuclear oxidative DNA damage occurs in cerebral cortical neurons in response to transient glutamate receptor activation using non-toxic physiological levels of glutamate. This DNA damage was prevented by intracellular Ca(2+) chelation, the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTMPyP (Mn-5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphine chloride tetrakis(methochloride)), and blockade of the permeability transition pore. The repair of glutamate-induced DNA damage was associated with increased DNA repair activity and increased mRNA and protein levels of apurinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). APE1 knockdown induced accumulation of oxidative DNA damage after glutamate treatment, suggesting that APE1 is a key repair protein for glutamate-induced DNA damage. A cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding sequence is present in the Ape1 gene (encodes APE1 protein) promoter and treatment of neurons with a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor (KN-93) blocked the ability of glutamate to induce CREB phosphorylation and APE1 expression. Selective depletion of CREB using RNA interference prevented glutamate-induced up-regulation of APE1. Thus, glutamate receptor stimulation triggers Ca(2+)- and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-mediated DNA damage that is then rapidly repaired by a mechanism involving Ca(2+)-induced, CREB-mediated APE1 expression. Our findings reveal a previously unknown ability of neurons to efficiently repair oxidative DNA lesions after transient activation of glutamate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1972257514,"Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a site-specific modification of RNA transcripts, catalyzed by members of the ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA) protein family. RNA editing occurs in human RNA in thousands of different sites. Some of the sites are located in protein-coding regions but the majority is found in non-coding regions, such as 3′UTRs, 5′UTRs and introns - mainly in Alu elements. While editing is found in all tissues, the highest levels of editing are found in the brain. It was shown that editing levels within protein-coding regions are increased during embryogenesis and after birth and that RNA editing is crucial for organism viability as well as for normal development. In this study we characterized the A-to-I RNA editing phenomenon during neuronal and spontaneous differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We identified high editing levels of Alu repetitive elements in hESCs and demonstrated a global decrease in editing levels of non-coding Alu sites when hESCs are differentiating, particularly into the neural lineage. Using RNA interference, we showed that the elevated editing levels of Alu elements in undifferentiated hESCs are highly dependent on ADAR1. DNA microarray analysis showed that ADAR1 knockdown has a global effect on gene expression in hESCs and leads to a significant increase in RNA expression levels of genes involved in differentiation and development processes, including neurogenesis. Taken together, we speculate that A-to-I editing of Alu sequences plays a role in the regulation of hESC early differentiation decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2056491325,"Glyco-lipopeptides, a form of lipid-tailed glyco-peptide, are currently under intense investigation as B- and T-cell based vaccine immunotherapy for many cancers. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of glyco-lipopeptides (GLPs) immunogenicity and the position of the lipid moiety on immunogenicity and protective efficacy of GLPs remain to be determined.We have constructed two structural analogues of HER-2 glyco-lipopeptide (HER-GLP) by synthesizing a chimeric peptide made of one universal CD4(+) epitope (PADRE) and one HER-2 CD8(+) T-cell epitope (HER(420-429)). The C-terminal end of the resulting CD4-CD8 chimeric peptide was coupled to a tumor carbohydrate B-cell epitope, based on a regioselectively addressable functionalized templates (RAFT), made of four alpha-GalNAc molecules. The resulting HER glyco-peptide (HER-GP) was then linked to a palmitic acid moiety, attached either at the N-terminal end (linear HER-GLP-1) or in the middle between the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes (branched HER-GLP-2). We have investigated the uptake, processing and cross-presentation pathways of the two HER-GLP vaccine constructs, and assessed whether the position of linkage of the lipid moiety would affect the B- and T-cell immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Immunization of mice revealed that the linear HER-GLP-1 induced a stronger and longer lasting HER(420-429)-specific IFN-gamma producing CD8(+) T cell response, while the branched HER-GLP-2 induced a stronger tumor-specific IgG response. The linear HER-GLP-1 was taken up easily by dendritic cells (DCs), induced stronger DCs maturation and produced a potent TLR- 2-dependent T-cell activation. The linear and branched HER-GLP molecules appeared to follow two different cross-presentation pathways. While regression of established tumors was induced by both linear HER-GLP-1 and branched HER-GLP-2, the inhibition of tumor growth was significantly higher in HER-GLP-1 immunized mice (p<0.005).These findings have important implications for the development of effective GLP based immunotherapeutic strategies against cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1980013500,"Patients with diabetes suffer disproportionately from impaired lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease, but the relevant roles of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in these processes are unclear. Transcription factor FoxO1 is regulated dually by insulin and nutrients. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that, in addition to its established role to regulate hepatic glucose production, FoxO1 controls aspects of lipid metabolism in the diabetic liver. Mice with a liver-specific deletion of FoxO1 (l-FoxO1) and their control littermates were rendered hyperglycemic by streptozotocin administration. Subsequently, we monitored serum lipids, liver VLDL secretion, and hepatic expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. Hepatic FoxO1 ablation resulted in increased VLDL secretion, increased cholesterol, and increased plasma free fatty acids, three hallmarks of the diabetic state. l-FoxO1 mice expressed increased levels of SREBP-2 and FGF21 without affecting lipogenic genes. We propose that FoxO1 fine tunes lipolysis through its actions on FGF21 and that hepatic FoxO1 ablation increases availability of substrates for hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis and VLDL secretion. The implications of these findings are that FoxO1 protects against excessive hepatic lipid production during hyperglycemia and that its inhibition by intensive insulin treatment may exacerbate paradoxically the lipid abnormalities of diabetes.

Alterations of lipid metabolism are an integral part of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes and can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases (1Nathan D.M. Cleary P.A. Backlund J.Y.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a 2–4-fold increase in their lifetime risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and heart disease is the leading cause of death among diabetics (2Sobel B.E. Am. J. Med. 2007; 120: S3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The primary abnormalities of lipid metabolism in diabetes are increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, and increased plasma triglyceride (TG) 2The abbreviations used are: TGtriglycerideNEFAnonesterified fatty acidChREBPcarbohydrate response element binding proteinLXRliver X receptorPPARαperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. and cholesterol in atherogenic lipoprotein fractions, due in part to excessive secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by the liver (3Savage D.B. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how insulin resistance and diabetes affect the development of these defects. Two mutually nonexclusive causes have been proposed: insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Delineating the relative roles of these two states has been difficult because they typically coexist, although increased TG and VLDL can be observed in insulin-resistant humans long before the development of hyperglycemia (4Lewis G.F. Steiner G. Diabetes Care. 1996; 19: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most prospective studies indicate that tight glucose control has little benefit, or possible untoward effects, on macrovascular complications of diabetes (5Gerstein H.C. Miller M.E.

Res. 2005; 36: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). But the mechanism by which insulin resistance affects hepatic lipid metabolism remains elusive. In recent years, a consensus has emerged, indicating that insulin regulates hepatic lipid synthesis through transcription factor SREBP-1c, and glucose production through transcription factor FoxO1 (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 95-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 8Haeusler R.A. Accili D.

The forkhead protein FoxO1 is regulated by both insulin (through phosphorylation-dependent inactivation) and high glucose (through deacetylation-dependent activation) to promote or repress gene expression, providing a metabolic sensor linking the nutritional status of the cell to regulation of gene expression (9Accili D. Arden K.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Accordingly, liver-specific FoxO1 knock-out mice (l-FoxO1) show increased glucose disposal and reduced hepatic glucose production during hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamps and hypoglycemia following a prolonged fast (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The role of FoxO1 in lipid metabolism has been less clear. Gain-of-function experiments have yielded conflicting results (11Kamagate A. Qu S. Perdomo G. Su D. Kim D.H. Slusher S. Meseck M. Dong H.H.

Hepatic loss-of-function experiments have been notable for the lack of effects on lipid metabolism genes (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D.

Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 65-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress leads to FoxO1 activation by targeting it to nuclear PML bodies by way of an acetylation-dependent mechanism (15Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that the effect of FoxO1 in lipid metabolism might only become apparent in hyperglycemic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we used streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes in liver-specific FoxO1 knock-out (l-FoxO1) and control mice, generating a model of diabetes where both glucose and insulin levels were similar between the two genotypes, minimizing these as potential confounders. Unexpectedly, we found that hyperglycemic l-FoxO1 animals have high serum TG, cholesterol, and FFA and increased VLDL secretion from the liver. We provide a mechanism suggesting that the effect of FoxO1 ablation is due to increased FGF21 secretion from the liver, acting in turn to promote elevation of FFAs in vivo (16Inagaki T. Dutchak P.

Male mice, with an average age of 14–20 weeks, were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a dose of 225 mg/kg or a similar volume of 0.9% saline. The Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experiments. Colorimetric assay kits included TG (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), β-hydroxybutyrate (Stanbio, Boerne, TX), cholesterol E, and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs; Wako, Richmond, VA). The OneTouch glucose monitor and strips were from LifeScan (Milpitas, CA). “HI” glucose measurements were read in 7 of 38 mice ad libitum fed and 1 of 32 overnight fasted STZ-treated control mice as well as 2 of 57 ad libitum fed and 5 of 10 refed STZ-treated l-FoxO1 mice; these were treated as 600 mg/dl. Serum glucagon was measured at the St. Luke's Hormone and Metabolite Core by radioimmunoassay (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For fasting serum lipids, measurements from untreated and saline-treated mice were combined, as there were no differences due to saline. Liver lipid content (n = 5–7) was measured by Folch extraction (17Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol.

TG production was measured by intravenous injection of Triton WR 1339 (Tyloxapol, Sigma) at 500 mg/kg followed by serum collection at 1 and 2 h post-injection. Post-Triton serum samples were separated by density ultracentrifugation as described (19Han S. Liang C.P. Westerterp M. Senokuchi T. Welch C.L. Wang Q. Matsumoto M. Accili D. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1029-1041PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue for apoB visualization. Bands were quantitated using Image J software. Total RNA from liver was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and RNA from perigonadal white adipose tissue was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III (Invitrogen), and quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate with 5–9 mice per group using SyBr Green (New England Biolabs) in a Bio-Rad Peltier thermal cycler (96 well). All genes are normalized to 18 S. qPCR primer sequences are available in supplemental Table S2, with the exception of liver pyruvate kinase, which was purchased from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD). Rabbit anti-LDL receptor (LDLR) was a gift from Jay Horton. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by either two-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey tests, or two-tailed Student's t tests, where appropriate. To identify the effects of FoxO1 knock-out on lipid metabolism, we first analyzed serum lipid levels (Fig. 1, A–C) after an overnight fast and a subsequent 4-h refeeding period in untreated mice (n ≥ 19 for fasting and n ≥ 6 for refeeding). In control mice, refeeding caused an increase in serum TG, a decline in cholesterol, and a large reduction in NEFAs. We obtained similar results in l-FoxO1 mice, indicating that FoxO1-ablated animals can respond normally to fasting-feeding regulation of lipid metabolism, similar to what has been observed previously (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). To determine whether hyperglycemia affected this response, we injected WT control and l-FoxO1 littermates with a single high dose of STZ. One week after STZ injection, both control and l-FoxO1 mice exhibited insulin levels below the limit of detection and few, if any, insulin-positive islet cells (data not shown). There were no differences in fasting serum glucagon levels between control and l-FoxO1 animals (75.5 ± 9.7 pg/ml versus 74.9 ± 10.3 pg/ml, respectively). As expected, STZ-treated animals from both genotypes were found to be hyperglycemic in fed and fasted states (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, l-FoxO1 mice showed lower glucose levels after a 5-h fast, consistent with the established role of FoxO1 in promoting glucose production (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). STZ-treated control and l-FoxO1 mice were fasted overnight and refed for 4 h, and serum lipids were analyzed (Fig. 1, A–C) (n ≥ 16 for fasting and n ≥ 6 for refeeding). In control mice, STZ treatment had little effect on fasted or refed serum TG, but, in l-FoxO1 mice, STZ treatment caused TG to rise to a level 60% higher than control animals during the fasted state (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 for the interaction of l-FoxO1 and STZ). TG in l-FoxO1 remained 60% higher than control after refeeding. Fasting cholesterol levels rose similarly in both genotypes in response to STZ (p < 0.05). However, after refeeding, serum cholesterol declined in control animals, similar to what we observed in untreated mice, but failed to do so in l-FoxO1 mice, such that levels were 40% higher in l-FoxO1 (p < 0.01). Fasting serum NEFA were increased only marginally due to STZ in control mice but were significantly higher, by 60%, in STZ l-FoxO1 mice compared with controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01 for the interaction of l-FoxO1 and STZ). Refed NEFAs were significantly elevated in STZ-treated mice of both genotypes (p < 0.01) but were still significantly higher in l-FoxO1 compared with control (p < 0.01). The increases in serum lipids were not associated with lipid accumulation in the liver, as STZ treatment greatly reduced liver TG content in both genotypes, as reported previously (20Matsuzaka T. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Tomita S. Sekiya M. Hasty A. Nakagawa Y. Sone H. Toyoshima H. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yamada N. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and had only a modest effect on liver cholesterol, which also was similar between the two genotypes (Fig. 1, E–F). Overall, STZ-treated mice of both genotypes were able to initiate lipid metabolic responses to refeeding, with the exception of the serum cholesterol in l-FoxO1 mice, which did not decline as it did in the other three groups. These responses should be regulated by both glucose and the trace amounts of insulin remaining after STZ. During fasting, the differences between control and l-FoxO1 mice are magnified, consistent with the expectation that in the fasted state hyperglycemic, hypoinsulinemic control mice have active nuclear FoxO1 in hepatocytes, whereas l-FoxO1 mice do not. To investigate the difference in fasting TG between hyperglycemic control and l-FoxO1 mice, we performed a less prolonged 5-h fast on STZ-treated mice and subjected pooled serum samples to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) to analyze lipoprotein distribution. As shown in Fig. 2A, the VLDL fraction in l-FoxO1 animals contained a nearly 2-fold increase of TG compared with control animals. Thus, the difference in total serum TG can be primarily accounted for by the VLDL fraction. Cholesterol levels in the 5-h fasted state were similar between knock-out and control mice (Fig. 2B). Serum FFAs in the 5-h fasted state were increased in l-FoxO1 compared with control (0.89±.04 meq/l versus 0.73±.04 meq/l, respectively; p < 0.05). We wanted to determine whether the increase in TG levels was due to increased production or decreased uptake by the liver. To this end, we used tail-vein injection of Triton WR 1339 to block lipoprotein clearance from the circulation, and measured accumulation of serum TG and apolipoprotein B (apoB), the apoprotein required for hepatic VLDL assembly. Using similar methods, several previous studies have found that STZ treatment alone causes minimal changes in TG and apoB production (21Reaven E.P. Reaven G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 1167-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi T. Hirano T. Okada K. Adachi M.

Huang L.S. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1674-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We found that hyperglycemic l-FoxO1 mice secreted significantly more TG than hyperglycemic control animals (Fig. 2C). We separated individual serum samples from the final (2-h) time point after Triton WR 1339 injection using density ultracentrifugation into VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions. We found higher TG, cholesterol, apoB100 and apoB48 levels in post-Triton serum VLDL fractions from l-FoxO1 mice, compared with controls (Fig. 2, D–G). These data indicate that hypertriglyceridemia in l-FoxO1 mice is due to increased production of apoB-containing VLDL by the liver. FoxO1 is capable of exerting both positive and negative transcriptional regulation (24Buteau J. Shlien A. Foisy S. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs 3rd, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J.

Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because the mutation in these hyperlipidemic mice was liver-specific, we hypothesized that the primary cause of the defect in hyperglycemic l-FoxO1 was aberrant expression of lipogenic genes in liver. Thus, we measured mRNA levels of lipogenic genes in hyperglycemic control and l-FoxO1 mice. The SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein)-1c transcription factor regulates lipogenesis by promoting transcription of genes in the TG biosynthetic pathway (27Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3708) Google Scholar). Although Srebp-1c expression is known to decline dramatically due to STZ treatment (28Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 29Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we found that Srebp-1c mRNA was 5-fold higher in fasted, hyperglycemic l-FoxO1 mice compared with similarly treated controls (Table 1) but not under basal fasting conditions (supplemental Table S1 and (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar)). Increased Srebp-1c mRNA is not necessarily predictive of increased target gene transcription, as SREBP proteins must be activated post-translationally (30McPherson R. Gauthier A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); thus, we measured expression of several SREBP-1c target genes (Table 1). Although fatty acid synthase showed a 75% increase in l-FoxO1 mice (p < 0.05), overall SREBP-1c target genes failed to show large or statistically significant increases in expression. Furthermore, transgenic expression of SREBP-1c in liver that increases expression of Acc, fatty acid synthase, and Scd1 more robustly than this model (2–4-fold) fails to increase, and indeed decreases, plasma TG, while markedly increasing hepatic TG accumulation (31Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Thus, it did not appear that the level of Srebp-1c we observed could explain the elevation in TG secretion. The apparent discrepancy between elevated Srebp-1c expression and activity was examined by measuring the expression of Insig-1, -2a, and -2b, inhibitors of the SREBP-1c chaperone Scap (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) that is required for transport of SREBP proteins out of the endoplasmic reticulum and into the Golgi for cleavage and activation. Insig proteins normally bind Scap under conditions of high cholesterol, although high Insig expression can lower the threshold for association (32Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Three Insig transcripts have been identified: Insig-1 levels are high in fed animals, and its transcription is promoted by SREBPs; Insig-2a levels are high during fasting, and its transcription is repressed by insulin; and Insig-2b transcription is not known to be regulated by fasting and feeding (29Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We measured Insig expression in STZ-treated mice and found that in the fasted state all three Insig transcripts were significantly up-regulated in l-FoxO1 mice (Table 1). The large increase in Insig levels is consistent with Scap inhibition and subsequent SREBP-1c endoplasmic reticulum retention, despite elevated mRNA expression. There were no significant differences in Insig-2a expression in untreated l-FoxO1 compared with controls (supplemental Table S1).TABLE 1Expression of SREBP-1c, LXR, and ChREBP pathways in liverSTZ-treated, fastedSTZ-treated, refedControll-FoxO1Controll-FoxO1Srebp-1c1 ± 0.145.16 ± 0.58ap < 0.01.7.88 ± 2.2112.54 ± 1.23Acc11 ± 0.080.89 ± 0.030.94 ± 0.040.98 ± 0.07Acc21 ± 0.370.51 ± 0.06bp < 0.05.0.95 ± 0.190.54 ± .06bp < 0.05.FAS1 ± 0.201.72 ± 0.16ap < 0.01.4.21 ± 0.585.15 ± 0.79Scd11 ± 0.392.90 ± 0.553.05 ± 1.242.30 ± 0.71Acss21 ± 0.091.1 ± 0.101.21 ± 0.131.46 ± 0.15Gpam1 ± 0.101.52 ± 0.142.06 ± 0.311.84 ± 0.21Insig-11 ± 0.262.82 ± 0.47ap < 0.01.4.99 ± 1.987.20 ± 1.05Insig-2a1 ± 0.293.38 ± 0.53ap < 0.01.1.53 ± 0.320.68 ± 0.15bp < 0.05.Insig-2b1 ± 0.181.66 ± 0.08ap < 0.01.1.95 ± 0.311.72 ± 0.12LXRα1 ± 0.021.07 ± 0.051.40 ± 0.171.61 ± 0.06Abcg51 ± 0.221.36 ± 0.240.88 ± 0.130.51 ± 0.02ap < 0.01.Abcg81 ± 0.321.35 ± 0.260.77 ± 0.190.34 ± 0.04bp < 0.05.ChREBP1 ± 0.150.98 ± 0.080.87 ± 0.170.81 ± 0.12l-pk1 ± 0.151.47 ± 0.181.84 ± 0.371.94 ± 0.16a p < 0.01.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Having excluded a major contribution of the SREBP-1c pathway to hypertriglyceridemia in this model, we examined other pathways. The liver X receptor (LXR) is a sterol-sensing nuclear receptor that can promote lipogenic gene expression by heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor and binding to LXR response elements. Although the induction of lipogenesis in response to LXR is executed largely by SREBP-1c, mice lacking SREBP-1c still can respond to LXR stimulation, leaving room for alternative effectors. To test the contribution of LXR to the observed phenotype, we measured expression of LXRα and its SREBP-independent targets. Neither LXRα nor its liver target genes, the cholesterol transporters Abcg5 and -8, were up-regulated (Table 1), indicating that LXR is not responsible for the lipid phenotype in these mice. Notably, both Abcg5 and -8 were significantly down-regulated in refed l-FoxO1 mice, consistent with their identification as direct FoxO1 targets (33Biddinger S.B. Haas J.T. Yu B.B. Bezy O. Jing E. Zhang W. Unterman T.G. Carey M.C. Kahn C.R. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A third chief regulator of lipid synthesis is the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), which is activated by glucose and also is a target of LXR. However, ChREBP mRNA was not different between l-FoxO1 and control animals (Table 1), and the small increase in liver pyruvate kinase, a ChREBP-specific target gene, did not reach significance. Thus, ChREBP is unlikely to be the cause of the excess lipids in this model. Dgat1, Dgat2, and apoB are involved in TG synthesis but are not regulated at the gene expression level by the three transcriptional pathways mentioned above (supplemental Table S1). However, overexpression of Dgat1 or Dgat2 in liver, even at high levels, does not increase TG or apoB production (34Monetti M. Levin M.C. Watt M.J. Sajan M.P. Marmor S. Hubbard B.K. Stevens R.D.

Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The absence of any large changes in SREBP-1c, LXR, or ChREBP pathways suggested the possibility that a different metabolic network was influencing lipid production in hyperglycemic l-FoxO1 mice. Although we expect that these pathways are still functional to mediate the refeeding response in this STZ model, where the FA and TG synthesis genes are up-regulated (Table 1) and serum TG rise (Fig. 1A), we find that differences in expression of these genes fails to explain the effect of FoxO1 ablation on fasting serum TGs or TG production. SREBP-2 promotes expression of cholesterol synthetic genes (27Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3708) Google Scholar) and is potentially able to substitute for SREBP-1c in the absence of the latter (37Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We observed a 60% increase in Srebp-2 mRNA in l-FoxO1 in the refed state (p < 0.05) and a similar trend in the fasted state. Consistent with this finding, all tested SREBP-2 target genes were up-regulated in l-FoxO1 mice compared with control mice (Table 2), particularly in the refed state. SREBP-2 is also post-translationally regulated by Scap and Insigs; thus, the considerable decline of Insig-2a in refed l-FoxO1 mice (see Table 1) may contribute to the ability of SREBP-2 to promote expression of its target genes in that condition. Furthermore, the stability of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, is regulated directly by Insigs (32Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), such that a down-regulation of Insig-2a in the refed state might lead directly to increased cholesterol production. An important transcriptional target of SREBP-2 is the LDLR. We found no defect in LDLR mRNA expression; if anything, LDLR mRNA was increased slightly (p = 0.065 and 0.054 in fasted and refed states, respectively), similar to other SREBP-2 target genes (Table 2), nor did we find any decrease in LDLR protein levels (Fig. 3). This suggests that defective lipoprotein clearance via LDLR is unlikely to be the cause of serum lipoprotein accumulation. Overall, the up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthetic genes is consistent with the elevated serum cholesterol but is not sufficient to explain the increased TG synthesis.TABLE 2Expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in liverSTZ-treated, fastedSTZ-treated, refedControll-FoxO1Controll-FoxO1Srebp-21 ± 0.301.78 ± 0.231.54"

IntroductionPrion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders in which a normal, cell surface glycoprotein called PrPC 2The abbreviations used are: PrPprion proteinPrPCcellular isoform of PrPPrPScscrapie isoform of PrPCRcentral regionPPSpentosan polysulfateNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineTEAtetraethylammonium. is converted into PrPSc, a conformationally altered isoform that propagates itself by a molecular templating mechanism (1Prusiner S.B.

Although much is now understood about how infectious prions propagate, the mechanisms by which neurotoxic forms of PrP kill nerve cells remain enigmatic (3Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, membrane-bound PrPC appears to play a crucial role in mediating the neurotoxicity of PrPSc. It has been proposed that interactions with PrPSc during the conversion process may alter a normal, physiological activity of PrPC, resulting in the transmission of a neurotoxic signal (4Harris D.A. True H.L. Neuron. 2006; 50: 353-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying the normal function of PrPC is important for understanding the mechanism of prion-induced neurodegeneration. However, the function of PrPC remains unclear because mice lacking this protein display no overt phenotype (5Büeler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H.P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M.

Each of these mice displays a neurodegenerative phenotype that is dose-dependently suppressed by co-expression of wild-type (WT) PrP, suggesting an antagonistic relationship between the normal activity of PrPC and the neurotoxic effects of the deletion mutants. We have found that mice expressing the smallest of the deletions (Δ105–125 or ΔCR for central region) display the most dramatic phenotype, characterized by neonatal lethality with massive degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons and vacuolar degeneration of white matter regions of the brain and spinal cord. ΔCR PrP is neither aggregated nor protease-resistant, and its cellular localization is identical to that of wild-type PrP (10Li A. Christensen H.M. Stewart L.R. Roth K.A. Chiesa R. Harris D.A.

Thus, the neurotoxicity of ΔCR PrP is likely to be due to an alteration in a physiological activity of PrPC rather than to the formation of PrPSc-like aggregates.We recently reported the unusual observation that cells expressing ΔCR PrP, as well as other toxic deletion mutants, are hypersensitive to killing by two classes of drugs normally used to select transfected cell lines (12Massignan T.

We hypothesize that the ion channels or membrane pores underlying these currents play a critical role in the pathological effects of neurotoxic PrP mutants and that they represent a new class of potential drug targets for treatment of prion diseases. IntroductionPrion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders in which a normal, cell surface glycoprotein called PrPC 2The abbreviations used are: PrPprion proteinPrPCcellular isoform of PrPPrPScscrapie isoform of PrPCRcentral regionPPSpentosan polysulfateNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineTEAtetraethylammonium. is converted into PrPSc, a conformationally altered isoform that propagates itself by a molecular templating mechanism (1Prusiner S.B.

Although much is now understood about how infectious prions propagate, the mechanisms by which neurotoxic forms of PrP kill nerve cells remain enigmatic (3Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, membrane-bound PrPC appears to play a crucial role in mediating the neurotoxicity of PrPSc. It has been proposed that interactions with PrPSc during the conversion process may alter a normal, physiological activity of PrPC, resulting in the transmission of a neurotoxic signal (4Harris D.A. True H.L. Neuron. 2006; 50: 353-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying the normal function of PrPC is important for understanding the mechanism of prion-induced neurodegeneration. However, the function of PrPC remains unclear because mice lacking this protein display no overt phenotype (5Büeler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H.P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M.

Each of these mice displays a neurodegenerative phenotype that is dose-dependently suppressed by co-expression of wild-type (WT) PrP, suggesting an antagonistic relationship between the normal activity of PrPC and the neurotoxic effects of the deletion mutants. We have found that mice expressing the smallest of the deletions (Δ105–125 or ΔCR for central region) display the most dramatic phenotype, characterized by neonatal lethality with massive degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons and vacuolar degeneration of white matter regions of the brain and spinal cord. ΔCR PrP is neither aggregated nor protease-resistant, and its cellular localization is identical to that of wild-type PrP (10Li A. Christensen H.M. Stewart L.R. Roth K.A. Chiesa R. Harris D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2026431853,"Background It is currently believed that face processing predominantly activates the right hemisphere in humans, but available literature is very inconsistent. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, ERPs were recorded in 50 right-handed women and men in response to 390 faces (of different age and sex), and 130 technological objects. Results showed no sex difference in the amplitude of N170 to objects; a much larger face-specific response over the right hemisphere in men, and a bilateral response in women; a lack of face-age coding effect over the left hemisphere in men, with no differences in N170 to faces as a function of age; a significant bilateral face-age coding effect in women. Conclusions/Significance LORETA reconstruction showed a significant left and right asymmetry in the activation of the fusiform gyrus (BA19), in women and men, respectively. The present data reveal a lesser degree of lateralization of brain functions related to face coding in women than men. In this light, they may provide an explanation of the inconsistencies in the available literature concerning the asymmetric activity of left and right occipito-temporal cortices devoted to face perception during processing of face identity, structure, familiarity or affective content."
https://openalex.org/W1973637747,"Plasmodium vivax is responsible for a significant portion of malaria cases worldwide, especially in Asia and Latin America, where geo-helminthiasis have a high prevalence. Impact of the interaction between vivax malaria and intestinal helminthes has been poorly explored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of intestinal helminthiasis on the concentration of hemoglobin in children with Plasmodium vivax malaria in rural areas in the municipality of Careiro, in the Western Brazilian Amazon.A cohort study was conducted from April to November 2008, enrolling children from 5 to 14 years old in two rural areas endemic for malaria. A cross-sectional evaluation was performed in April to actively detect cases of malaria and document baseline hemoglobin and nutritional status. Children were followed-up for six months through passive case detection of malaria based on light microscopy. Throughout the follow-up interval, hemoglobin value and stool examination (three samples on alternate days) were performed on children who developed P. vivax malaria. For 54 schoolchildren with a single infection by P. vivax, hemoglobin during the malaria episode was similar to the baseline hemoglobin for children co-infected with Ascaris lumbricoides (n = 18), hookworm (n = 11) and Trichuris trichiura (n = 9). In children without intestinal helminthes, a significant decrease in the hemoglobin during the malarial attack was seen as compared to the baseline concentration. In the survival analysis, no difference was seen in the time (in days) from the baseline cross-sectional to the first malarial infection, between parasitized and non-parasitized children.For the first time, a cohort study showed that intestinal helminthes protect against hemoglobin decrease during an acute malarial attack by P. vivax."
https://openalex.org/W1976015869,"While the phenomenon linking the early nutritional environment to disease susceptibility exists in many mammalian species, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that nutritional programming is a variable quantitative state of gene expression, fixed by the state of energy balance in the neonate, that waxes and wanes in the adult animal in response to changes in energy balance. We tested this hypothesis with an experiment, based upon global gene expression, to identify networks of genes in which expression patterns in inguinal fat of mice have been altered by the nutritional environment during early post-natal development. The effects of over- and under-nutrition on adiposity and gene expression phenotypes were assessed at 5, 10, 21 days of age and in adult C57Bl/6J mice fed chow followed by high fat diet for 8 weeks. Under-nutrition severely suppressed plasma insulin and leptin during lactation and diet-induced obesity in adult mice, whereas over-nourished mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from those on a control diet. Food intake was not affected by under- or over-nutrition. Microarray gene expression data revealed a major class of genes encoding proteins of the caveolae and cytoskeleton, including Cav1, Cav2, Ptrf (Cavin1), Ldlr, Vldlr and Mest, that were highly associated with adipose tissue expansion in 10 day-old mice during the dynamic phase of inguinal fat development and in adult animals exposed to an obesogenic environment. In conclusion gene expression profiles, fat mass and adipocyte size in 10 day old mice predicted similar phenotypes in adult mice with variable diet-induced obesity. These results are supported by phenotypes of KO mice and suggest that when an animal enters a state of positive energy balance adipose tissue expansion is initiated by coordinate changes in mRNA levels for proteins required for modulating the structure of the caveolae to maximize the capacity of the adipocyte for lipid storage."

IntroductionParathyroid hormone (PTH) and dopamine are important factors regulating phosphate homeostasis. Both hormones activate specific receptors in the renal proximal tubule thereby initiating protein kinase cascades that mediate the endocytosis of the major phosphate transporters including the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2a (Npt2a) located in the apical membrane of these cells (1Weinman E.J.

Interestingly, the downstream target of these protein kinases is not Npt2a itself, but rather a Npt2a-binding protein called the sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) (4Déliot, N., Hernando, N., Horst-Liu, Z., Gisler, S.

Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PTH and dopamine have been shown to phosphorylate Ser77 of the first PDZ domain of NHERF-1, resulting in the dissociation of NHERF-1·Npt2a complexes (1Weinman E.J. Biswas R. Steplock D. Douglass T.S.

The net result of these reactions is a decrease in the abundance of Npt2a in the apical membrane of renal proximal convoluted tubule cells, a decrease in phosphate uptake, and an increase in the urinary excretion of phosphate. Recent studies from our laboratory have indentified Thr95 in the first PDZ domain of NHERF-1 as another phosphoacceptor site, but its potential role in regulating phosphate transport has not been explored (8Voltz J.W.

The present studies indicate interesting and potentially important interactions among the phosphorylation of Thr95, the phosphorylation of Ser77, and the renal transport of phosphate. In particular, we report that the phosphorylation of Thr95 is increased by both PTH and dopamine and that this biochemical modification enhances the phosphorylation of Ser77, thereby modulating a decrease in Npt2a binding to NHERF-1 and renal phosphate transport (1Weinman E.J.

Ser77 was unchanged and, under these experimental conditions, was the only phosphate acceptor. Identical concentrations of the recombinant proteins were incubated with [32P]ATP, calcium, magnesium, phospholipids, and PKC. As shown in Fig. 1, the maximal phosphorylation of the T95A mutant was approximately half that seen with the T95D polypeptide. The half-time (t½) to reach maximal phosphorylation of the T95A polypeptide was 4.7 ± 0.7 min compared with 2.2 ± 0.4 for the T95D mutant (p < 0.05, n = 4). The total phosphorylation of WT PDZ I was higher than the T95D mutant likely reflecting the availability of the Thr95 site, but the t½ (2.1 ± 0.4 min) was similar to the T95D mutant. A PDZ I polypeptide containing alanine substitutions at positions 77 and 95 was not phosphorylated (not shown). These findings indicate that the phosphorylation of Thr95 influences the rate and extent of phosphorylation of Ser77 by PKC.The physiologic relevance of these observations was then tested in primary cultures of NHERF-1-null proximal tubule cells infected with control adenovirus-GFP, wild-type adenovirus-GFP-NHERF-1 (full-length), or adenovirus-GFP-NHERF-1 (full-length) containing either the T95A or T95D mutation (Fig. 2). As we have previously shown, phosphate transport in NHERF-1-null proximal tubule cells infected with adenovirus-GFP is not inhibited by either PTH or dopamine (2Cunningham R. Biswas R. Brazie M.

Infection of NHERF-1-null cells with WT adenovirus-NHERF-1 results in an increase in basal sodium-dependent phosphate transport and restoration of the inhibitory response to PTH and to dopamine. Infection of the NHERF-1-null cells with the T95A or T95D NHERF-1 results in an increase in the basal rates of phosphate transport similar to WT NHERF-1. The inhibition of phosphate transport in cells expressing NHERF-1 T95A in response to PTH and dopamine (−1.8 ± 1.4% and −3.6 ± 3.2%), however, was significantly lower than in NHERF-1 T95D-infected cells (39.1 ± 3.0% and 36.9 ± 1.5% in response to PTH and dopamine, respectively (p < 0.05, n = 5).FIGURE 2Sodium-dependent phosphate uptake was measured in cultured renal proximal tubule cells from NHERF-1-null animals (n = 5). Cells were infected with control adenovirus-GFP (GFP), adenovirus-GFP linked to full-length, wild-type NHERF-1 (WT), or adenovirus-GFP linked to full-length NHERF-1 containing either a T95D or T95A mutation.

Using pulldowns with recombinant proteins representing the C terminus of Npt2, we have also shown that the phosphorylation of Ser77 reduces its affinity for binding to NHERF-1 (8Voltz J.W. Brush M. Sikes S. Steplock D. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33879-33887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To validate and strengthen these findings further, we analyzed real-time binding of recombinant polypeptides representing PDZ I of NHERF-1 to a peptide representing the C-terminal 79 amino acids of human Npt2a using SPR spectroscopy. The binding of WT PDZ I to the C terminus of Npt2a requires the terminal TRL sequence of the transporter, as deletion of these residues abrogated binding completely (data not shown). The KD of binding of WT PDZ 1 to the C terminus of Npt2a was 1.56 × 10−6 m. Compared with WT PDZ I, PDZ I containing the T95D mutation was not significantly different (Fig. 3). The KD of the S77D mutant, however, was 3.3 ± 0.4-fold higher than WT PDZ I (p < 0.05, n = 4), indicating a decrease in binding affinity. Similarly, the KD of the T95D/S77D double mutant was 3.2 ± 0.51-fold higher than WT PDZ I (p < 0.05, n = 3), but not significantly different from the S77D mutant. This indicates that the phosphorylation of Ser77 inhibits Npt2a binding but that the phosphorylation of Thr95 affects the binding of Npt2a indirectly by facilitating PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser77.FIGURE 3Relative SPR-determined binding affinities of the C-terminal region of Npt2a and PDZ I domains of NHERF-1 containing the T95D, S77D, or combined T95D/S77D mutations compared with WT PDZ I (shown as = 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next sought to determine whether the phosphorylation of Thr95 was a target of the protein kinase cascades initiated by occupancy of the PTH 1 receptor or the dopamine receptors. In a proximal tubule cell line, opossum kidney cells, we expressed cDNAs encoding His6-PDZ I representing WT PDZ I or PDZ I in which all serine and threonine residues except Thr95 were mutated to alanines. The cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi and treated with PTH or dopamine, and the PDZ I domains were recovered from cell lysates by nickel chromatography. As shown in the autoradiographs in Fig. 4, Thr95 is phosphorylated in the basal state, and its phosphorylation is increased by both hormones. In response to PTH, the phosphorylation of WT PDZ I was increased 77 ± 5% (n = 3, p < 0.05), and the phosphorylation of Thr95 was increased by 32 ± 5% (n = 3, p < 0.05). In response to dopamine, the phosphorylation of WT PDZ I was increased by 50 ± 5% (n = 3, p < 0.05), and the phosphorylation of Thr95 was increased by 25 ± 3% (n = 3, p < 0.05).FIGURE 4Representative experiment showing autoradiographs and Western immunoblots from opossum kidney cells expressing His6-PDZ I cDNAs encoding WT PDZ I or PDZ I in which all serine and threonine residues except Thr95 were mutated to alanine residues.

The phosphorylation of Ser77, in turn, results in the disassociation of NHERF-1·Npt2a complexes, a decrease in the abundance of Npt2a in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells, and a decrease in phosphate transport. Our current findings provide additional insights into the regulatory events that mediate PTH- and dopamine-associated inhibition of renal phosphate transport. Specifically, we show that the phosphorylation of Thr95 is a critical determinant of the phosphorylation of Ser77 and is required for these hormones to inhibit phosphate transport. Using recombinant polypeptides representing the PDZ I domain of NHERF-1, we find that the substitution of Thr95 with alanine significantly decreases both the rate and the extent of phosphorylation of Ser77 in response to PKC. The cooperativity between the phosphorylation of Thr95 and Ser77 is supported by the physiologic studies using proximal tubule cells from NHERF-1-null animals infected with adenovirus-GFP-NHERF-1 constructs. Infection of NHERF-1-null proximal tubule cells with either WT NHERF-1, NHERF-1 containing the T95A mutation, or NHERF-1 containing the T95D mutation resulted in increased basal rates of phosphate transport compared with null cells infected with the control adenovirus-GFP. These findings would be consistent with the proposal that NHERF-1 that is not phosphorylated at Ser77 is in a conformation that is permissive for binding to the Npt2a transporter. The finding that the increase in basal phosphate transport following infection with wild-type NHERF-1 is the same as the rates using NHERF-1 with either the T95A or T95D mutation suggests that the trafficking and abundance of all three at the apical membrane are similar. On the other hand, infection of NHERF-1-null cells with adenovirus-NHERF-1 containing the T95A mutation blunts the inhibitory effect of both PTH and dopamine compared with virus encoding either WT NHERF-1 or NHERF-1 containing the T95D substitution. These findings suggest an important regulatory role of Thr95 phosphorylation in mediating the hormonal control of phosphate transport.We have previously shown that the phosphorylation of Ser77 affects the binding of Npt2a to NHERF-1 (1Weinman E.J.

To extend these studies to include PDZ I phosphorylation at Thr95, we employed SPR spectroscopy to determine Npt2a binding to the PDZ I domain of NHERF-1. This in vitro assay allows determination of binding affinities in the absence of other potentially confounding protein interactions. The C terminus of Npt2a binds to the first PDZ domain of NHERF-1 via its C-terminal TRL sequence. Compared with WT PDZ I, PDZ I containing the S77D substitution has significantly decreased binding affinity to Npt2a. The introduction of an additional T95D mutation results in no further change in affinity. We suggest that, when considered in conjunction with the phosphorylation studies, the phosphorylation of Thr95 is an important regulator of Npt2a binding by virtue of its effect on the phosphorylation state of Ser77, but by itself has little or no effect on Npt2a binding. The crystal structure of NHERF-1 not bound to a target peptide has not yet been reported. In the crystal structures of PDZ I of NHERF-1 complexed with the C-terminal peptides of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, the β2-adrenergic receptor, or the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, Ser77 lies in the middle of the α2-helix but does not make direct contact with the ligand (11Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18973-18978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the nearby Arg78 and Arg80 provide positive charges to that part of the molecule and may interact with the phosphate group attached to Ser77 to alter the electrostatic profile in that region and thereby interfere with ligand binding.The current studies demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Ser77 is strongly dependent on the phosphorylation status of Thr95 and, if Thr95 is mutated to alanine, neither PTH nor dopamine inhibits phosphate transport. Accordingly, we next sought to determine whether Thr95 is a target for phosphorylation by PTH and dopamine. In the absence of antibodies capable of specifically detecting the phosphorylation of this residue, we transfected metabolically labeled opossum kidney cells, a model proximal tubule cell line that has both PTH and dopamine receptors, with cDNAs encoding His6 PDZ I. The results indicate that Thr95 was phosphorylated in unstimulated cells and that its phosphorylation is increased by both hormones. This finding is consistent with the idea that the hormonal regulation of phosphate transport involves the coordinated phosphorylation of both Thr95 and Ser77. Although our results indicate that PTH and dopamine treatment increase the phosphorylation of Thr95, we recognize that these hormones may also modulate NHERF-1 phosphorylation at other sites. Indeed, the structural basis by which the covalent modification of Thr95 enhances the phosphorylation of Ser77 is unknown. Thr95 is not visible in the available crystal structures of the PDZ I domain of NHERF-1, and at the present time, there is no information on its role in the PDZ I domain structure. The simplest interpretation of our findings is that the phosphorylation of Thr95 in full-length NHERF-1 introduces a conformational change in the PDZ I domain that influences the regulation and/or interaction of Ser77 with PKC.In summary, the present experiments suggest an expanded model of PTH and dopamine mediated regulation of renal phosphate excretion and indicate that the inhibitory effect of these hormones require the coordinated phosphorylation of Thr95 and Ser77 in the first PDZ domain of NHERF-1. Moreover, the introduction of mutations at either of these two sites results in distinct effects on the relation between PTH and dopamine, and phosphate transport in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Remarkably, in cultured proximal tubule cells, neither PTH nor dopamine inhibits phosphate transport in NHERF-1-null cells. Rescue of these cells results in the restoration of not only the basal rates of phosphate transport but also the response to the hormones. This suggests that only the NHERF-1-bound Npt2a is subject to regulation by these hormones. The magnitude of the inhibitory response to PTH and dopamine is 35–50% of the basal rates of transport and this change approximates the percent of the total apical membrane Npt2a bound to NHERF-1 as determined by density gradient ultracentrifugation (5Weinman E.J. Biswas R.S. Peng G. Peng Q. Shen L. Turner C.L. Xiafei E. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. Cunningham R. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3412-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The present results also bear on the question of how PDZ domains might participate in the regulation of physiologic processes. Proteins containing multiple PDZ domains were initially envisioned to facilitate the formation of stable protein complexes. Our recent and current studies, on the other hand, suggest that the interactions between some PDZ domains and their target proteins are dynamic and subject to regulation. At the present time, it is not known whether the model proposed for the Npt2a·NHERF-1 interaction is specific for this ligand or represents a more general model applicable to the nearly 50 other proteins reported to bind to the PDZ I domain of NHERF-1. Our prior studies indicated that the binding of the β2-adrenergic receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator to the PDZ I domain of NHERF-1 is decreased in response to treatment with protein phosphatase inhibitors and was associated with the phosphorylation of Thr95 and Ser77 (8Voltz J.W.

IntroductionParathyroid hormone (PTH) and dopamine are important factors regulating phosphate homeostasis. Both hormones activate specific receptors in the renal proximal tubule thereby initiating protein kinase cascades that mediate the endocytosis of the major phosphate transporters including the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2a (Npt2a) located in the apical membrane of these cells (1Weinman E.J.

Interestingly, the downstream target of these protein kinases is not Npt2a itself, but rather a Npt2a-binding protein called the sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) (4Déliot, N., Hernando, N., Horst-Liu, Z., Gisler, S.

Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PTH and dopamine have been shown to phosphorylate Ser77 of the first PDZ domain of NHERF-1, resulting in the dissociation of NHERF-1·Npt2a complexes (1Weinman E.J. Biswas R. Steplock D. Douglass T.S.

This dissociation appears to be required for Npt2a to interact with other proteins that mediate entry into its endocytic pathway (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Cha B. Kovbasnjul O. Frost N.A.

The net result of these reactions is a decrease in the abundance of Npt2a in the apical membrane of renal proximal convoluted tubule cells, a decrease in phosphate uptake, and an increase in the urinary excretion of phosphate. Recent studies from our laboratory have indentified Thr95 in the first PDZ domain of NHERF-1 as another phosphoacceptor site, but its potential role in regulating phosphate transport has not been explored (8Voltz J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2059383458,"Background The endothelin B receptor (ETBR) promotes tumorigenesis and melanoma progression through activation by endothelin (ET)-1, thus representing a promising therapeutic target. The stability of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is essential for melanomagenesis and progression, and is controlled by site-specific hydroxylation carried out by HIF-prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) and subsequent proteosomal degradation. Principal Findings Here we found that in melanoma cells ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 through ETBR, enhance the expression and activity of HIF-1α and HIF-2α that in turn regulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in response to ETs or hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, ET-1 controls HIF-α stability by inhibiting its degradation, as determined by impaired degradation of a reporter gene containing the HIF-1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain encompassing the PHD-targeted prolines. In particular, ETs through ETBR markedly decrease PHD2 mRNA and protein levels and promoter activity. In addition, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent integrin linked kinase (ILK)-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is required for ETBR-mediated PHD2 inhibition, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and VEGF expression. At functional level, PHD2 knockdown does not further increase ETs-induced in vitro tube formation of endothelial cells and melanoma cell invasiveness, demonstrating that these processes are regulated in a PHD2-dependent manner. In human primary and metastatic melanoma tissues as well as in cell lines, that express high levels of HIF-1α, ETBR expression is associated with low PHD2 levels. In melanoma xenografts, ETBR blockade by ETBR antagonist results in a concomitant reduction of tumor growth, angiogenesis, HIF-1α, and HIF-2α expression, and an increase in PHD2 levels. Conclusions In this study we identified the underlying mechanism by which ET-1, through the regulation of PHD2, controls HIF-1α stability and thereby regulates angiogenesis and melanoma cell invasion. These results further indicate that targeting ETBR may represent a potential therapeutic treatment of melanoma by impairing HIF-1α stability."

Methods Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on samples from patients with meningioma. The results were graded according to the positive ratio and intensity of tissue immunoreactivity. The expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin in meningioma was analyzed by its relationship with WHO2007 grading, invasion, peritumoral edema and postoperative recurrence. Results The positive rates of E-cadherin in meningioma WHO I, II, III were 92.69%, 33.33% and 0, respectively, (P<0.05); while the positive rates of β-catenin in meningioma WHO I, II, III were 82.93%, 33.33% and 20.00%, respectively, (P<0.05). The positive rate of E-cadherin in meningioma without invasion (94.12%) was higher than that with invasion (46.67%) (P<0.05). The difference in the positive rate of β-catenin between meningioma without invasion (88.24%) and meningioma with invasion (33.33%, P<0.05) was also statically significant. The positive rates of E-cadherin in meningioma with peritumoral edema 0, 1, 2, 3 were 93.75%, 85.71%, 60.00% and 0 respectively, (P<0.05); the positive rates of β-catenin in meningioma with peritumoral edema 0, 1, 2, 3 were 87.50%, 85.71%, 30.00% and 0 respectively, (P<0.01). The positive rates of E- cadherin in meningioma with postoperative recurrence were 33.33%, and the positive rate with postoperative non-recurrence was 90.00% (P<0.01). The positive rates of β-catenin in meningioma with postoperative recurrence and non-recurrence were 11.11%, 85.00%, respectively (P<0.01). Conclusion The expression levels of E- cadherin and β-catenin correlated closely to the WHO 2007 grading criteria for meningioma. In atypical or malignant meningioma, the expression levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin were significantly lower. The expression levels of E- cadherin and β-catenin were also closely correlated with the invasion status of meningioma, the size of the peritumoral edema and the recurrent probabilities of the meningioma, all in an inverse correlationship. Taken together, the present study provided novel molecular targets in clinical treatments to meningioma."

Interactions between oocyte and the surrounding cumulus cells at germinal vesicle (GV) stage are considered essential for proper maturation or 'programming' of oocytes, which is crucial for normal fertilization and embryonic development. However, despite its importance, little is known about the molecular events and pathways involved in this bidirectional communication.We used differential detergent fractionation multidimensional protein identification technology (DDF-Mud PIT) on bovine GV oocyte and cumulus cells and identified 811 and 1247 proteins in GV oocyte and cumulus cells, respectively; 371 proteins were significantly differentially expressed between each cell type. Systems biology modeling, which included Gene Ontology (GO) and canonical genetic pathway analysis, showed that cumulus cells have higher expression of proteins involved in cell communication, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, as well as transport than GV oocytes. Our data also suggests a hypothesis that oocytes may depend on the presence of cumulus cells to generate specific cellular signals to coordinate their growth and maturation.Systems biology modeling of bovine oocytes and cumulus cells in the context of GO and protein interaction networks identified the signaling pathways associated with the proteins involved in cell-to-cell signaling biological process that may have implications in oocyte competence and maturation. This first comprehensive systems biology modeling of bovine oocytes and cumulus cell proteomes not only provides a foundation for signaling and cell physiology at the GV stage of oocyte development, but are also valuable for comparative studies of other stages of oocyte development at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1970926164,"The number of promising therapeutic interventions for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is increasing rapidly. One of the proposed strategies is to use drugs that are known to act by multiple different mechanisms including inducing of homologous fetal form of adult genes, for example utrophin in place of dystrophin.In this study, we have treated mdx mice with arginine butyrate, prednisone, or a combination of arginine butyrate and prednisone for 6 months, beginning at 3 months of age, and have comprehensively evaluated the functional, biochemical, histological, and molecular effects of the treatments in this DMD model. Arginine butyrate treatment improved grip strength and decreased fibrosis in the gastrocnemius muscle, but did not produce significant improvement in muscle and cardiac histology, heart function, behavioral measurements, or serum creatine kinase levels. In contrast, 6 months of chronic continuous prednisone treatment resulted in deterioration in functional, histological, and biochemical measures. Arginine butyrate-treated mice gene expression profiling experiments revealed that several genes that control cell proliferation, growth and differentiation are differentially expressed consistent with its histone deacetylase inhibitory activity when compared to control (saline-treated) mdx mice. Prednisone and combination treated groups showed alterations in the expression of genes that control fibrosis, inflammation, myogenesis and atrophy.These data indicate that 6 months treatment with arginine butyrate can produce modest beneficial effects on dystrophic pathology in mdx mice by reducing fibrosis and promoting muscle function while chronic continuous treatment with prednisone showed deleterious effects to skeletal and cardiac muscle. Our results clearly indicate the usefulness of multiple assays systems to monitor both beneficial and toxic effects of drugs with broad range of in vivo activity."

https://openalex.org/W2166568973,"Background Recent genetic studies have identified a growing number of loci with suggestive evidence of association with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known of the role of these candidate genes in influencing intermediate phenotypes associated with a diagnosis of AD, including cognitive decline or AD neuropathologic burden. Methods/Principal Findings Thirty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously implicated in AD susceptibility were genotyped in 414 subjects with both annual clinical evaluation and completed brain autopsies from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Regression analyses evaluated the relation of SNP genotypes to continuous measures of AD neuropathology and cognitive function proximate to death. A SNP in the zinc finger protein 224 gene (ZNF224, rs3746319) was associated with both global AD neuropathology (p = 0.009) and global cognition (p = 0.002); whereas, a SNP at the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase locus (PCK1, rs8192708) was selectively associated with global cognition (p = 3.57×10−4). The association of ZNF224 with cognitive impairment was mediated by neurofibrillary tangles, whereas PCK1 largely influenced cognition independent of AD pathology, as well as Lewy bodies and infarcts.

https://openalex.org/W2055600730,"Komodo dragons, the world's largest lizard, dispatch their large ungulate prey by biting and tearing flesh. If a prey escapes, oral bacteria inoculated into the wound reputedly induce a sepsis that augments later prey capture by the same or other lizards. However, the ecological and evolutionary basis of sepsis in Komodo prey acquisition is controversial. Two models have been proposed. The “bacteria as venom” model postulates that the oral flora directly benefits the lizard in prey capture irrespective of any benefit to the bacteria. The “passive acquisition” model is that the oral flora of lizards reflects the bacteria found in carrion and sick prey, with no relevance to the ability to induce sepsis in subsequent prey. A third model is proposed and analyzed here, the “lizard-lizard epidemic” model. In this model, bacteria are spread indirectly from one lizard mouth to another. Prey escaping an initial attack act as vectors in infecting new lizards. This model requires specific life history characteristics and ways to refute the model based on these characteristics are proposed and tested. Dragon life histories (some details of which are reported here) prove remarkably consistent with the model, especially that multiple, unrelated lizards feed communally on large carcasses and that escaping, wounded prey are ultimately fed on by other lizards. The identities and evolutionary histories of bacteria in the oral flora may yield the most useful additional insights for further testing the epidemic model and can now be obtained with new technologies."

GDP-Man, the activated form of Man, is required for mannosylation processes within the cell and is central for protein glycosylation and glycophospholipid anchor synthesis in eukaryotes. In bacteria, GDP-Man is an essential precursor of Man-containing polysaccharides found in capsular and other cell wall components. In this context, the genomes of thermophilic anaerobes are particularly rich in carbohydrate-active enzymes to produce exopolysaccharides to confer various cell surface-associated functions (1Vanfossen A.L. Lewis D.L. Nichols J.D. Kelly R.M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1125: 322-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In addition to its direct utilization for synthetic purposes, GDP-Man can be enzymatically converted to other GDP-sugars, such as GDP-l-fucose, GDP-d-mannuronate, and GDP-d-rhamnose, which in turn are incorporated into various glycoconjugates. GDP-Man is synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate fructose-6-phosphate and GTP in three steps. A phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) first converts fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate, which is then converted to mannose-1-phosphate (Man1P) by a phosphomannomutase. Finally, the GMP/Man1P guanylyltransferase catalyzes the condensation of GTP and Man1P to form GDP-Man. The GMP enzyme, also referred to as PMI (EC 2.7.7.13) and first characterized in Arthrobacter sp. (2Preiss J. Wood E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3119-3126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been described in several species. In some bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the noncontiguous GMP and PMI activities reside on separate domains of a bifunctional enzyme (3May T.B. Shinabarger D. Boyd A. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sequences from mono- and bifunctional PMIs, classified as PMI of type I and II, respectively, lack significant overall homology, the sequence associated to GMP activity has been conserved during the course of evolution (4Jensen S.O. Reeves P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, at the sequence level, monofunctional GMPs and the GMP domain of bifunctional PMIs share the consensus sequence GXGXRXnK, which is the signature motif of pyrophosphorylases (PPases).

GDP-Man, the activated form of Man, is required for mannosylation processes within the cell and is central for protein glycosylation and glycophospholipid anchor synthesis in eukaryotes. In bacteria, GDP-Man is an essential precursor of Man-containing polysaccharides found in capsular and other cell wall components. In this context, the genomes of thermophilic anaerobes are particularly rich in carbohydrate-active enzymes to produce exopolysaccharides to confer various cell surface-associated functions (1Vanfossen A.L. Lewis D.L. Nichols J.D. Kelly R.M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1125: 322-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In addition to its direct utilization for synthetic purposes, GDP-Man can be enzymatically converted to other GDP-sugars, such as GDP-l-fucose, GDP-d-mannuronate, and GDP-d-rhamnose, which in turn are incorporated into various glycoconjugates. GDP-Man is synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate fructose-6-phosphate and GTP in three steps. A phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) first converts fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate, which is then converted to mannose-1-phosphate (Man1P) by a phosphomannomutase. Finally, the GMP/Man1P guanylyltransferase catalyzes the condensation of GTP and Man1P to form GDP-Man. The GMP enzyme, also referred to as PMI (EC 2.7.7.13) and first characterized in Arthrobacter sp. (2Preiss J. Wood E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3119-3126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been described in several species. In some bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the noncontiguous GMP and PMI activities reside on separate domains of a bifunctional enzyme (3May T.B. Shinabarger D. Boyd A. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sequences from mono- and bifunctional PMIs, classified as PMI of type I and II, respectively, lack significant overall homology, the sequence associated to GMP activity has been conserved during the course of evolution (4Jensen S.O.

https://openalex.org/W2001894458,"CCN2/connective tissue growth factor is highly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes and is required for chondrogenesis. However, the transcriptional mechanisms controlling its expression in cartilage are largely unknown. The activity of the Ccn2 promoter was, therefore, investigated in osteochondro-progenitor cells and hypertrophic chondrocytes to ascertain these mechanisms. Sox9 and T-cell factor (TCF) x lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) factors contain HMG domains and bind to related consensus sites. TCF x LEF factors are normally repressive but when bound to DNA in a complex with beta-catenin become activators of gene expression. In silico analysis of the Ccn2 proximal promoter identified multiple consensus TCF x LEF elements, one of which was also a consensus binding site for Sox9. Using luciferase reporter constructs, the TCF x LEF x Sox9 site was found to be involved in stage-specific expression of Ccn2. Luciferase, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and ChIP analysis revealed that Sox9 represses Ccn2 expression by binding to the consensus TCF x LEF x Sox9 site. On the other hand, the same assays showed that in hypertrophic chondrocytes, TCF x LEF x beta-catenin complexes occupy the consensus TCF x LEF x Sox9 site and activate Ccn2 expression. Furthermore, transgenic mice in which lacZ expression is driven under the control of the proximal Ccn2 promoter revealed that the proximal Ccn2 promoter responded to Wnt signaling in cartilage. Hence, we propose that differential occupancy of the TCF x LEF x Sox9 site by Sox9 versus beta-catenin restricts high levels of Ccn2 expression to hypertrophic chondrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2045913066,"Objective Existing observational data describing rounds in teaching hospitals are 15 years old, predate duty-hour regulations, are limited to one institution, and do not include pediatrics. We sought to evaluate the effect of medical specialty, institution, patient-census, and team participants upon time at the bedside and education occurring on rounds. Methods and Participants Between December of 2007 and October of 2008 we performed 51 observations at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Seattle Children's Hospital, Stanford University Hospital, and the University of Washington Medical Center of 35 attending physicians. We recorded minutes spent on rounds in three location and seven activity categories, members of the care team, and patient-census. Results Results presented are means. Pediatric rounds had more participants (8.2 vs. 4.1 physicians, p<.001; 11.9 vs. 2.4 non-physicians, p<.001) who spent more minutes in hallways (96.9 min vs. 35.2 min, p<.001), fewer minutes at the bedside (14.6 vs. 38.2 min, p = .01) than internal medicine rounds. Multivariate regression modeling revealed that minutes at the bedside per patient was negatively associated with pediatrics (−2.77 adjusted bedside minutes; 95% CI −4.61 to −0.93; p<.001) but positively associated with the number of non-physician participants (0.12 adjusted bedside minutes per non physician participant; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.17; p = <.001). Education minutes on rounds was positively associated with the presence of an attending physician (2.70 adjusted education minutes; 95% CI 1.27 to 4.12; p<.001) and with one institution (1.39 adjusted education minutes; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.53; p = .02). Conclusions Pediatricians spent less time at the bedside on rounds than internal medicine physicians due to reasons other than patient-census or the number of participants in rounds. Compared to historical data, internal medicine rounds were spent more at the bedside engaged in patient care and communication, and less upon educational activities."
https://openalex.org/W2096309846,"Transmembrane stretch M(2C) from the bacterial K(+)-translocating protein KtrB is unusually long. In its middle part, termed M(2C2), it contains several small and polar amino acids. This region is flanked by the two alpha-helices M(2C1) and M(2C3) and may form a flexible gate at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane controlling K(+) translocation. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for this notion by using continuous wave and pulse EPR measurements of single and double spin-labeled cysteine variants of KtrB. Most of the spin-labeled residues in M(2C2) were shown to be immobile, pointing to a compact structure. However, the high polarity revealed for the microenvironment of residue positions 317, 318, and 327 indicated the existence of a water-accessible cavity. Upon the addition of K(+) ions, M(2C2) residue Thr-318R1 (R1 indicates the bound spin label) moved with respect to M(2B) residue Asp-222R1 and M(2C3) residue Val-331R1 but not with respect to M(2C1) residue Met-311R1. Based on distances determined between spin-labeled residues of double-labeled variants of KtrB in the presence and absence of K(+) ions, structural models of the open and closed conformations were developed."
https://openalex.org/W2067604380,"In previous studies, we observed that mice knocked out for the serotonin-2B receptor (5-HT(2B)R) show defects in bone homeostasis. The present work focuses on the downstream targets relaying the anabolic function of this receptor in osteoblasts. A functional link between the 5-HT(2B)R and the activity of the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is established using the C1 osteoprogenitor cell line. During C1 osteogenic differentiation, both 5-HT(2B)R and TNAP mRNA translations are delayed with respect to extracellular matrix deposition. Once the receptor is expressed, it constitutively controls TNAP activity at a post-translational level along the overall period of mineral deposition. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of the 5-HT(2B)R intrinsic activity or shRNA-mediated 5-HT(2B)R knockdown prevents TNAP activation, but not its mRNA translation. In contrast, agonist stimulation of the receptor further increases TNAP activity during the initial mineralization phase. Building upon our previous observations that the 5-HT(2B)R couples with the phospholipase A2 pathway and prostaglandin production at the beginning of mineral deposition, we show that the 5-HT(2B)R controls leukotriene synthesis via phospholipase A2 at the terminal stages of C1 differentiation. These two 5-HT(2B)R-dependent eicosanoid productions delineate distinct time windows of TNAP regulation during the osteogenic program. Finally, prostaglandins or leukotrienes are shown to relay the post-translational activation of TNAP via stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. In agreement with the above findings, primary calvarial osteoblasts from 5-HT(2B)R-null mice exhibit defects in TNAP activity."
https://openalex.org/W1970851949,"The aim of the study was to analyze whether the proliferative effects of insulin in rat liver involve cross-signaling toward the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and whether this is mediated by insulin-induced hepatocyte swelling. Studies were performed in the perfused rat liver and in primary rat hepatocytes. Insulin (35 nmol/liter) induced phosphorylation of the EGFR at position Tyr845 and Tyr1173, but not at Tyr1045, suggesting that EGF is not involved in insulin-induced EGFR activation. Insulin-induced EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation were sensitive to bumetanide, indicating an involvement of insulin-induced hepatocyte swelling. In line with this, hypoosmotic (225 mosmol/liter) hepatocyte swelling also induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation. Insulin- and hypoosmolarity-induced EGFR activation were sensitive to inhibition by an integrin-antagonistic RGD peptide, an integrin β1 subtype-blocking antibody, and the c-Src inhibitor PP-2, indicating the involvement of the recently described integrin-dependent osmosensing/signaling pathway (Schliess, F., Reissmann, R., Reinehr, R., vom Dahl, S., and Häussinger, D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21294–21301). As shown by immunoprecipitation studies, insulin and hypoosmolarity induced a rapid, RGD peptide-, integrin β1-blocking antibody and PP-2-sensitive association of c-Src with the EGFR. As for control, insulin-induced insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation remained unaffected by the RGD peptide, PP-2, or inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by AG1478. Both insulin and hypoosmolarity induced a significant increase in BrdU uptake in primary rat hepatocytes, which was sensitive to RGD peptide-, integrin β1-blocking antibody, PP-2, AG1478, and PD098059.

https://openalex.org/W1979697072,"Retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormone are critical for differentiation and organogenesis in the embryo. Mct8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8), expressed predominantly in the brain and placenta, mediates thyroid hormone uptake from the circulation and is required for normal neural development. RA induces differentiation of F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells toward neurons as well as extraembryonal endoderm. We hypothesized that Mct8 is functionally expressed in F9 cells and induced by RA. All-trans-RA (tRA) and other RA receptor (RAR) agonists dramatically (>300-fold) induced Mct8. tRA treatment significantly increased uptake of triiodothyronine and thyroxine (4.1- and 4.3-fold, respectively), which was abolished by a selective Mct8 inhibitor, bromosulfophthalein. Sequence inspection of the Mct8 promoter region and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR analysis in F9 cells identified 11 transcription start sites and a proximal Sp1 site but no TATA box. tRA significantly enhanced Mct8 promoter activity through a consensus RA-responsive element located 6.6 kilobases upstream of the coding region. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated binding of RAR and retinoid X receptor to the RA response element. The promotion of thyroid hormone uptake through the transcriptional up-regulation of Mct8 by RAR is likely to be important for extraembryonic endoderm development and neural differentiation. This finding demonstrates cross-talk between RA signaling and thyroid hormone signaling in early development at the level of the thyroid hormone transporter. Retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormone are critical for differentiation and organogenesis in the embryo. Mct8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8), expressed predominantly in the brain and placenta, mediates thyroid hormone uptake from the circulation and is required for normal neural development. RA induces differentiation of F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells toward neurons as well as extraembryonal endoderm. We hypothesized that Mct8 is functionally expressed in F9 cells and induced by RA. All-trans-RA (tRA) and other RA receptor (RAR) agonists dramatically (>300-fold) induced Mct8. tRA treatment significantly increased uptake of triiodothyronine and thyroxine (4.1- and 4.3-fold, respectively), which was abolished by a selective Mct8 inhibitor, bromosulfophthalein. Sequence inspection of the Mct8 promoter region and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR analysis in F9 cells identified 11 transcription start sites and a proximal Sp1 site but no TATA box. tRA significantly enhanced Mct8 promoter activity through a consensus RA-responsive element located 6.6 kilobases upstream of the coding region. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated binding of RAR and retinoid X receptor to the RA response element. The promotion of thyroid hormone uptake through the transcriptional up-regulation of Mct8 by RAR is likely to be important for extraembryonic endoderm development and neural differentiation. This finding demonstrates cross-talk between RA signaling and thyroid hormone signaling in early development at the level of the thyroid hormone transporter. Retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormones are essential for vertebrate development (1Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Nucl. Recept.

The actions of these hormones are mediated by specific nuclear hormone receptors, RA receptor (RAR) 3The abbreviations used are: RARretinoic acid receptorBCH2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acidBSPbromosulfophthaleinDBTSSdatabase of transcriptional start sitesDRdirect repeatLatL-type amino acid transporterLucluciferaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRAREretinoic acid response elementRXRretinoid X receptorT3triiodothyronineT4thyroxineTRthyroid hormone receptortRAall-trans-retinoic acidTSStranscription start site. and thyroid hormone receptor (TR), respectively. RAR signaling plays a critical role in embryonic patterning and in organogenesis (1Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2009; 7: e002Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). TR modulates RA-stimulated neural differentiation as well as expression of some RA-responsive genes in embryonic stem cells (3Lee L.R. Mortensen R.M. Larson C.A. Brent G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 746-756PubMed Google Scholar, 4Liu Y.Y. Tachiki K.H. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

RAR and TR form heterodimers with retinoid X (9-cis-RA) receptor (RXR) for regulation of most target genes. The consensus sequence of an RA response element (RARE) contains a direct repeat of the consensus half-sites, 5′-PuG(G/T)(T/A)CA-3′, with spacing of 1, 2, or 5 bases (DR-1, DR-2, or DR-5), whereas that of a retinoid X (or 9-cis-RA) response element contains the same half-sites separated by 1 base (DR-1) (5Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the difference of half-site spacing provides selectivity for a specific receptor, there are interactions among the various nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Nuclear receptors also share common co-activator(s) and co-repressor(s) for transcriptional regulation (2Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). A shared requirement for RXR, interaction at related cis-elements, and competition for co-factors are some of the mechanisms underlying cross-talk among nuclear receptor signaling pathways in development (6Furlow J.D. Neff E.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in metabolic regulation (2Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptor ligands are generally lipophilic and have been thought to reach their receptor by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that uptake of some of these ligands is mediated by selective transporters. Several members of the solute carrier (Slc) family (7Jansen J. Friesema E.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40128-40135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and the solute carrier organic anion transporter family (Slco, or organic anion-transporting polypeptides, Oatp) (9van der Deure W.M.

Mct8 loss of function mutations in humans are associated with profound neurological deficits (7Jansen J. Friesema E.C. Milici C. Visser T.J. Thyroid. 2005; 15: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a common manifestation of thyroid hormone insufficiency in embryos and fetuses. Mct8 is expressed in many tissues, including brain, placenta, liver, and kidney (7Jansen J. Friesema E.C. Milici C. Visser T.J. Thyroid. 2005; 15: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Friesema E.C. Ganguly S. Abdalla A. Manning Fox J.E. Halestrap A.P. Visser T.J. J. Biol.

F9 teratocarcinoma cells have been widely used as an in vitro model of embryonic stem cell differentiation. A combination treatment of F9 cells with all-trans-RA (tRA), an agonist of RAR, and cAMP induces extraembryonic endoderm (13Soprano D.R. Teets B.W. Soprano K.J. Vitam. Horm. 2007; 75: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Komiya S. Shimizu M. Ikenouchi J. Yonemura S. Matsui T. Fukunaga Y. Liu H. Endo F. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A.

Biol. 1980; 77: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), depending on the composition of culture media. The extraembryonic endoderm supports the developing embryo and facilitates exchange of small molecules between the maternal circulation and the embryo, functioning as an “early placenta” (16Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Because mature placenta expresses abundant Mct8 and transports thyroid hormone (12Chan S.Y. Franklyn J.A. Pemberton H.N. Bulmer J.N. Visser T.J. McCabe C.J. Kilby M.D. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 189: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it may be expressed in F9 cells differentiated into extraembryonic endoderm. Thyroid hormone is critical for brain development, and thus neural differentiation in F9 cells should be accompanied by induction of thyroid hormone transporter(s). To test these hypotheses, we investigated effects of the differentiation inducer, tRA, on expression of Mct8 and other thyroid hormone transporter genes as well as thyroid hormone uptake in F9 cells. F9 cells, purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) in gelatin-coated flasks or Petri dishes as recommended. Cells were subcultivated at a ratio of 1:10 to 1:20 and used at passages 2–6, unless otherwise noted. Neuron-like cells were induced as described previously (15Kuff E.L. Fewell J.W. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, ∼5 × 105 cells seeded in gelatin-coated Petri dishes were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 2% FBS, 1 μm tRA, and 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP for up to 7 days. The cells were fed every 2 days with fresh medium. The cells were split again at a subcultivation ratio of 1:10 2 days after the first seeding. JEG3 cells, MCF7 cells, and SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained as recommended. Synthetic retinoids were synthesized as described (17Kagechika H. Kawachi E. Hashimoto Y. Himi T. Shudo K. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 2182-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Kagechika H. Kawachi E. Hashimoto Y. Shudo K. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to 10−2 m, and stored at −20 °C. Restriction enzymes and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Two-step quantitative RT-PCR was carried out by using the DNA Engene Opticon System (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) as described (19Kogai T. Kanamoto Y. Li A.I. Che L.H. Ohashi E. Taki K. Chandraratna R.A. Saito T. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, total RNA from culture cells was prepared with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with on-column DNase digestion. Three μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using 50 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction with oligo(dT)12–18 primer or random hexamer. Quantitative PCR of mouse thyroid hormone transporter genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (Gapdh), 18 S ribosomal RNA, and human MCT8 mRNA was performed with custom DNA primers synthesized by Invitrogen (supplemental Table 1). Quantitative PCR of markers of extraembryonic endoderm and neural differentiation was carried out with the QuantiTect primer assay (Qiagen). Standard curves representing 6-point serial dilution of the corresponding control group were analyzed in each assay and used for calculation of relative expression values. RT-PCR of human GAPDH was performed as previously described (19Kogai T. Kanamoto Y. Li A.I. Che L.H. Ohashi E. Taki K. Chandraratna R.A. Saito T. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The sample quantifications were normalized by the internal control Gapdh or 18 S RNA. Conventional two-step RT-PCR of the 5′-untranslated region of Mct8 was performed with custom primers (supplemental Table 1) by using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The cycle number was 35. Uptake of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) was measured as described previously (20Friesema E.C. Kuiper G.G. Jansen J. Visser T.J. Kester M.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells, grown in 12-well plates, as well as empty wells for measurement of nonspecific binding of radiolabeled thyroid hormone to the surface of the side wall of the well were rinsed with 1 ml of Dulbecco's PBS, preincubated with 300 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 min at 37 °C, and the medium was replaced with 300 μl of preheated thyroid hormone uptake assay buffer. T3 uptake assay buffer contains Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.1% BSA, 0.25 μCi/ml 125I-labeled T3 (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), and 1.0 nm T3. T4 uptake assay buffer contains Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.1% BSA, 0.3 μCi/ml 125I-labeled T4 (MP Biomedicals), and 1.0 μm T4. Cells were incubated for 4–30 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator, rinsed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS, and lysed with 200 μm passive lysis buffer (Promega). Radioactivity of the whole lysate as well as lysis buffer from the duplicate empty wells was measured in a γ-counter. The background count from the side wall was subtracted from the count of cell lysate. The count was then normalized to the cellular protein content measured in the same cells by using a Bio-Rad protein assay. To determine putative RARE, consensus half-sites, (A/G)G(G/T)(A/T)CA as well as other reported half-sites (5Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were searched on both strands of the mouse Mct8 locus (NT_000086) by using MacMolly Tetra Lite (Mologen, Berlin, Germany) as described (21Kogai T. Ohashi E. Jacobs M.S. Sajid-Crockett S. Fisher M.L. Kanamoto Y. Brent G.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 93: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CpG islands around the transcription start site (TSS) of Mct8 were predicted by the CpG island searcher (hosted on the worldwide web by the laboratory of Dr. P. A. Jones at University of Southern California (USC)) with the following parameters: observed/expected ratio, >0.65; %GC, >50; length, >200 (22Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). Basic transcription factor binding sites (23Sandelin A. Carninci P. Lenhard B. Ponjavic J. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 24Frith M.C. Valen E. Krogh A. Hayashizaki Y. Carninci P. Sandelin A. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were searched around the TSS of Mct8 by using MacMolly Tetra Lite. Total RNA from F9 cells treated with 1 μm tRA for 72 h was isolated with the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen). The 5′-end of the Mct8 cDNA was identified by the oligo-capping and RNA ligase-mediated RACE method with the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA was dephosphorylated, decapped, and ligated to GeneRacer RNA oligonucleotides. Reverse transcription was carried out with random primer by using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The 5′-ends of Mct8 were amplified from the cDNA pool as a template with the GeneRacer 5′-primer and +496 primer (supplemental Table 1). Nested PCR was then performed with the GeneRacer 5′-nested primer and the +496 primer. PCR products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and analyzed by automated DNA sequencer (Laguna Scientific Laboratory, Laguna Niguel, CA). To generate constructs for screening of functional RARE on mouse Mct8, annealed synthetic oligonucleotides, containing the putative RAREs as well as an exogenous BamHI site for confirmation of cloning (supplemental Table 1), were inserted to the SmaI site of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A DNA fragment of the Mct8 5′-flanking region (−976 to −54; +1 is A in the translation start site) was obtained by genomic PCR from F9 cells with a forward primer (5′-CAGATCTTTCGTGCCTCCCTCCTTTC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CAAGCTTGTTTCTGCTGCTACTGCTCCT-3′). To generate pGL3 −976/−54, the PCR products were ligated into the polylinker site of the pGL Basic vector (Promega) with BglII and HindIII. pGL3 −836/−54 and pGL3 −659/−54 were constructed from the pGL3 −976/−54 by deletion of the sequences between ApaI and BglII sites and AgeI and BglII sites, respectively, both of which were treated with T4 DNA polymerase. pGL3 DR5A −976/−54 and pGL3 DR5A −836/−54 were constructed by blunt-end ligation of annealed oligonucleotides of the DR5A (supplemental Table 1) into the SmaI site of the pGL3 −976/−54 and the pGL3 −836/−54, respectively. Mutation of the DR5A element in pGL3 DR5A −836/−54 was generated by using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with custom primers from Invitrogen (supplemental Table 1). Sequences of the constructed vectors were analyzed by an automated DNA sequencer (Laguna Scientific Laboratory). Cells (500–600 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well dishes 24 h before transfection. Unless otherwise noted, 0.2 μg of a Luciferase (Luc) reporter construct and 10 ng of a Renilla Luc reporter vector, pRL-CMV (Promega), were transfected to the cells by using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as recommended. The transfection medium was changed to growth media with or without RA at 24 h, and the Luc assay was performed at 48 h with a dual Luc reporter assay system (Promega). Results of the Luc reporter assay were normalized to Renilla Luc expression. F9 cells, grown in 100-mm Petri dishes, were treated with tRA (1 μm) for up to 90 min and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. The ChIP assay was carried out with the ChIP-IT express enzymatic kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) as recommended. Partially digested chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-RARα (C-20), anti-RARβ (C-19), or anti-RXRα (D-20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Eluted DNA, as well as the aliquot of sheared chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation (input), was amplified by using the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with primers specific to an RA-responsive region of mouse Mct8 or the mouse Lat1 (L-type amino acid transporter 1) promoter (supplemental Table 1). PCR cycle numbers for Mct8 and Lat1 were 40 and 37, respectively. The amplicons were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. tRA treatment markedly increased Mct8 mRNA expression in F9 cells grown in media with 10% serum. A time course study (Fig. 1A) showed a significant induction of Mct8 mRNA by tRA (1 μm) at 12 h (∼9.5-fold), reaching a maximum at 96 h (∼1120-fold). The effect was dose-dependent with a 50% effective tRA concentration (EC50) of ∼1.47 × 10−7 m and maximum induction at an RA concentration of 10−6 m (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, the EC50 for tRA was ∼1.35 × 10−7 m. tRA is a potent agonist of RAR, although some tRA is converted intracellularly to 9-cis-RA, an agonist of RXR. Undifferentiated F9 cells express both RAR and RXR. To determine which receptor is required for Mct8 induction, we utilized synthetic retinoid receptor agonists (17Kagechika H. Kawachi E. Hashimoto Y. Himi T. Shudo K. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 2182-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Kagechika H. Kawachi E. Hashimoto Y. Shudo K. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Treatment with the pan-RAR agonist, Re80 (1 μm), or with an RARα/β-specific agonist, Am80 (1 μm), mimicked the effects of tRA on Mct8 mRNA expression. No significant induction was observed with the pan-RXR agonists, HX630 and PA024 (Fig. 1C). The induction of Mct8 by tRA was significantly inhibited by an RAR antagonist, LE135, as well as RXR antagonists HX531 and PA452 (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that stimulation of RAR is required for the induction of Mct8 in F9 cells. Expression of RXR, but not stimulation by ligand, is also probably required for the up-regulation of Mct8. Both RAR and RXR are expressed in many types of cancer cells, including MCF-7 breast cancer cells (25Kogai T. Kanamoto Y. Che L.H. Taki K. Moatamed F. Schultz J.J. Brent G.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our quantitative RT-PCR study indicated abundant Mct8 expression in untreated SH-SY5Y cells (∼36% of the level in tRA-treated F9 cells) (Table 1). tRA, however, did not significantly increase the MCT8 mRNA expression in SH-SY5Y or MCF7 cells (Table 1). JEG3 cells express abundant RXR but not RAR, and treatment with tRA did not induce MCT8 (Table 1).TABLE 1Expression of MCT8 mRNA in various cancer cell lines−tRA+tRA+tRA/−tRAF91.00 ± 0.0877.4 ± 4.46ap < 0.01, when compared with untreated cells.76.9 ± 8.32JEG32.03 × 10−4 ± 3.27 × 10−51.41 × 10−4 ± 8.50 × 10−50.74 ± 0.05MCF70.30 ± 0.010.51 ± 0.041.71 ± 0.19SH-SY5Y27.8 ± 3.3420.5 ± 3.540.73 ± 0.04a p < 0.01, when compared with untreated cells. Open table in a new tab Transfection of Mct8 into mammalian cells induces uptake of both T3 and T4 (20Friesema E.C. Kuiper G.G. Jansen J. Visser T.J. Kester M.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To investigate if the induction of endogenous Mct8 by tRA increases functional Mct8 expression, we measured the accumulation of T3 as well as T4 in F9 cells treated with or without tRA (1 μm) for 6 days. Cells were incubated with 125I-labeled T3 or T4 for 4–30 min in the presence of 0.1% BSA as a carrier. T3 uptake in tRA-treated cells was significantly increased in the first 4 min and partially saturated at 10 min (Fig. 2A). T3 uptake in tRA-treated cells at 10 min was significantly higher (∼4.1-fold) than that in untreated cells (Fig. 2A). T4 uptake was also significantly increased in the first 4 min and saturated at 10 min (Fig. 2B). T4 uptake in tRA-treated cells at 10 min was significantly higher (∼4.3-fold) than that in untreated cells (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with previous data of thyroid hormone uptake in mammalian cells transfected with vectors expressing Mct8 (20Friesema E.C. Kuiper G.G. Jansen J. Visser T.J. Kester M.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although Mct8 is one of the most efficient transporters of both T3 and T4, several other transporters have also been reported to mediate thyroid hormone uptake, including other SLC family members, Mct10 (or SLC16A10) (8Friesema E.C. Jansen J. Jachtenberg J.W. Visser W.E. Kester M.H. Visser T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), sodium/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide-1 (NTCP1, or SLC10A1), L-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1, or SLC7A5) and LAT2 (or SLC7A8) (9van der Deure W.M. Peeters R.P. Visser T.J. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 21: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and eight of the 15 members of the Oatp/Slco family (9van der Deure W.M. Peeters R.P. Visser T.J. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 21: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Hagenbuch B. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 21: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine if the tRA-induced thyroid hormone uptake in F9 cells is mediated by Mct8, we utilized pharmacological inhibitors of thyroid hormone transporters (26Wirth E.K. Roth S. Blechschmidt C. Hölter S.M. Becker L. Racz I. Zimmer A. Klopstock T. Gailus-Durner V. Fuchs H. Wurst W. Naumann T. Bräuer A. de Angelis M.H. Köhrle J. Grüters A. Schweizer U. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9439-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). An inhibitor of T3 uptake by Mct8, bromosulfophthalein (BSP), but not a broad spectrum inhibitor of Oatp, probenecid, significantly reduced the tRA-induced T3 uptake (Fig. 2C) with an IC50 of 112 μm (Fig. 2D). Modest T3 uptake was observed in the cells without tRA treatment, although it was not inhibited by BSP or probenecid (Fig. 2A). A Lat inhibitor, 2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid (BCH), significantly reduced the T3 uptake in both tRA-treated and -untreated F9 cells, whereas the induction by tRA was not abolished (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that the basal modest T3 uptake is mediated by Lat, whereas tRA-induced T3 uptake is dependent on the BSP-sensitive thyroid hormone transporter, Mct8. To determine if the tRA-induced thyroid hormone uptake (Fig. 2) was due to induction of Mct8, we measured the expression of mouse orthologs of other reported thyroid hormone transporter genes in response to tRA treatment in F9 cells (9van der Deure W.M. Peeters R.P. Visser T.J. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 21: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Hagenbuch B. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol.

The expression level of each gene was quantified by RT-PCR with a Gapdh standard for comparison of the relative expression among each gene. tRA treatment for 96 h increased expression of Mct10 and Lat2 (Table 2), although the magnitudes of induction (∼2.1- and ∼4.6-fold, respectively) were much less than that of Mct8 (∼678-fold). Interestingly, abundant expression of Lat1 (∼7 × 10−2-fold compared with Gapdh), as well as modest expression of Oatp4a1 (∼10−3-fold compared with Gapdh), was observed in both tRA-treated and untreated F9 cells, although tRA did not significantly influence the expression of these transporters (Table 2). Expression levels of Ntcp1 and the other seven Oatp genes were relatively small (less than 5 × 10−5-fold compared with Gapdh) and were not significantly increased by the tRA treatment (Table 2). These data indicate that, among the thyroid hormone transporter genes tested in F9 cells, only Mct8 was markedly induced by tRA.TABLE 2Expression of thyroid hormone transporter genes in F9 cells−tRA+tRA+tRA/−tRAMct8 (Slc16a2)1.92 × 10−5 ± 1.29 × 10−61.29 × 10−2 ± 1.25 × 10−3ap < 0.01, when compared with −tRA.678.1 ± 78.6Mct10 (Slc16a10)1.51 × 10−4 ± 3.73 × 10−53.11 × 10−4 ± 2.78 × 10−5ap < 0.01, when compared with −tRA.2.05 ± 0.53Ntcp1 (Slc10a1)<10−6<10−6NALat1 (Slc7a5)7.26 × 10−2 ± 2.11 × 10−36.68 × 10−2 ± 2.08 × 10−30.96 ± 0.18Lat2 (Slc7a8)8.83 × 10−5 ± 5.51 × 10−64.08 × 10−4 ± 5.49 × 10-6ap < 0.01, when compared with −tRA.4.63 ± 0.21Oatp (Slco) 1a14.66 × 10−5 ± 5.23 × 10−73.37 × 10−5 ± 3.21 × 10−60.72 ± 0.05Oatp (Slco) 1a4<10−6<10−6NAOatp (Slco) 1a5<10−6<10−6NAOatp (Slco) 1b21.10 × 10−5 ± 6.45 × 10−75.20 × 10−6 ± 4.26 × 10−70.47 ± 0.05Oatp (Slco) 1c1<10−6<10−6NAOatp (Slco) 4a11.45 × 10−3 ± 9.48 × 10−52.35 × 10−4 ± 2.15 × 10−50.16 ± 0.002Oatp (Slco) 6b1<10−6<10−6NAOatp (Slco) 6c1<10−6<10−6NAGapdh1.29 ± 0.020.93 ± 0.140.72 ± 0.07a p < 0.01, when compared with −tRA.

Thus, we sought to address the apparent discrepancy in Fur responsiveness to metals. Irr is a transcriptional regulator found in iron-limited cells. Here, we show that irr gene mRNA was regulated by both iron and manganese, and repression occurred only in the presence of both metals. Under these conditions, Fur occupied the irr promoter in vivo in the parent strain, and irr mRNA expression was derepressed in a fur mutant. Under low iron conditions, the irr promoter was occupied by Irr, but not by Fur, and control by manganese was lost. Fur occupancy of the irr promoter was dependent on manganese, but not iron, in an irr mutant, suggesting that Irr normally interferes with Fur binding. Correspondingly, regulation of irr mRNA was dependent only on manganese in the irr strain. The Irr binding site within the irr promoter partially overlaps the Fur binding site. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that Irr interfered with Fur binding in vitro. In addition, Fur repression of transcription from the irr promoter in vitro was relieved by Irr. We conclude that Fur mediates manganese-dependent repression of irr transcription and that Irr acts as an antirepressor under iron limitation by preventing Fur binding to the promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2022739314,"CD9P-1 is a cell surface protein with immunoglobulin domains and an unknown function that specifically associates with tetraspanins CD9 and CD81. Overexpression of CD9P-1 in HEK-293 cells induces dramatic changes in cell spreading and migration on various matrices. Experiments using time-lapse videomicroscopy revealed that CD9P-1 expression has led to higher cell motility on collagen I but lower motility on fibronectin through a beta1-integrins dependent mechanism. On collagen I, the increase in cell motility induced by CD9P-1 expression was found to involve integrin alpha2beta1 and CD9P-1 was observed to associate with this collagen receptor. The generation of CD9P-1 mutants demonstrated that the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains are necessary for inducing effects on cell motility. On the other hand, expression of tetraspanins CD9 or CD81 was shown to reverse the effects of CD9P-1 on cell motility on collagen I or fibronectin with a concomitant association with CD9P-1. Thus, the ratio of expression levels between CD9P-1 and its tetraspanin partners can regulate cell motility."

Our previous work indicates that the polysialylation of two N-glycans located on the fifth immunoglobulin domain (Ig5) of NCAM requires the presence of specific sequences in the adjacent fibronectin type III repeat (FN1). To understand the relationship of these two domains, we have solved the crystal structure of the NCAM Ig5-FN1 tandem. Unexpectedly, the structure reveals that the sites of Ig5 polysialylation are on the opposite face from the FN1 residues previously found to be critical for N-glycan polysialylation, suggesting that the Ig5-FN1 domain relationship may be flexible and/or that there is flexibility in the placement of Ig5 glycosylation sites for polysialylation. To test the latter possibility, new Ig5 glycosylation sites were engineered and their polysialylation tested. We observed some flexibility in glycosylation site location for polysialylation and demonstrate that the lack of polysialylation of a glycan attached to Asn-423 may be in part related to a lack of terminal processing. The data also suggest that, although the polysialyltransferases do not require the Ig5 domain for NCAM recognition, their ability to engage with this domain is necessary for polysialylation to occur on Ig5 N-glycans.

https://openalex.org/W2086144825,"Kinetochore proteins associate with centromeric DNA and spindle microtubules and play essential roles in chromosome segregation during mitosis. In this study, we uncovered a zebrafish mutant, stagnant and curly (stac), that carries the Tol2 transposon element inserted at the kinetochore protein H (cenph) locus. Mutant embryos exhibit discernible cell death as early as 20 hours postfertilization, extensive apoptosis, and upward curly tail during the pharyngula period and deform around 5 days postfertilization. The stac mutant phenotype can be rescued by cenph mRNA overexpression and mimicked by cenph knockdown with antisense morpholinos, suggesting the responsibility of cenph deficiency for stac mutants. We demonstrate that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is hyperactivated in stac mutants and that p53 knockdown partially blocks excess apoptosis in stac mutants. Mitotic cells in stac mutants show chromosome missegregation and are usually arrested in G(2)/M phase. Furthermore, compared with wild type siblings, heterozygous stac fish develop invasive tumors at a dramatically reduced rate, suggesting a reduced cancer risk. Taken together, our findings uncover an essential role of cenph in mitosis and embryonic development and its association with tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2078719249,"HbpS is an extracellular oligomeric protein, which has been shown to act in concert with the two-component system SenS-SenR during the sensing of redox stress. HbpS can bind and degrade heme under oxidative stress conditions, leading to a free iron ion. The liberated iron is subsequently coordinated on the protein surface. Furthermore, HbpS has been shown to modulate the phosphorylation state of the sensor kinase SenS as, in the absence of oxidative stress conditions, HbpS inhibits SenS autophosphorylation whereas the presence of heme or iron ions and redox-stressing agents enhances it. Using HbpS wild type and mutants as well as different biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that iron-mediated oxidative stress induces both secondary structure and overall intrinsic conformational changes within HbpS. We demonstrate in addition that HbpS is oxidatively modified, leading to the generation of highly reactive carbonyl groups and tyrosine-tyrosine bonds. Further examination of the crystal structure and subsequent mutational analyses allowed the identification of the tyrosine residue participating in dityrosine formation, which occurs between two monomers within the octomeric assembly. Therefore, it is proposed that oxidative modifications causing structural and conformational changes are responsible for the control of SenS and hence of the HbpS-SenS-SenR signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2046847450,"Epithelia often show, in addition to the ubiquitous apico-basal (A/B) axis, a polarization within the plane of the epithelium, perpendicular to the A/B axis. Such planar cell polarity (PCP) is for example evident in the regular arrangement of the stereocilia in the cochlea of the mammalian inner ear or in (almost) all Drosophila adult external structures. GIPCs (GAIP interacting protein, C terminus) were first identified in mammals and bind to the Galphai GTPase activating protein RGS-GAIP. They have been proposed to act in a G-protein coupled complex controlling vesicular trafficking. Although GIPCs have been found to bind to numerous proteins including Frizzled receptors, which participate in PCP establishment, there is little in vivo evidence for the functional role(s) of GIPCs. We show here that overexpressed Drosophila dGIPC alters PCP generation in the wing. We were however unable to find any binding between dGIPC and the Drosophila receptors Fz1 and Fz2. The effect of overexpressed dGIPC is likely due to an effect on the actin cytoskeleton via myosins, since it is almost entirely suppressed by removing a genomic copy of the Myosin VI/jaguar gene. Surprisingly, although dGIPC can interfere with PCP generation and myosin based processes, the complete loss-of-function of dGIPC gives viable adults with no PCP or other detectable defects arguing for a non-essential role of dGIPC in viability and normal Drosophila development."
https://openalex.org/W1993147870,"Human observers see a single mixed color (yellow) when different colors (red and green) rapidly alternate. Accumulating evidence suggests that the critical temporal frequency beyond which chromatic fusion occurs does not simply reflect the temporal limit of peripheral encoding. However, it remains poorly understood how the central processing controls the fusion frequency. Here we show that the fusion frequency can be elevated by extra-retinal signals during smooth pursuit. This eye movement can keep the image of a moving target in the fovea, but it also introduces a backward retinal sweep of the stationary background pattern. We found that the fusion frequency was higher when retinal color changes were generated by pursuit-induced background motions than when the same retinal color changes were generated by object motions during eye fixation. This temporal improvement cannot be ascribed to a general increase in contrast gain of specific neural mechanisms during pursuit, since the improvement was not observed with a pattern flickering without changing position on the retina or with a pattern moving in the direction opposite to the background motion during pursuit. Our findings indicate that chromatic fusion is controlled by a cortical mechanism that suppresses motion blur. A plausible mechanism is that eye-movement signals change spatiotemporal trajectories along which color signals are integrated so as to reduce chromatic integration at the same locations (i.e., along stationary trajectories) on the retina that normally causes retinal blur during fixation."
https://openalex.org/W1975979524,"The inhibition of specific SH2 domain mediated protein-protein interactions as an effective chemotherapeutic approach in the treatment of diseases remains a challenge. That different conformations of peptide-ligands are preferred by different SH2 domains is an underappreciated observation from the structural analysis of phosphotyrosine peptide binding to SH2 domains that may aid in future drug design. To explore the nature of ligand binding, we use simulated annealing (SA) to sample the conformational space of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides complexed with the Src SH2 domain. While in good agreement with the crystallographic and NMR studies of high-affinity phosphopeptide-SH2 domain complexes, the results suggest that the structural basis for phopsphopeptide- Src SH2 interactions is more complex than the ""two-pronged plug two-hole socket"" model. A systematic study of peptides of type pYEEX, where pY is phosphotyrosine and X is a hydrophobic residue, indicates that these peptides can assume two conformations, one extended and one helical, representing the balance between the interaction of residue X with the hydrophobic hole on the surface of the Src SH2 domain, and its contribution to the inherent tendency of the two glutamic acids to form an alpha-helix. In contrast, a beta-turn conformation, almost identical to that observed in the crystal structure of pYVNV bound to the Grb2 SH2 domain, predominates for pYXNX peptides, even in the presence of isoleucine at the third position. While peptide binding affinities, as measured by fluorescence polarization, correlate with the relative proportion of extended peptide conformation, these results suggest a model where all three residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine determine the conformation of the bound phosphopeptide. The information obtained in this work can be used in the design of specific SH2 domain inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2130258391,"Some low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) prolong survival of cancer patients and inhibit experimental metastasis. The underlying mechanisms are still not clear but it has been suggested that LMWHs (at least in part) limit metastasis by preventing cancer cell-induced destruction of the endothelial glycocalyx.To prove or refute this hypothesis, we determined the net effects of the endothelial glycocalyx in cancer cell extravasation and we assessed the anti-metastatic effect of a clinically used LMWH in the presence and absence of an intact endothelial glycocalyx. We show that both exogenous enzymatic degradation as well as endogenous genetic modification of the endothelial glycocalyx decreased pulmonary tumor formation in a murine experimental metastasis model. Moreover, LMWH administration significantly reduced the number of pulmonary tumor foci and thus experimental metastasis both in the presence or absence of an intact endothelial glycocalyx.In summary, this paper shows that the net effect of the endothelial glycocalyx enhances experimental metastasis and that a LMWH does not limit experimental metastasis by a process involving the endothelial glycocalyx."

https://openalex.org/W2149962145,"Background The mechanisms by which DNA damage triggers suppression of transcription of a large number of genes are poorly understood. DNA damage rapidly induces a release of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from the large inactive multisubunit 7SK snRNP complex. P-TEFb is required for transcription of most class II genes through stimulation of RNA polymerase II elongation and cotranscriptional pre-mRNA processing. Methodology/Principal Findings We show here that caffeine prevents UV-induced dissociation of P-TEFb as well as transcription inhibition. The caffeine-effect does not involve PI3-kinase-related protein kinases, because inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family members (ATM, ATR and DNA-PK) neither prevents P-TEFb dissociation nor transcription inhibition. Finally, caffeine prevention of transcription inhibition is independent from DNA damage. Conclusion/Significance Pharmacological prevention of P-TEFb/7SK snRNP dissociation and transcription inhibition following UV-induced DNA damage is correlated."
