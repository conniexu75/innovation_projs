Zhang et al. determined the x-ray crystal structure of a key protein in the virus' life cycle: the main protease. This enzyme cuts the polyproteins translated from viral RNA to yield functional viral proteins. The authors also developed a lead compound into a potent inhibitor and obtained a structure with the inhibitor bound, work that may provide a basis for development of anticoronaviral drugs.

https://openalex.org/W3011113661,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a lytic RNA virus that triggers receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated pathways of apoptosis and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL)-dependent necroptosis in infected cells. ZBP1 initiates RIPK3-driven cell death by sensing IAV RNA and activating RIPK3. Here, we show that replicating IAV generates Z-RNAs, which activate ZBP1 in the nucleus of infected cells. ZBP1 then initiates RIPK3-mediated MLKL activation in the nucleus, resulting in nuclear envelope disruption, leakage of DNA into the cytosol, and eventual necroptosis. Cell death induced by nuclear MLKL was a potent activator of neutrophils, a cell type known to drive inflammatory pathology in virulent IAV disease. Consequently, MLKL-deficient mice manifest reduced nuclear disruption of lung epithelia, decreased neutrophil recruitment into infected lungs, and increased survival following a lethal dose of IAV. These results implicate Z-RNA as a new pathogen-associated molecular pattern and describe a ZBP1-initiated nucleus-to-plasma membrane inside-out death pathway with potentially pathogenic consequences in severe cases of influenza."

Here, we present comprehensive datasets and analyses of brain transcriptomes and blood metabolomes from human apoE2-, apoE3-, and apoE4-targeted replacement mice across young, middle, and old ages with both sexes. We found that age had the greatest impact on brain transcriptomes highlighted by an immune module led by Trem2 and Tyrobp, whereas APOE4 was associated with upregulation of multiple Serpina3 genes. Importantly, these networks and gene expression changes were mostly conserved in human brains. Finally, we observed a significant interaction between age, APOE genotype, and sex on unfolded protein response pathway. In the periphery, APOE2 drove distinct blood metabolome profile highlighted by the upregulation of lipid metabolites.

Our work identifies unique and interactive molecular pathways underlying AD risk factors providing valuable resources for discovery and validation research in model systems and humans. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) as senile plaques and intracellular accumulation of pathological tau as neurofibrillary tangles in the brain (Blennow et al., 2006Blennow K. de Leon M.J. Zetterberg H. Alzheimer’s disease.Lancet. 2006; 368: 387-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar). Although the cause of sporadic AD is likely multifactorial, age is the greatest risk factor wherein 3% of people between the ages of 65 and 74, 17% of people between ages 75 and 84, and 32% of people aged 85 or older have AD (Brookmeyer et al., 1998Brookmeyer R.

The aging brain undergoes functional decline likely driven by decreased synaptic density and functions and is associated with inflammation induced by the reactive glial cells including astrocytes (Boisvert et al., 2018Boisvert M.M.

In addition to age, it is well documented that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (Bu, 2009Bu G. Apolipoprotein E and its receptors in Alzheimer’s disease: pathways, pathogenesis and therapy.Nat.

Carrying one copy of APOE4 increases the AD risk by 3- to 4-fold, and two copies by 10- to 15-fold compared to those carrying two copies of APOE3 (Holtzman et al., 2012Holtzman D.M. Herz J. Bu G.

Indeed, around 65% of all AD patients have at least one copy of the APOE4 allele (Mayeux et al., 1998Mayeux R. Saunders A.M. Shea S. Mirra S. Evans D. Roses A.D. Hyman B.T. Crain B. Tang M.X.

Multiple Aβ-dependent and Aβ-independent mechanisms are likely involved in the risk determining effect of APOE polymorphism from human or mouse studies (Kanekiyo et al., 2014Kanekiyo T. Xu H. Bu G.

Collectively, these emerging lines of evidence suggest that age, APOE genotype, and sex independently and/or interactively affect the pathogenesis of AD. Investigating the molecular pathways impacted by these factors is of paramount importance to developing therapeutic strategies for AD. Heterogeneity in humans due to genetic diversity and the impact of environmental and lifestyle differences limits the molecular study of disease mechanisms. Therefore, mouse models offer opportunities to study the effects of disease-related risk factors in a relatively pure genetic background within a controlled environment. In this study, we comprehensively profiled the brain transcriptomes and serum metabolomes of human apoE-targeted replacement (TR) mice, in which the murine Apoe gene locus is replaced with human APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4 gene (Sullivan et al., 1997Sullivan P.M.

These apoE-TR animal models have been extensively used to assess the role of apoE isoforms in brain homeostasis and aging (Zhao et al., 2017aZhao N. Liu C.C. Van Ingelgom A.J. Martens Y.A. Linares C.

To ensure availability of our transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets for widespread utilization, we established a user-friendly website (https://www.gbulab.com/searchlinks). Additionally, all datasets described in this study are available to the research community through AD Knowledge Portal (https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/). Guided by these datasets, we identified promising candidates of genes, metabolites, gene/metabolite co-expression networks/modules, and molecular pathways influenced by age, APOE genotype, and sex. We analyzed the cerebral cortex transcriptomics and serum metabolomics in male and female apoE2-TR, apoE3-TR and, apoE4-TR mice at 3, 12, and 24 months of age (experimental design in graphical abstract). In total, our analyses included 18 different experimental conditions (n = 7–8 mice per condition) for both transcriptomics and metabolomics. We first investigated how APOE genotype, age, sex, and their interactions contributed to the variation in the transcriptomics and metabolomics profiles. Interestingly, age was the strongest factor for the brain transcriptomes (Figure 1A), whereas APOE genotype had the greatest influence on the serum metabolomes (Figure 1C). Consistent with the source of variation analyses, principal-component analyses (PCAs) revealed a clear separation of the brain samples of young age cohort (3 months) from those of middle age (12 months) and old age (24 months) cohorts (Figure 1B). Although the separation between male and female was also clear by PCA, the distinguished pattern disappeared after removing the sex chromosome genes (Figure S1). Among the serum samples, a clear separation was observed between the apoE2-TR mice and other apoE-TR mice (Figure 1D). Next, we identified the brain transcriptional signatures affected by APOE genotype, age, and sex. To place gene expression changes in a systems-level framework, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10446) Google Scholar, Zhang and Horvath, 2005Zhang B. Horvath S. A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2005; 4: Article17Crossref PubMed Scopus (3369) Google Scholar) on the brain transcriptomes. We identified 16 co-expression modules (Figure 2A; Table S1). Four modules were significantly correlated with APOE genotype, including lightcyan, tan, cyan, and yellow (p < 0.01) (Figure 2A). Among the four modules, two were upregulated (lightcyan and tan) and two were downregulated (cyan and yellow) in APOE4 genotype compared to APOE2 or APOE3 genotype (Figure 2A). Ten modules were significantly correlated with age, including eight upregulated (blue, pink, brown, tan, black, magenta, green, and greenyellow) and two downregulated modules (turquoise and red) (Figure 2A). One module, magenta, was significantly correlated with sex, and was upregulated in females compared to males (Figure 2A). Further network analysis of the eigengene and traits revealed strong correlations between the lightcyan module and APOE genotype; the blue, pink modules and age; and the black and brown modules (eigengene correlation of at least 0.5, Figures 2B and 2C). To better understand the modules associated with the APOE genotype, we performed functional annotation of these modules and identified the top 10 intramodular hub genes in each module. The top 10 hub genes in the lightcyan module were mainly from the Serpina3 gene family, including Serpina3c, Serpina3f, Serpina3k, Serpina3l-ps, Serpina3m, and Serpina3n (Figure 2D). Genes in this module were enriched for the regulation of endopeptidase inhibitor activity (Figure 2E). The module eigengene (ME) of the lightcyan module was upregulated in APOE4 compared to the APOE2 or APOE3 genotype (Figure 2F). Additionally, the cyan module, enriched for lysosome and purine deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate metabolic processes, was significantly downregulated in the APOE4 genotype (Figures S2A–S2C). The yellow and tan modules, enriched for RNA splicing and ribosome, respectively, were slightly upregulated in APOE4 genotype (Figures S2D–S2F; Figures S3D–S3F). We further examined modules associated with aging. The blue module, significantly correlated with age, was upregulated at 12 and 24 months compared to 3 months (Figure 2I). Genes in this module were enriched for processes relating to extracellular vesicles (EVs) (Figure 2H). The top hub genes in this module are known to be detected in EVs, including Anln, Arhgef10, B3galt5, Csrp1, Endod1, Plekhb1, and Zcchc24 (Pathan et al., 2019Pathan M. Fonseka P. Chitti S.V. Kang T.

Vesiclepedia 2019: a compendium of RNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites in extracellular vesicles.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D516-D519Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) (Figure 2G). Furthermore, the pink module was also significantly correlated with aging, which was upregulated at 24 months compared to 3 and 12 months (Figure 2L). Genes in this module were enriched for immune response (Figure 2K), with top hub genes including Trem2, Tyrobp, and Cd68 (Figure 2J), all of which are involved in microglial functions and immune responses in the brain (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H. Spinrad A. Weiner A. Matcovitch-Natan O. Dvir-Szternfeld R. Ulland T.K. David E. Baruch K. Lara-Astaiso D.

Colonna M. TREM2 - a key player in microglial biology and Alzheimer disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2018; 14: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The turquoise and red modules, enriched for respiration chain and synaptic transmission, respectively, were significantly downregulated after 12 months of age (Figures S4A–S4F). The profiles of brown, tan, black, green, greenyellow, and magenta modules slightly increased with aging and were enriched for amine biosynthetic process, ribosome, protein targeting to vacuole, intracellular membrane bounded organelle, EVs, and neurological system process, respectively (Figures S3A–S3R). The magenta module was also slightly elevated in female mice (Figures S3P–S3R). To validate the top gene and pathway that were dysregulated by APOE4, we performed qPCR experiments to detect the expression of Serpina3n, which is the mouse ortholog of the human SERPINA3 gene (Horvath et al., 2005Horvath A.J. Irving J.A. Rossjohn J. Law R.H. Bottomley S.P. Quinsey N.S. Pike R.N. Coughlin P.B. Whisstock J.C. The murine orthologue of human antichymotrypsin: a structural paradigm for clade A3 serpins.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43168-43178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found significantly elevated Serpina3n mRNA levels in APOE4 mice at 3, 12, and 24 months of age (Figure 3A), consistent with the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) results. The effect of APOE4 on elevating brain Serpina3n level was further confirmed by using in situ hybridization to stain Serpina3n mRNA (Figures 3B and 3C) and western blotting to detect Serpina3n protein in an independent cohort of apoE animals (Figures 3D and 3E). To further test whether the effect of APOE4 on regulating Serpina3n is systematic or specific to the central nervous system, we assessed the Serpina3n level in the blood, as well as in the liver where Serpina3n is synthesized and secreted into the circulation (Baker et al., 2007Baker C. Belbin O. Kalsheker N. Morgan K. SERPINA3 (aka alpha-1-antichymotrypsin).Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 2821-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the blood Serpina3n level was not elevated but rather decreased in APOE4 mice compare to APOE3 mice, and this difference was exacerbated with aging (Figure 3F), whereas the mRNA and protein levels did not differ in the liver of APOE4 mice compared to APOE3 mice (Figures 3G–3I). Together, these data suggest that the upregulation of Serpina3n by APOE4 is brain specific. Additionally, to validate the upregulated immune response with aging, we selected one of the hub genes in the pink module, Cd68, which encodes a lysosomal protein expressed at high levels by activated microglia and at low levels by resting microglia in the brain (Walker and Lue, 2015Walker D.G. Lue L.F. Immune phenotypes of microglia in human neurodegenerative disease: challenges to detecting microglial polarization in human brains.Alzheimers Res. Ther. 2015; 7: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and performed immunohistological staining with the brain slides from apoE-TR mice. Consistent with upregulated Cd68 mRNA with aging, we also found significantly higher CD68 immunoreactivity in the mouse brain at 24 months of age compared to those at 3 months of age (Figure 3J and 3L), whereas the general microglia marker ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA1) (Walker and Lue, 2015Walker D.G. Lue L.F. Immune phenotypes of microglia in human neurodegenerative disease: challenges to detecting microglial polarization in human brains.Alzheimers Res. Ther. 2015; 7: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) did not change significantly with aging (Figures 3K and 3M), confirming the aging effects on activating microglia. We next assessed preservation of the APOE genotype, age, and sex-related modules in human post-mortem brain samples to validate their human relevance. We used the previously published RNA-seq datasets of the prefrontal cortex from Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) (Bennett et al., 2018Bennett D.A. Buchman A.S. Boyle P.A. Barnes L.L. Wilson R.S. Schneider J.A. Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2018; 64: S161-S189Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and the temporal cortex and cerebellum from the Mayo Clinic (Allen et al., 2016Allen M. Carrasquillo M.M. Funk C. Heavner B.D. Zou F. Younkin C.S. Burgess J.D. Chai H.S. Crook J. Eddy J.A. et al.Human whole genome genotype and transcriptome data for Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.Sci.

We found that 8, 10, and 9 out of 16 mouse modules were preserved in the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and the cerebellum, respectively (Figures 4A, 4D, and 4G ). As aging is the strongest risk factor for AD, we sought to assess whether the aging-related pink and blue mouse modules were also related to AD in humans. Interestingly, both the pink immune module and the blue EVs module were well preserved in all three human brain datasets and significantly upregulated in AD cases compared to controls in the prefrontal cortex (Figures 4B and 4C) and the temporal cortex (Figures 4E and 4F), consistent with their upregulation with aging in mouse cortex (Figures 2G–2L). In the cerebellum, the pink module did not change between AD and control (Figure 4I), but the blue module showed trending downregulation in AD cases, opposite of what we found in temporal cortex (Figure 4H). We further assessed whether the protein levels of these module genes were also affected by AD by analyzing a previously published proteomics dataset (Ping et al., 2018Ping L. Duong D.M. Yin L. Gearing M. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. Seyfried N.T. Global quantitative analysis of the human brain proteome in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease.Sci. Data. 2018; 5: 180036Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the protein level of the pink immune module was significantly upregulated in AD cases compared to controls in the anterior cingulate gyrus and frontal cortex regions (Figure S5A), reflecting robust gene to protein association in immune response and AD in different cortical regions. However, the blue EVs module showed trending upregulation in the anterior cingulate gyrus but downregulation in frontal cortex (Figure S5B), indicating that the regulation of this module in AD might be dependent on brain regions. Taken together, our analyses show that the pink immune and blue EVs co-expression modules were conserved from mouse to human and dysregulated in AD, confirming that our findings are relevant to AD pathogenesis in humans. The lightcyan module associated with APOE4 was not preserved in any of the three human RNA-seq datasets (Figures 4A, 4D, and 4G). This is likely due to the fact that humans only have one SERPINA3 protein-coding gene, whereas mice have ten protein-coding genes that are orthologous or paralogous to human SERPINA3 (Heit et al., 2013Heit C. Jackson B.C. McAndrews M. Wright M.W. Thompson D.C. Silverman G.A. Nebert D.W. Vasiliou V. Update of the human and mouse SERPIN gene superfamily.Hum. Genomics. 2013; 7: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), six of which were hub genes in the lightcyan module (Figure 2D). Consequently, we examined the expression levels of SERPINA3 and ATF4, two mouse hub genes with human homologs. Interestingly, both SERPINA3 and ATF4 gene expression were significantly upregulated in APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers in the temporal cortex (Figures 4J and 4L, left panel). Additionally, the expression of these two genes both showed upregulation in AD cases compared to controls (Figures 4K and 4M, left panel). However, the difference between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers disappeared after adjusting for AD status (Figures 4J and 4L, right panel), whereas the upregulation was still significant in AD versus control after adjusting for APOE4 status (Figures 4K and 4M, right panel), suggesting that the effects of AD pathology are stronger than APOE genotype or that the APOE4 effects are AD dependent in these human samples. We then evaluated genes with significant differential expression among different APOE genotypes, ages, and sexes (Table S2). We found 189 downregulated and 213 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in APOE2 versus APOE3 genotypes; 117 downregulated and 144 upregulated DEGs in APOE2 versus APOE4 genotype, and 97 downregulated and 112 upregulated DEGs in APOE3 versus APOE4 genotype (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05, fold change ≥1.2). Differential expression among three APOE genotypes was observed in 1,813 genes (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05; Table S2; Figure S6A; Figures 5A–5C). Hierarchical clustering of the top 20 genes successfully separated the samples by APOE genotype (Figure 5D; Figures S6B, S6D, and S6F). Among these DEGs, the Serpina3 family genes were upregulated in the APOE4 genotype compared to APOE2 or APOE3 genotype, consistent with our findings from WGCNA (Figures 2D–2F). On the other hand, the expression levels of Wdfy1, Alkbh6, and Rdh13 were lower in APOE4 genotype. Wdfy1 and Alkbh6 were also hub genes in the cyan module, which was downregulated in APOE4 (Figures S2A–S2C). Additionally, the expression levels of Zc3h7b, Oscar, Thnsl1, and Tmc4 genes were downregulated in APOE3 compared to APOE2 or APOE4 genotype; the Xaf1, Ech1, and Nnt gene expression levels were upregulated whereas the expression levels of Olfr316, Lyrm7, Alox8, and Zfp14 were downregulated in APOE2 compared to APOE3 and APOE4 genotype (Figure 5D).

Here, we describe a previously unidentified protein C receptor positive (Procr+) cell population in adult mouse pancreas through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The cells reside in islets, do not express differentiation markers, and feature epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition characteristics. By genetic lineage tracing, Procr+ islet cells undergo clonal expansion and generate all four endocrine cell types during adult homeostasis. Sorted Procr+ cells, representing ∼1% of islet cells, can robustly form islet-like organoids when cultured at clonal density. Exponential expansion can be maintained over long periods by serial passaging, while differentiation can be induced at any time point in culture. β cells dominate in differentiated islet organoids, while α, δ, and PP cells occur at lower frequencies. The organoids are glucose-responsive and insulin-secreting. Upon transplantation in diabetic mice, these organoids reverse disease. These findings demonstrate that the adult mouse pancreatic islet contains a population of Procr+ endocrine progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W3011011203,"Mutations in Shank3 are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders and neural circuit changes in several brain areas, but the cellular mechanisms that underlie these defects are not understood. Homeostatic forms of plasticity allow central circuits to maintain stable function during experience-dependent development, leading us to ask whether loss of Shank3 might impair homeostatic plasticity and circuit-level compensation to perturbations. We found that Shank3 loss in vitro abolished synaptic scaling and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity, deficits that could be rescued by treatment with lithium. Further, Shank3 knockout severely compromised the in vivo ability of visual cortical circuits to recover from perturbations to sensory drive. Finally, lithium treatment ameliorated a repetitive self-grooming phenotype in Shank3 knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that Shank3 loss severely impairs the ability of central circuits to harness homeostatic mechanisms to compensate for perturbations in drive, which, in turn, may render them more vulnerable to such perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W3012923032,"Mitophagy is a key process regulating mitochondrial quality control. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate mitophagy, but these have mostly been studied using stably expressed non-native proteins in immortalized cell lines. In skeletal muscle, mitophagy and its molecular mechanisms require more thorough investigation. To measure mitophagy directly, we generated a stable skeletal muscle C2C12 cell line, expressing a mitophagy reporter construct (mCherry-green fluorescence protein-mtFIS1101-152 ). Here, we report that both carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) treatment and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation by 991 promote mitochondrial fission via phosphorylation of MFF and induce mitophagy by ~20%. Upon CCCP treatment, but not 991, ubiquitin phosphorylation, a read-out of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) activity, and Parkin E3 ligase activity toward CDGSH iron sulfur domain 1 (CISD1) were increased. Although the PINK1-Parkin signaling pathway is active in response to CCCP treatment, we observed no change in markers of mitochondrial protein content. Interestingly, our data shows that TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylation is increased after both CCCP and 991 treatments, suggesting TBK1 activation to be independent of both PINK1 and Parkin. Finally, we confirmed in non-muscle cell lines that TBK1 phosphorylation occurs in the absence of PINK1 and is regulated by AMPK-dependent signaling. Thus, AMPK activation promotes mitophagy by enhancing mitochondrial fission (via MFF phosphorylation) and autophagosomal engulfment (via TBK1 activation) in a PINK1-Parkin independent manner."

https://openalex.org/W3012866857,"Blockade of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) by therapeutic antibodies has shown to be a promising strategy in cancer therapy, yet clinical response in many types of cancer, including prostate cancer (PCa), is limited. Tumor cells secrete PD-L1 through exosomes or splice variants, which has been described as a new mechanism for the resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy in multiple cancers, including PCa. This suggests that cutting off the secretion or expression of PD-L1 might improve the response rate of PD-L1 blockade therapy in PCa treatment. Here we report that p300/CBP inhibition by a small molecule p300/CBP inhibitor dramatically enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade treatment in a syngeneic model of PCa by blocking both the intrinsic and IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, p300/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) by the transcription factor IRF-1, which induced the acetylation of Histone H3 at CD274 promoter followed by the transcription of CD274. A485, a p300/CBP inhibitor, abrogated this process and cut off the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack. This finding reports a new mechanism of how cancer cells regulate PD-L1 expression through epigenetic factors and provides a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment."

Although mitochondrial function is crucial for brain homeostasis, it remains unknown whether mitochondrial disruption contributes to social behavioral deficits. Here, we show that Drosophila mutants in the homolog of the human CYFIP1, a gene linked to autism and schizophrenia, exhibit mitochondrial hyperactivity and altered group behavior. We identify the regulation of GABA availability by mitochondrial activity as a biologically relevant mechanism and demonstrate its contribution to social behavior. Specifically, increased mitochondrial activity causes gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) sequestration in the mitochondria, reducing GABAergic signaling and resulting in social deficits. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of mitochondrial activity or GABA signaling corrects the observed abnormalities.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking CYFIP1 deficiency with alterations in behavior and cognition remain unknown. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying social behaviors in Drosophila, demonstrating a mechanistic link between alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, neuronal communication, and social behavior. By using CYFIP haploinsufficient flies, we show that an increase in mitochondrial activity, energy metabolism, and membrane potential causes abnormal gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling, leading to deficits in social group interactions in flies. Furthermore, we identify the solute carrier Aralar as the mitochondrial transporter responsible for uptake of GABA into mitochondria, which is activated by mitochondrial membrane polarization. We provide genetic, biochemical, pharmacological, and morphological evidence that explains how dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis regulates GABA signaling and the social component of behavior. CYFIP haploinsufficiency in humans and flies has been shown recently to confer domain-specific cognitive impairments (Woo et al., 2019Woo Y.J. Kanellopoulos A.K. Hemati P. Kirschen J. Nebel R.A.

https://openalex.org/W3012489854,"Working memory relies on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), where microcircuits of pyramidal neurons enable persistent firing in the absence of sensory input, maintaining information through recurrent excitation. This activity relies on acetylcholine, although the molecular mechanisms for this dependence are not thoroughly understood. This study investigated the role of muscarinic M1 receptors (M1Rs) in the dlPFC using iontophoresis coupled with single-unit recordings from aging monkeys with naturally occurring cholinergic depletion. We found that M1R stimulation produced an inverted-U dose response on cell firing and behavioral performance when given systemically to aged monkeys. Immunoelectron microscopy localized KCNQ isoforms (Kv7.2, Kv7.3, and Kv7.5) on layer III dendrites and spines, similar to M1Rs. Iontophoretic manipulation of KCNQ channels altered cell firing and reversed the effects of M1R compounds, suggesting that KCNQ channels are one mechanism for M1R actions in the dlPFC. These results indicate that M1Rs may be an appropriate target to treat cognitive disorders with cholinergic alterations."
https://openalex.org/W3012223144,"Abstract The transcription factor TCF7L2 is indispensable for intestinal tissue homeostasis where it transmits mitogenic Wnt/β-Catenin signals in stem and progenitor cells, from which intestinal tumors arise. Yet, TCF7L2 belongs to the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer (CRC), and tumor-suppressive functions of TCF7L2 were proposed. This apparent paradox warrants to clarify the role of TCF7L2 in colorectal carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated TCF7L2 dependence/independence of CRC cells and the cellular and molecular consequences of TCF7L2 loss-of-function. By genome editing we achieved complete TCF7L2 inactivation in several CRC cell lines without loss of viability, showing that CRC cells have widely lost the strict requirement for TCF7L2 . TCF7L2 deficiency impaired G1/S progression, reminiscent of the physiological role of TCF7L2. In addition, TCF7L2 -negative cells exhibited morphological changes, enhanced migration, invasion, and collagen adhesion, albeit the severity of the phenotypic alterations manifested in a cell-line-specific fashion. To provide a molecular framework for the observed cellular changes, we performed global transcriptome profiling and identified gene-regulatory networks in which TCF7L2 positively regulates the proto-oncogene MYC , while repressing the cell cycle inhibitors CDKN2C/CDKN2D . Consistent with its function in curbing cell motility and invasion, TCF7L2 directly suppresses the pro-metastatic transcription factor RUNX2 and impinges on the expression of cell adhesion molecules. Altogether, we conclude that the proliferation-stimulating activity of TCF7L2 persists in CRC cells. In addition, TCF7L2 acts as invasion suppressor. Despite its negative impact on cell cycle progression, TCF7L2 loss-of-function may thereby increase malignancy, which could explain why TCF7L2 is mutated in a sizeable fraction of colorectal tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3011921546,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes in 18-month old (corrected age) preterm infants who received an intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection for the treatment of type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Methods In this ten-year retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent ROP screening at Kyushu University Hospital. Among the patients who received IVB or laser photocoagulation (LPC) for the treatment of type 1 ROP, we included infants whose neurodevelopmental examination (the Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development [KSPD]) results at 18 months corrected age were available. Then, the effect of IVB on the developmental quotient (DQ) in each KSPD domain (Postural-Movement, Cognitive-Adaptive, or Language-Social domain) or the overall DQ was investigated by performing linear regression analysis. Results Out of the 513 patients reviewed, 53 were included in the study. IVB and LPC were performed for 14 and 39 patients, respectively. Administration of IVB was significantly associated with neurodevelopmental delay in the Language-Social domain (p = 0.01). The observed association remained even after adjusting for gestational age and birth weight (p = 0.03). Conclusions Administration of IVB may introduce a risk of developmental impairment of interpersonal relationships, socializations, and/or verbal abilities of preterm children. We recommended that preterm infants who received IVB undergo a neurodevelopmental reassessment during their school years or in adulthood."

At the same time, uneven economic growth in countries is the prime cause of inequality in energy consumption. Keeping in view the worth of energy in the growth process, this study quantifies the impact of energy inequalities and trade on environmental quality over the period 1995-2018 for 57 countries. The Theil approach is used to quantify inter-and intra-regional disparities in five energy sources; oil, coal, natural gas hydroelectricity, and renewable energy. The results show that North America has the highest oil consumption inequality between the regions while East Asia & Pacific has the highest index value within the regions. Coal consumption inequality is declining in North America, but not in East Asia and the Pacific. Europe & Central Asia, and North America have the highest inequalities in natural gas consumption between the regions. Inequality is shrinking in hydropower consumption between the regions, however, such trend has not loomed within the regions. Europe & Central Asia and East Asia & Pacific have major renewable consumption inequalities within the regions. Generally, there is a decreasing temporal trend in energy consumption inequalities of all energy sources. The GMM technique is applied to investigate the impact of energy inequalities and trade openness on environmental quality. The results reveal that energy inequalities degrade environmental quality. Moreover, trade has a positive impact on environmental quality. However, democratic countries can be advantageous to improve the environmental quality. The study implies that countries should take actions to reduce energy inequalities within and between the regions. Specialization in production through trade can also be an option for improvement in the environment."

PLD1 is directly and synergistically regulated by protein kinase C, Arf and Rho GTPases, and the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Here, we present a 1.8 Å-resolution crystal structure of the human PLD1 catalytic domain, which is characterized by a globular fold with a funnel-shaped hydrophobic cavity leading to the active site. Adjacent is a PIP2-binding polybasic pocket at the membrane interface that is essential for activity. The C terminus folds into and contributes part of the catalytic pocket, which harbors a phosphohistidine that mimics an intermediate stage of the catalytic cycle. Mapping of PLD1 mutations that disrupt RhoA activation identifies the RhoA-PLD1 binding interface. This structure sheds light on PLD1 regulation by lipid and protein effectors, enabling rationale inhibitor design for this well-studied therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3012896646,"Iron homeostasis is essential for mitochondrial function, and iron deficiency has been associated with skeletal muscle weakness and decreased exercise capacity in patients with different chronic disorders. We hypothesized that iron deficiency-induced loss of skeletal muscle mitochondria is caused by increased mitochondrial clearance. To study this, C2C12 myotubes were subjected to the iron chelator deferiprone. Mitochondrial parameters and key constituents of mitophagy pathways were studied in presence or absence of pharmacological autophagy inhibition or knockdown of mitophagy-related proteins. Furthermore, it was explored if mitochondria were present in extracellular vesicles (EV). Iron chelation resulted in an increase in BCL2/Adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and BNIP3-like gene and protein levels, and the appearance of mitochondria encapsulated by lysosome-like vesicular structures in myotubes. Moreover, mitochondria were secreted via EV. These changes were associated with cellular mitochondrial impairments. These impairments were unaltered by autophagy inhibition, knockdown of mitophagy-related proteins BNIP3 and BNIP3L, or knockdown of their upstream regulator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. In conclusion, mitophagy is not essential for development of iron deficiency-induced reductions in mitochondrial proteins or respiratory capacity. The secretion of mitochondria-containing EV could present an additional pathway via which mitochondria can be cleared from iron chelation-exposed myotubes."

As they are tightly integrated into neural networks, label-free tools that can modulate cell function are needed to evaluate the role of astrocytes in brain physiology and dysfunction. Using live-cell fluorescence imaging, pharmacology, electrophysiology, and genetic manipulation, we show that pulsed infrared light can modulate astrocyte function through changes in intracellular Ca2+ and water dynamics, providing unique mechanistic insight into the effect of pulsed infrared laser light on astroglial cells. Water transport is activated and, IP3 R, TRPA1, TRPV4, and Aquaporin-4 are all involved in shaping the dynamics of infrared pulse-evoked intracellular calcium signal. These results demonstrate that astrocyte function can be modulated with infrared light. We expect that targeted control over calcium dynamics and water transport will help to study the crucial role of astrocytes in edema, ischemia, glioma progression, stroke, and epilepsy."

Objectives We evaluated the weighted prevalence of and demographic factors associated with radiographic knee OA in Korean adults. Methods We analyzed data from 12,287 individuals aged ≥ 50 years who had radiographs of the knee taken in the 2010–2013 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Radiographic knee OA was defined based on the Kellgren–Lawrence grade, as follows: 0: No abnormal finding 1: Mild degenerative changes, minute osteophytes 2: Mild knee OA, definite osteophytes 3: Moderate knee OA, moderate joint-space narrowing and definite osteophytes 4: Severe knee OA, severe joint-space narrowing with subchondral sclerosis. Results We found that the prevalence of radiographic knee OA in the Korean adult population was 35.1%. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated independently with radiographic knee OA, with age, sex, area of residence, education level, household income, and obesity serving as covariates. Women were at greater risk than men of having knee OA (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.90–2.37, p < 0.001). Compared with subjects aged 50–59 years, adults aged ≥ 80 years were at 8.87-fold (95% CI 7.12–11.06, p < 0.001) greater risk of having knee OA. Residence in a rural area was associated with a greater risk of having radiographic knee OA than was residence in an urban area (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.48, p = 0.004), regardless of knee OA severity (Kellgren–Lawrence grades ≥2, ≥3, and 4). Elementary school graduates had 1.71-fold (p < 0.001) greater risks of having knee OA than did college graduates. Household incomes ≤24th percentile were associated with a greater risk of having knee OA compared with those ≥75th percentile (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08–1.52, p = 0.004). Obesity was associated with an approximately two-fold greater risk of knee OA, regardless of knee OA severity (Kellgren–Lawrence grades ≥2, ≥3, and 4). Conclusions Using data from the 2010–2013 KNHANES and defining knee OA as Kellgren–Lawrence grade ≥ 2, we found that the prevalence of radiographic knee OA was 35.1% (24.4% in men, 44.3% in women) in a representative sample of Korean adults aged ≥ 50 years, with the highest prevalence (78.7%) observed in women aged ≥ 80 years. Low socioeconomic status and traditional factors, including age, female sex, and obesity, were associated with the risk of knee OA."
https://openalex.org/W3011654516,"The broad-spectrum antibiotic D-cycloserine (DCS) is a key component of regimens used to treat multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. DCS, a structural analog of D-alanine, binds to and inactivates two essential enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, alanine racemase (Alr) and D-Ala:D-Ala ligase. Inactivation of Alr is thought to proceed via a mechanism-based irreversible route, forming an adduct with the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor, leading to bacterial death. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Alr activity can be detected after exposure to clinically relevant DCS concentrations. To address this paradox, we investigated the chemical mechanism of Alr inhibition by DCS. Inhibition of M. tuberculosis Alr and other Alrs is reversible, mechanistically revealed by a previously unidentified DCS-adduct hydrolysis. Dissociation and subsequent rearrangement to a stable substituted oxime explains Alr reactivation in the cellular milieu. This knowledge provides a novel route for discovery of improved Alr inhibitors against M. tuberculosis and other bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3012213415,"Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has had considerable impact in pediatric stem cell transplantation, but its wider use is limited in part by unit size. Long-term ex vivo culture offers one approach to increase engraftment capacity by seeking to expand stem and progenitor cells. Here, we show brief incubation (8 h) of UCB CD34+ cells with the matricellular regulator Nov (CCN3) increases the frequency of serially transplantable hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) 6-fold. This rapid response suggests recruitment rather than expansion of stem cells; accordingly, in single-cell assays, Nov increases the clonogenicity of phenotypic HSCs without increasing their number through cell division. Recruitment is associated with both metabolic and transcriptional changes, and tracing of cell divisions demonstrates that the increased clonogenic activity resides within the undivided fraction of cells. Harnessing latent stem cell potential through recruitment-based approaches will inform understanding of stem cell state transitions with implications for translation to the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3012499112,"The literature provides strong evidence that stock price values can be predicted from past price data. Principal component analysis (PCA) identifies a small number of principle components that explain most of the variation in a data set. This method is often used for dimensionality reduction and analysis of the data. In this paper, we develop a general method for stock price prediction using time-varying covariance information. To address the time-varying nature of financial time series, we assign exponential weights to the price data so that recent data points are weighted more heavily. Our proposed method involves a dimension-reduction operation constructed based on principle components. Projecting the noisy observation onto a principle subspace results in a well-conditioned problem. We illustrate our results based on historical daily price data for 150 companies from different market-capitalization categories. We compare the performance of our method to two other methods: Gauss-Bayes, which is numerically demanding, and moving average, a simple method often used by technical traders and researchers. We investigate the results based on mean squared error and directional change statistic of prediction, as measures of performance, and volatility of prediction as a measure of risk."

The relationship between classification status and spinal progression during 2 years was investigated using binomial generalized estimating equations models with adjustment for sex, ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS) and tumour necrosis factor inhibitor treatment. Baseline spinal damage was considered an intermediate variable and included in sensitivity analyses.In total, 88 nr-axSpA and 418 r-axSpA patients contributed to data for 725 radiographic intervals. R-axSpA patients were more frequently male, had a longer disease duration and higher structural damage at baseline. Mean (SD) mSASSS change over 2 years was 0.16 (0.62) units in nr-axSpA and 0.92 (2.78) units in r-axSpA, p = 0.01. Nr-axSpA was associated with a significantly lower progression in 2 years (defined as an increase in ≥2 mSASSS units) in adjusted analyses (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.13; 0.83), confirmed with progression defined as the formation of ≥1 syndesmophyte. Mediation analyses revealed that sacroiliitis exerted its effect on spinal progression indirectly by being associated with the appearance of a first syndesmophyte (OR 0.09, 95%CI 0.02; 0.36 for nr-axSpA vs r-axSpA). Baseline syndesmophytes were predictors of further progression.Spinal structural damage is mainly restricted to patients with r-axSpA, leading to relevant prognostic and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W3011441982,"Prevention and treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are presently limited, underscoring the necessity for further elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying HCC development and identifying new prevention and therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate a unique protumorigenic niche in the livers of Ncoa5+/− mouse model of HCC, which is characterized by altered expression of a subset of genes including p21WAF1/CIP1 and proinflammatory cytokine genes, increased putative hepatic progenitors, and expansions of activated and tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8+ T lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and alternatively activated M2 macrophages. Importantly, prophylactic metformin treatment reversed these characteristics including aberrant p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and subsequently reduced HCC incidence in Ncoa5+/− male mice. Heterozygous deletion of the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene alleviated the key features associated with the protumorigenic niche in the livers of Ncoa5+/− male mice. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis reveals that preneoplastic livers of Ncoa5+/− mice are similar to the livers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients as well as the adjacent noncancerous liver tissues of a subset of HCC patients with a relatively poor prognosis. Together, our results suggest that p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpression is essential in the development of protumorigenic microenvironment induced by NCOA5 deficiency and metformin prevents HCC development via alleviating p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpression and protumorigenic microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3012038927,"The steroid hormone ecdysone is the central regulator of insect metamorphosis, during which a growing, immature larva is remodeled, through pupal stages, to a reproductive adult. However, the underlying mechanisms of ecdysone-mediated metamorphosis remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we identified metamorphosis-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) and their potential targets by cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing of endogenous Argonaute 1 protein in Drosophila. Interestingly, miR-8-3p targeted five Vha genes encoding distinct subunits of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which has a vital role in the organellar acidification. The expression of ecdysone-responsive miR-8-3p is normally downregulated during Drosophila metamorphosis, but temporary overexpression of miR-8-3p in the whole body at the end of larval development led to defects in metamorphosis and survival, hallmarks of aberrant ecdysone signaling. In addition, miR-8-3p was expressed in the prothoracic gland (PG), which produces and releases ecdysone in response to prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). Notably, overexpression of miR-8-3p or knockdown of its Vha targets in the PG resulted in larger than normal, ecdysone-deficient larvae that failed to develop into the pupal stage but could be rescued by ecdysone feeding. Moreover, these animals showed defective PTTH signaling with a concomitant decrease in the expression of ecdysone biosynthetic genes. We also demonstrated that the regulatory network between the conserved miR-8-3p/miR-200 family and V-ATPase was functional in human cells. Consequently, our data indicate that the coordinated regulation of V-ATPase subunits by miR-8-3p is involved in Drosophila metamorphosis by controlling the ecdysone biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3012432468,"Background Understanding how the conservation of nature can lead to improvement in human conditions is a research area with significant growth and attention. Progress towards effective conservation requires understanding mechanisms for achieving impact within complex social-ecological systems. Causal models are useful tools for defining plausible pathways from conservation actions to impacts on nature and people. Evaluating the potential of different strategies for delivering co-benefits for nature and people will require the use and testing of clear causal models that explicitly define the logic and assumptions behind cause and effect relationships. Objectives and methods In this study, we outline criteria for credible causal models and systematically evaluated their use in a broad base of literature (~1,000 peer-reviewed and grey literature articles from a published systematic evidence map) on links between nature-based conservation actions and human well-being impacts. Results Out of 1,027 publications identified, only ~20% of articles used any type of causal models to guide their work, and only 14 total articles fulfilled all criteria for credibility. Articles rarely tested the validity of models with empirical data. Implications Not using causal models risks poorly defined strategies, misunderstanding of potential mechanisms for affecting change, inefficient use of resources, and focusing on implausible efforts for achieving sustainability."

Lack of adequate information is one of the major problems preventing the design of cancer control strategies in Ethiopia.To characterize gynecological and breast cancers among clients attending Gynecologic clinic of Saint Paul Hospital Millennium Medical college over 5 year period.We retrospectively reviewed characteristics of 2,002 female cancer patients who visited the Oncology unit of Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College from 2014-2018. We estimated the proportion, pattern and trend of common types of gynecologic cancers as well as breast cancer. The ten years incidence projection was also computed.From the 2,002 malignancies, cervical (46.7%) was the most frequent cancer followed by breast (29.3%) and ovarian cancers (13%). The majority of breast cancers were observed among younger patients whereas cervical cancer was predominantly observed among older women. An overall increment in number of breast and gynecologic cancer was observed over the five years period.In this descriptive study, we found that breast and gynecologic cancers are important public health problems among women in Addis Ababa, and that the number of patients seeking care for these cancers is increasing. Additional studies are needed to identify risk factors for these cancers, particularly among younger women, to characterize the trends over time and to project the scope of the cancer problem expected in the future to inform cancer control programs. Increasing public awareness on the possible risk factors and screening is mandatory in addition to resource allocation for further studies and targeted intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3012379248,"A principal challenge in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is chemotherapy refractory disease. As such, there remains a critical need to identify key regulators of chemotherapy resistance in AML. In this study, we demonstrate that the membrane scaffold, CD82, contributes to the chemoresistant phenotype of AML. Using an RNA-seq approach, we identified the increased expression of the tetraspanin family member, CD82, in response to the chemotherapeutic, daunorubicin. Analysis of the TARGET and BEAT AML databases identifies a correlation between CD82 expression and overall survival of AML patients. Moreover, using a combination of cell lines and patient samples, we find that CD82 overexpression results in significantly reduced cell death in response to chemotherapy. Investigation of the mechanism by which CD82 promotes AML survival in response to chemotherapy identified a crucial role for enhanced protein kinase c alpha (PKCα) signaling and downstream activation of the β1 integrin. In addition, analysis of β1 integrin clustering by super-resolution imaging demonstrates that CD82 expression promotes the formation of dense β1 integrin membrane clusters. Lastly, evaluation of survival signaling following daunorubicin treatment identified robust activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) downstream of PKCα and β1 integrin signaling when CD82 is overexpressed. Together, these data propose a mechanism where CD82 promotes chemoresistance by increasing PKCα activation and downstream activation/clustering of β1 integrin, leading to AML cell survival via activation of p38 MAPK. These observations suggest that the CD82-PKCα signaling axis may be a potential therapeutic target for attenuating chemoresistance signaling in AML."
https://openalex.org/W3012742120,"Prominins (proms) are transmembrane glycoproteins conserved throughout the animal kingdom. They are associated with plasma membrane protrusions, such as primary cilia, as well as extracellular vesicles derived thereof. Primary cilia host numerous signaling pathways affected in diseases known as ciliopathies. Human PROM1 (CD133) is detected in both somatic and cancer stem cells and is also expressed in terminally differentiated epithelial and photoreceptor cells. Genetic mutations in the PROM1 gene result in retinal degeneration by impairing the proper formation of the outer segment of photoreceptors, a modified cilium. Here, we investigated the impact of proms on two distinct examples of ciliogenesis. First, we demonstrate that the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant variant of human PROM1 (i.e. mutation Y819F/Y828F) significantly decreases ciliary length in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. These results contrast strongly to the previously observed enhancing effect of WT PROM1 on ciliary length. Mechanistically, the mutation impeded the interaction of PROM1 with ADP-ribosylation factor–like protein 13B, a key regulator of ciliary length. Second, we observed that in vivo knockdown of prom3 in zebrafish alters the number and length of monocilia in the Kupffer's vesicle, resulting in molecular and anatomical defects in the left-right asymmetry. These distinct loss-of-function approaches in two biological systems reveal that prom proteins are critical for the integrity and function of cilia.

These prom/lipid complexes might stimulate the interaction of prom1 with various membrane and/or cytoplasmic protein partners and hence modulate the architecture of the given protrusion.

Altogether, alterations in prom1, as observed in vivo in retinal pathologies or in vitro with various cell types, may influence the organization of its surrounding membranous microenvironment and its cross-talk with cytoskeleton regulators. As a consequence, the general structure of the plasmalemma and, hence, dynamic protrusions such as microvilli and cilia would be affected.

https://openalex.org/W3012206915,"Introduction Compared to controlled laboratory settings, the real world is highly distracting with constant demands on visual attention to avoid hazards and falling. Fall-risk assessments do not adequately take into account the potential role of everyday distractions and environmental hazards. The purpose of this project was to identify the effect of the environment on gait and gaze behavior during walking in older adult fallers relative to non-fallers. Methods Thirteen older adult fallers (76.8±9.4 years, 3.2±2.3 falls in last year) and 13 age-matched non-fallers (78.3±7.3 years, 0 falls in last year) participated. Participants walked in a real-world and lab setting while gait and gaze were recorded. Gait variables were stride length variability, stride duration variability, and stride velocity. Gaze was analyzed for percentage of time fixating and average fixation duration coded across 6 areas of interest (AOIs) in the visual surroundings. Results Non-fallers walked faster than fallers, but there were no other group or environment effects on gait. For gaze behavior, fallers had shorter fixation durations on the near environment than non-fallers, but only in the real world. In the real world relative to the lab, fallers decreased fixation durations on the near environment but increased durations on near people. In the real world, participants spent a greater proportion of time fixating on people than on the walking path or the near environment compared to the lab. After adjusting for baseline gait speed, fallers had shorter fixation durations than non-fallers in both environments. Conclusions Our results indicate that in a busy environment, older adults concentrate most of their overt visual attention on people when navigating their walking path. Fallers in particular focus longer on people near to them and have overall shorter fixations than non-fallers. Visual focus while walking in a busy environment should be further explored as a fall-risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W3012104375,"Cognitive control is the most fundamental psychological function that underlies the execution of many other psychological functions. A mobile game application could be a useful strategy to evaluate cognitive control in the groups of children and adolescents. Although a serious game that is based on gamification would be an optimal platform for the administration of behavioral and clinical assessments of children and adolescents, most studies on gamification have been conducted among adults and older adults than among children and adolescents. This study aimed to assess cognitive control using a mobile game that used gamification and compared the results to those from traditional neuropsychological tests for children and adolescents. In order to address this objective, this study used a serious game, namely, ""CoCon,"" which was developed to assess cognitive control in children and adolescents. This study included 100 participants from a community sample (mean age = 11.75 years, ranged from 9 to 16 years, SD = 1.40 years; Male = 59(59%), Female = 41(41%)). The analyses interrogated the relationships among various game behaviors scores of CoCon, the standardized neuropsychological tests (K-WISC-IV, CTT, and Stroop), and self-reporting executive function difficulty questionnaire. As results, a mobile game application-based assessment proved to be a reliable and valid measure of the cognitive control in children and adolescents. The index scores from the CoCon were significantly related to various cognitive control functions and differentiated between the high and low cognitive control groups. Specifically, even though the participants completed the mobile game 'CoCon' in their natural habitats, the CoCon scores were comparable to the measures from standard neuropsychological tests. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that mobile games that use advanced technology and sophisticated psychological strategies can serve as a new and expanded platform for the administration of psychological assessments."

The control group comprised 202 patients who received gadoterate meglumine (Gd-DOTA) of which each 101 patients were allocated to IPPP or SPPP at site B. RM artefacts were scored retrospectively in dynamic phase images (1: none- 5: extensive) by five and two blinded readers at site A and B, respectively, and in the hepatobiliary phase of the Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced scans by two blinded readers at either site.The incidence of TSM was 15% at site A and 22.7% at site B (p = 0.157). IPPP did not reduce the incidence of TSM in comparison to SPPP: 16.7% vs. 21.6% (p = 0.366). This finding was consistent at site A: 12% vs. 18% (p = 0.401) and site B: 20.6% vs. 25% (p = 0.590). The TSM incidence in patients with IPPP and SPPP did not differ significantly between both sites (p = 0.227; p = 0.390). IPPP did not significantly mitigate RM in comparison to SPPP in any of the Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced dynamic phases and the hepatobiliary phase in patients without TSM (all p≥0.072). In the Gd-DOTA control group on the other hand, IPPP significantly mitigated RM in all dynamic phases in comparison to SPPP (all p≤0.031).We conclude that Gd-EOB-DTPA-related TSM cannot be mitigated by education and training and that Gd-EOB-DTPA-related breath-hold difficulty does not only affect the subgroup of patients with TSM or exclusively the arterial phase as previously proposed."

However, little is known about the hormonal regulation of miRNA expression and the role of the specific miRNA-mRNA interactions in corpus luteum. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine: (a) the expression of miRNAs in the corpus luteum in early pregnancy vs regression; (b) the effect of conceptus and uterine signals in the expression of selected miRNAs; and (c) the role of specific miRNA-mRNA interactions in the molecular changes and secretory function of the corpus luteum in the pig. The results showed that the majority of miRNAs differentially expressed in the corpus luteum in early pregnancy vs regression belong to independent clusters (eg, miR-99b, miR-532), which are highly conserved among different animal species. The main conceptus signal in the pig (17β-estradiol) elevated the luteal expression of the miR-99b cluster and lowered the expression of NR4A1 and AKR1C1, the genes involved in corpus luteum regression. Furthermore, the delivery of miR-99b cluster mimics to luteal tissue concomitantly decreased NR4A1 and AKR1C1 expression and enhanced progesterone secretion. The present study demonstrated that conceptus signals can support the maintenance of luteal function during pregnancy by clustered miRNA-stimulated pathways, governing the expression of genes involved in luteal regression."

Stabilization of HIF-1α has been widely reported to be a critical factor in the improvement of wound healing in diabetes. Therefore, our study reveals the roles of improved autologous blood in wound healing in diabetes, through autologous blood transfusion in a mouse model. Initially, BALB/c mice were subjected to streptozotocin for diabetic mouse model establishment. Diabetic mice were transfused with improved or standard autologous blood in perfusion culture system. Roles of improved autologous blood in mediating HIF-1α pathway were determined by measuring expression of VEGF, EGF, HIF-1α, and HSP-90. In order to assess the detailed regulatory mechanism of improved autologous blood in perspective of wound healing, cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle, fibroblasts isolated from diabetic mice were transfected with HIF-1α siRNA. Mice transfused with improved autologous blood exhibited increased levels of CD31 and α-SMA in skin tissues, and reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, indicating that improved autologous blood promoted wound healing ability and reduced the release of inflammatory factors. Diabetic mice transfused with improved autologous blood presented activated HIF-1α pathway. The survival rate, proliferation, and migration of fibroblasts were elevated via activation of the HIF-1α pathway. Taken together, improved blood preservation solution could enhance the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells and wound healing in mice with diabetes, which is achieved through regulation of HIF-1α pathway."

FWS and NMFS' comparable role for terrestrial and marine taxa, respectively, provides the opportunity to examine how implementation of the same law varies between agencies. We analyzed how the Services implement a core component of the ESA, section 7 consultations, by objectively assessing the contents of >120 consultations on sea turtle species against the requirements in the Services' consultation handbook, supplemented with in-person observations from Service biologists. Our results showed that NMFS consultations were 1.40 times as likely to have higher completeness scores than FWS consultations given the standard in the handbook. Consultations tiered from an FWS programmatic consultation inherited higher quality scores of generally more thorough programmatic consultations, indicating that programmatic consultations could increase the quality of consultations while improving efficiency. Both agencies commonly neglected to account for the effects of previous consultations and the potential for compounded effects on species. From these results, we recommend actions that can improve quality of consultation, including the use of a single database to track and integrate previously authorized harm in new analyses and the careful but more widespread use of programmatic consultations. Our study reveals several critical shortfalls in the current process of conducting ESA section 7 consultations that the Services could address to better safeguard North America's most imperiled species."

Here, we used stimulated immunoreactive Calcitonin Gene–Related Peptide (iCGRP) release as a measure of nociceptor activation, and we found that each dicarbonyl metabolite induces a concentration-, TRPA1-, and Ca2+-dependent iCGRP release. MGO, GO, and 3-DG were about equally potent in the millimolar range. We hypothesized that another dicarbonyl, 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene (3,4-DGE), which is present in peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions after heat sterilization, activates nociceptors. We also showed that at body temperatures 3,4-DGE is formed from 3-DG and that concentrations of 3,4-DGE in the micromolar range effectively induced iCGRP release from isolated murine skin. In a novel preparation of the isolated parietal peritoneum PD fluid or 3,4-DGE alone, at concentrations found in PD solutions, stimulated iCGRP release. We also tested whether inflammatory tissue conditions synergize with dicarbonyls to induce iCGRP release from isolated skin. Application of MGO together with bradykinin or prostaglandin E2 resulted in an overadditive effect on iCGRP release, whereas MGO applied at a pH of 5.2 resulted in reduced release, probably due to an MGO-mediated inhibition of transient receptor potential (TRP) V1 receptors. These results indicate that several reactive dicarbonyls activate nociceptors and potentiate inflammatory mediators. Our findings underline the roles of dicarbonyls and TRPA1 receptors in causing pain during diabetes or renal disease.

In mice, systemic MGO treatment causes pain and hyperalgesia (8Bierhaus A. Fleming T. Stoyanov S. Leffler A. Babes A. Neacsu C. Sauer S.K. Eberhardt M. Schnölzer M. Lasischka F. Neuhuber W.L.

In addition, MGO modifies nociceptor-type voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) subtypes NaV1.8 and NaV1.7 causing increased excitability of nociceptors (8Bierhaus A. Fleming T. Stoyanov S. Leffler A.

In healthy human subjects, subcutaneous microinjections elicit transient burning pain sensations and long-lasting hyperalgesia to thermal and mechanical stimuli (12Düll M.M. Riegel K. Tappenbeck J.

However, the correlation of elevated MGO plasma levels with pain sensations of diabetes patients is an issue of ongoing debate (8Bierhaus A. Fleming T. Stoyanov S. Leffler A. Babes A. Neacsu C.

Recently, another study identified high levels of methylglyoxal as a relevant risk factor for the development of diabetic polyneuropathy (14Andersen S.T. Witte D.R. Dalsgaard E.M. Andersen H. Nawroth P. Fleming T. Jensen T.M. Finnerup N.B. Jensen T.S. Lauritzen T. Feldman E.L. Callaghan B.C. Charles M.

Similarly, glyoxal and 3-DG are also reactive metabolites, but there is little information whether these disease-regulated dicarbonyls contribute to activation of the nociceptive system and thereby act in concert with MGO. Up to now, only glyoxal has been investigated in TRPA1-transfected HEK cells but was ineffective in stimulating intracellular calcium increase (15Ohkawara S. Tanaka-Kagawa T. Furukawa Y. Jinno H. Methylglyoxal activates the human transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 channel.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2012; 37 (22863862): 831-83510.2131/jts.37.831Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene (3,4-DGE) is a highly-reactive α,β-unsaturated dicarbonyl compound found in fluids used for peritoneal dialysis (PD), which achieves blood purification in patients with renal failure. To exert hyperosmotic suction, these fluids contain a high-glucose concentration, and 3,4-DGE is formed during heat sterilization (5Pischetsrieder M. Gensberger-Reigl S. Atzenbeck L. Weigel I.

Under pathophysiological conditions, 3,4-DGE has not been detected up to now, possibly due to its high reactivity (5Pischetsrieder M. Gensberger-Reigl S. Atzenbeck L. Weigel I.

Similar to the saturated dicarbonyl compounds, it can be assumed that 3,4-DGE is elevated under diabetic or uremic conditions because the precursor 3-DG is also increased (18Niwa T. Tsukushi S. 3-Deoxyglucosone and AGEs in uremic complications: inactivation of glutathione peroxidase by 3-deoxyglucosone.Kidney Int.

Glucose degradation products lead to a variety of morphological and functional changes of the peritoneum in the course of dialysis, and the successive loss of ultrafiltration capacity is mainly attributed to the formation of advanced glycation end products (1Rabbani N. Thornalley P.J. Advanced glycation end products in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease.Kidney Int. 2018; 93 (29477239): 803-81310.1016/j.kint.2017.11.034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Pischetsrieder M.

Thus, we studied acute effects of 3,4-DGE and a commercial dialysis fluid on nociceptors that richly innervate the parietal peritoneum (20Tanaka K. Matsugami T. Chiba T. The origin of sensory innervation of the peritoneum in the rat.Anat. Embryol. 2002; 205 (12136261): 307-31310.1007/s00429-002-0254-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Activation of these somatic nociceptors by reactive dicarbonyl compounds could lead to acute abdominal pain or pain associated with dialysis-related peritonitis (21Flasar M.H. Cross R. Goldberg E.

Furthermore, we investigated whether the effects of reactive dicarbonyls are potentiated by inflammatory mediators. Under diabetic conditions, an up-regulation of inflammatory markers like prostanoids (22Freshwater J.D. Svensson C.I. Malmberg A.B. Calcutt N.A.

To our knowledge, the interaction of classical inflammatory mediators like PGE2, BK, and low pH with reactive dicarbonyls has not been investigated up to now. We measured stimulated neuropeptide release as an index of nociceptor activation (27Levine J.D. Fields H.L. Basbaum A.I. Peptides and the primary afferent nociceptor.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13 (8501507): 2273-228610.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-06-02273.1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most tissues are innervated by peptidergic nociceptors and release neuropeptides such as CGRP by calcium-dependent exocytosis upon chemical or thermal stimulation (28Lundberg J.M. Franco-Cereceda A. Alving K. Delay-Goyet P. Lou Y.P. Release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory neurons.Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Using this screening method, we investigated the effects of the reactive dicarbonyls methylglyoxal, glyoxal, 3-deoxyglucosone, and the α,β-unsaturated 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene on the activation of peripheral nociceptors using hairy skin, vagus nerve, and peritoneum preparations in vitro. This study extends knowledge on the group of classical reactive dicarbonyl compounds as “metabolic pain mediators” that directly activate primary sensory neurons already under “healthy” control conditions or are able to augment effects of classical inflammatory conditions. We propose that this group of dicarbonyl compounds contributes to the development of pain when they are elevated during diabetes mellitus or renal disease. MGO, GO, and 3-DG were all found to activate peptidergic nociceptors and, by that, release iCGRP in a concentration-dependent manner. With regard to MGO, we reproduced published data (11Eberhardt M.J. Filipovic M.R. Leffler A. de la Roche J. Kistner K. Fischer M.J. Fleming T. Zimmermann K. Ivanovic-Burmazovic I. Nawroth P.P.

When looking at the overall release (depicted as AUC in picograms/ml), concentration dependence could be confirmed (one-way ANOVA F(2,37) = 10.9, p < 0.001; LSD post hoc p < 0.01 for both effects indicated). Likewise, GO induced a significant increase in iCGRP at 3, 5, and 10 mm (n = 8; p = 0.04, n = 7; p = 0.02 and n = 8; p = 0.02; all Wilcoxon tests, respectively, Fig. 1B), whereas at 1 mm (n = 7) no iCGRP release could be observed. The overall release induced by GO (depicted as AUC in picograms/ml) illustrates the concentration-dependent effect (one-way ANOVA F(2,20) = 19.7, p < 0.001; LSD post hoc p < 0.001 for both effects indicated). Similar to MGO, GO-induced neuropeptide release from peptidergic fibers depends on extracellular calcium and was therefore lacking at 5 and 10 mm concentrations using calcium-free solutions with EGTA (n = 4 both, Fig. 1B, right panel). In addition, GO-induced iCGRP release depended on TRPA1 receptor activation because GO at 3 and 10 mm did not induce any increase of iCGRP release in preparations from TRPA1 knockout mice (n = 6, n = 5, respectively, Fig. 1B, right panel). In skin preparations from TRPV1 knockout mice, 10 mm GO caused a significant iCGRP release that was not different from control C57BL/6J mice (n = 6, Fig. 1B, right panel) indicating that an activation of TRPV1 receptors by GO can be excluded. Interestingly, in contrast to MGO-induced release, GO-induced iCGRP release was not reversible within 5 min of washout. 3-DG significantly increased iCGRP from isolated skin preparations at 5 mm concentration (n = 12; p = 0.01; Wilcoxon test), whereas 1 and 3 mm 3-DG did not show any effect (both n = 10, Fig. 1C). The difference of the overall release (depicted as AUC in picograms/ml) between 3 and 5 mm 3-DG was significant (one-way ANOVA F(1,20) = 12.0, p < 0.01). This low reactivity motivated us to retest 3-DG in a desheathed vagus nerve preparation exhibiting high reactivity with respect to TRPA1 agonists (29Weller K. Reeh P.W. Sauer S.K. TRPV1, TRPA1, and CB1 in the isolated vagus nerve–axonal chemosensitivity and control of neuropeptide release.Neuropeptides. 2011; 45 (21868092): 391-40010.1016/j.npep.2011.07.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, only 5 mm 3-DG induced a significant increase of iCGRP release (n = 6, p = 0.03; Wilcoxon test, in the figure the overall release as AUC is depicted, Fig. 1C, right panel). Using the vagus nerve preparation, we also found that 3-DG–induced iCGRP release depended on extracellular calcium (n = 4) and TRPA1, as it could not be detected when either extracellular calcium was missing or preparations from knockout mice (n = 6) were stimulated with 5 mm 3-DG (depicted as AUC in picograms/ml, Fig. 1C, right panel). In vagus preparations from TRPV1 knockout mice, we found an increased overall release (depicted as AUC in picograms/ml, Fig. 1C, right panel) compared with the control conditions (one-way ANOVA F(1,9) = 4.9, p = 0.05). Interestingly, the iCGRP release induced by 3-DG was also sustained in isolated skin preparations, similar to GO stimulation. Comparing the acute effects of all three dicarbonyls tested so far, defined as increase over baseline level after a 5 mm stimulation, MGO and GO exhibited a comparable efficacy (2.7- and 2.8-fold increase over baseline level, respectively) in contrast to the weaker 3-DG that only resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in iCGRP over baseline. The lower reactivity of 3-DG could be due to intramolecular formation of hemiacetals or -ketals, which block the reactive carbonyl groups (30Mittelmaier S. Pischetsrieder M. Multistep ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis for untargeted quantification of glycating activity and identification of most relevant glycation products.Anal.

At high temperatures applied during heat sterilization of PD fluids, 3-DG is degraded, and 3,4-DGE is formed. A reversible conversion of 3-DG into 3,4-DGE has been observed (31Mittelmaier S. Fünfrocken M. Fenn D. Pischetsrieder M. 3-Deoxygalactosone, a new glucose degradation product in peritoneal dialysis fluids: identification, quantification by HPLC/DAD/MSMS and its pathway of formation.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2011; 399 (21136045): 1689-169710.1007/s00216-010-4456-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In human plasma, 3,4-DGE has not been detected yet, but the formation in vivo by dehydration of 3-DG is conceivable. We investigated whether 3-DG could be a source of 3,4-DGE also at a physiological temperature of 37 °C and could thus serve as a pool to release 3,4-DGE into the tissues. Thus, we measured in vitro the newly-formed 3,4-DGE in SIF solutions that contained freshly-synthesized 3-DG at a concentration of 375 μm at the beginning of the experiment. Half of these solutions were incubated at 37 °C and the other half at 39 °C to simulate normal body temperature or febrile conditions, respectively. As a control, SIF was also incubated without 3-DG. First of all, we could gain satisfying recovery rates for the quantification of 3-DG and 3,4-DGE in SIF (100.4% (n = 3) for 3-DG and 100.2% (n = 1) for 3,4-DGE, respectively), proving that the applied method was suitable for the analysis of the SIF-based samples. After 1 h at 37 °C, 0.3 ± 0.02 μm 3,4-DGE was detected, and over time a further increase of the 3,4-DGE formation occurred, although no 3,4-DGE was detectable in the control, confirming that the formed 3,4-DGE originates from 3-DG. When the same experiment was conducted at 39 °C, we detected 0.4 ± 0.04 μm 3,4-DGE after 1 h, and again a distinct increase occurred over time. These results show that a temperature difference of 2 °C has a considerable effect on the transformation of 3-DG into 3,4-DGE (repeated measures ANOVA F(3,12) = 8.7, p < 0.01, p < 0.05 indicating the overall temperature effect, Fig. 2A, right diagram). After 24 h, a concentration of ∼2.5 μm 3,4-DGE was measured at both temperatures, which accounts for about 0.6% of the initial 3-DG concentration. Simultaneously, we also analyzed 3-DG in the same samples and observed a continuous and linear degradation of the 3-DG content, which was also temperature-dependent (repeated measures ANOVA F(4,16) = 26.0, p < 0.001, p < 0.02 indicating the overall temperature effect, Fig. 2A, left panel). At 39 °C, the degradation was faster as indicated by a stronger decrease of the 3-DG content in the samples over time. These results show that 3,4-DGE is spontaneously formed from 3-DG at a physiological temperature in vitro, and its formation is accelerated at a higher temperature, e.g. during febrile states. Thus, it can be suggested that the 3-DG pool is a source for 3,4-DGE in the human body. Comparing the amount of degraded 3-DG at 24 h (126.3 ± 4.14 μm at 37 °C, 167.5 ± 2.68 μm at 39 °C) with the amount of formed 3,4-DGE after 24 h (2.4 μm at 37 and 39 °C, respectively) obviously shows that the 3-DG degradation prevails over the slight 3,4-DGE formation. We assume that some additional degradation products are formed that are not detected by the applied UHPLC method. Subsequently, we investigated whether the α,β-unsaturated dicarbonyl compound 3,4-DGE activates nociceptors. It has already been shown that 3,4-DGE has a high-glycating activity and modifies proteins that result, for example, in the inactivation of enzymes (17Distler L. Georgieva A. Kenkel I. Huppert J. Pischetsrieder M. Structure- and concentration-specific assessment of the physiological reactivity of α-dicarbonyl glucose degradation products in peritoneal dialysis fluids.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2014; 27 (25033248): 1421-143010.1021/tx500153nCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3,4-DGE reacts specifically with cysteine residues so that it is an interesting candidate to modify TRPA1 receptors and, by that, activate nociceptors (32Gensberger-Reigl S. Atzenbeck L. Göttler A. Pischetsrieder M.

We stimulated skin preparations with concentrations of 30 and 100 μm 3,4-DGE and found significant increases in iCGRP release (both n = 6, p = 0.03 Wilcoxon tests, respectively, Fig. 2B). The overall release (depicted as AUC in picograms/ml) was concentration-dependent (one-way ANOVA F(1,10) = 45.9, p < 0.001). The high reactivity of 3,4-DGE is evident when compared with the stimulatory effects of 5 mm MGO, GO, and 3-DG resulting in a 2.7-, 2.8-, and 1.9-fold increase over baseline. In contrast, an about 14-fold increase of iCGRP release over baseline was observed for 100 μm 3,4-DGE, which is a 50-fold lower concentration. The effect was also not reversible within a 5-min washout. In peritoneal dialysis fluids, 3,4-DGE is found after heat sterilizat"

To quickly sense and respond to this ubiquitous threat, organisms have evolved enzymes that neutralize harmful oxidants such as reactive oxygen species and electrophilic compounds (including xenobiotics and their breakdown products) in cells.

GSH S-transferase antioxidant response element aryl hydrocarbon xenobiotic-responsive element NFE2-related factor 2. GSH S-transferase antioxidant response element aryl hydrocarbon xenobiotic-responsive element NFE2-related factor 2. The antioxidant response element (ARE) is a major regulatory component of this cellular stress response. The ARE is a conserved, 11-nucleotide-long DNA motif present in the 5′-flanking regions of many genes encoding antioxidant proteins. The laboratory of Cecil Pickett (Fig. 1) at the Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research in Quebec discovered ARE, a finding reported in the early 1990s in two JBC papers recognized as Classics here (4Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. Transcriptional regulation of the rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene: characterization of a xenobiotic-responsive element controlling inducible expression by phenolic antioxidants.J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266 (1646813): 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARE's discovery was spurred in large part by Pickett's career choice. After completing a PhD in biology and a 2-year postdoc at UCLA in the mid-1970s, he began to work in the pharmaceutical industry. Recruited to Merck in 1978 by its then head of research and development (and later CEO), Roy Vagelos, “I became interested in how drug-metabolizing enzymes were induced by various xenobiotics,” Pickett says. According to Pickett, Vagelos encouraged researchers at the company “to really start a program where we could build our research careers. But he also said, ’Keep in mind the long-term mission of Merck—and that is to discover novel medicines that could help people.’” Pickett remembers joining Merck at a unique time in the pharmaceutical industry. “[Vagelos] really had an incredible vision for research and development.” Inspired by Vagelos’ vision, Pickett launched a vigorous research program that attracted many talented scientists. To find xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, Pickett and his team treated rats with various chemicals, including phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene, to induce genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and breakdown. To isolate these genes, the team used an in vitro system for translation of the mRNAs isolated from the livers of the animals. This approach yielded promising results. “I noticed that the profile of the in vitro translated material from induced animals was very different from that of noninduced animals,” says Pickett. “And there tended to be a low-molecular-weight protein that was always induced.” At first, it was unclear what this small protein might be. But a colleague at Merck, Anthony Lu, had a hunch that it might be GST, Pickett says. Acting on Lu's idea, Pickett and his team applied a technique called polysomal immunoprecipitation. The researchers used GST-specific antibodies from Barbara Hales' laboratory at McGill University in Montreal to detect and isolate mRNA-ribosome complexes that contained GST-encoding mRNA sequences (6Pickett C.B. Telakowski-Hopkins C.A. Ding G.J. Argenbright L. Lu A.Y.

Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (6325423): 5182-5188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). “That allowed us to synthesize cDNAs and isolate the structural genes for the GSTs,” says Pickett. With the GST gene sequences in hand, the researchers could home in on cis-acting regulatory motifs in the 5′-flanking regions of these genes (reviewed by Pickett and Thomas Rushmore in Ref. 7Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. Glutathione S-transferases, structure, regulation, and therapeutic implication.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (8505281): 11475-11478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARE was one of the motifs the researchers discovered as being required for xenobiotics-induced activation of GST gene transcription. Its location in the promoter of the gene encoding the Ya subunit of GST was delineated by extensive deletion and point mutation analyses. These findings were reported in a series of articles (8Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E. Pickett C.B.

Transcriptional regulation of the rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene: characterization of a xenobiotic-responsive element controlling inducible expression by phenolic antioxidants.J. Biol.

The discovery of ARE by Pickett and colleagues caused a major shift in thinking about how xenobiotic-metabolizing genes are regulated. Up to that point, it was thought that the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor, a transcription factor that binds to the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) in gene promoters, activated all the genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes. Pickett's work made it clear that antioxidant genes such as GST have multiple regulatory elements in their promoters that are responsive to specific cellular stressors (Fig. 2). Subsequent work in Pickett's laboratory and by others helped identify the transcription factors that recognize the ARE and activate the transcription of GST and other oxidative stress response genes (2Nguyen T. Nioi P. Pickett C.B. The Nrf2-antioxidant response element signaling pathway and its activation by oxidative stress.J. Biol.

One of these transcriptional regulators is NFE2-related factor 2 (NRF2), identified in 1994 by another research group (11Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W.

Because NRF2 binds ARE, suggesting that it helps activate oxidative stress responses, NRF2 soon became a major focus of Pickett's team, which helped uncover key aspects of how NRF2 itself is regulated by proteasomal degradation and protein kinases (2Nguyen T.

Given the many fundamental discoveries coming out of Pickett's laboratory, one may be forgiven for thinking that his main focus was on fundamental research. But while running a very prolific research program, Pickett's talents for designing and overseeing drug discovery programs soon led him to also direct major drug development efforts at Merck. This meant working with multidisciplinary research teams. “It was a large group of people—chemists, pharmacologists, molecular biologists, and biochemists,” says Pickett. “I oversaw a more integrated approach to how drugs need to be discovered and developed.” Pickett also served on an internal committee that directed all of Merck's business in Canada; this unique vantage point further shaped his approach to drug discovery. Pickett's polymath talents and scientific background in the molecular bases of inflammatory diseases were key for the discovery and development of the anti-inflammatory medicine montelukast (Singulair), used chiefly to prevent asthma attacks and other inflammatory lung conditions. In 1993, Pickett joined Schering–Plough in New Jersey as executive vice president of discovery research, eventually becoming president of the institute. “I had a very good balance between the more fundamental work and also the drug discovery work,” says Pickett of his time at Schering–Plough. Pickett drove the development of several drugs for managing metabolic disorders and diseases, including cancer, fungal and viral infections, and hypercholesterolemia. He also continued basic research that further deciphered the role of the ARE-binding transcriptional regulator NRF2 in oxidative stress responses. This effort later helped advance drug development at Biogen Idec, a company Pickett joined as head of R&D in 2006. “Work on NRF2 at Biogen began with some ideas that I had,” says Pickett. “Biogen’s current small-molecule compound Tecfidera [dimethyl fumarate], which is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, activates the NRF2 pathway.” Pickett is now formally retired, but he remains involved in R&D as a member on several advisory boards and committees of such organizations and companies as the American Association for Cancer Research and Zimmer Biomet. Reflecting on the many challenges of directing both fundamental research and drug discovery efforts, Pickett emphasizes the synergy these diverse pursuits offered. “I think having my own lab, being engaged in that research, and reading the scientific literature helped me in making sure that the scientific thoughts in the [drug discovery] programs were solid.”"
