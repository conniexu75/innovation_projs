https://openalex.org/W2021222335,"Transgenic plants are an effective system for the study of regulated gene expression. Developmental control of expression can be monitored by assaying different tissues or by assaying a plant at different developmental stages. Analysis of the petunia 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene, which is highly expressed in flowers, allowed identification of an upstream region that confers tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression. The cell specificity of expression in floral tissues has been defined by histochemical localization. This expression is contrasted to that of the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus, a nominally constitutive promoter that shows a definite specificity of expression in floral tissues. Moreover, this expression differs in transgenic hosts of different species."
https://openalex.org/W2062398827,"A bacterial streptomycin resistance gene (SPT) was engineered to make it possible to detect visually the transposition of the maize transposon Activator (Ac) in tobacco. In the presence of streptomycin, transgenic seedlings carrying the SPT gene appear green, whereas those carrying an SPT:: Ac construct display clones of green cells on a white background. Fully green seedlings arise in the progeny of SPT:: Ac transformants as a result of excision of Ac before fertilization. About half of these germinal revertants carry a transposed Ac element. Therefore, SPT:: Ac constitutes an efficient marker for selecting plants that have undergone transposition. In maize, there is a negative effect of increasing Ac dosage on the frequency and timing of Ac transposition. This negative effect is not observed in tobacco with the streptomycin variegation assay."
https://openalex.org/W2074923334,"Closed-system partial melts of hydrated, metamorphosed arc basalts and andesites (greenstones and amphibolites), where only water structurally bound in metamorphic minerals is available for melting (dehydration melting), are generally water-undersaturated, coexist with plagioclase-rich, anhydrous restites, and have compositions like island arc tonalites. In contrast, water-saturated melting at water pressures of 3 kilobars yields strongly peraluminous, low iron melts that coexist with an amphibolebearing, plagioclase-poor restite. These melt compositions are unlike those of most natural silicic rocks. Thus, dehydration melting over a range of pressures in the crust of island arcs is a plausible mechanism for the petrogenesis of islands arc tonalite, whereas water-saturated melting at pressure of 3 kilobars and above is not."
https://openalex.org/W2006620913,"Differences in the distribution of parasitized and unparasitized hosts has been used to infer modification of host behavior by insect parasitoids. Data are presented showing that not only do parasitized hosts behave differently from unparasitized ones, but that the behavior of parasitized hosts varies in function of the physiological state of the parasitoid. Aphids containing nondiapausing parasitoids leave the aphid colony and mummify on the upper surface of the leaves, whereas those containing diapausing parasitoids leave the host plant and mummify in concealed sites. Modification of host behavior by diapausing parasitoids results in the selection of a suitable microhabitat that reduces the incidence of hyperparasitism and should decrease the action of adverse climatic conditions during the lengthy dormant period."

This time interval covered the decrease in solar activity from the maximum of solar cycle 21 to solar minimum and the onset of cycle 22. The sun's ultraviolet irradiance also decreased during the descending phase of cycle 21 and, like the total irradiance, is now increasing concurrently with the increase in cycle 22 activity. Although only 1 percent of the sun's energy is emitted at ultraviolet wavelengths between 200 and 300 nanometers, the decrease in this radiation from 1 July 1981 to 30 June 1985 accounted for 19 percent of the decrease in the total irradiance over the same period."
https://openalex.org/W1979440187,"An ancient mine located at Kestel on the outskirts of Nigde, in the Taurus Mountains of south central Turkey, has been dated by radiocarbon and pottery type to the third millennium B.C. Archeological soundings in the mine located cassiterite (tin oxide) in the detritus of ancient mining activity. Cassiterite is also present in veins and, as placer deposits, in streams nearby. Since tin is used with copper in order to form bronze but is thinly distributed in the earth's crust, the presence of tin ore at Kestel offers a source for the much sought after tin of the Bronze Age. The discovery of an ancient mine containing cassiterite sheds light on this question, but also greatly complicates the accepted picture of regional economic patterns in the highland resource areas of Anatolia and of interregional metal exchange in the formative periods of urbanization and metal use in the eastern Mediterranean."
https://openalex.org/W2025036815,"During the past 20 years, computer graphic techniques for simulating the reflection of light have progressed so that today images of photorealistic quality can be produced. Early algorithms considered direct lighting only, but global illumination phenomena with indirect lighting, surface interreflections, and shadows can now be modeled with ray tracing, radiosity, and Monte Carlo simulations. This article describes the historical development of computer graphic algorithms for light reflection and pictorially illustrates what will be commonly available in the near future."
