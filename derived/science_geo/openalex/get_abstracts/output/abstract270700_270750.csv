https://openalex.org/W2006643041,"An aftereffect of color which depends on the orientation of lines in the test field may be obtained by presenting a horizontal grating of one color alternately with a vertical grating of a different color. Like the aftereffect of adaptation to chromatic fringes produced by prismatic spectacles, this aftereffect is visible in monochromatic light and fails to show inter-ocular transfer. It is suggested that both effects are to be understood in terms of color adaptation of orientation-specific edge-detectors."

https://openalex.org/W2081619877,"Electrical stimulation of the same hypothalamic point with current of mild or strong intensity produces opposite behavioral effects; moreover, interruption of either kind of stimulation invariably results in the appearance of powerful antagonistic aftereffects. There is a strict correlation between approach behavior and hippocampal theta rhythm on the one hand and withdrawal behavior and desynchronization on the other. The importance of the antagonistic aftereffects in the organization of conditional processes and in the interpretation of the ""drive reduction"" hypothesis is emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2031236139,"A numerical, fluid-dynamics technique for high-speed computers is described and illustrated. It applies to the solution of problems dealing with incompressible viscous fluids and involving nonsteady motions in several dimensions in space. The ability to handle free-surface boundary conditions allows waves to be studied through all phases of breaking and splashing, as well as a number of related phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2070665106,"Chromium-51 and zinc-65 were detected as far as 115 and 15 kilometers, respectively, from the mouth of the Columbia River; zinc-65 also was found at a few isolated stations. Zirconium-95 and niobium-95 from atmospheric fallout occurred in the river effluent but they were most abundant in surface waters further offshore. Distribution of the radionuclides is controlled largely by surface currents and by upwelling of sea water near the coast."

https://openalex.org/W1972546006,"Cerebral temperature was continuously recorded in male rats during sexual activity. The temperature showed a persistent increase in the presence of females and a relatively brief, rapid increase during sexual intromission. Cerebral temperature may be usable as a sensitive measure of immediate and persisting motivational effects of transitory and longterm conditions of stimulation."
