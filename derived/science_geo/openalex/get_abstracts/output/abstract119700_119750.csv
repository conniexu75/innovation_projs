https://openalex.org/W2149967205,"A cell-free system based on cytosols of normally growing cells is established that reproduces aspects of the apoptotic program in vitro. The apoptotic program is initiated by addition of dATP. Fractionation of cytosol yielded a 15 kDa protein that is required for in vitro apoptosis. The absorption spectrum and protein sequence revealed that this protein is cytochrome c. Elimination of cytochrome c from cytosol by immunodepletion, or inclusion of sucrose to stabilize mitochondria during cytosol preparation, diminished the apoptotic activity. Adding back cytochrome c to the cytochrome c–depleted extracts restored their apoptotic activity. Cells undergoing apoptosis in vivo showed increased release of cytochrome c to their cytosol, suggesting that mitochondria may function in apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c."

A total of 1738 predicted protein-coding genes were identified; however, only a minority of these (38 percent) could be assigned a putative cellular role with high confidence. Although the majority of genes related to energy production, cell division, and metabolism in M. jannaschii are most similar to those found in Bacteria, most of the genes involved in transcription, translation, and replication in M. jannaschii are more similar to those found in Eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1995734405,"Small synthetic molecules termed growth hormone secretagogues (GHSs) act on the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus to stimulate and amplify pulsatile growth hormone (GH) release. A heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (GPC-R) of the pituitary and arcuate ventro-medial and infundibular hypothalamus of swine and humans was cloned and was shown to be the target of the GHSs. On the basis of its pharmacological and molecular characterization, this GPC-R defines a neuroendocrine pathway for the control of pulsatile GH release and supports the notion that the GHSs mimic an undiscovered hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1965217295,"THE Bcl-2 family of proteins regulate programmed cell death by an unknown mechanism1. Here we describe the crystal and solution structures of a Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL (ref. 2). The structures consist of two central, primarily hydrophobic α-helices, which are surrounded by amphipathic helices. A 60-residue loop connecting helices αl and α2 was found to be flexible and non-essential for anti-apoptotic activity. The three functionally important Bcl-2 homology regions (BH1, BH2 and BH3)3–5 are in close spatial proximity and form an elongated hydrophobic cleft that may represent the binding site for other Bcl-2 family members. The arrangement of the α-helices in Bcl-xL is reminiscent of the membrane translocation domain of bacterial toxins, in particular diphtheria toxin and the colicins6. The structural similarity may provide a clue to the mechanism of action of the Bcl-2 family of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2046589688,"A murine model of ataxia telangiectasia was created by disrupting the Atm locus via gene targeting. Mice homozygous for the disrupted Atm allele displayed growth retardation, neurologic dysfunction, male and female infertility secondary to the absence of mature gametes, defects in T lymphocyte maturation, and extreme sensitivity to γ-irradiation. The majority of animals developed malignant thymic lymphomas between 2 and 4 months of age. Several chromosomal anomalies were detected in one of these tumors. Fibroblasts from these mice grew slowly and exhibited abnormal radiation-induced G1 checkpoint function. Atm-disrupted mice recapitulate the ataxia telangiectasia phenotype in humans, providing a mammalian model in which to study the pathophysiology of this pleiotropic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2081524299,"A signaling pathway has been elucidated whereby growth factors activate the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), a critical regulator of immediate early gene transcription. Growth factor-stimulated CREB phosphorylation at serine-133 is mediated by the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. MAPK activates CREB kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates CREB. Purification, sequencing, and biochemical characterization of CREB kinase revealed that it is identical to a member of the pp90(RSK) family, RSK2. RSK2 was shown to mediate growth factor induction of CREB serine-133 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify a cellular function for RSK2 and define a mechanism whereby growth factor signals mediated by RAS and MAPK are transmitted to the nucleus to activate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2158366682,"The plant hormone auxin regulates various developmental processes including root formation, vascular development, and gravitropism. Mutations within the AUX1 gene confer an auxin-resistant root growth phenotype and abolish root gravitropic curvature. Polypeptide sequence similarity to amino acid permeases suggests that AUX1 mediates the transport of an amino acid-like signaling molecule. Indole-3-acetic acid, the major form of auxin in higher plants, is structurally similar to tryptophan and is a likely substrate for the AUX1 gene product. The cloned AUX1 gene can restore the auxin-responsiveness of transgenic aux1 roots. Spatially, AUX1 is expressed in root apical tissues that regulate root gravitropic curvature."
https://openalex.org/W1999047431,"The T cell leukemia oncoprotein SCL/tal-1, a basic–helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is required for production of embryonic red blood cells in the mouse yolk sac. To define roles in other lineages, we studied the hematopoietic potential of homozygous mutant SCL/tal-1 −/− embryonic stem cells upon in vitro differentiation and in vivo in chimeric mice. Here we show that in the absence of SCL/tal-1, hematopoiesis, including the generation of red cells, myeloid cells, megakaryocytes, mast cells, and both T and B lymphoid cells, is undetectable. These findings suggest that SCL/tal-1 functions very early in hematopoietic development, either in specification of ventral mesoderm to a blood cell fate, or in formation or maintenance of immature progenitors."

https://openalex.org/W2071786252,"Cardiac Na+,Ca2+ exchange is activated by a mechanism that requires hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but is not mediated by protein kinases. In giant cardiac membrane patches, ATP acted to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from phosphatidylinositol (PI). The action of ATP was abolished by a PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and recovered after addition of exogenous PI; it was reversed by a PIP2-specific PLC; and it was mimicked by exogenous PIP2. High concentrations of free Ca2+ (5 to 20 microM) accelerated reversal of the ATP effect, and PLC activity in myocyte membranes was activated with a similar Ca2+ dependence. Aluminum reversed the ATP effect by binding with high affinity to PIP2. ATP-inhibited potassium channels (KATP) were also sensitive to PIP2, whereas Na+,K+ pumps and Na+ channels were not. Thus, PIP2 may be an important regulator of both ion transporters and channels."
https://openalex.org/W1973891844,"In tomato, resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strains expressing the avirulence gene avrPto requires the presence of at least two host genes, designated Pto and Prf. Here we report that Prf encodes a protein with leucine-zipper, nucleotide-binding, and leucine-rich repeat motifs, as are found in a number of resistance gene products from other plants. prf mutant alleles (4) were found to carry alterations within the Prf coding sequence. A genomic fragment containing Prf complemented a prf mutant tomato line both for resistance to Pst strains expressing avrPto and for sensitivity to the insecticide Fenthion. Prf resides in the middle of the Pto gene cluster, 24 kb from the Pto gene and 500 bp from the Fen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1989105446,"Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa and harbors more than 300 endemic species of haplochromine cichlid fish. Seismic reflection profiles and piston cores show that the lake not only was at a low stand but dried up completely during the Late Pleistocene, before 12,400 carbon-14 years before the present. These results imply that the rate of speciation of cichlid fish in this tropical lake has been extremely rapid."
https://openalex.org/W2074345277,"Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases have been proposed to control axon guidance and fasciculation. To address the biological functions of the Eph family member Nuk, two mutations in the mouse germline have been generated: a protein null allele (Nuk1) and an allele that encodes a Nuk-βgal fusion receptor lacking the tyrosine kinase and C-terminal domains (NuklacZ). In Nuk1 homozygous brains, the majority of axons forming the posterior tract of the anterior commissure migrate aberrantly to the floor of the brain, resulting in a failure of cortical neurons to link the two temporal lobes. These results indicate that Nuk, a receptor that binds transmembrane ligands, plays a critical and unique role in the pathfinding of specific axons in the mammalian central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1993056927,"To identify genes important for human cognitive development, we studied Williams syndrome (WS), a developmental disorder that includes poor visuospatial constructive cognition. Here we describe two families with a partial WS phenotype; affected members have the specific WS cognitive profile and vascular disease, but lack other WS features. Submicroscopic chromosome 7q11.23 deletions cosegregate with this phenotype in both families. DNA sequence analyses of the region affected by the smallest deletion (83.6 kb) revealed two genes, elastin (ELN ) and LIM-kinase1 (LIMK1). The latter encodes a novel protein kinase with LIM domains and is strongly expressed in the brain. Because ELN mutations cause vascular disease but not cognitive abnormalities, these data implicate LIMK1 hemizygosity in impaired visuospatial constructive cognition."
https://openalex.org/W1964361564,"Autocatalytic processing mediated by the carboxy-terminal domain of the hedgehog (hh) protein precursor (Hh) generates an amino-terminal product that accounts for all known signaling activity. The role of autoprocessing in biogenesis of the hh signal has been unclear, since a truncated unprocessed protein lacking all carboxy-terminal domain sequences retains signaling activity. Here, we present evidence that the autoprocessing reaction proceeds via an internal thioester intermediate and results in a covalent modification that increases the hydrophobic character of the signaling domain and influences its spatial and subcellular distribution. We demonstrate that truncated unprocessed amino-terminal protein causes embryonic mispatterning, even when expression is localized to cells that normally express Hh, thus suggesting a role for autoprocessing in spatial regulation of hh signaling. This type of processing also appears to operate in the biogenesis of other novel secreted proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2021278943,"Aniridia in man and Small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene PAX6. Whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia, homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities. To investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail, we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human PAX6 locus. When crossed onto the Small eye background, the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype. Strikingly, mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye, but not of other tissues expressing the gene. Thus, at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in PAX6 expression. We provide evidence that not only reduced, but also increased levels of transcriptional regulators can cause developmental defects."
https://openalex.org/W1974292630,"It is proposed here that the delayed cytotoxicity of thioguanine involves the postreplicative DNA mismatch repair system. After incorporation into DNA, the thioguanine is chemically methylated by S-adenosylmethionine to form S6-methylthioguanine. During DNA replication, the S6-methylthioguanine directs incorporation of either thymine or cytosine into the growing DNA strand, and the resultant S6-methylthioguanine-thymine pairs are recognized by the postreplicative mismatch repair system. Azathioprine, an immunosuppressant used in organ transplantation, is partly converted to thioguanine. Because the carcinogenicity of N-nitrosamines depends on formation of O6-alkylguanine in DNA, the formation of the analog S6-methylthioguanine during azathioprine treatment may partly explain the high incidence of cancer after transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2087985833,"We have investigated the mechanism that enables achiasmate chromosomes to segregate from each other at meiosis I in D. melanogaster oocytes. Using novel cytological methods, we asked whether nonexchange chromosomes are paired prior to disjunction. Our results show that the heterochromatin of homologous chromosomes remains associated throughout prophase until metaphase I regardless of whether they undergo exchange, suggesting that homologous recognition can lead to segregation even in the absence of chiasmata. However, partner chromosomes lacking homology do not pair prior to disjunction. Furthermore, euchromatic synapsis is not maintained throughout prophase. These observations provide a physical demonstration that homologous and heterologous achiasmate segregations occur by different mechanisms and establish a role for heterochromatin in maintaining the alignment of chromosomes during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2091991077,"A methane record from the GISP2 ice core reveals that millennial-scale variations in atmospheric methane concentration characterized much of the past 110,000 years. As previously observed in a shorter record from central Greenland, abrupt concentration shifts of about 50 to 300 parts per billion by volume were coeval with most of the interstadial warming events (better known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events) recorded in the GISP2 ice core throughout the last glacial period. The magnitude of the rapid concentration shifts varied on a longer time scale in a manner consistent with variations in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, which suggests that insolation may have modulated the effects of interstadial climate change on the terrestrial biosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1979098362,"A previously unknown redox cofactor has been identified in the active site of lysyl oxidase from the bovine aorta. Edman sequencing, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectra, and resonance Raman studies showed that this cofactor is a quinone. Its structure is derived from the crosslinking of the epsilon-amino group of a peptidyl lysine with the modified side chain of a tyrosyl residue, and it has been designated lysine tyrosylquinone. This quinone appears to be the only example of a mammalian cofactor formed from the crosslinking of two amino acid side chains. This discovery expands the range of known quino-cofactor structures and has implications for the mechanism of their biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2006389406,"The spindle assembly checkpoint keeps cells with defective spindles from initiating chromosome segregation. The protein kinase Mps1 phosphorylates the yeast protein Mad1p when this checkpoint is activated, and the overexpression of Mps1p induces modification of Mad1p and arrests wild-type yeast cells in mitosis with morphologically normal spindles. Spindle assembly checkpoint mutants overexpressing Mps1p pass through mitosis without delay and can produce viable progeny, which demonstrates that the arrest of wild-type cells results from inappropriate activation of the checkpoint in cells whose spindle is fully functional. Ectopic activation of cell-cycle checkpoints might be used to exploit the differences in checkpoint status between normal and tumor cells and thus improve the selectivity of chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2070204151,"Arabidopsis COP9 is a component of a large protein complex that is essential for the light control of a developmental switch and whose conformation or size is modulated by light. The complex is acidic, binds heparin, and is localized within the nucleus. Biochemical purification of the complex to near homogeneity revealed that it contains 12 distinct subunits. One of the other subunits is COP11, mutations in which result in a phenotype identical to cop9 mutants. The COP9 complex may act to regulate the nuclear abundance of COP1, an established repressor of photomorphogenic development. During the biogenesis of the COP9 complex, a certain degree of prior subunit association is a prerequisite for proper nuclear translocation. Since both COP9 and COP11 have closely related human counterparts, the COP9 complex probably represents a conserved developmental regulator in higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2088879940,"X inactivation results in inactivation of one X chromosome to compensate for gene dosage differences between mammalian females and males. It requires the X-inactivation center (Xic) and Xist in cis. We report that introducing 450 kb of murine Xic/Xist sequences onto autosomes activates female dosage compensation in male ES cells. Xist is induced upon differentiation and can be expressed from both endogenous and ectopic loci, suggesting that elements for counting and choosing Xs are present in the transgene. Differentiating transgenic ES cells undergo excessive cell death. Postnatally, Xist is expressed only from the transgene. Ectopic Xist RNA structurally associates with the autosome and may inactivate a marker gene in cis. These results argue that the Xic is contained within 450 kb and that these sequences are sufficient for chromosome counting, choosing, and initiation of X inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W2008686052,"Although neurons in primary visual cortex are sensitive to the spatial distribution and intensity of light, their responses have not been thought to correlate with the perception of brightness. Indeed, primary visual cortex is often described as an initial processing stage that sends information to higher cortical areas where perception of brightness, color, and form occurs. However, a significant percentage of neurons in primary visual cortex were shown to respond in a manner correlated with perceived brightness, rather than responding strictly to the light level in the receptive fields of the cells. This finding suggests that even at the first stage of visual cortical processing, spatial integration of information yields perceptual qualities that are only indirectly related to the pattern of illumination of the retina."

https://openalex.org/W2066928538,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens can genetically transform eukaryotic cells. In many bacteria, pili are required for interbacterial DNA transfer. The formation of pili by Agrobacterium required induction of tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid-encoded virulence genes and growth at low temperature. A genetic analysis demonstrated that virA, virG, virB1 through virB11, and virD4 are the only Ti plasmid genes necessary for pilus assembly. The loss and gain of pili in various mutants correlated with the loss and gain of transferred DNA (T-DNA) transfer functions, which is consistent with the view that Agrobacterium pili are required for transfer of DNA to plant cells in a process similar to that of conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W2010383826,"Inheritance of the active and inactive states of gene expression by individual cells is crucial for development. In fission yeast, mating-type region consists of three loci called mat1, mat2, and mat3. Transcriptionally silent mat2 and mat3 loci are separated by a 15 kb interval, designated the K-region, and serve as donors of information for transcriptionally active mat1 interconversion. In a strain carrying replacement of 7.5 kb of the K-region with the ura4 gene, we discovered that ura4 silencing and efficiency of mating-type switching were covariegated and were regulated by an epigenetic mechanism. Genetic analyses demonstrated that epigenetic states were remarkably stable not only in mitosis but also in meiosis and were linked to the mating-type region. This study indicates that different epigenetic states are heritable forms of chromatin organization at the mat region."
https://openalex.org/W1999237392,"Apolipoproteins are protein constituents of plasma lipid transport particles. Human apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) was expressed in the liver of C57BL/6 mice and mice deficient in apoE, both of which are prone to atherosclerosis, to investigate whether apoA-IV protects against this disease. In transgenic C57BL/6 mice on an atherogenic diet, the serum concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 35 percent, whereas the concentration of endogenous apoA-I decreased by 29 percent, relative to those in transgenic mice on a normal diet. Expression of human apoA-IV in apoE-deficient mice on a normal diet resulted in an even more severe atherogenic lipoprotein profile, without affecting the concentration of HDL cholesterol, than that in nontransgenic apoE-deficient mice. However, transgenic mice of both backgrounds showed a substantial reduction in the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, apoA-IV appears to protect against atherosclerosis by a mechanism that does not involve an increase in HDL cholesterol concentration."

The responses of these neurons to an echo are facilitated by a biosonar pulse emitted by the bat when the echo returns with a particular delay from a target located at a particular distance. Electrical stimulation of cortical delay-tuned neurons increases the delay-tuned responses of collicular neurons tuned to the same echo delay as the cortical neurons and decreases those of collicular neurons tuned to different echo delays. Cortical neurons improve information processing in the inferior colliculus by way of the corticocollicular projection."
https://openalex.org/W2032388023,"Chagas' disease, a protozoan infection by the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma cruzi, constitutes a major public health problem in Latin America. With the use of mouse models of both short- and long-term forms of the disease, the efficacy of D0870, a bis-triazole derivative, was tested. D0870 was able to prevent death and induced parasitological cure in 70 to 90 percent of animals, in both the short- and long-term disease. In contrast, currently used drugs such as nifurtimox or ketoconazole prolonged survival but did not induce significant curing effects. D0870 may be useful in the treatment of human long-term Chagas' disease, a condition that is currently incurable."
https://openalex.org/W2011968083,"The Neurospora crassa Asm-1+ (ascospore maturation 1) gene encodes an abundant nucleus-localized protein required for formation of female structures and for ascospore maturation. Deletion mutants of Asm-1+ are ""ascus-dominant,"" i.e., when crossed to wild type, neither Asm-1+ nor Asm-1 delta spores mature. To explain this behavior, we considered three models: an effect of reduced dosage of the gene product, failure of internuclear communication, and failure of transvection (regulation dependent on pairing of alleles). We found that for proper regulation of subsequent sexual sporulation, Asm-1+ must be in proximity, probably paired, to its allelic counterpart in the zygote: i.e., transvection must occur. Disruption of pairing causes failure of ascospore progeny to mature. Transvection in Neurospora, unlike in Drosophila, occurs immediately before meiosis, and can be demonstrated between wild-type alleles."
https://openalex.org/W1994610242,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the SRC-related TEC family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). DT-40 lymphoma B cells, rendered BTK-deficient through targeted disruption of the btk gene by homologous recombination knockout, did not undergo radiation-induced apoptosis, but cells with disrupted lyn or syk genes did. Introduction of the wild-type, or a SRC homology 2 domain or a plecstrin homology domain mutant (but not a kinase domain mutant), human btk gene into BTK-deficient cells restored the apoptotic response to radiation. Thus, BTK is the PTK responsible for triggering radiation-induced apoptosis of lymphoma B cells, and its kinase domain is indispensable for the apoptotic response."

The closely related Valpha3.1 and Valpha3.2 elements show reciprocal selection into CD4 and CD8 subsets, respectively. Transgenic mice expressing site-directed mutants of a Valpha3.1 gene were used to show that individual residues in either the complementarity-determining region 1 (CDR1) or CDR2 were sufficient to change selection from the CD4 subset to the CD8 subset. Thus, the germline-encoded Valpha elements are a major influence on major histocompatibility class complex (MHC) restriction, most likely by a preferential interaction with one or the other class of MHC molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2059764349,"Although ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites dominate observed falls, the identification of near-Earth and main-belt asteroid sources has remained elusive. Telescopic measurements of 35 near-Earth asteroids ( approximately3 kilometers in diameter) revealed six that have visible wavelength spectra similar to laboratory spectra of OC meteorites. Near-Earth asteroids were found to have spectral properties that span the range between the previously separated domains of OC meteorites and the most common (S class) asteroids, suggesting a link. This range of spectral properties could arise through a diversity of mineralogies and regolith particle sizes, as well as through a time-dependent surface weathering process."

A screen for proteins interacting with Tax yielded a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the human Int-6 protein. In mice, the Int-6 gene can be converted into a putative dominant negative oncogene after retroviral insertion. Here, Int-6 was localized in the cell nucleus to give a speckled staining pattern superposed to that of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. The binding of Tax to Int-6 caused its redistribution from the nuclear domains to the cytoplasm. Thus, Int-6 is a component of the PML nuclear bodies and Tax disrupts its normal cellular localization by binding to it."

Most EKOs larger than about 100 kilometers in diameter survive over the age of the solar system, but at smaller sizes collisional breakup is frequent, producing a cascade of fragments having a power law size-frequency distribution. Collisions are also a plausible mechanism for injecting EKOs 1 to 10 kilometers in diameter into dynamical resonances, where they can be transported into the inner solar system to become short-period comets. The fragmental nature of these comets may explain their physical properties, such as shape, color, and strength."

Thus, Rad4-Rad23 proteins may function in tethering the different components of the incision machinery at the damage site. Rad1-Rad10 and Rad2 endonucleases mediate the dual incision of the damage-containing DNA strand(11.Sung P. Reynolds P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26391-26399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Tomkinson A.E. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tappe N.J. Friedberg E.C.

The human homologs of the yeast NER proteins share similar biochemical activities. XPA binds damaged DNA, XPD and XPB are DNA helicases, and XPG and ERCC1-XPF encode the two nucleases (14.Jones C.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in both the yeast and human systems, incision of UV-damaged DNA is absolutely dependent upon RPA(6.Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7.Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of RPA in the incision process remains unclear. RPA is a highly conserved heterotrimeric protein, composed of three subunits of 70, 32, and 14 kDa in humans. In DNA replication, RPA is required for origin-dependent unwinding by the SV40 large T antigen (19.Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In incision, RPA could function in an analogous manner by binding and stabilizing ssDNA created as a result of unwinding by the two DNA helicases present in TFIIH. Alternatively, RPA could function in another step, such as in damage recognition. Here, we show that RPA binds specifically to UV-damaged DNA, thus identifying RPA as a damage recognition factor. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was freshly transformed with p11d-tRPA, which co-expresses all three subunits of human RPA, and induced as described(20.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 4-g pellet of RPA expressing E. coli was suspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT) containing 100 mM KCl and protease inhibitors(21.Sung P. Prakash L. Weber S. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Crude cell lysate was prepared by passage of the bacterial suspension through a French Press and subjected to fractionation in columns of Affi-Gel Blue, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q, as described(20.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A HindIII-SalI 130-base pair DNA fragment from plasmid pTB402 (8.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was purified by electroelution from polyacrylamide gels. The DNA fragment was labeled at the 3′ end using Klenow polymerase and [α-α−32P]dATP (100 μCi; 6000 Ci/mmol) to a specific activity of 2.5 × 106 cpm/μg. The labeled fragment was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.2 mM EDTA). The purified DNA fragment was irradiated with 15-watt germicidal lamps emitting at 254 nm at a fluence rate of 10 J/m2/s. UV-irradiated DNA or its non-irradiated counterpart, 2 ng each, was incubated with RPA (20 to 100 ng) in 10 μl of reaction buffer (30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 30 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 100 μg/ml BSA). After 30 min at 30°C, samples were mixed with 8 μl of gel loading buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50% glycerol, and 0.05% Orange G) and electrophoresed at 4°C for 2 h at 2 mA/cm in 3.5% polyacrylamide gels, using 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA as running buffer. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak XRP film. Autoradiograms were subjected to image analysis in a Bio-Rad GS-670 Imaging Densitometer to obtain data points for graphical representation of the results. UV-irradiated α−32P-labeled DNA fragment (0.25 μg) was incubated with 6 μg of E. coli photolyase in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 μg/ml BSA) for 1 h at 25°C under black light emitting at ∼360 nm. After photoreactivating treatment, reaction mixtures were extracted twice with phenol, and the DNA was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol at −70°C and redissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer. The removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was verified by incubating 5 ng of the photoreactivated DNA with T4 pyrimidine-dimer endonuclease in 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, and 100 μg/ml BSA), as described previously(8.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were heated at 95°C for 3 min, chilled on ice, and electrophoresed in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA). After drying, the gel was exposed to an x-ray film to detect the products generated as a result of the T4 endonuclease action. For examining the DNA damage binding properties of RPA, it was purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid p11d-tRPA, which co-expresses the three RPA subunits(20.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPA thus purified is fully active in the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA(20.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in nucleotide excision repair in a reconstituted system(7.Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and exhibits an affinity for ssDNA indistinguishable from that observed with RPA purified from HeLa cell extract(20.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the chromatographic procedures described by Henricksen et al.(20.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that yield biologically active RPA protein, we subjected clarified bacterial extract to fractionation in columns of Affi-Gel Blue, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q. As shown in Fig. 1A, the RPA pool (fraction IV) from the final step of purification on Mono Q contained stoichiometric amounts of the 70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits of RPA, and a minor species migrating below the largest subunit, which, as has been noted before(20.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a proteolytic product of the 70-kDa RPA subunit. The fraction IV RPA (Fig. 1A) was used in all of the DNA binding experiments described below. The lesions induced by UV light occur predominantly at pyrimidine residues in DNA. As DNA probe for damage binding, a 130-base pair DNA fragment high in pyrimidine content was therefore chosen, and it was generated by restriction digest of plasmid DNA, purified, and 3′-end-labeled with α−32P, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The radiolabeled DNA fragment was then irradiated with an ultraviolet source for increasing lengths of time, giving final dosages ranging from 0.5 to 15 kJ/m2. In the UV damage binding reaction, RPA was incubated with the DNA fragment which had received increasing UV dosage in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2 and 30 mM KCl at 30°C for 30 min, and the reaction mixtures were mixed with loading buffer and then applied onto 3.5% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis at 4°C, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films to visualize the free DNA probe and any retarded form of the DNA probe, which would be indicative of an RPA-DNA complex. As shown in Fig. 1B, a slow migrating form of the UV irradiated DNA fragment, designated as C, was seen upon incubation with RPA, indicating that RPA binds UV damage. The amount of the RPA-DNA complex increased with the UV dose, and densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram indicated that, at the highest dose (15 kJ/m2) used, greater than 85% of the input DNA probe was bound by RPA (Fig. 1, B and C). We next examined complex formation as a function of RPA concentration, using DNA fragment that had been irradiated with 15 kJ/m2 of UV. As expected, the amount of RPA-damaged DNA complex increased with the RPA concentration (Fig. 2, A and B). In these (Figure 1:, Figure 2:) and other experiments (data not shown), only a low level (≤2%) of binding of the nonirradiated counterpart of the DNA fragment was detected, even at the highest amount of RPA used (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Taken together, our results indicate that RPA binds preferentially to duplex DNA containing UV-induced lesions. In the experiments described thus far, wherein preferential binding of RPA to UV damaged DNA occurred, 3 mM MgCl2 was present during incubation of DNA with RPA. Interestingly, when MgCl2 was omitted from the reaction, the undamaged DNA fragment was bound by RPA nearly as well as the UV irradiated (15 kJ/m2) DNA (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 8). Consistent with the results obtained in prior experiments (Figure 1:, Figure 2:), nonspecific binding of RPA to undamaged DNA was essentially eliminated by the inclusion of 3 mM Mg2+, such that only <2% of the unirradiated DNA was bound by RPA in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+, as compared to binding of >85% of the DNA in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9). As shown in Fig. 3, binding of RPA to the UV-irradiated fragment was also reduced from 100% to 50% by 3 mM Mg2+ (lanes 2 and 3). However, because RPA binds nonspecifically to undamaged DNA in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 3, lane 8), the reduction observed (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3) was very likely due to abolition of binding of RPA to sites other than those containing UV lesions in the target DNA. In support of this notion, efficient binding to UV damaged DNA still occurred when the Mg2+ concentration was further increased to 12 mM (Fig. 3, lane 6). These results therefore indicate that nonspecific, low affinity binding of RPA to nondamaged duplex DNA is overcome by Mg2+ in the millimolar range, allowing detection of specific binding to the UV damage. The binding of UV damaged DNA by RPA is not affected by KCl up to 100 mM, and the addition of 1 mM ATP has no effect on binding, but the inclusion of 0.2% SDS at the beginning of reaction abolished damage binding (data not shown). Two major classes of DNA lesions are induced by exposure to UV light; namely, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and the pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photoproducts ((6-4) photoproducts). The kinetics of formation of these two types of UV lesions, however, differ considerably. At UV doses up to 2 kJ/m2, CPDs are introduced into DNA at ≈5 times the frequency of that of the(6-4) photoproducts, but formation of the former reaches photochemical equilibrium at ≈4 kJ/m2, whereas the yield of the(6-4) photoproducts continues to increase linearly with the UV dose above 4 kJ/m2(22.Bourre F. Renault G. Sarasin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8861-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23.Spivak G. Leadon S.A. Vos J.M. Meade S. Hanawalt P.C. Ganesan A.K. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar). An examination of the RPA damage binding profile as a function of the UV dose (Fig. 1, B and C) revealed that the amount of RPA-DNA complex is relatively insignificant at low UV doses where the CPD represents the predominant lesion, suggesting that the primary target for RPA in UV-damaged DNA is the(6-4) photoproduct. We used enzymatic photoreactivation, a procedure that selectively and quantitatively removes CPDs from UV-damaged DNA without affecting the content of the(6-4) photoproducts, to test the notion that RPA has little affinity for the former class of UV lesion. To do this, DNA which had been irradiated with a UV dose of either 3 kJ/m2 or 15 kJ/m2 was incubated with E. coli photolyase under photoreactivating light, which provides the energy for photolyase to catalyze the monomerization of the pyrimidine dimers(24.Sancar G.B. Smith F.W. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1849-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To verify that CPDs in the UV-irradiated DNA had been removed, after incubation with photolyase, the DNA was treated with the bacteriophage T4 pyrimidine-dimer endonuclease, which nicks DNA at CPD sites. As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of UV-irradiated DNA with photolyase resulted in the removal of T4 endonuclease-sensitive sites, indicating that the UV-damaged DNA had now been freed of CPDs. We then examined the ability of the photoreactivated, UV-irradiated DNA to form a complex with RPA. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, complex formation between UV irradiated DNA and RPA was refractory to enzymatic photoreactivation, indicating that RPA does not detectably bind CPD and suggesting that RPA binds the(6-4) photoproduct in target DNA. At the UV dose of 12 kJ/m2, where we observed ∼50-fold preferential binding to UV-damaged DNA (Fig. 1), there are ∼1.8(6-4) photoproducts per DNA probe. From these results, it can be estimated that RPA binds the UV damage with an affinity ∼3600-fold over undamaged nucleotides. In this work, we demonstrate a role for human RPA in DNA damage recognition. RPA binds specifically to UV-damaged DNA in a UV dose- and protein concentration-dependent manner. Enzymatic photoreactivation experiments suggest that RPA has affinity for(6-4) photoproducts. It remains to be determined whether RPA recognizes the UV damage per se or the single-strandedness resulting from UV lesions. The damage binding ability of RPA may explain the absolute dependence of the damage-specific incision reaction on RPA. RPA binds tightly to ssDNA with an apparent binding constant of ∼109(25.Mitsis P.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Lehman I.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26.Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the ss binding activity of RPA is necessary for both replication and recombination. In SV40 origin-dependent DNA replication, RPA assists in DNA unwinding catalyzed by T antigen by binding and stabilizing the unwound, single-stranded DNA. RPA also functions as a single strand binding protein in DNA chain elongation, and interaction with RPA stimulates the activity of various enzymes assembled at the replication fork (reviewed in (27.Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)). Additionally, RPA functions as an important component in the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction catalyzed by the S. cerevisiae Rad51 protein(28.Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In this reaction, as a single strand DNA-binding protein, RPA enhances the efficiency of Rad51 filament formation on ssDNA(29.Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Our study now implicates RPA as a damage recognition factor in NER. The structure and function of RPA have been conserved among eukaryotes; the 70-kDa subunit binds ssDNA and interacts directly with the 32- and 14-kDa subunits (30 and references therein). Between residues 481 and 503, human RPA70 contains a putative C4 type zinc finger motif, and this motif is conserved in all known RPA70 homologs. This C4 motif does not appear to be necessary for ssDNA binding activity, because a protein deleted for the carboxyl-terminal portion of RPA, including the C4 zinc finger motif, retains normal ssbinding activity(30.Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4534-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The C4 motif may have a role in specific binding of RPA to DNA damage sites.

https://openalex.org/W1989385298,"Glutamate and aspartate are endogenous excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters widely distributed in the mammalian central nervous system. Aspartate was shown to induce a large membrane current sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptor antagonists in Purkinje cells from mice lacking functional NMDA receptors (NR1(-/-)). This response was accompanied by high permeability to calcium. In contrast, no current was induced by aspartate in hippocampal neurons and cerebellar granule cells from NR1(-/-) mice. Several other glutamate receptor agonists failed to evoke this response. Thus, in Purkinje cells, aspartate activates a distinct response capable of contributing to synaptic plasticity through calcium permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1997977506,"Measurements by the Galileo probe support the possibility that the zonal winds in Jupiter's atmosphere originate from convection that takes place in the deep hydrogen-helium interior. However, according to models based on recent opacity data and the probe's temperature measurements, there may be radiative and nonconvective layers in the outer part of the jovian interior, raising the question of how deep convection could extend to the surface. A theoretical model is presented to demonstrate that, because of predominant rotational effects and spherical geometry, thermal convection in the deep jovian interior can penetrate into any outer nonconvective layer. These penetrative convection rolls interact nonlinearly and efficiently in the model to generate and sustain a mean zonal wind with a larger amplitude than that of the nonaxisymmetric penetrative convective motions, a characteristic of the wind field observed at the cloud level on Jupiter."

https://openalex.org/W2068744765,X-ray lasers (XRLs) have experimental average gains that are significantly less than calculated values and a persistently low level of spatial coherence. An XRL has been used both as an injected signal to a short XRL amplifier and as an interferometer beam to measure two-dimensional local gain and density profiles of the XRL plasma with a resolution near 1 micrometer. The measured local gain is in agreement with atomic models but is unexpectedly spatially inhomogeneous. This inhomogeneity is responsible for the low level of spatial coherence observed and helps explain the disparity between observed and simulated gains.
