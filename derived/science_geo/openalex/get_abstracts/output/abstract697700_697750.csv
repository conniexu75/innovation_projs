https://openalex.org/W4288447257,"Despite using effective drugs and vaccines for Covid 19, due to some limitations of current strategies and the high rate of coronavirus mutation, the development of medicines with effective inhibitory activity against this infection is essential. The SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by attaching its receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). According to previous studies, the natural peptide Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) exhibited an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV, but its mechanism has not precisely been elucidated. Here, we studied the interaction between UDA and RBD of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. So, protein-protein docking of RBD-UDA was performed using Cluspro 2.0. To further confirm the stability of the complex, the RBD-UDA docked complex with higher binding affinity was studied using Molecular Dynamic simulation (via Gromacs 2020.2), and MM-PBSA calculated the binding free energy of the system. In addition, ELISA assay was used to examine the binding of UDA with RBD protein. Results were compared to ELISA of RBD-bound samples of convalescent serum IgG (from donors who recovered from Covid 19). Finally, the toxicity of UDA is assessed by using MTT assay. The docking results show UDA binds to the RBD binding site. MD simulation illustrates the UDA-RBD complex is stable during 100 ns of simulation, and the average binding energy was calculated to be -47.505 kJ/mol. ELISA and, MTT results show that UDA binds to RBD like IgG-RBD binding and may be safe in human cells. Data presented here indicate UDA interaction with S-protein inhibits the binding sites of RBD, it can prevent the virus from attaching to ACE2 and entering the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W4288425746,"Due to the rapid progress of urbanization in China, the percentage of residential energy consumption out of total energy consumption has increased. This paper uses statistical data from 30 Chinese provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) from 2000 to 2020 to analyze the impact of urbanization on residential energy consumption and construct an econometric model to test the mechanism. The empirical tests show that the consumption of direct energy (energy that exists in nature in its original form and has not been transformed) is positively U-shaped about the urbanization rate. Furthermore, the impact of economic development on direct and indirect energy consumption is significantly positive. In contrast, the effects of population agglomeration on immediate energy consumption are adverse, and the indirect energy consumption is positive."
https://openalex.org/W4288439835,"Background Cell survival or death is one of the key scientific issues of inflammatory response. To regulate cell death during the occurrence and development of periodontitis, various forms of programmed cell death, such as pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and apoptosis, have been proposed. It has been found that ferroptosis characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation is involved in cancer, degenerative brain diseases and inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, NCOA4 is considered one of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) contributing to butyrate-induced cell death in the periodontitis. This research aims to analyze the expression of FRGs in periodontitis tissues and to explore the relationship between ferroptosis and periodontitis. Method Genes associated with periodontitis were retrieved from two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Then, we normalized microarray data and removed the batch effect using the R software. We used R to convert the mRNA expression data and collected the expression of FRGs. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), transcription factor (TF) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were used. In addition, we constructed a receiver operating characteristic curve and obtained relative mRNA expression verified by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Eight and 10 FRGs related to periodontitis were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. GO analysis showed that FRGs were enriched in the regulation of glutathione biosynthetic, glutamate homeostasis, and endoplasmic reticulum-nucleus signaling pathway. The top TFs included CEBPB , JUND , ATF2 . Based on the PPI network analysis, FRGs were mainly linked to the negative regulation of IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response, regulation of type IIa hypersensitivity, and regulation of apoptotic cell clearance. The expression levels of NCOA4 , SLC1A5 and HSPB1 using PCR were significantly different between normal gingival samples and periodontitis samples. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of FRGs for periodontitis were “Good”. Conclusions We found significant associations between FRGs and periodontitis. The present study not only provides a new possible pathomechanism for the occurrence of periodontitis but also offers a new direction for the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W4288440925,"The Internet of Things (IoT) and its relevant advances have attracted significant scholarly, governmental, and industrial attention in recent years. Since the IoT specifications are quite different from what the Internet can deliver today, many groundbreaking techniques, such as Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), have gradually been integrated into IoT. The Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy network (RPL) is the de-facto IoT routing protocol in such networks. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to numerous internal attacks. Many techniques, such as cryptography, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and authorization have been used to counter this. The large computational overhead of these techniques limits their direct application to IoT nodes, especially due to their low power and lossy nature. Therefore, this paper proposes a Trust-based Hybrid Cooperative RPL protocol (THC-RPL) to detect malicious Sybil nodes in an RPL-based IoT network. The proposed technique is compared and evaluated with state-of-the-art and is found to outperform them. It detects more attacks while maintaining the packet loss ratio in the range of 15-25%. The average energy consumption of the nodes also remains in the ratio of 60-80 mj. There is approximately 40% more energy conservation at node level with an overall 50% increase in network lifetime. THC-RPL has 10% less message exchange and 0% storage costs."
https://openalex.org/W4288439515,"Animal–Visitor Interactions (AVI) are activities offered by zoos and other tourism facilities, in which visitors come into close contact with animals. These activities can promote conservational and educational content, raise conservation mindedness and responsibility for the environment and animal welfare, but if not properly managed can jeopardize visitors’ and animals’ well-being and conservation efforts. The Animal-Visitor Interaction assessment Protocol (AVIP) has been designed to perform an integrated and multidisciplinary assessment of these activities, encompassing the “One Health, One Welfare” approach. AVIP throughout six different steps allows to assess the effects of AVIs both on animals, visitors, and the staff involved. Results can assist zoos to improve management decisions, ensure a transparent evaluation of their activities and promote conservation education goals. Lemurs walk-in enclosures have become increasingly popular among zoos, nevertheless studies focused on their assessment are still scarce. To validate AVIP to this particular AVI, we applied it to assess a walk-in enclosure hosting five Lemur catta in an Italian zoo. Results of behavioural and physiological analyses suggested no changes in animal welfare level and the Animal Welfare Risk Assessment showed low animal welfare risks. Two Visitor Experience Surveys were used to interview 291 visitors, showing that the assessed AVI could help promote the zoo’s conservation objectives and visitor education. Risk Assessment found low and medium risks to the health and safety of visitors. Results were then combined to perform a final ethical assessment. Some potential ethical concerns were detected, but the outcomes indicated that these conflicts were well managed. In the context of recent findings AVIP demonstrated its potential for application also in assessing AVIs involving primates. Our findings confirmed the usefulness of AVIP in assessing and monitoring AVIs, allowing to gain key information in a single process on multiple welfare-related parameters, educational impact, safety of the main stakeholders involved, and ethical concerns."
https://openalex.org/W4288442043,"In numerous classification problems, class distribution is not balanced. For example, positive examples are rare in the fields of disease diagnosis and credit card fraud detection. General machine learning methods are known to be suboptimal for such imbalanced classification. One popular solution is to balance training data by oversampling the underrepresented (or undersampling the overrepresented) classes before applying machine learning algorithms. However, despite its popularity, the effectiveness of sampling has not been rigorously and comprehensively evaluated. This study assessed combinations of seven sampling methods and eight machine learning classifiers (56 varieties in total) using 31 datasets with varying degrees of imbalance. We used the areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) as the performance measures. The AUPRC is known to be more informative for imbalanced classification than the AUROC. We observed that sampling significantly changed the performance of the classifier (paired t-tests P < 0.05) only for few cases (12.2% in AUPRC and 10.0% in AUROC). Surprisingly, sampling was more likely to reduce rather than improve the classification performance. Moreover, the adverse effects of sampling were more pronounced in AUPRC than in AUROC. Among the sampling methods, undersampling performed worse than others. Also, sampling was more effective for improving linear classifiers. Most importantly, we did not need sampling to obtain the optimal classifier for most of the 31 datasets. In addition, we found two interesting examples in which sampling significantly reduced AUPRC while significantly improving AUROC (paired t-tests P < 0.05). In conclusion, the applicability of sampling is limited because it could be ineffective or even harmful. Furthermore, the choice of the performance measure is crucial for decision making. Our results provide valuable insights into the effect and characteristics of sampling for imbalanced classification."
https://openalex.org/W4288430355,"Objective The objectives of the study is to investigate the global socioeconomic risk factors associated with diabetes prevalence using evidence from available country-level data. Design A cross-sectional study based on (2010 &amp; 2019) countrywide Health Nutrition and Population Statistics data. Population People ages 20–79 who have diabetes. Setting One hundred and thirty-two countries or territories in the world. Primary outcome measure Diabetes prevalence rates were determined from (2010 &amp; 2019) countrywide Health Nutrition and Population Statistics (Health Stats, World Bank Group). Results In 2010, a 1% increase in per capita income and total tobacco consumption is associated with a 0.92% (95% CI 0.64% to 1.19%) and 0.02% (95% CI 0.006% to 0.047%) increase in diabetes prevalence respectively; and a 1% increase in alcohol consumption is associated with a -0.85% (95% CI -1.17% to -0.53%) decrease in diabetes prevalence. Statistically significant socioeconomic and lifestyle indices positively associated with diabetes prevalence included gross national income; overweight prevalence (BMI&gt;25 kg/m 2 ); and tobacco consumption. Statistically significant inverse associations with global diabetes prevalence included total population size; unemployment and alcohol consumption. The 2019 data was removed due to sparsity of data. Conclusion Statistically significant global lifestyle and socioeconomic determinants of diabetes prevalence include alcohol consumption; tobacco consumption; overweight prevalence; per capita income; total population and unemployment rates. Determinants of diabetes include modifiable risk factors which are consistent at both the micro and macro level and include tobacco consumption and overweight prevalence. Factors which are non-modifiable and warrant further investigation include total population and unemployment rates, which were inversely associated with diabetes prevalence and are a product of other underlying factors. Other determinants such as alcohol consumption was also inversely associated with diabetes prevalence, but has been observed to have both negative and positive associations with diabetes at the micro-level. These associations were dependent upon the amount of alcohol consumed. Global cut-off point of alcohol consumption is critical to establish global policies to reduce diabetes prevalence. Overall, the use of cross-sectional based study for country level aggregate data is a critical tool that should be considered when making global joint strategies or policies against diabetes in both data analysis and decision making."
https://openalex.org/W4288430726,"Intensive cropping systems with diverse cropping patterns present a challenge for nutrient management on smallholder farms. Government-endorsed recommendations for crop fertilizer use are designed to assist farmers achieve profitable and balanced nutrient inputs, but it is unclear how closely farmers follow these recommendations. We identified farmers' current nutrient use gaps (overuse or underuse) relative to the Government-endorsed recommended nutrient doses in two cropping patterns in three representative Agro-ecological Zones of Bangladesh. A total of 330 farms were surveyed in 2019 from three farm size categories (referred to as large-, medium and small-scale) and their gaps in nutrient use were assessed relative to Government-endorsed Fertilizer Recommendation Guides (FRG) published in 2012 and in 2018: FRG-2012 and FRG-2018. The large- and medium-scale farms used 11-16%, 80-90% and 21-30%, respectively, over-doses of NPK in the cropping season under fully rice-based cropping pattern relative to FRG-2012 recommendations, while the over-dose levels were much lower for small-scale farms. Small-scale farms used much less than recommended S, Mg, Zn, B and organic manure (OM) rates relative to FRG-2012. The FRG-2018, which increased N and K recommendations but decreased the P recommendation for rice crops relative to FRG-2012, shows that all farms can decrease the dose of P (by 50%) while small-scale farms need to increase the dose of N (7%), K (16%), S (20%) and to apply Zn in the fully rice-based cropping pattern. On the other hand, the farms could greatly reduce NPK (19%, 86% and 44%, respectively) use while increasing S (14%), Mg, Zn, B and OM use relative to FRG-2018 in the pattern with the high-value potato crop. To increase crop profitability, enhance food security and save Government treasury in the Eastern Gangetic Plain enabling approaches are needed to effectively communicate the benefits of balanced nutrient use practices to farmers."
https://openalex.org/W4288434002,"The accurate identification of genetic variants contributing to therapeutic drug response or adverse effects is the first step in implementation of precision drug therapy. Targeted sequencing has recently become a common methodology for large-scale studies of genetic variation thanks to its favorable balance between low cost, high throughput, and deep coverage. Here, we present ClinPharmSeq, a targeted sequencing panel of 59 genes with associations to pharmacogenetic (PGx) phenotypes, as a platform to explore the relationship between drug response and genetic variation, both common and rare. For validation, we sequenced DNA from 64 ethnically diverse Coriell samples with ClinPharmSeq to call star alleles (haplotype patterns) in 27 genes using the bioinformatics tool PyPGx. These reference samples were extensively characterized by multiple laboratories using PGx testing assays and, more recently, whole genome sequencing. We found that ClinPharmSeq can consistently generate deep-coverage data (mean = 274x) with high uniformity (30x or above = 94.8%). Our genotype analysis identified a total of 185 unique star alleles from sequencing data, and showed that diplotype calls from ClinPharmSeq are highly concordant with that from previous publications (97.6%) and whole genome sequencing (97.9%). Notably, all 19 star alleles with complex structural variation including gene deletions, duplications, and hybrids were recalled with 100% accuracy. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the ClinPharmSeq platform offers a feasible path for broad implementation of PGx testing and optimization of individual drug treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4288437874,"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused considerable psychological and physical effects in healthy and diseased New Yorkers aside from the effects in those who were infected. We investigated the relationship between known risk-enhancing and health-promoting factors (social and medical), comorbidity indicators, and, as the primary outcome, health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Between April 22 and May 5, 2020, a market research agency (Dynata) administered a digital survey including the EQ-5D-5L and items related to individual characteristics, social position, occupational and insurance status, living situation, exposures (smoking and COVID-19), detailed chronic conditions, and experienced access to care to an existing internet panel representative of New Yorkers.2684 persons completed the questionnaire. The median age was 48 years old, and most respondents were non-Hispanic white (74%) and reported at least higher vocational training or a university education (83%). During COVID-19, mean HRQoL scores were 0.82 for the EQ-5D-5L index and 79.3 for the EQ VAS. Scores varied for healthy and diseased respondents differently by the above determinants. Lower age, impaired occupational status, loss of health insurance, and limited access to care exerted more influence on EQ-5D-5L scores of diseased persons compared to healthy persons. Among diseased persons, the number of chronic conditions and limited access to health care had the strongest association with EQ-5D-5L scores. While EQ-5D-5L scores improved with increasing age, gender had no noticeable effect. Deprivation factors showed moderate effects, which largely disappeared in (stratified) multivariable analysis, suggesting mediation through excess chronic morbidity and poor healthcare access. Generally, modifying effects were larger in the EQ-5D-5L as compared to the EQ VAS.Almost all factors relating to a disadvantaged position showed a negative association with HRQoL. In diseased respondents, pre-existing chronic comorbidity and experienced access to health care are key factors."
https://openalex.org/W4288440887,"The present study examined whether disagreement between self-, other-, and meta-perceptions of personality was related to burnout symptoms and eudaimonic workplace well-being. We expected disagreement in personality perceptions to explain incremental variance in burnout symptoms and eudaimonic workplace well-being beyond the main effects of the different personality ratings. Participants were 459 Dutch employees and their 906 colleagues (who provided other ratings of personality). The results, based on polynomial regression with response surface analyses, highlighted strong main effects of self-rated personality traits in relation to burnout symptoms and eudaimonic workplace well-being. This study provides, as far as we know, the first empirical evidence that self-rated Honesty-Humility negatively predicts burnout symptoms. Results showed little evidence on incremental effects of disagreement between personality perceptions, with one clear exception: when respondents misjudged how their colleagues would rate them on Honesty-Humility (i.e., discrepancy between meta- and other-perceptions), respondents experienced more feelings of burnout and less eudaimonic workplace well-being. Our study contributes to the literature by providing evidence that discrepancies between meta- and other-perceptions of Honesty-Humility affect employee well-being (i.e., burnout symptoms and eudaimonic workplace well-being)."
https://openalex.org/W4288425386,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of cardiac death and heart transplantation. It has been known that black people have a higher incidence of heart failure and related diseases compared to white people. To identify the relationship between gene expression and cardiac function in DCM patients, we performed pathway analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) using RNA-sequencing data (GSE141910) from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and identified several gene modules that were significantly associated with the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) and DCM phenotype. Genes included in these modules are enriched in three major categories of signaling pathways: fibrosis-related, small molecule transporting-related, and immune response-related. Through consensus analysis, we found that gene modules associated with LVEF in African Americans are almost identical as in Caucasians, suggesting that the two groups may have more common rather than disparate genetic regulations in the etiology of DCM. In addition to the identified modules, we found that the gene expression level of Na/K-ATPase, an important membrane ion transporter, has a strong correlation with the LVEF. These clinical results are consistent with our previous findings and suggest the clinical significance of Na/K-ATPase regulation in DCM."
https://openalex.org/W4288426664,"Arecoline is known to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our previous studies showed that arecoline inhibited myogenic differentiation and acetylcholine receptor cluster formation of C2C12 myoblasts. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is a known ROS scavenger. We hypothesize that NAC scavenges the excess ROS caused by arecoline. In this article we examined the effect of NAC on the inhibited myoblast differentiation by arecoline and related mechanisms. We found that NAC less than 2 mM is non-cytotoxic to C2C12 by viability analysis. We further demonstrated that NAC attenuated the decreased number of myotubes and nuclei in each myotube compared to arecoline treatment by H &amp; E staining. We also showed that NAC prevented the decreased expression level of the myogenic markers, myogenin and MYH caused by arecoline, using immunocytochemistry and western blotting. Finally, we found that NAC restored the decreased expression level of p-ERK1/2 by arecoline. In conclusion, our results indicate that NAC attenuates the damage of the arecoline-inhibited C2C12 myoblast differentiation by the activation/phosphorylation of ERK. This is the first report to demonstrate that NAC has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle myogenesis through ERK1/2 upon arecoline treatment. Since defects of skeletal muscle associates with several diseases, NAC can be a potent drug candidate in diseases related to defects in skeletal muscle myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4288429413,"Current medical guidelines consider pregnant women with COVID-19 to be a high-risk group. Since physiological gestation downregulates the immunological response to maintain “maternal-fetal tolerance”, SARS-CoV-2 infection may constitute a potentially threatening condition to both the mother and the fetus. To establish the immune profile in pregnant COVID-19+ patients, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Pregnant women with COVID-19 (P-COVID-19+; n = 15) were analyzed and compared with nonpregnant women with COVID-19 (NP-COVID-19+; n = 15) or those with physiological pregnancy (P-COVID-19-; n = 13). Serological cytokine and chemokine concentrations, leucocyte immunophenotypes, and mononuclear leucocyte responses to polyclonal stimuli were analyzed in all groups. Higher concentrations of serological TNF-α, IL-6, MIP1b and IL-4 were observed within the P-COVID-19+ group, while cytokines and chemokines secreted by peripheral leucocytes in response to LPS, IL-6 or PMA-ionomicin were similar among the groups. Immunophenotype analysis showed a lower percentage of HLA-DR+ monocytes in P-COVID-19+ than in P-COVID-19- and a higher percentage of CD39+ monocytes in P-COVID-19+ than in NP-COVID-19+. After whole blood polyclonal stimulation, similar percentages of T cells and TNF+ monocytes between groups were observed. Our results suggest that P-COVID-19+ elicits a strong inflammatory response similar to NP-COVID19+ but also displays an anti-inflammatory response that controls the ATP/adenosine balance and prevents hyperinflammatory damage in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4288433999,"Automatic operations of multi-functional and time-lapse live-cell imaging are necessary for the biomedical science community to study active, multi-faceted, and long-term biological phenomena. To achieve automatic control, most existing solutions often require the purchase of extra software programs and hardware that rely on the manufacturers’ own specifications. However, these software programs are usually non-user-programmable and unaffordable for many laboratories. To address this unmet need, we have developed a novel open-source software program, titled Automatic Multi-functional Integration Program (AMFIP), as a new Java-based and hardware-independent system that provides proven advantages over existing alternatives to the scientific community. Without extra hardware, AMFIP enables the functional synchronization of the μManager software platform, the Nikon NIS-Elements platform, and other 3rd party software to achieve automatic operations of most commercially available microscopy systems, including but not limited to those from Nikon. AMFIP provides a user-friendly and programmable graphical user interface (GUI), opening the door to expanding the customizability for myriad hardware and software systems according to user-specific experimental requirements and environments. To validate the intended purposes of developing AMFIP, we applied it to elucidate the question whether single cells, prior to their full spreading, can sense and respond to a soft solid substrate, and if so, how does the interaction depend on the cell spreading time and the stiffness of the substrate. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human epithelial Beas2B (B2B) cell line that expresses mNeonGreen2-tagged mechanosensitive Yes-associated protein (YAP), we show that single B2B cells develop distinct substrate-stiffness-dependent YAP expressions within 10 hours at most on the substrate, suggesting that cells are able to sense, distinguish, and respond to mechanical cues prior to the establishment of full cell spreading. In summary, AMFIP provides a reliable, open-source, and cost-free solution that has the validated long-term utility to satisfy the need of automatic imaging operations in the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W4288438940,"Endometriosis is a hormone-associated disease which has been considered as the precursor for certain types of ovarian cancer. In recent years, emerging evidence demonstrated potent roles of lncRNA in regulating cancer development. Since endometriosis shares several features with cancer, we investigated the possible involvement of cancer-related lncRNAs in endometriosis, including UCA1, GAS5 and PTENP1. By using massARRAY system, we investigated certain genetic variations in cancer-related lncRNAs that can change the thermo-stability, leading to up-regulation or down-regulation of those lncRNAs. Our data indicated three risk genetic haplotypes in UCA1 which can stabilize the RNA structure and increase the susceptibility of endometriosis. Of note, such alterations were found to be associated with long-term pain and infertility in patients. It has been known that UCA1 can function as a ceRNA to sponge and inhibit miRNAs, resulting in loss-of-control on downstream target genes. Gene network analyses revealed fatty acid metabolism and mitochondria beta-oxidation as the major pathways associated with altered UCA1 expression in endometriosis patients. Our study thus provides evidence to highlight functional/epigenetic roles of UCA1 in endometriosis development via regulating fatty acid metabolism in women."
https://openalex.org/W4288438951,"Polyhedrons, spheroids and bolas (PSBs) are present in lithic series from the Lower Palaeolithic onwards and are found in several regions of the world. Nevertheless, very little is known about them. We propose here to summarise, illustrate and discuss the current state of our knowledge about these artefacts. Based on the available data in the literature and on our observations of several collections, we set up a database comprising 169 Palaeolithic assemblages with PSBs. Thanks to the statistical analysis of these data, we aim to highlight potential relationships between PSB characteristics (e.g., quantity, raw material) and assemblage composition and context, according to regions and chrono-cultural attributions. We also aim to discuss the question of artefacts from possible independent local histories, especially in Northwest Europe, where these objects are scarce. Our study concludes that hard stones (stones with high resistance to a physical constraint) available locally were generally selected to produce PSBs. Soft sedimentary rocks are suitable for their manufacture, and were selected too, whereas siliceous materials were left aside. We hypothesise that the scarcity of PSBs in Northwest Europe could result from a combination of cultural and environmental factors: it could be part of a regional tradition, influenced by the abundance of siliceous materials in the environment. In this region where the lithic production is widely made of flint, even though other materials were available, objects made from hard stones are scarce, resulting in a toolkit with only rare PSBs and cleavers. Was flint too brittle for the functions of PSBs? Raw materials of PSBs are often similar to those of heavy-duty tools in assemblages, which could provide other clues about their functions (e.g., tasks requiring a resistance to shocks). It is possible that their raw materials partly conditioned their final shape. PSBs can comprise a wide variety of artefacts, that for some could have change of status (e.g., from cores to percussive tools), diffused, adapted but also reinvented over two million years."
https://openalex.org/W4288445079,"This paper is concerned with the unsolved issue of how to accurately predict the financial market volatility. We propose a novel volatility prediction method for stock index futures prediction based on LSTM, PCA, stock indices and relevant futures. Inspired by the recent advancement of deep learning methodology, six models that combine a variety of artificial intelligence techniques are compared, including ANN, ANN(PCA), ANN(AE), LSTM, LSTM(PCA), and LSTM(AE). That is, in the design and comparison of the proposed AI models, we consider the combination of two dimensionality reduction methods (PCA and AE) and two typical neural networks (ANN and LSTM) in processing time series data. Besides, to further assess the prediction performance of the proposed models, two widely-applied statistical models (i.e. AR and EGARCH) on volatility prediction are used as benchmarks. In the empirical study, we collect financial trading data in both China and the US, and compare the performances of different models in predicting 5 days and 10 days ahead volatilities of stock index futures. In all, our analysis supports the use of LSTM(PCA) model to tackle those irregular and complex datasets."

https://openalex.org/W4288429855,"Most U.S. public health agencies rely upon closed points of dispensing (PODs) to aid in medical countermeasure (MCM) distribution. However, few studies have focused on how to assess closed POD preparedness and none have examined best practices for managing sites once they have been recruited. This study involved qualitative interviews with U.S. disaster planners to elucidate their approaches and challenges to managing, sustaining, and assessing existing closed POD sites. In all, 16 disaster planners participated. Common management practices included frequent communication with sites, providing formal and informal training, and assisting with POD exercises. Very few jurisdictions reported doing formal assessments of closed POD sites. The largest challenges identified were staff turnover and keeping sites engaged, sometimes leading to sites voluntarily withdrawing or needing to be removed from being a closed POD. Frequent communication and building partnerships with closed POD site personnel were recommended to maintain and sustain existing sites. Formal and informal assessments will provide assurance of deployment readiness. Closed POD management is a challenging, but essential process to ensure readiness to deploy. Practices outlined by this study can be implemented to enhance closed POD network management at other jurisdictions. This should increase the ability to distribute MCMs rapidly during a future event, contributing to stronger community resilience. Public health officials should continue expanding and improving closed POD networks to enable MCM delivery and minimize morbidity and mortality related to mass casualty events."
https://openalex.org/W4288434567,"As a medium and low pressure gear machine without automatic compensation structure for axial and radial clearances, the friction pairs in the straight conjugate internal gear pumps (SCIGPs) depend on the fixed small clearances to seal, lubricate and transfer the force. The oil film design of the friction pairs has become an important part of gear pump design. However, there has never been a publicly published research on the oil film design of the SCIGP in past literature. This paper applies orthogonal test to the oil film design of the SCIGP for the first time to determine the best working clearances. With this goal, the paper first provides the mathematical models for analyzing the internal leakage flow and the viscous friction loss, which elucidate the relationships between the leakage and the friction loss with working conditions. After that, the orthogonal test scheme for numerical simulation was designed on the basis of determining the range of oil film thickness. The paper also propounds the viewpoints of using the range-method to estimate the primary and secondary relationship of factors and determining the optimal combination according to the test target. Based on this concept, the main factors affecting the target are procured and the optimal working clearances of the friction pairs are determined. For the purpose of verifying the model, the redesigned prototype was tested and compared with the simulation results. The results validate the applicability of the simulation model and the correctness of the simulation method. Finally, the paper summarizes the ways to improve the total efficiency and the working conditions at the highest efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4288434575,"Targeting the tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase XII (CA XII) is considered a promising strategy to improve cancer treatment. As such progress is highly demanded for ovarian carcinomas, the present study aimed to provide deeper information about their CA XII expression profile. A large collection of tissue specimens was stained immunohistochemically with a specific anti-CA XII antibody to evaluate the expression in neoplastic and non-neoplastic epithelial ovarian cells. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure CA XII expression on tumor cells from malignant ascites fluid. Binding of the antibody revealed a significant CA XII expression in most ovarian carcinoma tissue samples and ascites-derived ovarian carcinoma cells. Moreover, CA XII was expressed at higher levels in ovarian carcinomas as compared to borderline ovarian tumors and non-neoplastic ovarian epithelia. Within the carcinoma tissues, high expression of CA XII was associated with higher tumor grading and a trend towards shorter overall survival. Our results indicate that CA XII plays a crucial role for the malignancy of ovarian carcinoma cells and emphasize the potential of CA XII as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in the management of ovarian carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W4288438147,"Despite their importance to fall prevention research, little is known about the details of real-world fall events experienced by lower limb prosthesis users. This gap can be attributed to the lack of a structured, population-specific fall survey to document these adverse health events. The objective of this project was to develop a survey capable of characterizing the circumstances and consequences of fall events in lower limb prosthesis users. Best practices in survey development, including focus groups and cognitive interviews with diverse samples of lower limb prosthesis users, were used to solicit input and feedback from target respondents, so survey content would be meaningful, clear, and applicable to lower limb prosthesis users. Focus group data were used to develop fall event definitions and construct a conceptual fall framework that guided the creation of potential survey questions and response options. Survey questions focused on the activity, surroundings, situation, mechanics, and consequences of fall events. Cognitive interviews revealed that with minor revisions, survey definitions, questions, and response options were clear, comprehensive, and applicable to the experiences of lower limb prosthesis users. Administration of the fall survey to a national sample of 235 lower limb prosthesis users in a cross-sectional preliminary validation study, found survey questions to function as intended. Revisions to the survey were made at each stage of development based on analysis of participant feedback and data. The structured, 37-question lower limb prosthesis user fall event survey developed in this study offers clinicians and researchers the means to document, monitor, and compare fall details that are meaningful and relevant to lower limb prosthesis users in a standardized and consistent manner. Data that can be collected with the developed survey are essential to establishing specific goals for fall prevention initiatives in lower limb prosthesis users."

Coastal plant systems are expected to experience increased rates of nitrogen and phosphorus deposition by 2100, caused mostly by anthropogenic activity. Despite high density of studies investigating connections between plant community structure and ecosystem function in response to nutrient addition, inconsistencies in system response based on the ecosystem in question calls for more detailed analyses of nutrient impacts on community organization and resulting productivity response. Here, we focus on nutrient addition impacts on community structure and organization as well as productivity of different lifeforms in a coastal grassland. We established long-term nutrient enrichment plots in 2015 consisting of control (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen + phosphorus (NP) treatments. In 2017 we collected graminoid and forb productivity, root productivity, and community composition for each plot. We found no N x P interaction, but N enrichment was a significant main effect on productivity, highlighting N limitation in coastal systems. Importantly, nutrient enrichment treatments did not alter root productivity. However, all treatments caused significant differences in community composition. Using rank abundance curves, we determined that community composition differences were driven by increased dominance of nitrophilous graminoids, re-organization of subordinate species, and species absences in N and NP plots. Results of this study highlight how coastal grassland communities are impacted by nutrient enrichment. We show that community re-organization, increased dominance, and absence of critical species are all important mechanisms that reflect community-level impacts of nutrient enrichment in our coastal grassland site."
https://openalex.org/W4288439347,"Gulf War Illness (GWI) affects 25–35% of the 1991 Gulf War Veteran (GWV) population. Patients with GWI experience pain, fatigue, cognitive impairments, gastrointestinal dysfunction, skin disorders, and respiratory issues. In longitudinal studies, many patients with GWI have shown little to no improvement in symptoms since diagnosis. The gut microbiome and diet play an important role in human health and disease, and preliminary studies suggest it may play a role in GWI. To examine the relationship between the gut microbiota, diet, and GWI, we conducted an eight-week prospective cohort study collecting stool samples, medications, health history, and dietary data. Sixty-nine participants were enrolled into the study, 36 of which met the case definition for GWI. The gut microbiota of participants, determined by 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples, was stable over the duration of the study and showed no within person (alpha diversity) differences. Between group analyses (beta diversity) identified statistically significant different between those with and without GWI. Several taxonomic lineages were identified as differentially abundant between those with and without GWI (n = 9) including a greater abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae in those without GWI. Additionally, there were taxonomic differences between those with high and low healthy eating index (HEI) scores including a greater abundance of Ruminococcaceae in those with higher HEI scores. This longitudinal cohort study of GWVs found that participants with GWI had significantly different microbiomes from those without GWI. Further studies are needed to determine the role these differences may play in the development and treatment of GWI."

Extensive modifications took place; removal, addition, modification of themes and modification of clinical to lay terminology. The result was a thematically comprehensive advance directive to be used as a communication tool across the six European countries within the ACTION trial.This article shows the complex task of developing an advance directive suitable for cancer patients from six European countries; a process which required the resolution of several cross cultural differences in law, ethics, philosophy and practice. Our hope is that this paper can contribute to a deeper conceptual understanding of advance directives, their role in supporting decision making among patients approaching the end of life and be an inspiration to others wishing to develop a disease-specific advance directive or a standardised multinational advance directive."
https://openalex.org/W4288444177,"Late-onset non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing loss 9 (DFNA9) is a hearing impairment caused by mutations in the coagulation factor C homology gene ( COCH ). COCH encodes for cochlin, a major component of the cochlear extracellular matrix. Though biochemical and genetic studies have characterized the properties of wild-type and mutated cochlins derived from DFNA9, little is known about the underlying pathogenic mechanism. In this study, we established a cochlin reporter cell, which allowed us to monitor the interaction of cochlin with its ligand(s) by means of a β-galactosidase assay. We found a class of highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), heparin, that were selectively bound to cochlin. The interaction was distinctly abrogated by N -desulfation, but not by 2- O - or 6- O -desulfation. The binding of cochlin to GAG was diminished by all of the point mutations found in DFNA9 patients. Through GAG composition analysis and immunostaining using mouse cochlin/immunoglobulin-Fc fusion protein, we identified moderately sulfated GAGs in mouse cochlea tissue; this implies that cochlin binds to such sulfated GAGs in the cochlea. Since GAGs play an important role in cell growth and survival as co-receptors of signal transduction mechanisms, the interaction of cochlin with GAGs in the extracellular matrix could aid the pathological research of autosomal dominant late-onset hearing loss in DFNA9."
https://openalex.org/W4288426065,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation can lead to higher rates of mRNA decay, suggesting the ribosome plays a role in mRNA destruction. Furthermore, mRNA features, such as codon identities, which are directly probed by the ribosome, correlate with mRNA decay rates. Many amino acids are encoded by synonymous codons, some of which are decoded by more abundant tRNAs leading to more optimal translation and increased mRNA stability. Variable translation rates for synonymous codons can lead to ribosomal collisions as ribosomes transit regions with suboptimal codons, and ribosomal collisions can promote mRNA decay. In addition to different translation rates, the presence of certain codons can also lead to higher or lower rates of amino acid misincorporation which could potentially lead to protein misfolding if a substituted amino acid fails to make critical contacts in a structure. Here, we test whether Geneticin—G418, an aminoglycoside antibiotic known to promote amino acid misincorporation—affects mRNA stability. We observe that G418 decreases firefly luciferase mRNA stability in an in vitro translation system and also reduces mRNA stability in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). G418-sensitive mRNAs are enriched for certain optimal codons that contain G or C in the wobble position, arguing that G418 blunts the stabilizing effects of codon optimality."
https://openalex.org/W4288427177,"Background Coagulation abnormality is a significant complication and cause of mortality in children with uncorrected congenital heart defects (CHD). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of coagulation abnormalities and the associated factors in children with uncorrected CHD. Method A cross sectional study conducted to determine the prevalence of coagulation abnormalities among 70 children with uncorrected CHD aged six months to 17 years and 70 age and sex matched apparently healthy controls. Coagulation abnormalities was determined using complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and D-dimer assay. Results The prevalence of coagulation abnormalities among children with CHD and controls was 37.1% and 7.1% respectively. Children with Cyanotic CHD had a significantly higher prevalence of coagulation abnormalities compared to children with Acyanotic CHD (57.1% versus 17.1%). Haematocrit and oxygen saturation levels were significantly associated with coagulation abnormalities. Conclusion This study affirms that coagulation abnormalities are frequent in children with uncorrected CHD. Oxygen saturation and haematocrit are risk factors of coagulation abnormalities. Routine coagulation screen is recommended especially in children with cyanotic congenital heart defects to improve their quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality while awaiting definitive surgeries."
https://openalex.org/W4288427542,"Objective The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on mental health outcomes in adult patients with Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Introduction Mental health issues are highly prevalent among patients with CVDs leading to poor disease prognosis, self-care/ management, and Quality of Life (QOL). In the context of LMICs, where the disease burden and treatment gap are high and resources are inadequate for accessing essential care, effective psychosocial interventions can make significant contributions for improving mental health and reducing mental health problems among patients who live with cardiovascular diseases. Inclusion criteria This review will include studies published between 2010 and 2021 that evaluated the effect of psychosocial interventions on mental health outcomes (resilience, self-efficacy, QOL, depression and anxiety) on adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with any cardiovascular diseases using experimental and quasi experimental designs. Methods The search will be conducted from the following databases: MEDLINE via OVID (1946—Present), EMBASE via OVID (1974 –Present), Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost (1936—Present), PsycINFO via OVID (1806—Present), Scopus via Elsevier (1976—Present), and Cochrane Library via Wiley (1992—Present). Data will be critically appraised using standard tools and extracted by two reviewers and disagreement will be solved by the third reviewer. Meta-analysis will be performed, if possible, otherwise, data will be synthesized in narrative and tabular forms. Discussion The findings of this review will provide a key insight into contextually relevant psychosocial interventions for promoting mental health of patients with CVDs living in LMICs. The review findings will be potentially useful for health care providers and researchers to implement such interventions not only for reducing the burden of mental health issues but also for improving the overall well-being among patients with chronic illnesses.

https://openalex.org/W4288428143,"Currently, national governments of onchocerciasis endemic African countries are working towards the elimination of the disease using mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin as a primary strategy. Attainment of this goal requires implementation of prolonged high MDA coverage in all endemic areas, and vigilant monitoring and evaluation of the program. This study was thus conducted with the purpose of i) providing estimate of ivermectin coverage, ii) validating the MDA coverage reported through community drug distributors (CDDs), iii) determining the factors associated with MDA coverage, and iv) estimating the difference between MDA program reach and survey coverage rates following MDA campaign carried out in May 2017 in Asosa and Yeki districts in Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,824 study participants in Asosa and Yeki districts. A total of 50 kebeles (smallest administrative units) were randomly selected from the two districts. A systematic sampling was employed to select study households from the 50 kebeles . Then, a household member was randomly selected for the interview. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the odds ratio and to observe the associations between the MDA survey coverage and the variables used. Eighty-seven percent (2458/2824) of the respondents from both districts responded that they were offered ivermectin during the May 2017 MDA campaign. At the district level, 1182 individuals from Yeki and 1276 from Asosa, received the drug, that indicate 88.5% and 85.8% MDA program reach in Yeki and Assosa districts, respectively. Whereas, a total of 366 individuals were not offered ivermectin in both study districts. Of these, 47(12.8%), 143(39.1%), and 176(48.1%) did not receive the drug because of program implementation-related reasons, ineligibility criteria, and personal issues, respectively. Of the 1488 and 1336 respondents in Asosa and Yeki, 1272 and 1182 participants took the drug, resulting in survey coverage rate of 85.5% (95% CI: 83.6–87.2%) and 88.5% (95% CI: 86.7–90.1%), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed significantly low survey coverage rate in females (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3–0.6; p&lt;0.001) and in those whose age ranges between 15–24 years (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3–0.8; p = 0.007) and 25–34 years (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3–0.9; p = 0.021) in Asosa. The researchers believe that the current study generated operational evidence on MDA program reach and coverage rates in two study districts in Ethiopia. The survey coverages were lower than the recommended 90% minimum threshold for success. Only Yeki district reached the 90% threshold survey coverage. Both districts had reported higher coverages than the survey estimates (even outside the 95% CI), thus, were not validated. The majority (60.9%) of the reasons for not receiving the drug were related to program implementation and recipients`personal issues. Efforts must therefore be directed to enhance MDA coverage in future rounds via proper MDA planning and implementation, such as allocating adequate time to the MDA activities, health education, and mobilizing of all segments of the population, including adolescents and the youth. The researchers also recommend such studies to be extended to other MDA programs for other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)."
https://openalex.org/W4288429197,"Background Testing for ‘recent HIV infection’ is common in surveillance, where only population-level estimates (of incidence) are reported. Typically, ‘recent infection’ is a category , obtained by applying a threshold on an underlying continuous biomarker from some laboratory assay(s). Interpreting the biomarker values obtained for individual subjects, as estimates of the date of infection, has obvious potential applications in the context of studies of early infection, and has also for some years attracted significant interest as an extra component of post-test counselling and treatment initiation. The applicable analyses have typically run aground on the complexity of the full biomarker growth model, which is in principle a non-linear mixed-effects model of unknown structure, the fitting of which seems infeasible from realistically obtainable data. Methods It is known that to estimate Mean Duration of Recent Infection (MDRI) at a given value of the recent/non-recent -infection discrimination threshold, one may compress the full biomarker growth model into a relation capturing the probability of a recent test result as a function of time t since infection, given a value of assay threshold h which defines the recent/non-recent discrimination. We demonstrate that the derivative (gradient), with respect to h. of the probability of recent infection, seen as a function of both t and h, is identical to the formal likelihood relevant to Bayesian inference of the time since seroconversion, for a subject yielding an assay result h, at or close to the date of their first positive HIV test. This observation bypasses the need for fitting a complex detailed biomarker growth model. Using publicly available data from the CEPHIA collaboration, we calibrated this likelihood function for the Sedia Lag assay, and performed Bayesian inference on hypothetical infection data. Results We demonstrate the generation of posteriors for infection date, for patients with various delays between their last negative and first positive HIV test, and a range of LAg assay results (ODn) hypothetically obtained on the date of the first positive result. Conclusion Depending on the last-negative / first-positive interval, there is a range of ODn values that yields posteriors significantly different from the uniform prior one would be left with based merely on interval censoring. Hence, a LAg ODn obtained on the date of, or soon after, diagnosis contains potentially significant information about infection dating. It seems worth analysing other assays with meaningful dynamic range, especially tests already routinely used in primary HIV diagnosis (for example chemiluminescent assays and reader/cartridge lateral flow tests which admit objective variable line intensity readings) which have a sufficient dynamic range that corresponds to a clinically meaningful range of times-since-infection that are worth distinguishing from each other."
https://openalex.org/W4288429581,"Nutritional care during the neonatal period is a cornerstone towards achieving optimal care. However, very limited data is available on optimizing parenteral and enteral nutrition that directly affects infant survival among Ethiopian neonates. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify determinants of time to full enteral feeding achievement among low-birth-weight neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in Hawassa city.A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Adare general hospital and Hawassa University's comprehensive specialized hospital from August 2018 to 2019. Charts of infants with a birth weight of 1000-2000g (n = 273) neonates who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) were reviewed. The sample size for each hospital was allocated proportionally and subjects were selected by using a simple random sampling technique. Data were entered using Epi. data version 3.1, and analysis was performed using SPSS version 20. Kaplan-Meier estimator and a Cox proportional hazard model were used.The mean (SD) age when an enteral feed (trophic feeding) was first commenced was 2.13(1.373) days. The median time to achieve full enteral feeding was 8 days with IQR (7-10 days). Gestational age reduces the time to full enteral feeding by 18.8% for each additional week of gestation (AHR = 0.812, p-value = 0.003). The time to achieve full enteral feeding was shorter by 70.4% among neonates who were small for gestational age, as compared with that appropriate for gestational age (AHR = 0.296, p-value<0.001).According to this study, the time that the neonate takes to achieve full enteral feeding was relatively short. Gestational age and weight for gestational were the determinants for time to full enteral feeding achievement. Further research needs to be conducted to explore further, in addition to current findings."
https://openalex.org/W4288429872,"Many researchers try to understand a biological condition by identifying biomarkers. This is typically done using univariate hypothesis testing over a labeled dataset, declaring a feature to be a biomarker if there is a significant statistical difference between its values for the subjects with different outcomes. However, such sets of proposed biomarkers are often not reproducible - subsequent studies often fail to identify the same sets. Indeed, there is often only a very small overlap between the biomarkers proposed in pairs of related studies that explore the same phenotypes over the same distribution of subjects. This paper first defines the Reproducibility Score for a labeled dataset as a measure (taking values between 0 and 1) of the reproducibility of the results produced by a specified fixed biomarker discovery process for a given distribution of subjects. We then provide ways to reliably estimate this score by defining algorithms that produce an over-bound and an under-bound for this score for a given dataset and biomarker discovery process, for the case of univariate hypothesis testing on dichotomous groups. We confirm that these approximations are meaningful by providing empirical results on a large number of datasets and show that these predictions match known reproducibility results. To encourage others to apply this technique to analyze their biomarker sets, we have also created a publicly available website, https://biomarker.shinyapps.io/BiomarkerReprod/, that produces these Reproducibility Score approximations for any given dataset (with continuous or discrete features and binary class labels)."
https://openalex.org/W4288429884,"Monitoring programs are fundamental to understanding the state and trend of aquatic ecosystems. Sampling designs are a crucial component of monitoring programs and ensure that measurements evaluate progress toward clearly stated management objectives, which provides a mechanism for adaptive management. Here, we use a well-established marine monitoring program for inshore water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia to investigate whether a sampling re-design has increased the program's capacity to meet its primary objectives. Specifically, we use bootstrap resampling to assess the change in statistical power to detect temporal water quality trends in a 15-year inshore marine water quality data set that includes data from both before and after the sampling re-design. We perform a comprehensive power analysis for six water quality analytes at four separate study areas in the GBR Marine Park and find that the sampling re-design (i) increased power to detect trends in 23 of the 24 analyte-study area combinations, and (ii) resulted in an average increase in power of 34% to detect increasing or decreasing trends in water quality analytes. This increase in power is attributed more to the addition of sampling locations than increasing the sampling rate. Therefore, the sampling re-design has substantially increased the capacity of the program to detect temporal trends in inshore marine water quality. Further improvements in sampling design need to focus on the program's capability to reliably detect trends within realistic timeframes where inshore improvements to water quality can be expected to occur."
https://openalex.org/W4288430928,"Temporary goals modulate attention to threat. We examined whether attentional bias to angry faces differs depending on whether a temporary background goal is neutral, or threat related, whilst also measuring social anxiety. Participants performed a dot probe task combined with a separate task that induced a temporary goal. Depending on the phase in this goal task, the goal made angry faces or neutral stimuli (i.e., houses) relevant. The dot probe task measured attention to combinations of angry faces, neutral but goal-relevant stimuli (i.e., houses), and neutral control stimuli. Attention was allocated to angry faces when an angry goal was active. This was more pronounced for people scoring high on social phobia. The neutral goal attenuated attention to angry faces and effects of social phobia were no longer apparent. These findings suggest that individual differences in social anxiety interact with current and temporary goals to affect attentional processes."

Methods We undertook a retrospective cohort study of children &lt;5 years old from Northern Canada transferred by urgent air transport for ARI from 2005 through 2014 to 5 pediatric tertiary care centers in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa and Montreal. Admissions were identified via ARI-related ICD-9/10 coding and forward sortation area. Descriptive statistics and univariable analyses were performed. Results Among 650 urgent air transfers, the majority were from Nunavut (n = 349, 53.7%) or Nunavik (n = 166, 25.5%), &lt;6 months old (n = 372, 57.2%), and without underlying comorbidity (n = 458; 70.5%). Estimated annual tertiary care ARI admission rates in infants &lt;1 year old from Nunavut (40.7/1000) and Nunavik (44.5/1000) were tenfold higher than in children aged 1 to 4 years. Bronchiolitis (n = 333, 51.2%) and pneumonia (n = 208, 32.0%) were the most common primary discharge diagnoses. Nearly half required critical care (n = 316, 48.6%); mechanical ventilation rates ranged from 7.2% to 55.9% across centres. The most common primary pathogen was respiratory syncytial virus (n = 196, 30.1%). Influenza A or B was identified in 35 cases (5.4%) and vaccine-preventable bacterial infections in 27 (4.1%) cases. Interpretation Urgent air transfers for ARI from Northern Canada are associated with high acuity. Variations in levels of care were seen across referral centers, age groups and pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4288434023,"Background Overactive bladder (OAB) is a problem that increasingly affects adults and the elderly, especially women. It may affect quality of life, ability to participate and overall wellbeing. Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) is a form of neuromodulation involving the use of electrical impulses to address urinary symptoms. There are many randomized controlled trials that have shown that TTNS is effective at treating overactive bladder. In recent years, TTNS has gained increasing attention for this condition. But its effect in females remains controversial and evidence is lacking. Therefore, the main purpose of this study will be to systematically evaluate the effect of TTNS on females with OAB in Multiple sclerosis (MS) by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis, and also to provide a reference for the application of TTNS in OAB. Methods A systematic review of eligible articles will be conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search of the literature will be conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Weipu Electronics, and other databases. We will include randomized controlled trials about TTNS in females with OAB in MS. Two reviewers will screen titles, abstracts, and full texts independently. We will use a hierarchy of recommended assessment, development, and assessment methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence and report findings accordingly. Endnote X9 will be used to select the studies and Review Manager V.5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) will be used to conduct the meta-analysis. The mean difference or standard deviation with 95% confidence interval (CI) will be used in the computation of continuous variables to synthesize data. Results The results will provide evidence for judging whether TTNS is effective in females with OAB and MS.

The items are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (total scores from 7 to 35). The higher the score, the greater the fear.10145 patients, 52% of the Norwegian adult type 1 diabetes population, completed the questionnaire. The mean total fear score was 13.8 (SD 5.8). Women experienced more fear than men (OR 1.96), and fear increased significantly with increasing age for both genders (p<0.05). Fear increased with increasing BMI, more pronounced for men than women. Fear was positively correlated to HbA1c (Spearman rho 0.067, p<0.05), and significantly increased in patients with micro- and macrovascular complications, compared with patients without complications (p<0.05).

https://openalex.org/W4288435132,"Malnutrition is common, morbid, and often correctable, but subject to missed and delayed diagnosis. Better screening and prediction could improve clinical, functional, and economic outcomes. This study aimed to assess the predictability of malnutrition from longitudinal patient records, and the external generalizability of a predictive model. Predictive models were developed and validated on statewide emergency department (ED) and hospital admission databases for California, Florida and New York, including visits from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2018. Visit features included patient demographics, diagnosis codes, and procedure categories. Models included long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks trained on longitudinal trajectories, and gradient-boosted tree and logistic regression models trained on cross-sectional patient data. The dataset used for model training and internal validation (California and Florida) included 62,811 patient trajectories (266,951 visits). Test sets included 63,997 (California), 63,112 (Florida), and 62,472 (New York) trajectories, such that each cohort’s composition was proportional to the prevalence of malnutrition in that state. Trajectories contained seven patient characteristics and up to 2,008 diagnosis categories. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) and precision-recall curves (AUPRC) were used to characterize prediction of first malnutrition diagnoses in the test sets. Data analysis was performed from September 2020 to May 2021. Between 4.0% (New York) and 6.2% (California) of patients received malnutrition diagnoses. The longitudinal LSTM model produced the most accurate predictions of malnutrition, with comparable predictive performance in California (AUROC 0.854, AUPRC 0.258), Florida (AUROC 0.869, AUPRC 0.234), and New York (AUROC 0.869, AUPRC 0.190). Deep learning models can reliably predict malnutrition from existing longitudinal patient records, with better predictive performance and lower data-collection requirements than existing instruments. This approach may facilitate early nutritional intervention via automated screening at the point of care."
https://openalex.org/W4288436658,"Background Meningioma surgery has evolved over the last 20 years with increased use of minimally invasive approaches including the endoscopic endonasal route and endoscope-assisted and gravity-assisted transcranial approaches. As the “keyhole” concept remains controversial, we present detailed outcomes in a cohort series. Methods Retrospective analysis was done for all patients undergoing meningioma removal at a tertiary brain tumor referral center from 2008–2021. Keyhole approaches were defined as: use of a minimally invasive “retractorless” approach for a given meningioma in which a traditional larger approach is often used instead. The surgical goal was maximal safe removal including conservative (subtotal) removal for some invasive locations. Primary outcomes were resection rates, complications, length of stay and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). Secondary outcomes were endoscopy use, perioperative treatments, tumor control and acute MRI FLAIR/T2 changes to assess for brain manipulation and retraction injury. Results Of 329 patients, keyhole approaches were utilized in 193(59%) patients (mean age 59±13; 30 (15.5%) had prior surgery) who underwent 213 operations; 205(96%) were skull base location. Approaches included: endoscopic endonasal (n = 74,35%), supraorbital (n = 73,34%), retromastoid (n = 38,18%), mini-pterional (n = 20,9%), suboccipital (n = 4,2%), and contralateral transfalcine (n = 4,2%). Primary outcomes : Gross total/near total (&gt;90%) resection was achieved in 125(59%) (5% for petroclival, cavernous sinus/Meckel’s cave, spheno-cavernous locations vs 77% for all other locations). Major complications included: permanent neurological worsening 12(6%), CSF leak 2(1%) meningitis 2(1%). There were no DVTs, PEs, MIs or 30-day mortality. Median LOS decreased from 3 to 2 days in the last 2 years; 94% were discharged to home with favorable 90-day KPS in 176(96%) patients. Secondary outcomes : Increased FLAIR/T2 changes were noted on POD#1/2 MRI in 36/213(17%) cases, resolving in all but 11 (5.2%). Endoscopy was used in 87/139(63%) craniotomies, facilitating additional tumor removal in 55%. Tumor progression occurred in 26(13%) patients, mean follow-up 42±36 months. Conclusions &amp; relevance Our experience suggests minimally invasive keyhole transcranial and endoscopic endonasal meningioma removal is associated with comparable resection rates and low complication rates, short hospitalizations and high 90-day performance scores in comparison to prior reports using traditional skull base approaches. Subtotal removal may be appropriate for invasive/adherent meningiomas to avoid neurological deficits and other post-operative complications, although longer follow-up is needed. With careful patient selection and requisite experience, these approaches may be considered reasonable alternatives to traditional transcranial approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4288437346,"Rationale Studies identify prenatal household air pollution (HAP) exposure and maternal psychological distress (PMPD) as independent factors contributing to gestational ill-health and adverse birth outcomes. Objective We investigated the impact of PMPD on fetal biometric parameters (FBP) in HAP-exposed pregnant Nigerian women. Methods The randomized controlled trial (RCT; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02394574) investigated effects of HAP exposure in pregnant Nigerian women (n = 324), who customarily cooked with polluting fuels (firewood or kerosene). Half of the women (intervention group) were given CleanCook ethanol stoves to use for 156 days during the study. Once a month, all women were administered an abridged version of the SF-12v2 TM health-related quality of life questionnaire to assess psychological distress. Using mixed effects linear regression models, adjusted for relevant covariates, we analyzed associations between the women’s exposure to PM 2·5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter&lt;2 · 5 microns) from HAP, their PMPD scores, and FBP (ultrasound estimated fetal weight [UEFW], head circumference [HC], abdominal circumference [AC], femur length [FL], biparietal diameter [BPD], estimated gestational age [GA] and intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR]), and birth anthropometric measures (birth weight [BW] and birth length [BL]). Results PMPD negatively impacted UEFW, HC, FL, BPD and BL (p&lt;0 · 05). Controls (kerosene/firewood users) experienced significantly higher PMPD compared with ethanol-stove users (p&lt;0 · 05). The mediation analysis revealed that the proportion of the outcome (fetal biometrics, birth anthropometrics, IUGR and GA), which can be explained via PMPD by groups (intervention vs. control) after adjusting for confounding variables was 6 · 2% (0 · 062). No significant correlation was observed between levels of PM 2.5 exposure and PMPD scores. Conclusions PMPD was an independent mediator of adverse fetal biometric parameters in pregnant women, who were exposed to HAP from burning of firewood/kerosene. Formulating preventative measures to alleviate maternal distress during pregnancy and reducing exposure to HAP is important from public health perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W4288438967,"Background Emotion dysregulation has been shown to be a transdiagnostic characteristic of eating disorders. The Affect School aims to enhance emotional awareness and the ability to perceive and express emotions. This study was conducted as part of an RCT where patients with various eating disorders were randomised to participation in the Affect School as a supplement to treatment. Aim To explore Affect School participants’ and leaders’ experiences of the Affect school at an Eating Disorder outpatient unit in Sweden. Method Nine patients with eating disorder diagnoses and three Affect School leaders at an eating disorder outpatient clinic in Sweden were interviewed for their experiences of the intervention. The interviews were analysed with Thematic Analysis. Result Eight themes were revealed at the analysis, five from the participants: “Worries about group participation”, “Not alone anymore and gaining new insights about oneself”, “Shared stories can also be painful”, “Relationships outside the Affect School as a foundation for affective work”, and “A change is coming”, and three from the leaders:”Affect awareness is important in eating disorders”, “Group meetings create opportunities and challenges”, and “The Affect School setup needs more customisation”. Conclusion The results suggested that the Affect School provided an acceptance for experiencing all sorts of affects. Both leaders and participants considered working with affects necessary, although participants reported no changes in their life situation or condition after the intervention but considered the intervention as part of a process with gradual results. Being part of a group and sharing experiences was experienced as positive by participants and leaders, but the model could be further developed to better adapt to patients with an eating disorder."
https://openalex.org/W4288439416,"Several studies examined how some characteristics of personal bankruptcy laws influenced entrepreneurial developments during the last two decades. Our main objective is to analyze the association between self-employment and the leniency of the personal bankruptcy systems in 24 EU countries. Unlike previous studies, we measure differences and changes in the leniency of the regulations with a composite index that incorporates 35 variables. Based on a cross-country database of self-employment ratios and various control variables spanning the years 2000 to 2019, we apply a panel regression model. We find that the implementation of new regulations and reforms in personal bankruptcy legislation in more lenient directions positively correlates with entrepreneurial developments measured by self-employment rates. This is more significant in the group of countries where the eligibility criteria for entrepreneurs are not constrained. We find a one-year negative time-lag effect and conclude that strong anticipation of the law for a more lenient system can immediately change the risk-reward profile, and thereby influence entrepreneurship before implementing the actual reform. An important policy implication is that a major reform in regulation or the first implementation of conservative legislation has the same order of magnitude of effect on promoting entrepreneurship as other public policy reforms of similar purpose."
https://openalex.org/W4288439569,"Awareness of breeders of Warmblood Fragile Foal Syndrome (WFFS) increased after a widely discussed case in the USA in 2018. The hereditary connective tissue disorder, first described by a US research group in 2011 and for which a commercial genetic test exists since 2013, is caused by a point mutation in the PLOD1 gene, inherited autosomal recessively. Extension of molecular genetic testing and reporting of test results of organized horse breeders to their studbooks implies new opportunities for analyses. In Germany, data are centrally accessible through the integrated equine data base allowing comprehensive and population-wide investigation of the role of WFFS. The objective of this study was statistical testing for associations between WFFS and reproductive performance of German riding horses and quantifying possible differences between WFFS carriers and non-carriers, also in respect of performance traits. For this purpose, covering data from 2008 to 2020 were provided by ten German studbooks, so almost 400,000 coverings and resulting foaling rates were available for multiple analyses of variance with general and mixed linear models using procedures GLM, MIXED and HPMIXED of SAS software (version 9.2). Published breeding values of stallions were used for respective comparisons of riding horse performance. Assuming a WFFS carrier frequency of 9.5–15.0% in Warmblood horses, Hardy Weinberg principle implied an expected difference of 2.4–3.7% in the foaling rates of carrier and non-carrier stallions. Our results provided statistical evidence of detrimental effects of WFFS on the reproductive performance of Warmblood horses with about 2.7% lower average foaling rate in carriers of the mutant allele than in WFFS free sires, if mated to an average mare population. Indications of favorable dressage performance of WFFS carriers were found. Reported WFFS cases indicate only the tip of the iceberg and assessing the impact of WFFS on reproduction requires consideration of premature foal losses."
https://openalex.org/W4288441476,"Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV), which is a calicivirus, is used as a biocontrol agent to suppress European wild rabbit populations in Australia. The transmission of RHDV can be influenced by social interactions of rabbits; however, there is a paucity of this knowledge about juvenile rabbits and the roles they may play in the transmission of RHDV. We aimed to quantify the social interactions of juvenile (< 900 g) and adult (> 1200 g) rabbits in a locally abundant population in the Central Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. Twenty-six juvenile and 16 adult rabbits were fitted with VHF proximity loggers to monitor intra- and inter-group pairings. Use of multiple warrens by these rabbits was investigated using VHF base stations at nine warrens and on foot with a hand-held Yagi antenna. Juvenile rabbits were strongly interconnected with both juveniles and adults within and outside their warren of capture, and almost all juveniles were well-connected to other individuals within their own social group. Inter-group pairings were infrequent and fleeting between adults. Both juvenile and adult rabbits used multiple warrens. However, visits to warrens outside their warren of capture, particularly those within 50 m, were more common and longer in duration in juveniles than in adults. The high connectivity of juveniles within and between warrens in close proximity increases potential pathogen exchange between warrens. Therefore, juvenile rabbits could be of greater importance in lagovirus transmission than adult rabbits. The strength of juvenile rabbit inter- and intra-group pairings, and their tendency to use multiple warrens, highlight their potential to act as 'superspreaders' of both infection and immunity for lagoviruses and other pathogens with similar lifecycles. Confirmation of this potential is required through examination of disease progress and rabbit age-related immune responses during outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4288441608,"Microbial experimental evolution allows studying evolutionary dynamics in action and testing theory predictions in the lab. Experimental evolution in chemostats (i.e. continuous flow through cultures) has recently gained increased interest as it allows tighter control of selective pressures compared to static batch cultures, with a growing number of efforts to develop systems that are easier and cheaper to construct. This protocol describes the design and construction of a multiplexed chemostat array (dubbed “mesostats”) designed for cultivation of algae in 16 concurrent populations, specifically intended for studying adaptation to herbicides. We also present control data from several experiments run on the system to show replicability, data illustrating the effects of common issues like leaks, contamination and clumps, and outline possible modifications and adaptations of the system for future research."
https://openalex.org/W4288441770,"Objectives To assess the usability of German hospital administrative claims data (GHACD) to determine inpatient management patterns, healthcare resource utilization, and quality-of-care in patients with multiple myeloma (PwMM). Methods Based on German tertiary hospital’s claims data (2015–2017), PwMM aged &gt;18 years were included if they had an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code of C90.0 or received anti-MM therapy. Subgroup analysis was performed on stem cell transplantation (SCT) patients. Results Of 230 PwMM, 59.1% were men; 56.1% were aged ≥65 years. Hypertension and infections were present in 50% and 67.0%, respectively. Seventy percent of PwMM received combination therapy. Innovative drugs such as bortezomib and lenalidomide were given to 36.1% and 10.9% of the patients, respectively. Mean number of admissions and mean hospitalization length/patient were 3.69 (standard deviation (SD) 2.71 (1–16)) and 12.52 (SD 9.55 (1–68.5)) days, respectively. In-hospital mortality was recorded in 12.2%. Seventy-two percent of SCT patients (n = 88) were aged ≤65 years, 22.7% required second transplantation, and 89.8% received platelet transfusion at a mean of 1.42(SD 0.63 (1–3)). Conclusion GHACD provided relevant information essential for healthcare studies about PwMM from routine care settings. Data fundamental for quality-of-care assessment were also captured."
https://openalex.org/W4288441856,"Inflammatory signaling induces barrier dysfunction in retinal-pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells and plays a role in the pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We studied the role of Zn flux from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytoplasm via Zip7 during inflammatory signaling in RPE cells. In ARPE-19 cells, Zip7 inhibition reduced impedance loss, FITC-dextran permeability and cytokine induction caused by challenge with IL-1β/TNF-α. Zip7 inhibition in iPS-derived RPE cells challenged with TNF- α reduced barrier loss in TER assays. In ARPE-19 cells, a Zn ionophore restored cytokine induction and barrier loss in cells challenged with IL-1 β /TNF- α despite Zip7 inhibition. A cell permeable Zn chelator demonstrated that Zn is essential for IL-1 β /TNF- α signaling. ER stress caused by Zip7 inhibition in ARPE-19 cells was found to partially contribute to reducing barrier dysfunction caused by IL-1 β /TNF- α. Overall, it was shown that Zn flux through Zip7 from the ER to the cytoplasm plays a critical role in driving barrier dysfunction caused by inflammatory cytokines in RPE cells."
https://openalex.org/W4288445454,"Background Inadequate adherence to treatment is among the main underlying causes of depression becoming a chronic problem. In developing countries due to limited access to health care, inaccurate diagnoses, and scarcity of medications, poor adherence may become an even larger obstacle in the treatment of depression. The current study aims to assess the magnitude and factors related to treatment non-adherence among patients with depressive disorders. Objective To assess the magnitude and factors associated with treatment non adherence among patients with depressive disorders at St. Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2019. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 respondents using systematic random sampling technique. Medication adherence was assessed by using Medication Adherence Rating Scale. Data was entered to Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Binary logistic analysis was done and P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results The prevalence of treatment non-adherence among patients with depressive disorders was 26% (95%CI; 21.2, 32.5). Previous suicide attempt (AOR = 3.05, 95%CI; 1.82, 5.12), medication side effects (AOR = 2.46, 95%CI; 1.47, 4.11), moderate to high self-stigma (AOR = 2.60, 95%CI; 1.45, 4.66), and poor quality of life (AOR = 2.47, 95%CI; 1.42, 4.28) were significantly associated with treatment non-adherence among patients with depressive disorders. Conclusion and recommendation Treatment non-adherence is a common problem among patients being treated for depressive disorders. Previous suicide attempts, medication side effects, moderate to high self-stigma, and poor quality of life were significantly associated with treatment non-adherence. Appropriate interventions should be developed to promote measures to facilitate adherence in this group of patients, and address the associated factors when applicable."
