https://openalex.org/W1576509886,"Abstract The kinetics of the incorporation in vivo of 14C-glucosamine into the protein-bound hexosamine and sialic acid of nine rat liver subcellular fractions and of plasma indicates that hexosamine is incorporated into glycoprotein in the channels of both the rough and smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, whereas sialic acid is incorporated primarily within the smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. Puromycin in vitro releases between 13 and 52% of acid-insoluble 14C-glucosamine incorporated into rat liver ribosomes in vivo, indicating that some glucosamine is incorporated into nascent ribosome-bound polypeptide. Evidence is presented that membrane-bound ribosomes are the site of this glucosamine incorporation. The conclusion is drawn that hexosamine is first incorporated into newly synthesized polypeptide while it is still attached to the ribosome on which it is being assembled and that further hexosamine residues are incorporated after detachment from the ribosome as the polypeptide traverses the channels of the rough and smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum on its way out of the cell into the plasma. Sialic acid, which is usually found in terminal positions of glycoprotein prosthetic groups, is incorporated primarily during the final stages of this synthetic process while the glycoprotein is within the smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. Morris hepatoma 5123 TC, which is deficient in membrane-bound ribosomes, shows a markedly altered pattern of 14C-glucosamine incorporation into glycoprotein."

The purified enzyme is specific for nonmethoxylated polygalacturonic acid. It shows an optimum pH between 5.2 and 5.4; no shift of optimum pH is observed when tetragalacturonic acid is used as a substrate. The activity is stimulated by 0.1 m sodium, potassium, and ammonium ions, but not by 0.001 m calcium, magnesium, and barium ions. At 0.1 m, phosphate (pH 5.2), chloride, and sulfate ions are somewhat inhibitory as compared to acetate ions, but 0.1 m phosphate (pH 4.8) and 0.001 m polymetaphosphate ions are not inhibitory. The major end products are mono- and digalacturonic acids. Digalacturonic acid is not hydrolyzed further. The relative initial rates of the reactions on substrates of different chain lengths are: polygalacturonic acid, 100; shorter chain polygalacturonic acid (average degree of polymerization, 12), 52; hexagalacturonic acid, 15.8; pentagalacturonic acid, 12.8; tetragalacturonic acid, 2.2; trigalacturonic acid, 1.7. Hexamer is cleaved predominantly at the central bond, producing 2 molecules of trimer; slower reactions yielding dimer and tetramer were also observed. Pentamer is cleaved only into dimer and trimer. Tetramer is cleaved at Bond 1 to yield trimer and monomer; the central bond of tetramer is also cleaved at a lower but significant rate to form dimer. Both reduced and oxidized tetramer are cleaved much more slowly, and at the central bond only, resulting in an accumulation of normal and reduced or oxidized dimer. Simultaneous attack of Bonds 1 and 2 is postulated for trimer hydrolysis, since only the monomer is found as the reaction product and no dimer is detected, although Erwinia polygalacturonase cannot hydrolyze the dimer. Both reduced and oxidized trimer are cleaved at Bond 1 after a long incubation."
https://openalex.org/W1604650512,"Light absorption spectra of cytochrome c peroxidase and its derivatives are measured between 23° and -190°. Spectra of the enzyme and its azide complex are found to be temperature-dependent, while those of Complex ES (a red peroxide compound) and of complexes of the enzyme with cyanide and fluoride appear temperature-independent. The spectrum of the enzyme at pH 7.0, which is a predominantly high spin type at 23°, changes to an essentially low spin type on cooling at -190°. This spectral transition of the frozen enzyme is found to take place in a relatively limited range of cryogenic temperature from -10° to -100°. Upon warming the frozen enzyme up from -190°, it is found that the α- and β-bands at 574 and 540 mµ (low spin type) disappear in a range from -100° to -30°, while the charge transfer bands at 500 and 640 mµ (high spin type) appear in a range from -60° to -10°."
https://openalex.org/W1487596862,"Abstract When discs of the marine brown alga, Fucus gardneri, were infiltrated with uniformly labeled d-mannose-14C or uniformly labeled d-glucose-14C, radioactivity was detected in the respiratory CO2, fucoidin, alginic acid, and in the residual fractions. Radioactivity was also found in the ethanol and in the acid extracts of the leaves. The extracts contained sugar phosphates, sugar nucleotides, and glyconic acids. Enzyme preparations were obtained from the alga which contained the following enzymic activities: hexokinase, phosphomannomutase, d-mannose 1-phosphate guanylyl-transferase, guanosine diphosphate-d-mannose dehydrogenase, and mannuronic acid transferase. It was shown that, starting with d-mannose, these enzyme systems are involved in the pathway leading to the formation of guanosine diphosphate-d-mannuronic acid and subsequent incorporation of the d-mannuronic acid into a polymer of the uronic acid. The enzyme activities of the F. gardneri could be observed only when the cell-free preparations were made in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone."
https://openalex.org/W1674001632,"Fructokinase (ketohexokinase, EC 2.7.1.3), aldolase (ketose-1-aldehyde lyase, EC 4.1.2.7), and triokinase (ATP:D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.28) activities of rat liver were measured under various dietary and hormonal conditions. Specific activities in terms of liver weight did not change greatly, but marked changes were observed in total liver activity. All three activities decreased to about one-half or less of their normal total activity on fasting for 48 to 72 hours, and were restored completely to normal in 24 hours by fructose feeding. With glucose feeding, recovery was complete for aldolase but only partial for fructokinase and triokinase. There was no recovery of activity on feeding a high protein diet. Recovery of activity on fructose feeding occurred within a 4- to 8-hour period following a lag of about 16 hours, and roughly paralleled increases in liver weight. Long term feeding of fructose resulted in the maintenance of a considerably higher level of all three enzymes over that on a high fat or high protein diet. Levels of all three enzymes were unchanged in alloxan-diabetic rats. Fructokinase activity of fed adrenalectomized rats was at the fasting level of normal rats and was neither lowered further on fasting nor increased by subsequent feeding of fructose or glucose. In contrast, aldolase and triokinase activities were normal and decreased sharply on fasting but did not recover on subsequent glucose or fructose feeding. Essentially the same pattern was found for hypophysectomized as for adrenalectomized rats. Throughout all of the alterations of aldolase activity there was an invariably constant ratio of 1 for activity toward the two substrates, fructose 1,6-diphosphate and fructose 1-phosphate, suggesting the presence of a single aldolase species in rat liver."

https://openalex.org/W1606951866,"Abstract 2,4-Bis-(β-hydroxypropionic acid) deuteroporphyrin IX tetramethyl ester was synthesized from trans-diacrylic deuteroporphyrin IX and crystallized. The melting point, absorption spectra in the visible region, molar extinction co-efficient, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra are recorded. Dehydration of β-hydroxypropionic acid deuteroporphyrin IX in pyridine with p-toluenesulfonic acid resulted in a mixture of diacrylic acid deuteroporphyrin IX and monohydroxypropionic-monoacrylic deuteroporphyrin IX. No protoporphyrin IX was formed by this method. Chromic acid-pyridine oxidation of β-hydroxypropionic acid deuteroporphyrin IX gave a diacetyl deuteroporphyrin IX. Protoporphyrin IX was obtained in a yield of 45% from an acid-catalyzed reaction of β-hydroxypropionic acid deuteroporphyrinogen IX. Diacrylic deuteroporphyrin and monovinyl-monoacrylic deuteroporphyrin IX was obtained from β-hydroxypropionic acid deuteroporphyrinogen IX at 38° and neutral pH. Protoporphyrin IX was formed from β-hydroxypropionic acid deuteroporphyrinogen IX, but not from the oxidized form, in neutral anaerobic incubation with a mitochondrial enzyme. It is suggested that β-hydroxypropionic acid deuteroporphyrinogen IX, resulting from an oxygenase-type reaction, is dehydrated and decarboxylated to protoporphyrinogen IX."

https://openalex.org/W1509844336,"Abstract Relationships of the oxidation reactions to the phosphorylation and the water formation reactions of oxidative phosphorylation have been assessed by measurement of inhibitor effects on the Pi ⇄ ATP, Pi ⇄ HOH, and ATP ⇄ HOH exchange reactions. With mitochondria or with mitochondrial particles, additions of cyanide, Amytal, rotenone, or antimycin, with or without substrate addition, had no or only partial inhibitory effects on all exchanges. Particles oxidizing succinate or reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide without added adenine nucleotides showed no detectable Pi ⇄ HOH exchange. The conclusion is reached that the phosphorylation and the water formation reactions probably occur without concomitant oxidation or reduction. Some additive effects of combinations of respiratory inhibitors on the exchanges were noted. This might reflect nonspecific inhibitions, or possibly a compulsory coupling of the phosphorylation or water formation reactions to formation of combinations with or changes in conformation of respiratory components. Any such combination required most likely occurs with a reduced form of the respiratory carrier. A fat-soluble iron chelator, 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione, and p-mercuribenzoate were noted to have roughly similar effects in promoting ATPase, in inhibiting succinate but not DPNH oxidation, and in uncoupling phosphorylation from oxidation. The chelator effects were readily reversible. Emphasis is given to the important point that the apparent independence of the water formation reaction from the oxidation reactions of oxidative phosphorylation is difficult to reconcile with many schemes for oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1537890706,"A method is described for the preparation of highly purified arginine kinase from the tail muscle of the sea crayfish, Jasus verreauxi. Initial velocity studies have been made of the arginine kinase reaction in both the forward and reverse directions. When the experimental data are plotted in double reciprocal form, families of parallel straight lines are obtained. Thus it has been concluded that the reaction mechanism is of the ping-pong type so that the product of the first reactant dissociates from the enzyme before the second substrate adds to the enzyme. The conclusions with regard to the mechanism have been confirmed by the demonstration that an adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange reaction occurs in the absence of the guanidino substrates and that an arginine-phosphoarginine exchange takes place in the absence of nucleotides. Whereas a divalent metal ion is required for the adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange, it appears that it is not essential for the arginine-phosphoarginine exchange. Higher concentrations of phosphoarginine have been shown to give rise to the inhibition of the reverse reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1509604742,"Abstract Evidence is presented that phosphorylated proteins or lipids containing phosphohistidine, phosphoserine, or other phosphoryl groups stable to phenol extraction at acidic, near neutral, or alkaline pH do not serve as intermediates in the formation of adenosine triphosphate by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondrial particles. Suggestions of phosphoproteins as intermediates are thus considered to be tenuous. It has been shown that an unidentified, apparently protein-bound, and very labile phosphate fraction rapidly formed from 32Pi in mitochondria and particles probably represents a specifically occluded Pi and not a labile phosphoryl derivative. This Pi does not appear to be at or near the site of oxidative phosphorylation. In intact mitochondria, bound phosphohistidine is labeled much more rapidly and initially to a greater extent than phosphoserine or lipid phosphate fractions, and independently from the labeling of these fractions. Phosphohistidine may be labeled directly from Pi, but labeling of the phosphoserine and lipid phosphate fractions by 32Pi appears to occur only via intermediate formation of AT32P. Transphosphorylation among the various fractions does not occur under conditions tested. Most of the lipid phosphate labeling from AT32P occurs near the mitochondrial surface in an atractyloside-insensitive locus."
https://openalex.org/W1649558887,"Abstract The enzymatic dehydration of homoisocitric acid (α-hydroxy-β-carboxyadipic acid) to the α,β-unsaturated tricarboxylic acid, homoaconitic acid, has been shown spectrophotometrically by increase in absorbance at 240 mµ. The product was isolated by ether extraction and column chromatography and was identified by comparing its melting point, infrared spectrum, and Rf values on paper chromatograms with synthetic cis-homoaconitic acid. The enzyme product was also characterized by catalytic reduction to the saturated derivative, 1,2,4-butanetricarboxylic acid (homotricarballylic acid). The cis structure of the enzymatically formed homoaconitic acid was established by its quantitative conversion into the anhydride under mild conditions and its transformation into the more stable trans isomer on heating in acidic solution. In addition, as expected for a cis isomer, the enzyme product and the corresponding synthetic isomer had a lower melting point, lower Rf values in paper chromatograms, and a lower absorptivity in ultraviolet light when compared with the trans isomer. The cis isomer of synthetic homoaconitic acid reacted in the presence of yeast extract to yield homoisocitrate. The trans isomer was unreactive. The enzyme, which has been named cis-homoaconitase, was separated from cis-aconitase by ammonium sulfate precipitation, has an optimum pH of 8.6 in phosphate buffer, and is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, α,α'-dipyridyl, and o-phenanthroline."

https://openalex.org/W1488957061,"Abstract Tropocollagen solutions treated with mushroom tyrosinase developed a yellow-brown color and showed a large increase in viscosity. Spectral and fluorescence studies revealed the oxidation of tyrosine residues in collagen. Viscosity, sedimentation, and polarimetric studies showed that tyrosinase action on collagen resulted in inter- and intramolecular cross-linking of tropocollagen molecules. Protease treatment abolished most of the sites of tyrosinase action in tropocollagen. The results suggest that tyrosine residues in collagen are integral parts of the tropocollagen primary structure and that they are mainly located on protease-susceptible peptide appendages (telopeptides) so strategically located that they play important roles in intermolecular interactions."

The activity of this bacterium (culture kindly presented by Dr. A. N. Hall) and of ten other species of bacteria on cyclic ketones has been investigated.

https://openalex.org/W1527687937,"Abstract Decrease in the ionic strength of a solution of horse heart ferricytochrome c at pH 1.5 results in changes in optical rotatory dispersion similar to those observed upon helix-random coil transition in model polypeptide systems. These changes are accompanied by modification of the dispersion pattern in the Soret region and parallel alterations in the absorption spectrum indicative of transition from a partially low spin system to a predominantly high spin one. A corresponding ionic strength effect is not observed with the unmodified protein at pH 7 but can be obtained at neutral pH with a derivative in which all the carboxyl groups are esterified. Such an esterified preparation, even under conditions where the dispersion pattern in the region from 200 to 250 mµ remains essentially that of the unmodified protein, exhibits rotations which, at longer wave lengths, approximate more nearly those recorded for the nonesterified molecule in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride or urea. The possibility is considered that the propionate side chains of the porphyrin play an important role in the binding between the protein and its prosthetic group."
