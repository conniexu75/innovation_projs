We identify and examine challenges faced by online automatic approaches for hate speech detection in text. Among these difficulties are subtleties in language, differing definitions on what constitutes hate speech, and limitations of data availability for training and testing of these systems. Furthermore, many recent approaches suffer from an interpretability problem-that is, it can be difficult to understand why the systems make the decisions that they do. We propose a multi-view SVM approach that achieves near state-of-the-art performance, while being simpler and producing more easily interpretable decisions than neural methods. We also discuss both technical and practical challenges that remain for this task."
https://openalex.org/W2969389395,"Background Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is a multifactorial condition that already affects one third of the worldwide population. The identification of candidate genes for hypertension is a challenge for the next years. Nevertheless, the small contribution of each individual genetic factor to the disease brings the necessity of evaluate genes in an integrative manner and taking into consideration the physiological interaction of functions. Angiotensin I–converting enzymes, ACE and ACE2, are key regulators of blood pressure that have counterbalance roles by acting on vasoactive peptides from Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of ACE gene and single nucleotide polymorphism G8790A of ACE2 gene have been associated with susceptibility to SAH, but the literature is controversial. We proposed to evaluate these two polymorphisms jointly exploring the combined effects of ACE and ACE2 genotypes on SAH susceptibility, an approach that have not been done yet for ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms. Methods and findings This genetic association study included 117 hypertensive (mean age 59.7 years) patients and 123 normotensive and diabetes-free controls (mean age 57.5 years). ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms were genotyped by SYBR Green real-time PCR and RFLP-PCR, respectively. Crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) values were calculated to estimate the susceptibility to SAH development. It was obtained homogeneity regarding distribution by sex, age range, smoking, alcohol consumption and body mass index (BMI) between case and control groups. No-association was verified for each gene individually, but the combination of ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms on female gender revealed a significative association for DD/G_ carriers who had a 3-fold increased risk to SAH development (p = 0.03), with a stronger susceptibility on DD/GG carriers (7-fold increased risk, p = 0.01). The D allele of ACE showed association with altered levels of lipid profile variables on case group (VLDL-cholesterol, p = 0.01) and DD genotype in all individuals analysis (triglycerides, p = 0.01 and VLDL-cholesterol, p = 0.01). Conclusion These findings indicate that the combination of ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms effects may play a role in SAH predisposition been the DD/G_ genotype the susceptibility profile. This result allowed us to raise the hypothesis that an increased activity of ACE (prohypertensive effects) in conjunction with reduced ACE2 activity (antihypertensive effects) could be the underlining mechanism. The association of ACE D allele with lipid alterations indicate that this can be a marker of poor prognostic on SAH evolution and contribute to CVD development. Although these preliminary findings must be confirmed by further researches with larger sample size, we could observe that the integrative analysis of ACE and ACE2 can be an informative tool in hypertension understanding that needs to be explored in new studies."

The association between depression and motivation in Vietnamese medical students is not well-documented.To estimate the prevalence of self-reported depression and to identify associated risk factors among medical students at Hanoi Medical University (HMU).A cross-sectional study was conducted on medical students with clinical experience at HMU from November 2015 to January 2016. We used the multistage cluster random sampling technique to select and invite students to complete a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Academic Motivation Scale (AMS), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ).Among 494 participants (78.8% response rate), the prevalence of self-reported depression was 15.2% (95%CI:12.0%-19.0%), and suicidal ideation was 7.7% (95%CI:6.2%-9.5%). Self-reported depression was significantly associated with perceived financial burden, physical inactivity, being senior student, perceived negative influence of night shifts, and non-self-determined motivation profile. Suicidal ideation was significantly associated with perceived financial burden and non-self-determined motivation profile. In the multivariable regression models, significant risk factors for self-reported depression were non-self-determined motivation (PR = 2.62, 95%CI:1.68-4.07), perceived financial burden (PR = 1.95, 95%CI:1.39-2.73), and vigorous level of physical activity (PR = 0.43, 95%CI:0.20-0.942). For suicidal ideation, non-self-determined motivation (PR = 2.33, 95%CI:1.13-4.80) and perceived financial burden (PR = 1.91, 95%CI:1.16-3.13) were significant risk factors.The strengths of our study included a representative sample, a good response rate, and using a good depression screening tool. However, the PHQ-9 only allowed us to screen for depression, and the translation of the AMS and IPAQ into Vietnamese could potentially decrease these tools' validity.The prevalence of self-reported depression and suicidal ideation in medical students is notably higher compared to the general population in Vietnam. Non-self-determined motivation and financial burden were the prominent risk factors for both the depression and suicidal ideation in medical students."
https://openalex.org/W2969931949,"This research article aims to disclose the features of nanofluidic flow manifested with Cattaneo-Christov model of heat and mass flux over non-linearly stretching surface. An incompressible visco-elastic nanofluid saturates the given porous medium through Darcy-Forchheimer relation. A non-uniformly induced magnetic effect is considered to accentuate the electro-magnetic and thermal conductivity of the base fluid. The model is restricted to small magnetic Reynolds. Boundary layer assumptions are incorporated for the given flow model. Governing equations are remodeled into non-linear ordinary differential equations through transformations. So formulated nonlinear system is solved through homotopy analysis method (HAM) to achieve series solutions for velocity field, concentration of nanoparticles and temperature distribution. It is noticed that the temperature distribution and corresponding thermal boundary layer pattern shows declination for Cattaneo-Christov model of heat and mass flux as compared to classical Fourier's law of heat flux/conduction. Furthermore, the intensive resistance offered by the addition of porosity factor in the flow model results in rise of temperature profile, however, opposite behavior is noticed in concentration of nanoparticles. The wall-drag intensity, the heat flux and the mass flux are discussed on the premise of numerical information obtained upon simulation of the problem."
https://openalex.org/W2969878755,"Introduction Globally, 289,000 women die from complications related to pregnancy, childbirth, or the postnatal period every year. Two-thirds of all maternal deaths occur during the first six weeks following birth and more than two thirds of newborn deaths occur during the first week of life, These statistics underscore the importance of postnatal care, an often neglected service according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The purpose of this study was to assess the factors associated with postnatal service utilization in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Methods The study was a community-based, cross-sectional study. A multi-stage sampling method was used to select study districts randomly from the entire region. A total of 1,690 participants were selected using systematic random sampling. Participants were 18–49 years old, had given birth within the last six months, and were residents of the district for at least six months. Using SPSS version 20 means, frequencies, and percentages were calculated for the sub-group of participants who did attend postnatal care. Barriers to non-attendance of postatal care were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Bivariate analysis was undertaken to assess the association between demographic, obstetric, and knowledge regarding PNC and attendance at antenatal care. Variables with a P value, <0.05 were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the determinant factors of postnatal care utilization. Result Of the women surveyed, 132 (8%) obtained postnatal care. Women who did not receive postnatal care reported lack of awareness of the services (n = 1110, 73.3%). Most mothers who received postnatal care reported that they were aware of the service prior to the birth of their child (n = 101, 76.5%). Women were more likely to receive postnatal services if they lived in an urban area (odds ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.07, 3.59), had greater than a secondary education (OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.32,9.83), delivered by cesarean section (OR 2.88 95% CI 1.32,6.29), had four or more antenatal visits (OR 4.84, 95% CI 1.57,14.9), or had a planned pregnancy (OR 6.47, 95% CI 2.04,20.5). Conclusion Postnatal care service utilization is very low in Tigray region. Interventions targeted at increasing women’s awareness of the importance of postnatal services and improving accessibility, particularly in rural areas, is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2969922799,"Chronic pain patients enter treatment with different problem profiles making careful assessment a necessity for more individualized treatment plans. In this cross-sectional study we assigned 320 patients entering tertiary multidisciplinary pain treatment into four categories based on whether they scored low or high on the activity and the affective pain interference dimensions of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). To determine whether this categorization system delineates issues that should be assessed further, the categories were compared with ANOVA and MANOVA analyses on three domains: variables affecting physical well-being (body mass index, exercise, substance use), psychological resources (mood), and pain-specific psychological factors (pain anxiety, pain acceptance). The results indicated that subjects who scored low on both interference dimensions compared similarly in weight: mean Body Mass Index (BMI) 27.0 (SD 6.0) kg/m2, and exercise: mean of 2.4 (SD 1.7) exercising sessions over 20 minutes per week, to the general population, had no depressive symptoms on average: mean Beck Depression Index II (BDI-II) score 11.7 (SD 7.5), and had the most favorable psychological reactions to pain relative to the other categories: mean total Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale-20 (PASS-20) score 36.4 (SD 17.9). In contrast, when interference was high on activity, more physical well-being problems were evident e.g. weight: mean BMI 31.0 (SD 7.3) kg/m2, diminished exercise: mean of 1.5 (SD 1.6) exercising sessions per week, and avoidance behavior: mean PASS-20 Escape/Avoidance subscale 3.7 (95% CI: 1.7 to 5.8) scores higher in comparison to activity interference remaining low. With high affective interference, more depressive symptoms: mean BDI-II score 17.7 (SD 7.3), and more cognitive pain anxiety: mean PASS-20 Cognitive Anxiety subscale 2.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 4.8) scores higher in comparison to affective interference remaining low, emerged. Having high interference on both dimensions indicated accumulated risks for reduced physical well-being: mean BMI 29.9 (SD 6.1) kg/m2, mean of 1.2 (SD 1.7) exercising sessions per week, mood problems: mean BDI-II 20.3 (SD 10.6), and negative psychological reactions to pain: mean total PASS-20 score 53.2 (18.4). The results suggest that low interference on both dimensions may allow assessment with only physician consultations, while high interference on either dimension may call attention to distinct issues to be addressed with the help of a physiotherapist or a psychologist, whereas high interference on both dimensions highlights the need for a full multidisciplinary assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2969574744,"Objectives As an emerging middle-income country, Indonesia is grappling with the double burden of malnutrition across all age groups, including adolescents. Slow gains in reducing undernutrition are compounded by rapidly increasing overnutrition. This study aims to determine the patterns and determinants of this double burden, particularly stunting, thinness and overweight, among adolescent girls and boys aged 12–18 years in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,160 girls and boys in the districts of Klaten and Lombok Barat in 2017. Data were collected on adolescents’ nutritional status, sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, dietary intake and physical activity and other relevant factors. Multivariable logistic regression models using generalized estimation equation were employed to determine risk factors for stunting, thinness and overweight. Results About a quarter of adolescent girls (25%) and boys (21%) were stunted. Approximately 5% of girls and 11% of boys were thin, whereas 11% girls and boys each were overweight. Living in a higher wealth household (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49–0.91), compared to a lower wealth household, and living in a district with higher socioeconomic status (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.51–0.79) were associated with lower odds of being stunted. Adolescent education was also protective against stunting (OR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33–0.88). Older adolescents aged 15–18 years were more likely to be stunted (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.42–2.46). Being a girl was associated with reduced odds of being thin (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.30–0.58). Higher household wealth (OR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.27–2.97) predicted being overweight, while maternal primary or some secondary education, compared to no or incomplete primary education, was protective against adolescent overweight (OR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40–0.90). Conclusion Indonesian adolescent girls and boys face both extreme spectrums of malnutrition. Addressing the dual burden of malnutrition requires a multi-pronged approach, and urgent shift is warranted in nutrition policy and programmes targeting adolescents to effectively address the associated underlying determinants."
https://openalex.org/W2969529390,"Introduction Adverse events pose a serious threat to quality patient care. Promoting a culture of safety is essential for reducing adverse events. This study aims to assess healthcare providers’ perceptions of patient safety culture in three selected hospitals in the Upper East region of Ghana. Methods The English version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) questionnaire was administered to 406 clinical staff. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, version 23, was used to analyze the data. The results were presented using descriptive statistics, Pearson Correlation Analysis and One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results It was found that two out of twelve patient safety culture dimensions recorded high positive response rates (≥ 70%). These include teamwork within units (81.5%) and organizational learning (73.1%). Three patient safety culture dimensions (i.e. staffing, non-punitive response to error and frequency of events reported) recorded low positive response rates (≤ 50%). The overall perception of patient safety correlated significantly with all patient safety culture dimensions, except staffing. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall perception of patient safety among the three hospitals. Conclusion Generally, healthcare providers in this study perceived patient safety culture in their units as quite good. Some of the respondents perceived punitive response to errors. Going forward, healthcare policy-makers and managers should make patient safety culture a top priority. The managers should consider creating a ‘blame-free’ environment to promote adverse event reporting in the hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2969673600,"Biofilm formation is a common strategy used by bacteria in order to survive and persist in the environment. In Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae), a Gram-negative pathogen responsible for the cholera disease, biofilm-like aggregates are important for the pathogenesis and disease transmission. Biofilm formation is initiated by the attachment of the bacteria to a surface, followed by maturation stages involving the formation of a biofilm matrix. In V. cholerae, flagella are essential for the initial step of biofilm formation, allowing the bacteria to swim and to detect a surface. In this study, we explored the effect of polymyxin B (PmB), a cationic bacterial antimicrobial peptide, on biofilm formation in pathogenic V. cholerae strains belonging to the O1 and O139 serotypes. We found that sub-inhibitory concentration of PmB induces a reduction of the biofilm formation by V. cholerae O1 and O139. Experiment on preformed biofilm demonstrated that the biofilm formation inhibition occurs at the initial step of biofilm formation, where the flagella are essential. We further characterize the effect of PmB on V. cholerae flagellation. Our results demonstrate that the flagellin expression is not reduced in presence of sub-inhibitory concentration of PmB. However, a decrease of the abundance of flagellin associated with the bacterial cells together with an increase in the secretome was observed. Electron microscopy observations also suggest that the abundance of aflagellated bacteria increases upon PmB supplementation. Finally, in agreement with the effect on the flagellation, a reduction of the bacterial motility is observed. Altogether, our results suggest that the PmB affect V. cholerae flagella resulting in a decrease of the motility and a compromised ability to form biofilm."
https://openalex.org/W2923632057,"Recently, a range of organisations, including car and consumer electronics manufacturers, have applied so-called patent pledges. A patent pledge is a publicly announced intervention by patent-owning entities (‘pledgers’) to out-license active patents to the restricted or unrestricted public free from or bound to certain conditions for a reasonable or no monetary compensation. Despite growing research to better understand this phenomenon, the underlying terminology remains contradictory. We apply an inductive research approach using qualitative coding to analyse 60 patent pledges made by 80 organisations. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-dimensional taxonomy that distinguishes eight types of patent pledges. Extending this taxonomy using case examples, we then propose a generalised patent licensing taxonomy. This second taxonomy can be used to distinguish patent licensing strategies, including other frequently used approaches, such as patent pools and cross-licenses. Finally, we use the patent pledge taxonomy to illustrate how patent owners change their licensing strategies over time and how it can support strategic decision processes within an organisation. We contribute to the field of patent management by building an ontology of patent pledges through proposing a definition and eight types. The patent licensing taxonomy enables organisations to devise and choose licensing strategies, and to illustrate licensing approaches of competitors, for instance."
https://openalex.org/W2969803048,"Introduction Efficacy of daily emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) for PrEP is strongly dependent on the adherence. We examined the concordance between indirect adherence measures and protective drug levels among participants retained through 48 weeks in the PrEP Brasil Study. Methods PrEP Brasil was a prospective, multicenter, open-label demonstration project evaluating PrEP provision for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) at higher risk for HIV infection within the setting of Brazilian Public Health System. Three indirect adherence measures were obtained at week 48: medication possession ratio (MPR), pill count and self-report (30-days recall). Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentration in Dried Blood Spot (DBS) was measured at week 48. Areas under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the concordance between achieving protective drug levels (TFV-DP≥700fmol/punch) and the indirect adherence measures. Youden’s index and distance to corner were used to determine the optimal cutoff points for each indirect adherence measure. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values for the found cutoff points. Finally, Delong test was used to compare AUCs. Results and discussion From April, 2014 to July, 2016, 450 participants initiated PrEP, 375(83.3%) were retained through 48 weeks. Of these, 74% (277/375) had TFV-DP ≥700fmol/punch. All adherence measures discriminated between participants with and without protective drug levels (AUC>0.5). High indirect adherence measure was predictive of protective drug levels (PPV>0.8) while low indirect adherence measure was not predictive of lack of protective drug levels (NPV<0.5). No significant differences were found between the adherence methods (p = 0.44). Conclusions Low-burden measurements such as MPR and self-report can be used to predict PrEP adherence in a public health context in Brazil for MSM and TGW retained through 48 weeks. Clinical Trial Number: NCT01989611."
https://openalex.org/W2969812142,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a trainer’s interpersonal relations from the perspective of autonomy support and controlling style on sportspeople’s basic need satisfaction and frustration, motivation, and resilience. The study used a cross-sectional design based on self-determination theory (SDT). Sportspeople (N = 324) completed questionnaires to measure their perceptions of trainers’ autonomy-supportive and controlling coaching styles, basic need satisfaction and frustration in the sports context, motivation for sport, and resilience. Structural equation modeling of the proposed relations among variables supported SDT by showing a positive relation between perceived autonomy support and the satisfaction of basic psychological needs (β = .39, p < .001) and a negative relation with the frustration of psychological needs (β = −.17, p < .05). The coach’s perceived interpersonal controlling style showed a positive relation with the frustration of psychological needs (β = .55, p < .001) and a negative relation with the satisfaction of basic psychological needs (β = −.27, p < .05). Furthermore, autonomous motivation showed a negative relation (β = −.46, p < .001) with the frustration of psychological needs and a positive relation (β = .35, p < .05) with the satisfaction of basic psychological needs and resilience (β = .60, p < .001). In addition, the resilience of sportspeople was indirectly affected to the same extent by the trainer’s influence through control (β = −.38, p < .05) and perception of autonomy support (β = .16, p < .05) through the mediators of satisfaction of basic psychological needs and motivation. These results show the influence of the coach on the motivation and resilience of sportspeople."
https://openalex.org/W2969455288,"Background Ghana introduced a national health insurance program in 2005 with the goal of removing user fees, popularly called “cash and carry”, along with their associated catastrophic and impoverishment effects on the population and ensuring access to equitable health care. However, after a decade of implementation, the impact of this program on user fees and out-of-pocket payment (OOP) is not properly documented. This paper contributes to understanding the impact of Ghana’s health insurance program on out-of-pocket healthcare payments and the factors associated with the level of out-of-pocket payments for primary healthcare in a predominantly rural region of Ghana. Methods Using a five-year panel data of revenues accruing to public primary health facilities in seven districts, We employed mean comparison tests (t-test) to examine the trend in revenues accruing from out-of-pocket payments vis-à-vis health insurance claims for health services, medication, and obstetric care. Furthermore, generalized estimation equation regression models were used to assess the relationship between explanatory variables and the level of out-of-pocket payments and health insurance claims. Results Out-of-pocket payment for health services and medications declined by 63% and 62% respectively between 2010 and 2014. Insurance claims however increased by 16% within the same period. There was statistically a significant mean reduction in out-of-pocket payment over the period. Factors significantly associated with out-of-pocket payments in a given district are the number of community health facilities, availability of a district hospital and the year of observation. Conclusion The study provides evidence that Ghana’s national health insurance program is significantly contributing to a reduction in out-of-pocket payment for primary healthcare in public health facilities. Efforts should therefore be put in place to ensure the sustainability of this policy as a major pathway for achieving universal health coverage in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2969915148,"Endothelial cells (ECs) form an active barrier between the circulation and the body. In addition to controlling transport of molecules between these 2 compartments, the endothelium is a major secretory organ, releasing proteins both into the circulation and into the vascular matrix. Although it is clearly important that proteins are correctly sorted into these 2 spaces, we currently know little of the polarization of this secretion or how it is controlled. Here, we present an optimized system for the analysis of polarized secretion and show that it allows the derivation of deep, robust proteomes from small numbers of primary ECs. We present the first endothelial apically and basolaterally secreted proteomes, demonstrating that ECs polarize the secretion of extracellular vesicle cargoes to the apical surface. Conversely, we find that protein secretion at the basolateral surface is focused on components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Finally, we examine the role of liprin-α1 in secretion toward the basolateral compartment and identify a subset of ECM components that share this route with fibronectin.-Wei, H., Sundararaman, A., Dickson, E., Rennie-Campbell, L., Cross, E., Heesom, K.

https://openalex.org/W2969897230,"Background Since there is a high prevalence of high risk alcohol use in patients with HIV in Africa, with negative health effects, there is a need for short interventions to reduce alcohol use. Methods We studied the efficacy of a short intervention aiming to reduce alcohol use based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills Model in patients with HIV with high alcohol use (measured by AUDIT). The study was performed in three outpatient clinics in South Africa. The intervention group received in one-session intervention a personalized feedback on AUDIT results trying to make people aware that they are in the medium- or high-risk drinking category. Both the intervention and the control group received a health education leaflet. Results A total of 560 patients participated in the study with a follow up of 1 year. There was a significant decrease in total AUDIT scores between baseline and follow up points 1 (5 months) and 2 (1 year) in both groups. There was no significant decrease between time points 1 and 2. However, between the intervention and control groups there was no difference in reduction of alcohol use to abstinence or low risk alcohol use over time as there was no difference in absolute decrease in AUDIT-score or percentage of change in AUDIT score. The intervention had no influence on the quality of life outcomes, depression scores, stigma, tobacco use, viral load and therapy adherence at both time points. In all secondary outcomes, there was no significant interaction between intervention and time. Conclusion The brief intervention was not successful at reducing alcohol use both 5 and 12 months after the intervention. However, there was a beneficial effect on reported hazardous or harmful alcohol use at least over a short term follow up period in both study groups. It might be that only an interview and/or the distribution of a health leaflet can be successful in reducing alcohol use but this needs to be investigated with more objective measures of alcohol use. To sustain an effect, most likely repetitive contacts with hazardous or harmful alcohol drinkers will be needed during a long follow up period."
https://openalex.org/W2969459224,"Purpose To examine outcomes of 23-gauge (23G) pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for complex diabetic tractional retinal detachment (TRD) in Chicago’s Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS). Materials and methods This is a retrospective noncomparative study of diabetic TRD cases that underwent PPV at CCHHS. Primary retinal reattachment rate, visual function, and postoperative complications were analyzed. Results Sixty nine consecutive cases were included. Primary reattachment and final attachment were achieved in 68/69 eyes (98.6%). Secondary retinal detachment was noted in 1 eye (1.4%). Vitreous hemorrhage requiring repeat PPV developed in 5 eyes (7.2%) and reoperation due to other complications was required in 4/69 eyes (5.8%). Perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas tamponade was used in 91.3% of eyes and silicone oil in 8.7% of eyes. Mean LogMAR visual acuity significantly improved from 1.84 ± 0.61 to 0.93 ± 0.66, (P<0.0001). Vision was stabilized or improved in 66 eyes (95.7%). Visual acuity of 20/200 or better was achieved in 49/69 eyes (71.0%) and 20/50 or better in 16/69 eyes (23.2%). Conclusions Even in patients with severe and advanced diabetic TRD pathology and unique demographics as seen in CCHHS, modern vitrectomy techniques can provide excellent anatomical and visual outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2969685301,"Soil food webs are important drivers for key ecological functions in terrestrial systems such as carbon and nutrient cycling. However, soil food web models generally lack quantitative data, mainly due to the shortage in high-throughput methods to describe energy flows. In marine environments, multivariate optimization models (Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature Analysis) and Bayesian approaches (source-tracking algorithm) were established to predict the proportion of predator diets using lipids as tracers. A premise for the application of such models to soil systems is to acquire the fatty acid pattern of a broad range of resources and to reveal potential overlap in their signatures. We present a comprehensive comparison of lipid pattern across widespread taxa of plants (leaves and roots, n = 48), algae (n = 59), fungi (n = 60), and bacteria (n = 62) as basal food web resources. Lipid profiles from microorganisms and algae were assessed from laboratory cultures, whereas plant tissue was derived from an arable field. A lipid library was constructed and multivariate data analyses (hierarchical clustering, nMDS) was used to assess the extent of separation in lipid pattern by species or resource type. The performance of the lipid library was tested by leave-one-prey-out (LOPO) analysis, giving the distinctiveness of the resource (prey) groups. Fungi and plant leaves were correctly assigned based on their lipid pattern with more than 98%, while plant roots and bacteria achieved 88 and 85%, respectively. However, algae were only correctly classified by 60%, pointing to a bias in the herbivore food chain. Fatty acids most important for separation of algae and plant leaves were of the omega 3 type, i.e. 16:3ω3 and 18:3ω3. In plant roots 18:1ω9 was most important, whereas bacteria were distinguished predominantly by methyl-branched fatty acids. Overall, the lipid pattern of major soil food web resources are sufficiently differentiated to allow for qualitative (biomarker) analyses as well as quantitative modelling, yet with precaution in the case of algae."

https://openalex.org/W2969328745,"Health systems for surgical care for children in low- and middle-income countries remain poorly understood. Our goal was to characterize the delivery of surgical care for children across Brazil and to identify associations between surgical resources and childhood mortality.We performed a cross-sectional, ecological study to analyze surgical care for children in the public health system (Sistema Único de Saúde) across Brazil from 2010 to 2015. We collected data from several national databases, and used geospatial analysis (two-step floating catchment, Getis-Ord-Gi analysis, and geographically weighted regression) to explore relationships between infrastructure, workforce, access, procedure rate, under-5 mortality rate (U5MR), and perioperative mortality rate (POMR).A total of 246,769 surgical procedures were performed in 6,007 first level/ district hospitals and 491 referral hospitals across Brazil over the study period. The surgical workforce is distributed unevenly across the country, with 0.13-0.26 pediatric surgeons per 100,000 children in the poorer North, Northeast and Midwest regions, and 0.6-0.68 pediatric surgeons per 100,000 children in the wealthier South and Southeast regions. Hospital infrastructure, procedure rate, and access to care is also unequally distributed across the country, with increased resources in the South and Southeast compared to the Northeast, North, and Midwest. The U5MR varies widely across the country, although procedure-specific POMR is consistent across regions. Increased access to care is associated with lower U5MR across Brazil, and access to surgical care differs by geographic region independent of socioeconomic status.There are wide disparities in surgical care for children across Brazil, with infrastructure, manpower, and resources distributed unevenly across the country. Access to surgical care is associated with improved U5MR independent of socioeconomic status. To address these disparities, policy should direct the allocation of surgical resources commensurate with local population needs."
https://openalex.org/W2969860634,"Gypsy moth Lymantria dispar L. 1758 (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) is one of the most dangerous forest pests of the Holarctic region. Outbreaks of gypsy moth populations lead to significant defoliation of local forests. Within the vast territory of the West Siberian Plain, we noted the outbreak front movement in the north-east direction with a speed 100–200 km per year. The reason for the outbreak’s movement is still unclear because L. dispar females are characterised by limited flight ability, which is not enough to support that movement per se. Herein, we analysed the mtDNA divergence pattern among L. dispar populations collected from the vast territory of the West Siberian Plain to determine the boundaries of populations and reveal the effect of the outbreak’s front movement on mtDNA patterns of populations. The 590-bp region of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene of the mitochondrial genome was sequenced for 220 specimens that were collected from 18 localities along a transect line (~ 1400 km). Our results clearly show that the gypsy moth populations of the vast Siberian territory are not subdivided. This result can be explained by extensive genetic exchange among local populations. Taking into account that the flight ability of L. dispar females is rather limited, we suggest that spreading occurs through ballooning of early instar larvae. This hypothesis was confirmed by the coincidence of the outbreaks’ movement direction with that of the dominant winds, complemented by the observation of ballooned larvae far from a forest edge."
https://openalex.org/W2969521045,"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) types 2D and 2F are caused by mutations in the genes encoding for α- and δ-sarcoglycan, respectively, leading to progressive muscle weakness. Mouse models exist for LGMD2D (Sgca-/-) and 2F (Sgcd-/-). In a previous natural history study, we described the pathology in these mice at 34 weeks of age. However, the development of muscle pathology at younger ages has not been fully characterised yet. We therefore performed a study into age-related changes in muscle function and pathology by examining mice at different ages. From 4 weeks of age onwards, male mice were subjected to functional tests and sacrificed at respectively 8, 16 or 24 weeks of age. Muscle histopathology and expression of genes involved in muscle pathology were analysed for several skeletal muscles, while miRNA levels were assessed in serum. In addition, for Sgcd-/- mice heart pathology was assessed. Muscle function showed a gradual decline in both Sgca-/- and Sgcd-/- mice. Respiratory function was also impaired at all examined timepoints. Already at 8 weeks of age, muscle pathology was prominent, and fibrotic, inflammatory and regenerative markers were elevated, which remained relatively constant with age. In addition, Sgcd-/- mice showed signs of cardiomyopathy from 16 weeks of age onwards. These results indicate that Sgca-/- and Sgcd-/- are relevant disease models for LGMD2D and 2F."

As with other infectious diseases, report of antimicrobial resistance to existing therapeutic arsenal poses challenges in the management of disease. Hence, identification of novel drug targets for the pathogen deems essential. Present study used combined approach of comparative and subtractive genomics to identify putative drug targets. Crucial genes of 16 pathogenic Leptospira strains were filtered and subjected to homology search via target identification tool “TiD”. Thereafter, comparative analysis was performed for non-homologous, essential genes to accomplish the broad-spectrum drug target. Consequently, 37 essential genes were found to be conserved in at least 10 strains of Leptospira. Further, prioritization of resultant set of genes revealed 18 were hubs in protein–protein interaction network. Sixteen putative targets among the hub genes were conserved in all strains of Leptospira. Out of sixteen, fourteen were enzymes while 8 were novel and 4 were involved in virulence mechanism. In addition, genome scale metabolic network reconstruction and choke point analysis revealed cobA (porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism) and thiL (thiamine metabolism) as chokepoints in their respective metabolic pathways. The proposed hub genes could act as putative broad-spectrum drug targets for Leptospira species, however, these putative targets should be validated to ensure them as real one prior to utilizing them for target based lead discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2969507225,"Background Advanced bipolar vessel sealing devices are widely used in human and veterinary medicine to reduce the operation time and intraoperative blood loss. Because most devices are made for a single use, their application is cost intensive. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of multiple uses and sterilization on the performance of bipolar vessel sealing devices. Methods The burst pressure of sealed porcine renal arteries was compared between the disposable devices „LigaSure”(Valleylab) and „Caiman“(Braun Vetcare) and the reuseable device „MarSeal”(KLS Martin). Additionally, the influence of the sterilization process was investigated, and the sealing time, number of cutting activations and tissue sticking were noted. Results The disposable devices showed reliable performances over multiple activations and sterilization cycles, except for one Caiman device. Seals created with all devices achieved supra-physiologic burst pressures, with the highest pressure measured in a cycle using a MarSeal device. Discussion During 25 activations with and without intermittent sterilization, no correlation was found between increasing seal numbers and decreasing burst pressure. However, the number of cycles in our study was limited to five. Conclusion For limited numbers of cycles and sterilization procedures, seals created with the disposable vessel sealing devices LigaSure and Caiman achieved burst pressures comparaable to those produced with the reuseable MarSeal."

In tumors, elevated intracellular Hsp70 levels were associated on the one hand with radio- and chemotherapy resistance and on the other hand with a favorable outcome for patients. This study was undertaken to investigate cytosolic Hsp70 (cHsp70) as a potential biomarker for progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with primary glioblastomas (GBM). Methods The cHsp70 expression in tumor tissue of 60 patients diagnosed with primary GBM was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The cHsp70 expression was correlated to the PFS and OS of the patients. Results A high cHsp70 expression was associated with a prolonged PFS (hazard ratio = 0.374, p = 0.001) and OS (hazard ratio = 0.416, p = 0.014) in GBM patients treated according to the standard Stupp protocol with surgery, radiotherapy and temozolomide. Conclusions These data suggest that the intracellular Hsp70 expression might serve as a prognostic marker in patients with primary GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2969256547,"The corpus callosum (CC) is the biggest commissure that links cerebral hemispheres. Guidepost structures develop in the cortical midline during CC development and express axon guidance molecules that instruct neurons regarding the proper direction of axonal elongation toward and across the cortical midline. Neuropilin-1 (Npn1), a high affinity receptor for class 3 semaphorins (Sema3s) localized on cingulate pioneering axons, plays a crucial role in axon guidance to the midline through interactions with Sema3s. However, it remains unclear which type of Plexin is a component of Sema3 holoreceptors with Npn1 during the guidance of cingulate pioneering axons. To address the role of PlexinA1 in CC development, we examined with immunohistochemistry the localization of PlexinA1, Npn1, and Sema3s using embryonic brains from wild-type (WT) and PlexinA1-deficient (PlexinA1 knock-out (KO)) mice with a BALB/cAJ background. The immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of PlexinA1 in callosal axons derived from the cingulate and neocortex of the WT mice on embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) but not in the PlexinA1 KO mice. To examine the role of PlexinA1 in the navigation of callosal axons, the extension of callosal axons toward and across the midline was traced in brains of WT and PlexinA1 KO mice at E17.5. As a result, callosal axons in the PlexinA1 KO brains had a significantly lower incidence of midline crossing at E17.5 compared with the WT brains. To further examine the role of PlexinA1 in CC development, the CC phenotype was examined in PlexinA1 KO mice at postnatal day 0.5 (P0.5). Most of the PlexinA1 KO mice at P0.5 showed agenesis of the CC. These results indicate the crucial involvement of PlexinA1 in the midline crossing of callosal axons during CC development in BALB/cAJ mice."

Coastal flooding is a particularly pressing and increasing problem, which affects hundreds of millions of people and damages trillions of US$ in property. Scientists, practitioners and managers must be able to quickly assess flood risk and identify appropriate adaptation and risk reduction measures often with limited data and tools, particularly in developing countries. To inform these decision-making processes, we identify how sensitive flood risk and adaptation analyses are to changes in the resolution of data and models. We further do these comparisons in the context of assess the benefits of an ecosystem-based approach for risk reduction. There is growing interest in these ecosystem-based approaches as cost effective measures for adaptation and risk reduction. We assess flood risks from tropical cyclones and the flood risk reduction benefits provided by mangroves in Pagbilao (the Philippines). Then, we also compare risks and risk reduction (benefits) using different quality data and models, to identify where to invest in in new modeling and data acquisition to improve decision-making. We find that coastal flood risk valuation improves by using high resolution topography and long time series of data on tropical cyclones, while flood reduction benefits of mangroves are better valued by using consistent databases and models along the whole process rather than investing in single measures."

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of prior illness (PI) on EHS severity.We performed a retrospective clinical record review of 179 documented cases of EHS at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia.Approximately 30% of EHS cases had a medically documented PI. Anthropometrics (height, weight, body mass index) and commonly associated risk factors for EHS (age, number of days in training, wet bulb globe temperature, sleep patterns) did not differ between PI and no illness (NI) groups. PI patients presented with higher maximal rectal core temperatures (40.6 ± 1.0°C vs. 40.3 ± 1.2°C; P = 0.0419), and elevated pulse rates (118.1 ± 16.7 bpm vs. 110.5 ± 24.2 bpm; P = 0.0397). At the point of care, biomarker values were similar between PI and NI groups, with the exception of a trend toward elevated monocytes in those with PI (7.9 ± 2.9% vs 6.7± 2.7%; P = 0.0521). Rate and duration of cooling were similar between PI and NI patients.This study indicates that PI has a minimal effect on the patient presentation, severity and treatment outcome of EHS. The results of this study have important implications for military, civilian, and occupational populations who are at risk for EHS."
https://openalex.org/W2969807022,"Introduction Over the past decades, obesity stigma has become a substantial public health issue as studies have highlighted its negative consequences for mental and physical health. However, comparative studies are scarce. In this cross-national study, we focus on the following research questions: (1) Are there differences in the magnitude of public obesity stigma between Germany and the United States (US), and (2) are there differences in the associations of sociodemographic as well as experience (i.e. former obesity experience) and contact-related (i.e. contact to a person with obesity) factors with public obesity stigma between these two countries? Material and methods National telephone surveys in Germany and the United States were conducted (total sample = 2,802) by using vignettes for the description of a person with obesity. Fat Phobia Scale, negative reactions, and desire for social distance were assessed as components of public obesity stigma. All three stigma components were examined with multilevel linear regression analyses. Results Overall, results show that public obesity stigma is significantly more pronounced in the US than in Germany. Relationships between obesity stigma and sociodemographic as well as experience and contact-related factors remain rather inconclusive, though, in general, stronger associations are shown in the US. Conclusions Contrary to the normalization hypothesis, findings indicate that a comparatively high prevalence of obesity like in the US is associated with a higher level of obesity stigma."
https://openalex.org/W2969258598,"Resource polymorphism-whereby ancestral generalist populations give rise to several specialised morphs along a resource gradient-is common where species colonise newly formed ecosystems. This phenomenon is particularly well documented in freshwater fish populations inhabiting postglacial lakes formed at the end of the last ice age. However, knowledge on how such differential exploitation of resources across contrasting habitats might be reflected in the biochemical compositions of diverging populations is still limited, though such patterns might be expected. Here, we aimed to assess how fatty acids (FA)-an important biochemical component of animal tissues-diverged across a polymorphic complex of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and their closely related monomorphic specialist congener vendace (Coregonus albula) inhabiting a series of six subarctic lakes in northern Fennoscandia. We also explored patterns of FA composition in whitefish's predators and invertebrate prey to assess how divergence in trophic ecology between whitefish morphs would relate to biochemical profiles of their key food web associates. Lastly, we assessed how information on trophic divergence provided by differential FA composition compared to evidence of resource polymorphism retrieved from more classical stomach content and stable isotopic (δ13C, δ15N) information. Examination of stomach contents provided high-resolution information on recently consumed prey, whereas stable isotopes indicated broad-scale patterns of benthic-pelagic resource use differentiation at different trophic levels. Linear discriminant analysis based on FA composition was substantially more successful in identifying whitefish morphs and their congener vendace as distinct groupings when compared to the other two methods. Three major FA (myristic acid, stearic acid, and eicosadienoic acid) proved particularly informative, both in delineating coregonid groups, and identifying patterns of pelagic-benthic feeding throughout the wider food web. Myristic acid (14:0) content and δ13C ratios in muscle tissue were positively correlated across fish taxa, and together provided the clearest segregation of fishes exploiting contrasting pelagic and benthic niches. In general, our findings highlight the potential of FA analysis for identifying resource polymorphism in animal populations where this phenomenon occurs, and suggest that this technique may provide greater resolution than more traditional methods typically used for this purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2969482246,"Bitter taste receptor-14 (TAS2R14) is a GPCR also expressed on human airway smooth muscle cells, which signals to intracellular [Ca2+], resulting in relaxation of the airway, and is a novel target for bronchodilators. Here, we examine long-term, agonist-promoted down-regulation of TAS2R14 expression because tachyphylaxis would be an undesirable therapeutic characteristic. Five TAS2R structurally distinct full agonists were studied to ascertain biasing away from down-regulation. Agonist exposure for 18 h caused minimal desensitization by diphenhydramine (DPD) compared with ∼50% desensitization with all other agonists. Agonists evoked β-arrestin recruitment to TAS2R14, which was not seen with a phosphoacceptor-deficient mutant, TAS2R14-10A. All agonists except for DPD also caused subsequent TAS2R14 internalization and trafficking via early and late endosomes to down-regulation. TAS2R14-10A failed to undergo these events with any agonist. Molecular docking showed that DPD has specific interactions deep within a binding pocket that are not observed with the other agonists, which may lock the receptor in a conformation that does not internalize and therefore does not undergo down-regulation. Thus, TAS2R14 is subject to β-arrestin-mediated internalization and subsequent down-regulation with chronic exposure to most agonists. However, by manipulating the agonist structure, biasing toward G-protein coupling but away from long-term down-regulation can be achieved.-Woo, J. A., Castaño, M., Goss, A., Kim, D., Lewandowski, E.

https://openalex.org/W2969886483,"Experimental and numerical analyses performed on a scaled-down model of a 1900TEU container-ship are reported herein. Wind-tunnel and towing-tank experiments along with computational-fluid-dynamic simulations were performed to obtain (1) wind-load coefficients for superstructure of container ship at different wind angles under full-load operating conditions; (2) wave resistance of the model sans the superstructure under different wave conditions; and (3) combined wind–wave resistance of the model in the head waves coupled with a fluctuating wind. Wind-tunnel experiments were first performed to determine wind-load coefficients concerning of the superstructure at different wind angles. Subsequently, the obtained wind-load coefficients from the wind tunnel test were compared against numerical and empirically obtained results to validate the applicability of the applied numerical methods. Next, the wave-induced resistance to ship motion was investigated via a series of towing-tank experiments and numerical simulations to analyze the resistance and motion of ship under wavy conditions. Finally, characteristics of the added resistance to ship motion under conditions of combined wind–wave load were analyzed, and the coupling between ship motion and combined wind–wave load was used to investigate the changes in added resistance under different load scenarios. The results reveal that combined wind–wave load causes the resistance to ship motion to exceed the algebraic sum of the corresponding resistances under standalone wind- and wave-load conditions. The additional resistance was observed to be a combined manifestation of resistances induced by ship motion and wave-parameter alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2969586674,"Although corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities are common in the pharmaceutical industry, there is little empirical evidence on consumer responses to CSR practices. We investigated public awareness, preferences, and expectations regarding social contribution of the pharmaceutical industry's CSR activities, and identified the factors associated with such activities. We conducted an online survey with 1,298 respondents comprising two groups: healthy individuals (546) and patients (752). Most respondents (78%) expressed interest in CSR activities undertaken by pharmaceutical companies. However, they reported a lack of awareness and experience thereof; only 26.9% were aware of and 7.9% had experience with such activities. Among our six CSR activity categories, both survey groups showed the highest preference for the ""promoting public health"" (healthy group: 6.34/10; patient group: 6.37/10) and ""emergency disaster relief support"" (6.31 and 6.35) categories. Among sub-categories, activities related to ""development of innovative drugs in untreated areas"" (6.63 and 6.82) and ""support for research on new drug development"" (6.59 and 6.84) received the highest scores. The mean expectation score of social contribution of all CSR activities was slightly higher than the mean preference score (6.37 and 6.06, respectively). The patient group exhibited a larger difference between the highest and lowest expectation scores than the healthy group (1.11 and 0.64, respectively). The results of the regression analysis revealed that being a patient, being male, and having positive attitudes toward CSR and its expected effects significantly and positively affected public preferences regarding CSR activities. We can conclude that CSR activities with high public preference might be an effective strategy to improve public awareness of the pharmaceutical industry's CSR activities. Furthermore, the highest preference for CSR activities relates to new drug development, indicating that our society believes the pharmaceutical industry's key CSR activity should be to pursue its intrinsic mission: to fulfill unmet medical needs by developing new drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2969681833,"There have been increasing number of reports of SZT2-related neurological diseases, the main symptoms of which are epilepsy, developmental delay, macrocephaly and a dysmorphic corpus callosum. SZT2 functions as a regulator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cultured human cell lines and mouse tissues. However, it remains to be determined whether mutations in SZT2 in human patients alter mTORC1 signaling. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional consequence of biallelic SZT2 variants in Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from two patients with a typical SZT2-related neurodevelopmental disease. Increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 was identified in patient-derived cell lines under amino acid-starved condition, suggestive of constitutive hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling. This result was validated by constitutive lysosomal localization of mTOR in patients' LCLs. Furthermore, patients' LCLs display an excessive response to slight amino acid stimulation. Our data suggest the loss-of-function nature of SZT2 mutations in the patients, and consequent hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in response to both amino acid starvation and stimulation in their LCLs. By these functional analyses, the pathogenicity of newly identified SZT2 variants can be determined, allowing for more detailed characterization of genotype-phenotype correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2969407196,"The thermoanalytical technique differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been applied to characterize protein denaturation patterns (thermograms) in blood plasma samples and relate these to a subject’s health status. The analysis and classification of thermograms is challenging because of the high-dimensionality of the dataset. There are various methods for group classification using high-dimensional data sets; however, the impact of using high-dimensional data sets for cancer classification has been poorly understood. In the present article, we proposed a statistical approach for data reduction and a parametric method (PM) for modeling of high-dimensional data sets for two- and three- group classification using DSC and demographic data. We compared the PM to the non-parametric classification method K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and the semi-parametric classification method KNN with dynamic time warping (DTW). We evaluated the performance of these methods for multiple two-group classifications: (i) normal versus cervical cancer, (ii) normal versus lung cancer, (iii) normal versus cancer (cervical + lung), (iv) lung cancer versus cervical cancer as well as for three-group classification: normal versus cervical cancer versus lung cancer. In general, performance for two-group classification was high whereas three-group classification was more challenging, with all three methods predicting normal samples more accurately than cancer samples. Moreover, specificity of the PM method was mostly higher or the same as KNN and DTW-KNN with lower sensitivity. The performance of KNN and DTW-KNN decreased with the inclusion of demographic data, whereas similar performance was observed for the PM which could be explained by the fact that the PM uses fewer parameters as compared to KNN and DTW-KNN methods and is thus less susceptible to the risk of overfitting. More importantly the accuracy of the PM can be increased by using a greater number of quantile data points and by the inclusion of additional demographic and clinical data, providing a substantial advantage over KNN and DTW-KNN methods."

It is widely distributed in different geographical regions worldwide. In China, it has been mainly found in Xinjiang, Gansu, and Tibet in recent years. In addition to causing direct damage to the animal hosts, M. ovinus also carries pathogens and serves as a vector for disease transmission. Border disease virus (BDV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA pestivirus that mainly infects and causes border disease (BD) in sheep and goats worldwide. Since 2012, this disease has been reported in 4 provinces in China. In the present study, we investigated the presence of BDV in M. ovinus from Xinjiang and Gansu. Frozen M. ovinus collected during 2017 and 2018 from Xinjiang and Gansu and preserved in our laboratory were studied. First, total RNA of M. ovinus was extracted, followed by reverse transcription, PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of the 5'-UTR of BDV, and sequencing of the amplified products. Finally, the sequencing results were analyzed using DNAStar, MEGA 5.0 molecular biology software, and the BLAST online platform. The results from RT-PCR and sequencing analyses showed that among the samples included in the study, only the M. ovinus collected from Qinghe County in Alta, Xinjiang in 2018 tested positive for BDV. BLAST analysis showed that the viral strain with the most similar nucleotide identity to the sequence of the China/BDV/2018 fragment was the goat-derived BDV strain AH12-02 collected in Anhui, China, in 2012. A phylogenetic-tree analysis showed the strain to exhibit a BDV-3 genotype.

Mutations in nuclear envelopes, emerin (Emd) and lamin A/C (Lmna) genes, cause clinically indistinguishable myopathy called Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Several murine models for EDMD have been generated; however, emerin-null (Emd) mice do not show obvious skeletal and cardiac muscle phenotypes, and Lmna H222P/H222P mutant (H222P) mice show only a mild phenotype in skeletal muscle when they already have severe cardiomyopathy. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanism of muscle involvement due to nuclear abnormalities is still unclarified. We generated double mutant (Emd-/-/LmnaH222P/H222P; EH) mice to characterize dystrophic changes and to elucidate interactions between emerin and lamin A/C in skeletal and cardiac muscles. As H222P mice, EH mice grow normally and have breeding productivity. EH mice showed severer muscle involvement compared with that of H222P mice which was an independent of cardiac abnormality at 12 weeks of age. Nuclear abnormalities, reduced muscle fiber size and increased fibrosis were prominent in EH mice. Roles of emerin and lamin A/C in satellite cells function and regeneration of muscle fiber were also evaluated by cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury. Delayed increases in myog and myh3 expression were seen in both H222P and EH mice; however, the expression levels of those genes were similar with control and regenerated muscle fiber size was not different at day 7 after injury. These results indicate that EH mouse is a suitable model for studying skeletal muscle involvement, independent of cardiac function, in laminopathies and an interaction between emerin and lamin A/C in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2969507528,"Risks associated with drought are increasing and are a global problem. Therefore, there is a need for new solutions for the safe production of food, while maintaining respect for the environment. Fungicides are designed to protect maize plants against disease, but some of the active substances used in preparations can also promote plant growth, which is known as the ‘physiological effect’. However, there is a paucity of information as to how some of the ‘new generation’ fungicides act in stimulating grain yield in plants under abiotic stress, especially drought. Therefore, the effects of these products on conventional and stay-green maize varieties need to be better understood in order to reduce losses caused by droughts and to maximize production. In this study, the effect of a pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole fungicide preparation on maize plants was evaluated at different times after spraying; during induced drought conditions and again during the regeneration process of the plants. The preparation was applied to ‘KWS 1325’ (conventional) and ‘Ambrosini’ (stay-green) varieties at the recommended dose, three times in greenhouse conditions. Plant gas exchange, plant water use efficiency, chlorophyll fluorescence and fresh and dry plant biomass were evaluated. The pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole preparation increased stomatal conductance and photosynthesis intensity in the ‘Ambrosini’ plants. When maintained under a high light intensity, the variety used increased efficiency and exchanged excessive energy in the form of thermal energy to protect the maize leaf from light-induced damage under drought stress. Plant photosynthetic efficiency (ETR and Yield parameters) during drought stress and after regeneration was significantly higher in treated plants than in the controls. Thus, the beneficial effects on the physiology of the maize varieties grown under drought stress from the fungicide application are significant for farmers and growers."
https://openalex.org/W2969630560,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory RNAs around 21–25 nucleotides in length which govern many aspects of immunity including the host innate and adaptive responses to infection. RT-qPCR studies of select microRNAs show that vaccination alters the expression circulating microRNAs but the effect of vaccination on the global microRNA population (i.e. micronome) has never been studied. Aim To describe vaccine associated changes in the expression of microRNAs 21 days after vaccination in children receiving a pandemic influenza (H1N1) vaccination. Method Serum samples were obtained from children aged 6 months to 12 years enrolled in an open label randomised control trial of two pandemic influenza (H1N1) vaccines, in which participants received either ASO3B adjuvanted split virion or a whole virion non-adjuvanted vaccine. MicroRNA expression was profiled in a discovery cohort of participants prior to, and 21 days after vaccination using an Agilent microarray platform. Findings were followed up by RT-qPCR in the original discovery cohort and then in a validation cohort of participants taken from the same study. Results 44 samples from 22 children were assayed in a discovery cohort. The microarray results revealed 19 microRNAs were differentially expressed after vaccination after adjustment for multiple testing. The microarray detected ubiquitous expression of several microRNAs which could not be validated by RT-qPCR, many of which have little evidence of existence in publicly available RNA sequencing data. Real time PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed downregulation of miR-142-3p in the discovery cohort. These findings were not replicated in the subsequent validation cohort (n = 22). Conclusion This study is the first study to profile microRNA expression after vaccination. An important feature of this study is many of the differentially expressed microRNAs could not be detected and validated by RT-qPCR. This study highlights the care that should be taken when interpreting omics biomarker discovery, highlighting the need for supplementary methods to validate microRNA microarray findings, and emphasises the importance of validation cohorts. Data from similar studies which do not meet these requirements should be interpreted with caution."

In this study, we present a binocular and portable vision simulator, based on temporal multiplexing of two synchronized tunable lenses allowing see-through and programmable visual simulations of presbyopic corrections. Seventeen binocular corrections were tested: 3 Monofocal (Far, Intermediate, Near), 4 Simultaneous Vision (bifocal, trifocal), 2 Monovision (far and near in either eye) and 8 Modified Monovision corrections (Simultaneous vision in one eye, Monofocal in the other eye). Perceived visual quality was assessed through the simulated corrections in 8 cyclopleged subjects who viewed a composite realistic visual scene with high contrast letters and a landscape at far (4 m) and a high contrast text at intermediate (66 cm) and near (33 cm) distances. Perceptual scores were obtained on a scale of 0 to 5 (low to high perceived quality). Perceptual preference was assessed by judging 36 random image pairs (6 repetitions) viewed through 9 binocular presbyopic corrections using two-interval forced choice procedures. The average score, across far and near distances, was the highest for Monovision (4.4±0.3), followed by Modified Monovision (3.4±0.1), Simultaneous Vision (3.0±0.1) and Monofocal corrections (2.9±0.2). However, the mean difference between far and near was lower for Simultaneous Vision and Monovision (0.4±0.1 PS) than Modified Monovision (1.8±0.7) or monofocal corrections (3.3±1.5). A strong significant correlation was found between the perceptual scores and the percentages of energy in focus, for each correction and distance (R = 0.64, p<0.0001). Multivariate ANOVA revealed significant influence of observation distances (p<10-9) and patients (p = 0.01) on Perceptual Score. In conclusion, we have developed a binocular portable vision simulator that can simulate rapidly and non-invasively different combinations of presbyopic corrections. This tool has applications in systematic clinical evaluation of presbyopia corrections."

This is similar to a mean microbial C concentration of 31.8 mg g-1 DM, which is the sum of bacterial C and fungal C, estimated by cell-wall derived muramic acid (MurN) and fungal glucosamine (GlcN), respectively. However, the response of these two approaches to the feeding regime was contradictory, due to feeding effects on the conversion values. The higher neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) concentrations in the non-lactating group led to higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of cellulose and lignin in their faeces in comparison with the lactating cows. This change in faecal chemical composition in the non-lactating group was accompanied by usually higher ratios of G+/G- phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), ergosterol/MBC and fungal C/bacterial C. Although bacteria dominate the faecal microbial biomass, fungi contribute a considerable mean percentage of roughly 20% to the faecal microbiome, according to PLFA and amino sugar data, which requires more attention in the future. Near-infra red spectroscopic estimates of organic N and C fractions of cow faeces were able to model microbial biomarkers successfully, which might be useful in the future to predict its N2O emission potential and fertilizer value."
https://openalex.org/W2969934676,"In the ultimatum game (UG), mid-value offers are unfair but not so unreasonable as to be rejected immediately. As a consequence, they are difficult for responders to evaluate because of the conflict that arises between two key processes, namely inequity aversion and self-interests. Since there is no clear consensus in the literature on event-related potential (ERP) as to how mid-value offers are processed, we designed an experiment to explore how the ability to reject offers influences key ERP signatures. By manipulating the right to reject offers based on game type (ultimatum game, UG or dictator game, DG), our study explored how ERPs were influenced by three types of offers available to participants (fair, unfair and mid-value). We recorded the electroencephalogram results of 28 participants while they responded to the three kinds of offers in the UG and the DG. We observed that mid-value offers in the UG elicited more negative feedback-related negativity and N400 than did the unfair offers. However, these ERP patterns were specific to the UG. Furthermore, we interpreted these results as further electrophysiological evidence of the interaction between the two processing systems during the UG."
https://openalex.org/W2969939150,"Several laboratories have created rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cell lines stably transfected with the human high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRIH). More recently, humanized RBL cell lines saw the introduction of reporter genes such as luciferase (RS-ATL8) and DsRed (RBL NFAT-DsRed). These reporters are more sensitive than their parental non-reporter humanized RBL cell lines. However, no studies so far have addressed the levels of FcεRIH surface expression on humanized RBL cell lines. This is a critical parameter, as it determines the ability of these cells to be efficiently sensitized with human IgE, hence it should affect the sensitivity of the cell assay-a critical parameter for any diagnostic application. Our purpose was to assess and compare the levels of expression of the transfected FcεRIH chain in humanized RBL cell lines. We compared surface levels of FcεRIαH by flow cytometry, using a fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibody (CRA-1/AER-37) and determined receptor numbers using calibration microspheres. FcεRIαH copy numbers were assessed by qPCR, and the sequence verified. Transfection with FcεRIγH cDNA was assessed for its ability to increase FcεRIαH expression in the NFAT-DsRed reporter. While both SX-38 and RS-ATL8 expressed about 500.000 receptors/cell, RBL 703-21 and NFAT-DsRed had approximately 10- to 30-fold lower FcεRIαH expression, respectively. This was neither related to FcεRIH gene copy numbers, nor to differences in steady state mRNA levels, as determined by qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively. Instead, FcεRIαH surface expression appeared to correlate with the co-expression of FcεRIγH. Stable transfection of NFAT-DsRed cells with pBJ1 neo-huFcεRI gamma, which constitutively expresses FcεRIγH, increased FcεRIαH chain expression levels. Levels of FcεRIαH surface expression vary greatly between humanized RBL reporter cell lines. This difference will affect the sensitivity of the reporter system when used for diagnostic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2969412040,"Gastrin is a peptide hormone, which in combination with other factors such as TGFα, EGF or GLP-1, is capable of increasing beta cell mass and lowering blood glucose levels in adult diabetic mice. In humans, administration of a bolus of gastrin alone induces insulin secretion suggesting that gastrin may target islet cells. However, whether gastrin alone is sufficient to exert an effect on isolated human islets has been controversial and the mechanism remained poorly understood. Therefore, in this study we started to examine the effects of gastrin alone on cultured adult human islets. Treatment of isolated human islets with gastrin I for 48 h resulted in increased expression of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin transcripts. These increases were significantly correlated with the levels of donor hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) but not BMI or age. In addition, gastrin treatment resulted in increased expression of PDX1, NKX6.1, NKX2.2, MNX1 and HHEX in islets from donors with HbA1c greater than 42 mmol/mol. The addition of YM022, an antagonist of the gastrin receptor cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR), together with gastrin eliminated these effects, verifying that the effects of gastrin are mediated through CCKBR.CCKBR is expressed in somatostatin-expressing delta cells in islets from all donors. However, in the islets from donors with higher HbA1c (greater than 42 mmol/mol [6.0%]), cells triple-positive for CCKBR, somatostatin and insulin were detected, suggesting a de-differentiation or trans-differentiation of endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate a direct effect of gastrin on human islets from prediabetic or diabetic individuals that is mediated through CCKBR+ cells. Further, our data imply that gastrin may be a potential treatment for diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2969570678,"Human-wildlife conflicts often centre on economic loss caused by wildlife. Yet despite being a major issue for land-managers, estimating total prey losses to predation can be difficult. Estimating impacts of protected wildlife on economically important prey can also help management decisions to be evidence-led. The recovery in population and range of common buzzards Buteo buteo in Britain has brought them into conflict with some gamebird interests. However, the magnitude of any impact is poorly understood. We used bioenergetics models that combine measures of buzzard abundance from field surveys with diets assessed by using cameras at nests, prey remains and pellet analysis, to estimate their impact on red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica on a large (115 km2) moor managed for red grouse shooting in Scotland. Whilst grouse consumption by individual buzzards was lower than previous estimates for other raptor species present on our study site, total consumption could be greater given an estimated 55-73 buzzards were present on the study site year-round. Averaging across diet assessment methods, consumption models estimated that during each of three breeding seasons (April-July 2011-2013), the buzzards foraging on our study site consumed 73-141 adult grouse and 77-185 chicks (depending on year). This represented 5-11% of adult grouse present in April (22-67% of estimated adult mortality) and 2-5% of chicks that hatched (3-9% of estimated chick mortality). During two non-breeding seasons (August-March), consumption models using pellet analysis estimated that buzzards ate a total of 242-400 grouse, equivalent to 7-11% of those present at the start of August and 14-33% of estimated grouse mortality during the non-breeding season. Buzzard consumption of grouse has the potential to lead to non-trivial economic loss to grouse managers, but only if buzzards predated the grouse they ate, and if grouse mortality is additive to other causes."
https://openalex.org/W2969654950,"Background The quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) has proven to be a reliable method for detection of common fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. However, there are some technical shortcomings, such as uncertainty of aneuploidy determination when the short tandem repeats (STR) height ratio is unusual due to a large size difference between alleles or failure due to the presence of maternal cell contamination (MCC). The aim of our study is to facilitate the implementation of the QF-PCR as a rapid diagnostic test for common fetal aneuploidies. Methods Here, we describe an in-house one-tube multiplex QF-PCR method including 20 PCR markers (15 STR markers and 5 fixed size) for rapid prenatal diagnosis of chromosome 13, 18, 21, X and Y aneuploidies. In order to improve the aneuploidy classification of a given diallelic STR marker, we have employed a multilevel logistic regression analysis using ""height-ratio"" and ""allele-size-difference"" as fixed effects and ""marker"" as a random effect. We employed two regression models, one for the 2:1 height ratio (n = 48 genotypes) and another for the 1:2 height ratio (n = 41 genotypes) of the trisomic diallelic markers while using the same 9015 genotypes with normal 1:1 height ratio in both models. Furthermore, we have described a simple procedure for the treatment of the MCC, prior DNA isolation and QF-PCR analysis. Results For both models, we have achieved 100% specificity for the marker aneuploidy classification as compared to 98.60% (2:1 ratio) and 98.04% (1:2 ratio) specificity when using only the height ratio for classification. Treatment of the MCC enables a successful diagnosis rate of 76% among truly contaminated amniotic fluids. Conclusions Adjustment for the allele size difference and marker type improves the STR aneuploidy classification, which, complemented with appropriate treatment of contaminated amniotic fluids, eliminates sample re-testing and reinforces the robustness of the QF-PCR method for prenatal testing."
https://openalex.org/W2969297401,"Nanometre-scale observation of specimens in water is indispensable in several scientific fields, such as biology, chemistry, materials science and nanotechnology. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) obtains high-resolution images of biological samples under high vacuum conditions but requires specific sample-preparation protocols. Observations of unstained biological samples in water require more convenient and less invasive methods. Herein, we have developed a new type of impedance microscopy, namely impedance SEM (IP-SEM), which allows the imaging and sub-micrometer scale examination of various specimens in water. By varying the frequency of the input signal, the proposed system can detect the impedance properties of the sample’s composition at sub-micrometer scale resolution. Besides examining various unstained biological specimens and material samples in water. Furthermore, the proposed system can be used for diverse liquid samples across a broad range of scientific fields, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes and organic and catalytic materials."
https://openalex.org/W2969682977,"A series of experiments were conducted to characterize a novel restorative material. We explored the effect on biological, physical and chemical properties of glass ionomer cement (GIC) adding-the naturally occurring tt-farnesol (900 mM). Two groups were accomplished for all assays: GIC+tt-farnesol and GIC (control). Biological assays: 1) agar diffusion against some cariogenic bacteria; 2) S. mutans biofilm formation and confocal laser scanning microscopy-CLSM. 3) gtfB, gtfC, gtfD, gbpB, vicR, and covR expression; 4) MTT and microscopic morphology. Physical properties assays: 1) roughness; 2) hardness; 3) compressive strength and 4) diametral tensile strength. Chemical assay: Raman spectroscopy. The adding of tt-farnesol to GIC led to larger zones of inhibition (p<0.05), biofilms with a short-term reduction in bacterial viability but similar biomass (p>0.05). Polysaccharides levels increased over time, similarly over groups (p>0.05). Viable and non-viable S. mutans were seen on the specimens' surface by CLSM but their virulence was not modulated by tt-farnesol. The tt-farnesol increased the HaCaT cell viability without impact on compressive and diametral tensile strength and roughness although the hardness was positively affected (p<0.05). Raman confirmed the presence of tt-farnesol. The incorporation of tt-farnesol into GIC inhibited the growth of cariogenic bacteria but had a little effect on the composition, structure and physiology of the biofilm matrices. Also, the tt-farnesol increased the hardness and the biocompatibility of the GIC, not influencing negatively other physical properties of the restorative material."
https://openalex.org/W2969852014,"Methamphetamine (METH), a commonly abused drug, elevates extracellular dopamine (DA) levels by inducing DA efflux through the DA transporter (DAT). Emerging evidence in rodent models suggests that locomotor responses to a novel inescapable open field may predict behavioral responses to abused drugs; METH produces more potent stimulant effects in high responders to novelty than in low responders. We herein found that mice deficient in protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (Ptprz-KO) exhibited an enhanced behavioral response to novelty; however, METH-induced hyperlocomotion was significantly lower in Ptprz-KO than in wild-type mice when METH was administered at a non-toxic dose of 1 mg per kg body weight (bdw). Single-cell RT-PCR revealed that the majority of midbrain DA neurons expressed PTPRZ. No histological alterations were observed in the mesolimbic or nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways in Ptprz-KO brains; however, a significant decrease was noted in brain DA turnover, suggesting functional alterations. In vivo microdialysis experiments revealed that METH-evoked DA release in the nucleus accumbens was significantly lower in Ptprz-KO mice than in wild-type mice. Consistent with this result, Ptprz-KO mice showed significantly fewer cell surface DAT as well as weaker DA uptake activity in striatal synaptosomes prepared 1 hr after the administration of METH than wild-type mice, while no significant differences were observed in the two groups treated with saline. These results indicate that the high response phenotype of Ptprz-KO mice to novelty may not be simply attributed to hyper-dopaminergic activity, and that deficits in PTPRZ reduce the effects of METH by reducing DAT activity."
https://openalex.org/W2969364391,"A promising strategy for the enhancement of vaccine-mediated immune responses is by directly targeting protein antigens to immune cells. Targeting of antigens to the dendritic cell (DC) molecule Clec9A has been shown to enhance antibody affinity and titers for model antigens, and influenza and enterovirus antigens, and may be advantageous for immunogens that otherwise fail to elicit antibodies with sufficient titers and breadth for broad protection, such as the envelope protein (Env) of HIV. Previously employed targeting strategies often utilize receptor-specific antibodies, however it is impractical to conjugate a bivalent IgG antibody to oligomeric antigens, including HIV Env trimers. Here we designed single chain variable fragment (scFv) and single chain Fab (scFab) constructs of a Clec9A-targeting antibody, expressed as genetically fused conjugates with the soluble ectodomain of Env, gp140. This conjugation did not affect the presentation of Env neutralising antibody epitopes. The scFab moiety was shown to be more stable than scFv, and in the context of gp140 fusions, was able to mediate better binding to recombinant and cell surface-expressed Clec9A, although the level of binding to cell-surface Clec9A was lower than that of the anti-Clec9A IgG. However, binding to Clec9A on the surface of DCs was not detected. Mouse immunization experiments suggested that the Clec9A-binding activity of the scFab-gp140 conjugate was insufficient to enhance Env-specific antibody responses. This is an important first proof of principle study demonstrating the conjugation of a scFab to an oligomeric protein antigen, and that an scFab displays better antigen binding than the corresponding scFv. Future developments of this technique that increase the scFab affinity will provide a valuable means to target oligomeric proteins to cell surface antigens of interest, improving vaccine-generated immune responses."
