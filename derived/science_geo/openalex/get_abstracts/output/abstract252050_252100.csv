https://openalex.org/W1982268890,"Phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PC), is an important constituent of biological membranes. It is also the major component of serum lipoproteins and pulmonary surfactant. In the remodeling pathway of PC biosynthesis, 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LPC) is converted to PC by acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT, EC 2.3.1.23). Whereas LPCAT activity has been detected in several tissues, the structure and detailed biochemical information on the enzyme have not yet been reported. Here, we present the cloning and characterization of a cDNA for mouse lung-type LPCAT (LPCAT1). The cDNA encodes an enzyme of 60 kDa, with three putative transmembrane domains. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, mouse LPCAT1 exhibited Ca2+-independent activity with a pH optimum between 7.4 and 10. LPCAT1 demonstrated a clear preference for saturated fatty acyl-CoAs, and 1-myristoyl- or 1-palmitoyl-LPC as acyl donors and acceptors, respectively. Furthermore, the enzyme was predominantly expressed in the lung, in particular in alveolar type II cells. Thus, the enzyme might synthesize phosphatidylcholine in pulmonary surfactant and play a pivotal role in respiratory physiology.

PC is formed from diacylglycerol by a de novo pathway that was originally described by Kennedy in 1961 (1.Kennedy E.P. Fed. Proc. 1961; 20: 934-940PubMed Google Scholar). PC can also be generated by LPC remodeling. The rapid turnover of the sn-2 acyl moiety of glycerophospholipids was described by Lands (Lands' cycle) (2.Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Lands W.E. Merkl I. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 898-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Merkl I. Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 905-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is attributed to activation of phospholipase A2s and lysophospholipid acyltransferases. Although these metabolic processes are carried out in a variety of different tissues, the enzyme molecule(s) involved in LPC remodeling have not been identified. We previously cloned 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid, LPA) acyltransferase (LPAAT), and found that the enzyme used LPA as an acceptor (5.Kume K. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas the recombinant enzyme utilized various fatty acyl-CoAs as acyl donors, no other lysophospholipid served as an acceptor. Several lysophospholipid acyltransferases have been cloned in the last decade (6.Lightner V.A. Bell R.M. Modrich P. J. Biol.

However, LPCAT, the most important enzyme in membrane biogenesis and surfactant production, has not yet been isolated. Using previously proposed acyltransferase motifs (27.Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and an extensive genomic data base search as well as 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we identified a candidate Lpcat gene. The enzyme was highly expressed in the lung, in particular in alveolar type II cells, and it possessed a catalytic preference for the production of di-saturated PC. Thus, we propose that this enzyme plays a critical role in the production of surfactant lipids. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of a cDNA for LPCAT, a critically important enzyme in the biogenesis of membrane phospholipids and surfactant lipids. We termed the enzyme LPCAT1. [1-14C]Palmitoyl-CoA (2.22 GBq/mmol), [1-14C]palmitoyl-LPC (2.07 GBq/mmol), and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Four amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, M2 and M5 anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and linoleoyl-CoA (C18:2) were purchased from Sigma. A proteinase inhibitor mixture, Complete, was from Roche. TLC silica gel plates (type 5721) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG, LysoTracker Red DND-99, and MitoTracker Red CMXRos were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). An anti-calnexin antibody was from BD Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan). Various lysophospholipids and acyl-CoAs were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The mouse lysophospholipid acyltransferase gene was identified based upon sequence similarity to the C terminus of the Lpaatζ gene through a comprehensive BLAST search. A 1.6-kb cDNA clone encoding the full-length mouse Lpcat1 (LPCAT1, DDBJ accession number AB244717) was cloned by PCR amplification using the forward primer 5′-CTAGCTAGCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGAGGCTGCGGGGCCGCGGGCCGCGG-3′, the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTAGTCCGCTTTCTTACAAGAATTC-3′, and a mouse spleen cDNA library as a template. The FLAG epitope (DYKD-DDDK) was attached to the N terminus of mLpcat1 using PCR, and a forward primer that encoded the FLAG sequence inframe with the start codon of the mLpcat1 coding region. Amplification was carried out for 5 cycles of 96 °C for 15 s, 40 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 1.75 min, followed by 30 cycles of 96 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 1.75 min. Amplified PCR products were cloned into the pCXN2.1 vector (28.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Similarly, human and rat LPCAT1 cDNAs (DDBJ accession numbers AB244719 and AB244983, respectively) were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pCXN2.1 vector. Mouse total RNA was prepared from various tissues using Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA), and first strand cDNAs were synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan). PCR were carried out in microcapillary tubes, in 20-μl reaction volumes consisting of 2 μl of cDNA solution, 1× FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science), and 0.5 μm each of the forward and reverse primer. A 163-bp fragment of mLpcat1 or rat Lpcat1 was generated using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GTGCACGAGCTGCGACT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCTGCTCTGGCTCCTTATCA-3′. A 227-bp fragment of rat surfactant protein-C was generated using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-CTCCACTGGCATCGTTCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTCGCCCAGAAGAATCAG-3′. FLAG-tagged mLpcat1 was constructed by ligating the FLAG-tagged cDNA (as described above) into the NheI-XhoI site of pCXN2.1. DNA transfection of CHO-K1 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. CHO-K1 cells were seeded onto 6-cm dishes at a density of 8 × 105 cells/dish 1 day before transfection. Six μg each of pCXN2.1 vector or FLAG-mLpcat1-pCXN2.1 were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h post-transfection, pCXN2.1 vector- or FLAG-mLPCAT1-pCXN2.1-transfected cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml DiOC6(3) (Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml M5 anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in 1/4× Permeabilization Buffer (Beckman). After washing, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (Eugene, OR) for 30 min. pEGFP-C1 vector- or pEGFP-mLP-CAT1-transfected cells were stained with 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos or 50 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed with an LSM510 Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a 63× water-immersion objective lens (NA = 1.2). FLAG-mLPCAT1, MitoTracker Red, and LysoTracker Red were monitored by excitation at 543 nm with a He/Ne laser, and by emission with a 585-nm long path filter. For the detection of DiOC6(3) and GFP fluorescence, the excitation was at 488 nm with an argon laser, and emissions were taken with a 505–550-nm band pass filter. One μg of total cellular protein was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk, incubated with M2 anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody, washed, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, the membranes were exposed to ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize immunoreactive proteins. 7 μg of total cellular protein was analyzed by Western blot using an anticalnexin antibody as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker. For the preparation of cell extracts, cells in 10-cm dishes were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm sucrose, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture, Complete, then sonicated three times on ice for 30 s. After centrifugations for 10 min at 800 and 9,000 × g, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (29.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using a protein assay solution (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid-free, Sigma) as a standard. The acyltransferase activity was measured in two ways: (i) conversion of [1-14C]palmitoyl-LPC (293 MBq/mmol) to PC in the presence of acyl-CoA and (ii) the transfer of [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (293 MBq/mmol) to lysophospholipids to form phospholipids. Reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PC, the indicated concentrations of acyl-CoA and lysophospholipid, and enzyme in a total volume of 0.1 ml. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.3 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v). Total lipid was extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (30.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar), and subsequently analyzed by TLC in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid: water (50:25:8:4, v/v). Bands at positions corresponding to the expected product were visualized by I2 vapor, cut off the plate, placed in Microscinti-O (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter LS6500 (Beckman). Cells were isolated by the method of Dobbs and Mason (31.Dobbs L.G. Mason R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 63: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In brief, 6–8-week-old Sprague-Dawley (200–250 g body weight) rats were injected intraperitoneally with heparin and pentobarbital. The heart-lung preparation was perfused with buffer A consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm sodium potassium phosphate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mg/ml glucose, and 10 mg/ml gentamycin. The lungs were removed en block from the thoracic cavity and washed five times with buffer A. Lavage fluids were collected and centrifuged to obtain alveolar macrophages, which were used as a negative control in these experiments. After washing, a fluorocarbon (Sumitomo 3M, Tokyo, Japan)-albumin emulsion was injected intratracheally, and the lung was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. This step facilitated the separation of alveolar macrophages from alveolar type II cells. After extensive washing with buffer containing 2 mm EGTA, the lung was injected intratracheally with about 40 ml of elastase solution (porcine pancreas elastase, 4.3 units/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). The lung was minced into 1-mm3 pieces, shaken vigorously during incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, and cells released from the lung were recovered through nylon gauzes. Type II alveolar epithelial cells were isolated from the upper layer of a metrizamide density gradient, washed with buffer A containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 1.3 mm MgSO4, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The fraction contained >90% alveolar type II cells. These cells were quickly frozen, and subsequently used for RT-PCR or enzymatic analyses. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Alveolar type II cells freshly isolated from rat lungs were seeded on aclar film (Nisshin EM, Tokyo, Japan) and incubated overnight. The cells were then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After a brief wash with the same buffer, postfixation with 1% OsO–4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer was carried out for 2 h, followed by gradual dehydration with ethanol. The cells were embedded in Epon. Thin serial sections (90-nm thickness) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The samples were examined at 100 kV with a HITACHI H-7100s (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan). Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy—2 × 106 rat alveolar type II cells were seeded on a 35-mm glass-bottomed dish (IWAKI) and incubated overnight. The cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and mounted into a CO2 incubator placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510 system) 30 min before the observation. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for animal research at The University of Tokyo and were approved by The University of Tokyo Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments. Identification and Cloning of LPCAT1—The mouse Lpcat1 gene was identified based upon sequence homology with previously reported lysophospholipid acyltransferases, including a putative mouse Lpaatζ gene. A 1.6-kb cDNA clone encoding the full-length mouse LPCAT1 enzyme was obtained by PCR amplification. The putative open reading frame of mLPCAT1 encoded a 534-amino acid protein of 59.8 kDa, containing three transmembrane domains and several conserved motifs found in members of the lysophospholipid acyltransferase family (5.Kume K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The presence of a C-terminal sequence motif (KKXX) indicated that the enzyme localizes to the ER (32.Shikano S. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5783-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). mLPCAT1 exhibited 88.2 and 98.1% amino acid sequence identity to human and rat LPCAT1, respectively (Fig. 1). The protein contained a putative EF-hand-like motif (from amino acids 380 to 480) (33.Maki M. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Ohkouchi S. Shibata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but we found no obvious Ca2+ requirement for catalytic activity (see below). Tissue Distribution of mLPCAT1 mRNA—The tissue distribution of mLpcat1 was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We found the highest level of mLpcat1 expression in the lung, followed by spleen and brain. Other tissues had very low expression levels of mLpcat1 (Fig. 2). Subcellular Localization of FLAG- or EGFP-mLPCAT1—To facilitate immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis of mLPCAT1, we constructed a fusion protein of mLPCAT1 that contained the FLAG or EGFP epitope fused in-frame to the N terminus of mLPCAT1. FLAG- or EGFP-mLpcat1 were transfected into CHO-K1 cells, and the enzyme distribution was examined by confocal microscopy after 48 h. Both FLAG- and EGFP-mLPCAT1 exhibited significant enzyme activities (data not shown). Cells were stained for ER-Golgi, mitochondria, and lysosome using DiOC6(3), MitoTracker Red, and LysoTracker Red, respectively. Whereas the subcellular distribution pattern of FLAG-mLPCAT1 was similar to that of DiOC6(3), EGFP-mLPCAT1 was not co-localized with MitoTracker Red or LysoTracker Red, suggesting that the enzyme is present mainly in the ER and Golgi (Fig. 3A). To confirm the results of microscopic observations, CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-mLPCAT1 were homogenized, and different subcellular fractions were collected by centrifugation. When these fractions were analyzed by Western blot using the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3B), the enzyme was found mostly in a 100,000 × g pellet, consistent with the confocal microscopic data (Fig. 3A). FLAG-mLPCAT1 had an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa, a value consistent with the molecular weight predicted from the open reading frame of mLPCAT1 (Fig. 3B). FLAG-mLPCAT1 was also detected in a 9,000 × g pellet. According to Western blot analysis using anti-calnexin antibody as an ER maker, this fraction contained ER protein to a small extent (Fig. 3B). Kinetics of mLPCAT1 Expressed in CHO-K1 Cells—We next examined the acyltransferase activity of mLPCAT1 using 1-palmitoyl-LPC and palmitoyl-CoA. The reaction was linear for the first few minutes at 30 °C (data not shown). The pH optimum for the reaction was between 7.4 and 10, and the reaction did not require Ca2+ (data not shown). Src homology-reducing reagents also had no effect on enzymatic activity (data not shown). Kinetic analysis was carried out by measuring acyltransferase activity in the microsomal fraction (100,000 × g pellet) derived from vector- or mLPCAT1-transfected CHO-K1 cells, using increasing concentrations (0–200 μm) of palmitoyl-CoA in the presence of 50 μm [1-14C]palmitoyl-LPC, or increasing concentrations (0–100 μm) of 1-palmitoyl-LPC in the presence of 25 μm [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 4, A and B). The apparent Km values of mLPCAT1 for palmitoyl-CoA and 1-palmitoyl-LPC were 3.0 and 2.3 μm, respectively. At higher concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA, enzymatic activity appeared to be inhibited, possibly due to a detergent effect. Thus, the mLPCAT1 cDNA, when expressed in CHO-K1 cells, conferred significant LPCAT activity, using palmitoyl-CoA and 1-palmitoyl-LPC as substrates. Substrate Selectivity of mLPCAT1—Using [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA as an acyl donor, we analyzed the substrate specificity of mLPCAT1 using a variety of lysophospholipid acceptors (Fig. 5A). The microsomal fraction from CHO-K1 cells transfected with mLPCAT1 had detectable LPCAT activity in the presence of 1-acyl-LPC (Fig. 5A). 1-O-Alkyl-LPC, 1-O-alkenyl-LPC, and 1-acyl-LPG also served as acyl acceptors (supplemental figure). There also appeared to be endogenous acyltransferase activity toward 1-acyl-LPA and 1-acyl-LPC in CHO-K1 cells (open bars in Fig. 5A). Next, we examined the preference of mLPCAT1 for various acceptor acyl groups at the sn-1 position of LPC, using [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA as an acyl donor. As seen in Fig. 5B, mLPCAT1 recognized medium to long chain LPCs (C14:0 > C16:0 > C18:1 > C12:0, C18:0) as substrates. We then examined the acyl-CoA selectivity of mLPCAT1 using [1-14C]palmitoyl-LPC as an acceptor (Fig. 5C). mLP-CAT1 demonstrated a clear preference for medium to long chain and saturated fatty acyl-CoAs (C10:0 > C8:0, C12:0 > C6:0, C14:0, C16:0). In addition, there was significant enzymatic activity toward C18 and C22 unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs (Fig. 5C and supplemental materials Fig. A). In contrast, there was poor activity using short chain (C2 to C4) saturated fatty acyl-CoAs. Note that CHO-K1 cells had significant endogenous LPCAT activity toward long chain unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs (open bars in Fig. 5C). These results suggested that the mLPCAT1 gene encoded an LPC acyltransferase with a preference for saturated acyl-CoAs. Presence of LPCAT1 in Rat Alveolar Type II Cells—The high expression level of Lpcat1 in the mouse lung (Fig. 2), and its catalytic activity in producing both dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), strongly suggested that the enzyme would be present in alveolar type II cells. We isolated alveolar type II cells from the rat lung, because standard procedures for their isolation have been established (34.Mason R.J. Dobbs L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5101-5107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a significant number of cells could be obtained. As shown in supplemental Fig. B, rat alveolar type II cells have typical structures, including intracellular lamellar bodies. Lpcat1 was enriched in this cell type, as determined by both quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6A) and enzyme assays using 1-palmitoyl-LPC and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates (Fig. 6B). Alveolar macrophages, which are another major cellular component of the lung, were obtained by lung lavage. Whereas Lpcat1 was not expressed in these cells (Fig. 6A), they exhibited LPCAT activity (Fig. 6B), possibly due to other types of lysophospholipid acyltransferases. Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of lipids and surfactant proteins secreted from alveolar type II cells (for reviews, see Ref. 35.Veldhuizen R. Nag K. Orgeig S. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 90-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar and 36.Halliday H.L. Biol. Neonate. 2005; 87: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It provides a low surface tension at the air-liquid interface for efficient gas exchange and alveolar stability. Both genetic and acquired deficiencies in pulmonary surfactant cause severe respiratory failure, which is manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, or neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (37.Lewis J.F. Jobe A.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 38.Floros J. Kala P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 365-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Surfactant lipids also serve as binding and entry molecules for non-enveloped adenoviruses during common respiratory infections (39.Balakireva L. Schoehn G. Thouvenin E. Chroboczek J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4858-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, the production of surfactant lipids, especially DPPC, is highly regulated in vivo. Whereas there has been extensive analyses of surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D (38.Floros J. Kala P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 365-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 40.Suwabe A. Mason R.J. Smith D. Firestone J.A. Browning M.D. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), very little information is available on the mechanisms of production of surfactant lipids. Extensive analysis of surfactant composition revealed that there is 40% DPPC, and other PC, and that it contains 10% PG (41.Yu S.H. Possmayer F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 621-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Essentially, three distinct biosynthetic pathways are proposed to contribute to the composition of surfactant: 1) de novo biosynthesis, 2) remodeling by LPC or LPG acyltransferases, and 3) CoA-independent transacylation with 2 molecules of LPC (1.Kennedy E.P. Fed. Proc. 1961; 20: 934-940PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Yamada K. Okuyama H. Arch. Biochem.

In an attempt to understand the relative contribution of each of these three pathways, we have isolated an enzyme that is involved in the production of both PC and PG via the remodeling pathway. By searching the genomic data base using conserved motifs of LPA acyltransferases (27.Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and tafazzins as queries, we identified a cDNA that encoded a protein of 534 amino acid residues, and had a predicted molecular mass of 60 kDa (Figs. 1 and 3B). It contained three motifs, motif 1 (HSSYFD), motif 2 (GTLIQ/RYIR), and motif 3 (PEGTC), that are conserved among three species (Fig. 1), and are possibly involved in catalytic activity. 4T. Harayama, H. Shindou, and T. Shimizu, unpublished data. Using a heterologous overexpression system, we found that the enzyme was predominantly located in the ER-Golgi complex (Fig. 3). Whereas the small amount of mLPCAT1 was found in a 9.000 × g pellet (Fig. 3B), this could be due to the cross-contamination of ER protein in this fraction. In fact, calnexin, an ER maker was observed to the some extent in this fraction (data not shown). Thus, although there appears to be ER-Golgi-specific localization, the exact location of the endogenous protein in native cells remains to be determined. The protein was highly expressed in alveolar type II cells of the rat lung (Fig. 6), and exhibited significant LPCAT activity, with a preference for medium chain (C6 to 14) saturated and long chain unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs (Fig. 5C) in vitro. However, in alveolar type II cells, palmitoyl-CoA constitutes about 40% of all acyl-CoAs, and the medium chain acyl-CoAs are rarely seen in vivo (49.den Breejen J.N. Batenburg J.J. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is significant, because substrate availability determines the molecular species of PC in surfactant. It is interesting to note that mLPCAT1 also used LPG as an acceptor (Fig. 5A), because pulmonary surfactant contains PG, in addition to DPPC (41.Yu S.H. Possmayer F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 621-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the roles of mLPCAT1 in the production of components of surfactant, and in other biological processes awaits gene-targeting studies. It is also important to note that CHO-K1 cells have endogenous LPCAT activity, especially for long chain unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA donors (open bars in Fig. 5C). The identity of the endogenous enzyme(s) responsible for this activity is unknown, but these results point to enzymes involved in the deacylation and reacylation cycle (Lands' cycle) that occurs in various biological membranes (2.Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Lands W.E. Merkl I. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 898-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Merkl I. Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 905-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to elucidate the roles of mLPCAT1 in vivo, and determine its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases involving surfactant dysfunction. Finally, the molecular identification and characterization of the first LPCAT paves the way for a better understanding of the biochemical mechanism underlying phospholipid biosynthesis.

However, the role of PEDF against retinal vascular hyperpermeability remains to be elucidated. We investigated here whether and how PEDF could inhibit the advanced glycation end product (AGE) signaling to vascular hyperpermeability. Intravenous administration of AGEs to normal rats not only increased retinal vascular permeability by stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression but also decreased retinal PEDF levels. Simultaneous treatments with PEDF inhibited the AGE-elicited VEGF-mediated permeability by down-regulating mRNA levels of p22phox and gp91phox, membrane components of NADPH oxidase, and subsequently decreasing retinal levels of an oxidative stress marker, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. PEDF also inhibited the AGE-induced vascular hyperpermeability evaluated by transendothelial electrical resistance by suppressing VEGF expression. Furthermore, PEDF decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in AGE-exposed endothelial cells by suppressing NADPH oxidase activity via down-regulation of mRNA levels of p22PHOX and gp91PHOX. This led to blockade of the AGE-elicited Ras activation and NF-κB-dependent VEGF gene induction in endothelial cells. These results indicate that the central mechanism for PEDF inhibition of the AGE signaling to vascular permeability is by suppression of NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation and subsequent VEGF expression.

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the miserable microvascular complications in diabetes and is a leading cause of acquired blindness among people of occupational age (1.Frank R.N. Ophthalmology. 1991; 98: 586-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Chronic hyperglycemia is a major initiator of diabetic retinopathy. Two recent large prospective clinical studies have shown that intensive blood glucose control reduces microvascular complications among patients with diabetes (2.The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research GroupN. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (22798) Google Scholar, 3.UK Prospective Diabetes Study GroupLancet. 1998; 352: 837-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19019) Google Scholar). However, strict control of hyperglycemia is often difficult to maintain and may increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia in diabetic patients. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target diabetic retinopathy is desired for patients with diabetes. Various hyperglycemia-induced metabolic and hemodynamic derangements have been reported to contribute to the characteristic histopathological changes observed in diabetic retinopathy (4.Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7064) Google Scholar).

Indeed, we, along with others, have previously shown that AGEs could elicit a brisk angiogenic response, at least in part, by inducing autocrine production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is an important mediator in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (16.Yamagishi S.

Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ROS in turn activate the Ras protooncogene and its downstream effectors that are important for both proliferative and differentiative responses. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a glycoprotein that belongs to the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors (20.Tombran-Tink J. Chader C.G. Johnson L.V. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It was first purified from the conditioned media of human retinal pigment epithelial cells as a factor with potent neuronal differentiating activity (20.Tombran-Tink J. Chader C.G. Johnson L.V. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Recently, PEDF has been shown to be a highly effective inhibitor of angiogenesis in cell culture and animal models. PEDF inhibits the growth and migration of cultured endothelial cells (ECs), and it potently suppresses ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization (21.Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E.

PEDF levels in aqueous humor or vitreous are decreased in diabetic patients, especially with proliferative retinopathy (23.Spranger J. Osterhoff M. Reimann M. Mohlig M. Ristow M. Francis M.K.

These observations suggest that the loss of PEDF activity in the eye may contribute to the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, the protective role of PEDF against retinal vascular hyperpermeability, the characteristic feature of early diabetic retinopathy, remains to be elucidated. In this study, we have investigated whether PEDF could inhibit the AGE-induced retinal vascular hyperpermeability and the mechanism by which it might achieve this beneficial effect. Materials—Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), lucigenin, and NADPH were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies (Abs) against rat VEGF were purchased from R & D Systems (Genzyme-Techne, Minneapolis, MN). Protease inhibitor mixtures were from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Purification of PEDF Proteins—PEDF proteins were prepared and purified as described previously (12.Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Amano S. Okamoto T. Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified PEDF proteins revealed a single band with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa, which showed positive reactivity with monoclonal Ab against human PEDF (Transgenic, Kumamoto, Japan). Preparations of AGEs—AGE-bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared as described previously (12.Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Amano S. Okamoto T. Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, BSA (50 mg/ml) was incubated under sterile conditions with 0.1 m d-glyceraldehyde in 0.2 m NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, for 7 days. Then unincorporated sugars were removed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Control nonglycated BSA was incubated in the same conditions except for the absence of reducing sugars. Preparations were tested for endotoxin using Endospecy ES-20S system (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan); no endotoxin was detectable. Preparations of AGE-rich Serum Fractions from Diabetic Patients on Hemodialysis—Serum AGE fractions were obtained from normal volunteers and diabetic patients with hemodialysis (DM-AGEs) as described previously (26.Takeuchi M. Watai T. Sasaki N. Choei H. Iwaki M. Ashizawa T. Inagaki Y. Yamagishi S. Kikuchi S. Riederer P. Saito T. Bucala R. Kameda Y. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ml of serum from each of 4 normal individuals and from 11 type 2 diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis were concentrated by lyophilization and dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water. These solutions were applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (1.5 × 110 cm), which was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and eluted with the same buffer (fraction size, 1.5 ml; flow rate, 10 ml/h) in a cold room. Each fraction was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm, and the AGE concentration of each fraction was measured by a competitive ELISA as described below. Preparations were passed through Zeta-Pore filter to remove endotoxin. No endotoxin was detectable. AGE-rich serum fractions obtained from diabetic patients on hemodialysis and normal volunteers contained 176.1 and 28.5 μg/ml AGEs, respectively. Clinical characteristics of 11 type 2 diabetic patients are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Characteristics of diabetic patients on hemodialysisNo. of patients11 (7 male/4 female)Age (years)51.7 ± 8.6Duration of diabetes (years)22.4 ± 9.1Duration of hemodialysis (months)85.8 ± 56.0Hemoglobin A1c (%)7.74 ± 1.04No. of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy11 Open table in a new tab Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for AGEs—Measurement of AGEs was performed with a competitive ELISA as described previously (27.Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Bucala R. Suzuki T. Koike T. Kameda Y. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 114-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 0.1 μg/ml AGE-BSA. The test samples (50 μl) were then added to each well as a competitor for 50 μl of polyclonal Abs directed against AGE-BSA (1:1000), followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking on a horizontal rotary shaker. After incubating each well with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added as a colorimetric substrate. The plate was then read at 405 nm by using a microplate reader. AGE Treatments of Normal Rats Prepared in Vitro—Nine-week-old normoglycemic Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with 1 mg of AGE-BSA or nonglycated BSA in the presence or absence of 10 μg of PEDF proteins or 10 μgof Abs against rat VEGF every day for up to 10 days. The rats were sacrificed 1–2 h after injection on the final day. This AGE administration increases serum AGE levels by about 2-fold, compared with nonglycated BSA injection (33.4 ± 1.6 versus 18.7 ± 0.5 μg/ml). We have recently found that serum level of AGEs in diabetic rats (Goto-Kakizaki rats at 14 weeks old) was 32.8 ± 7.1 μg/ml. Therefore, the serum AGE concentrations obtained by the AGE injection were comparable with those of diabetic rats. All animal procedures were conducted according to the guidelines provided by the Kurume University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under an approved protocol. Leakage of FITC-conjugated Dextran from Retinal Vasculature—Leakage of FITC-conjugated dextran from retinal vasculature was determined by the method of Stitt et al. (18.Stitt A.W. Bhaduri T. McMullen T. Gardiner T.A. Archer D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized, and then FITC-conjugated dextran (40 kDa, Sigma) was injected into the inferior vena cava. After the tracer was allowed to circulate, the eyes were enucleated and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). The retinas were imaged by a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Quantification of Blood Retinal Barrier (BRB) Breakdown—BRB breakdown quantification was determined by the method of Adamis and co-workers (28.Ishida S. Usui T. Yamashiro K. Kaji Y. Ahmed E. Carrasquillo K.G. Amano S. Hida T. Oguchi Y. Adamis A.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2155-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, after deep anesthesia, the rats received intravenous injection with FITC-conjugated dextran (4.4 kDa, Sigma). After 10–15 min, a blood sample was collected, and each rat was then perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. After perfusion, the retinas were carefully removed, weighed, and homogenized to extract the FITC-conjugated dextran. BRB breakdown was calculated by using Equation 1, retinal FITC−dextran (mg)/retinal weight (g)plasma FITC−dextran concentration (mg/ml)×circulation time (h) (Eq. 1) Effects of AGE-rich Serum Fractions on Retinal Vascular Permeability—Nine-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with AGE-rich serum fractions derived from normal volunteers or diabetic patients with hemodialysis (DM-AGEs) in the presence or absence of 10 μg of PEDF proteins or 77 μg of polyclonal anti-human PEDF Abs. After injection every day for 5 days, the rats were sacrificed, and retinal permeability and BRB breakdown were analyzed. Cells—Human adult skin microvascular ECs were cultured in endothelial basal medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4% bovine brain extracts, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone according to the supplier's instructions (Clonetics Corp., San Diego). AGE treatment was carried out in medium lacking epidermal growth factor and hydrocortisone. Cells at 3–5 passages were used for the experiments. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from ECs or enucleated eyes as described previously (16.Yamagishi S. Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Katsuno K. Sato F. Mita I. Ooka H. Satozawa N. Kawakami T. Nomura M. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8723-8730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using Assay-on-Demand and TaqMan 5 fluorogenic nuclease chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Identifications of primers for human p22PHOX, human gp91PHOX, human VEGF, rat p22phox, rat gp91phox, and rat VEGF genes were Hs00164370_m1, Hs00166163_m1, Hs00173626_m1, Rn00577357_m1, Rn00576710_m1, and Rn00582935_m1, respectively. Immunohistochemistry—Rat eyes were removed and fixed for 1 day in 4% paraformaldehyde. The eyes were then embedded in paraffin wax for sectioning. Five-μm paraffin sections were incubated with polyclonal Abs raised against human PEDF (4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or monoclonal Abs raised against 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) (10 μg/ml; Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Shizuoka, Japan). After exposure to peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-rabbit Abs, the sections were incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) and then counterstained with methyl green for visualizing PEDF or 8-OHdG immunoreactivity. The immunoreactivity was measured with microcomputer-assisted NIH Image. Measurement of Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER)—Effects of PEDF on barrier function of ECs were assessed by measurement of TER using electric cell substrate impedance sensing (Applied Biophysics) according to the method of Becker et al. (29.Becker P.M. Waltenberger J. Yachechko R. Mirzapoiazova T. Sham J.S.K. Lee C.G. Elias J.A. Verin A.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were seeded onto gold microelectrodes (Applied Biophysics) and grown to confluence for 2 days. Cells were washed three times with serum-free endothelial basal medium and then were connected to the impedance sensing system to measure the TER base line. The applied alternating current (1 μA) was clamped so that impedance (resistance) was directly related to changes in voltage, which was measured with a locked-in amplifier. Data from the electrical resistance experiments (ohms) were obtained over the experimental time course at 5-min intervals. Resistance values for each microelectrode were normalized as the ratio of measured resistance to base-line resistance and plotted as a function of time. NADPH Oxidase Assay—ECs were treated with 100 μg/ml AGE-BSA or nonglycated BSA in the presence or absence of 10 nm PEDF for 24 h, and the cells were then suspended in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitor mixtures). NADPH oxidase activity of the cell homogenate was measured by luminescence assay in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, 5 μm lucigenin as the electron acceptor, and 100 μm NADPH as a substrate according to the methods of Griendling et al.

Preparations of Abs Directed against AGE-BSA Prepared in Vitro—Polyclonal Abs directed against in vitro-modified AGE-BSA were prepared as described previously (27.Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Bucala R. Suzuki T. Koike T. Kameda Y. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 114-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the Abs did not cross-react with several structurally identified AGE-modified BSAs, including pyrraline-BSA, pentosidine-BSA, argpyrimidine-BSA, 3-deoxyglucosone imidazolone-BSA, carboxymethyllysine-BSA, carboxyethyllysine-BSA, glyoxal-lysine dimer, or methyglyoxal-lysine dimer (13.Yamagishi S.

Preparations of Antiserum Directed against Receptor for AGEs (RAGE)—Antiserum directed against human RAGE for neutralizing assays, which recognizes the amino acid residues 167–180 of human RAGE protein, was prepared as described previously (31.Sasaki N. Takeuchi M. Chowei H. Kikuchi S. Hayashi Y. Nakano N. Ikeda H. Yamagishi S. Kitamoto T. Saito T. Makita Z. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 326: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS Generation—ECs were treated with various concentrations of AGE-BSA or nonglycated BSA in the presence or absence of 10 nm PEDF, 50 nm DPI, 10 μg/ml Abs directed against AGEs, or 0.1% anti-RAGE serum for 24 h. The intracellular formation of ROS was detected by using the fluorescent probe CM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) as described previously (15.Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Amano S. Okamoto T. Koga K. Takeuchi M. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 464-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Superoxide Generation—ECs were treated with serum AGE fractions in the presence or absence of 10 nm PEDF for 24 h, and the cells were then incubated with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3 μmol/liter dihydroethidium (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). After 30 min, fluorescence intensity was measured, and the cells were imaged by a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Assay for Ras Activation—ECs were treated with 100 μg/ml AGE-BSA or nonglycated BSA in the presence or absence of 10 nm PEDF or 1 mm N-acetylcysteine for 24 h. Ras activity then was measured using a Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of Dominant-negative Mutant Vector—ECs were transiently transfected with a dominant-negative human Ras mutant (DN-Ras) vector or an empty vector (mock) as described previously (17.Okamoto T. Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Amano S. Koga K. Abe R. Takeuchi M. Ohno S. Yoshimura A. Makita Z. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Measurement of NF-κB Activity—ECs were transiently transfected with plasmids containing the NF-κB promoter attached upstream to the luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase activity was measured as described previously (17.Okamoto T. Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Amano S. Koga K. Abe R. Takeuchi M. Ohno S. Yoshimura A. Makita Z. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values were presented as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Scheffe F test was performed for statistical comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Anti-vasopermeability Effects of PEDF in Vivo—We used glyceraldehyde-modified AGE-BSA for the present experiments as we have shown previously that this type of AGE could elicit a brisk angiogenic response by inducing autocrine production of VEGF, also known as a vascular permeability factor (17.Okamoto T. Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Amano S. Koga K. Abe R. Takeuchi M. Ohno S. Yoshimura A. Makita Z. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 32.Duh E. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 33.Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether intravenous administration of in vitro-prepared AGE-BSA to normal rats increased retinal vascular leakage in vivo. As shown in Fig. 1A, AGE-BSA increased retinal vascular permeability compared with nonglycated BSA. BRB function was also disturbed by the treatment with AGEs. The quantitative pooled data of BRB breakdown are shown in Fig. 1B. Moreover, to evaluate the pathophysiological relevance of the experiments using in vitro-prepared AGEs, we studied whether AGE-rich serum fractions derived from diabetic patients on hemodialysis (DM-AGEs) could elicit the same biological response. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, DM-AGEs also increased retinal vascular permeability and induced BRB breakdown. Next, we examined the role of VEGF for the AGE-induced vascular hyperpermeability in two different ways, VEGF gene expression and effects of anti-VEGF Abs. VEGF mRNA levels were increased in the eye of AGE-treated rats (Fig. 1E), whereas anti-VEGF Abs completely suppressed the AGE-induced retinal vascular hyperpermeability (Fig. 1A). These observations indicate the central role of VEGF in the AGE-induced retinal vascular leakage. PEDF is a potent anti-angiogenic factor; it inhibits the VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of ECs (21.Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H.J. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 22.Duh E.J. Yang H.S. Suzuma I. Miyagi M. Youngman E. Mori K. Katai M. Yan L. Suzuma K. West K. Davarya S. Tong P. Gehlbach P. Pearlman J. Crabb J.W. Aiello L.P. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 821-829PubMed Google Scholar). Because VEGF is also known as a vascular permeability factor (32.Duh E. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 33.Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the involvement of PEDF and its therapeutic efficacy in the AGE-induced vascular hyperpermeability. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that administration of AGE-BSA to normal rats decreased expression levels of PEDF in the retina, compared with that of nonglycated BSA; PEDF immunoreactivity in the ganglion cell layer and in the inner plexiform layer of AGE-injected rats was decreased to about 70% that of nonglycated BSA-treated rats (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, simultaneous treatments with PEDF inhibited the up-regulation of VEGF mRNA levels in the eye of AGE-injected rats (Fig. 1E). In addition, PEDF was found to block both the in vitro-prepared AGE-BSA- and DM-AGE-induced retinal vascular hyperpermeability and BRB breakdown (Fig. 1, A–D), and the effects of PEDF were reversed by the treatments with PEDF Abs (Fig. 1C). Taken together, our data indicate that PEDF could block the AGE-induced retinal hyperpermeability and BRB breakdown by suppressing VEGF expression. Because it has been demonstrated that NADPH oxidase plays an important role in the AGE-elicited ROS generation and subsequent gene expression in cultured ECs (34.Wautier M.P. Chappey O. Corda S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Wautier J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E685-E694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we further examined whether intravenous administration of PEDF suppressed the up-regulation of mRNA levels for p22phox and gp91phox, key components of NADPH oxidase with respect to its enzymatic activity (35.Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar), in the eye of AGE-treated rats. AGEs up-regulated mRNA levels of these membrane components of NADPH oxidase in the eye, which was suppressed by PEDF treatments (Fig. 1G). Moreover, immunohistochemistry of 8-OHdG, a sensitive indicator of oxidative damage to DNA, showed intense staining in the nuclei of cells in the inner and outer plexiform layers of AGE-treated retina, which was also blocked by simultaneous PEDF treatments (Fig. 1H). These observations suggest that PEDF could inhibit the AGE-induced retinal vascular hyperpermeability by suppressing VEGF induction via inhibition of NADPH oxidase expression and ROS generation. In addition, the present findings suggest that AGE infusion could down-regulate retinal PEDF levels, at least in part, via oxidative stress generation since we have recently found that AGE-BSA or H2O2 suppresses PEDF gene expression in microvascular ECs and that anti-oxidant N-acetylcys"

From circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, we demonstrate that the major structural elements within D2 consist of two amphipathic α-helices (Helix I and Helix II) separated by a hydrophobic loop. Both helices require a hydrophobic environment for folding, indicating that lipid interactions contribute to their structural integrity. Mutational studies revealed that a combination of Helix I, the hydrophobic loop, and Helix II is essential for efficient lipid droplet association and pointed to an in-plane membrane interaction of the two helices at the phospholipid layer interface. Aside from lipid droplet association, membrane interaction of D2 is necessary for folding and stability of core following maturation at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by signal peptide peptidase. These studies identify critical determinants within a targeting domain that enable trafficking and attachment of a viral protein to lipid droplets.

Lipid droplets (LDs) 3The abbreviations used are: LD, lipid droplet; HCV, hepatitis C virus; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; wt, wild-type; ADRP, adipocyte differentiation-related protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SP, signal peptidase; SPP, signal peptide peptidase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HL, hydrophobic loop. are intracellular storage organelles, composed primarily of a hydrophobic core of cholesterol ester and triacylglycerol, which is bounded by a phospholipid leaflet encased in a layer of proteins (1Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The properties of LDs have attracted considerable interest because of the link between enhanced fat storage and human diseases such as obesity, atheroma, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and cancer. The periphery of LDs has been described as a novel membrane domain (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The most widely studied LD proteins are perilipin, adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP), and the tail-interacting protein, TIP47, collectively known as the PAT protein family (7Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Identification of motifs within PAT proteins that are sufficient for LD association has been elusive, due to redundancy in the sequences necessary for efficient targeting (8Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Nakamura N. Fujimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15998-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A similar picture has emerged for caveolin, which also can be found on LDs (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Ostermeyer A.G. Ramcharan L.T. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Brown D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consequently, little is known about the processes and determinants that mediate the attachment of proteins to LDs. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is a human pathogen of global clinical importance that typically establishes a chronic infection in infected individuals. The viral genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule, which encodes a polyprotein of some 3000 amino acids that is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to generate the mature viral products (reviewed in Ref. 12Penin F. Dubuisson J. Rey F.A. Moradpour D. Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Structural components of the virion, which comprise the capsid protein (referred to as core) and two envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2), lie at the polyprotein N terminus and are released by cellular signalases at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. E1 and E2 are produced following cleavage by signal peptidase (SP) while maturation of core requires proteolysis by SP and signal peptide peptidase (SPP (13Hussy P. Langen H. Mous J. Jacobsen H. Virology. 1996; 224: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,14McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar)). Mature core is a dimeric, α-helical protein exhibiting features that are consistent with those of a membrane protein (15Boulant S. Vanbelle C. Ebel C. Penin F. Lavergne J.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11353-11365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Core can be separated into two domains, D1 and D2, based on its hydropathic profile (15Boulant S. Vanbelle C. Ebel C. Penin F. Lavergne J.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11353-11365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). D1 consists of the N-terminal 117 amino acids and has similar characteristics to the capsid proteins of related pesti- and flaviviruses. The first amino acid in D2 has been positioned at residue 118, but its C-terminal limit is less well defined and lies in the region between amino acids 171 and 182, which encompasses the beginning of the signal peptide between core and E1 (SPcore-E1) and the SPP cleavage site. D2 is required for proper folding of domain D1 and is critical for the membrane protein characteristics of core (15Boulant S. Vanbelle C. Ebel C. Penin F. Lavergne J.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11353-11365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The D2 region is absent in the pesti- and flaviviruses but is found in GB virus B (15Boulant S. Vanbelle C. Ebel C. Penin F.

Following maturation, core is targeted to LDs in a wide variety of cell types (18Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Barba G. Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Z. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Proc.

Apart from LDs, the protein can be retained at the ER membrane (21Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B.

Virol. 2004; 78: 7958-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The purpose of the interaction between core and LDs in the virus life cycle has not been elucidated but could play a role in virus assembly or the development of liver disease in chronic infection. Our previous studies have mapped the sequences required for association of core with LDs to segments throughout D2 (17Hope R.G. Murphy D.J. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4261-4270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the lack of information concerning the structural motifs within this domain precluded any description of the nature of attachment between core and LDs. Here, we describe structural analyses of D2, which revealed two amphipathic α-helices connected by a hydrophobic loop. Mutational studies identified the essential role of several hydrophobic residues in the association of core with LDs and point to an in-plane interaction between the two helices in D2 and the surface of membranes. Moreover, we have examined the contribution of individual residues to the stability of core after SPP cleavage to assess whether there is a link between LD association and the abundance of the protein after processing. From our findings, we propose a model depicting the role of D2 structural elements in the folding of HCV core and LD targeting. Construction of Plasmids—Plasmids pgHCV/CE1E2Gla and pSFV/CE1E2Gla have been described previously (20Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Patel J. Patel A.H. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To express portions of HCV core protein fused to EGFP, the relevant segments of its coding region were amplified by PCR from pgHCV/CE1E2Gla. For cloning purposes, BglII and KpnI sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-terminal ends, respectively, of the primers used for amplification. Amplified DNA fragments were inserted into plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, UK) to create plasmids pGFP/D2 and the variants that consisted of sub-fragments of D2 shown in Fig. 5B. The various point mutants in Fig. 5A were generated with pgHCV/CE1E2Gla as the parent plasmid using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis oligonucleotides were designed according to manufacturer's guidelines. DNA fragments containing mutants were amplified by PCR from the relevant pgHCV/CE1E2Gla mutant plasmid and cloned into pEGFP-C1 as described for the wild-type (wt) form of core. To generate the pSFV/CE1E2Gla mutant plasmids, a 132-bp fragment from the pgHCV/CE1E2Gla mutant plasmids, produced by cleavage by ClaI and BstEII, was ligated with appropriate BstEII-SpeI and SpeI-ClaI fragments from pSFV/CE1E2Gla. To create a construct that contained mutations at Phe130 and at the SPP recognition site, a ClaI-BstEII fragment from pSFV/CF130EE1E2 was ligated with BsteII-SpeI and SpeI-ClaI fragments from pSFV/CspmtE1E2Gla (14McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). For all constructs, sequences were determined to verify that only the desired mutations were introduced into DNA fragments. Maintenance of Tissue Culture Cells and Treatment with MG132—HuH-7 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with MG132 as described previously (14McLauchlan J.

Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C and analyzed ∼16-18 h after transfection. In vitro transcription and electroporation of recombinant Semliki Forest virus (SFV) RNAs into cells was performed as described previously (14McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 20Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Extracts, Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, and Western Blot Analysis—To prepare extracts, cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in sample buffer (160 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 700 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) at a concentration of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml sample buffer. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 37.5:1). For Western blot analysis, proteins, separated on polyacrylamide gels, were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline A containing 5% milk powder (Marvel), membranes were incubated with the relevant antibody, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline A containing 5% milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20. After washing, bound antibody was detected using protein A-peroxidase (Sigma) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Separation of Intracellular Organelles on Sucrose Gradients—HuH-7 cells, in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, were transfected with the relevant plasmid and incubated overnight at 37 °C. All fractionation procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cell monolayers were washed three to four times with phosphate-buffered saline and once with homogenization buffer (HB, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were scraped into 600 μl of HB and homogenized by passage through a 22-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected as a post-nuclear supernatant. For flotation gradient centrifugation, the post-nuclear supernatant was adjusted to 2 ml with HB containing 1.2 m sucrose and applied above a 1.6 m sucrose cushion (2 ml) in a 14- × 89-mm centrifuge tube. The post-nuclear supernatant was overlaid with 2 ml each of 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 m sucrose solutions prepared in HB. Gradients were centrifuged in a SW41Ti rotor at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, fractions were collected, protein was precipitated from each fraction with trichloroacetic acid (15% v/v) and acetone (35% v/v), and pellets were resuspended in sample buffer. Indirect Immunofluorescence, Staining of LDs, and GFP Fluorescence—Analyses of the intracellular localization of proteins and LDs in live and fixed cells were performed as described previously (10Targett-Adams P. Chambers D. Gledhill S. Hope R.G. Coy J.F. Girod A. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15998-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine the proportion of cells in which GFP/D2 and its variants were associated with LDs, the intracellular localization for each protein was assessed by confocal microscopy in 100 randomly selected cells. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides C-(118-149) (NLGKVIDTLTCGFADLMGYIPLVGAPLGGAAR) and C-(141-171) (GAPLGGAARALAHGVRVLEDGVNYATGNLPG) were synthesized by Clonestar Biotech s.r.o. (Brno, Czech Republic) and purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C8 column (300 Å, 10 μm, 10 × 250 mm) using a water/acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of C-(118-149) and C-(141-171) was greater than 98% and 90%, respectively, as determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, electrospray mass spectroscopy (m/z ratio of 3204.25 ± 0.35 and 2973.48 ± 0.51, respectively), and NMR spectroscopy. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon CD6 calibrated with 1S-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Measurements were carried out at room temperature using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette (Hellma), with peptide concentrations ranging from 22 to 48 μm (pH 6.5). Spectra were recorded in the 190 to 250 nm wavelength range with a 0.2 nm increment and a 2-s integration time. Spectra were processed with CD6 software, baseline-corrected, and smoothed by using a third order least square polynomial fit. Spectral units were expressed in molar ellipticity per residue using peptide concentrations determined by measurements of UV light absorbance of tyrosine at 280 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 1536 m−1. cm−1). The α-helical content was estimated at 222 nm using the empirical equation described in Ref. 26Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar as reported previously (27Montserret R. McLeish M.J. Bockmann A. Geourjon C. Penin F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8362-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with a theoretical molar ellipticity of −36,000 deg.cm2.dmol−1 for 100% helical conformation for both peptides in the various media. NMR Spectroscopy—Purified peptides were dissolved in a mixture of 50% TFE-D2OH (99% isotopic enrichment) and 50% H2O (v/v) at 2.5 mm and 1.9 mm, respectively. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane 5-sulfonate was added to the NMR samples as an internal 1H chemical shift reference. All NMR spectra were acquired between 15 and 25 °C. Multidimensional NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Unity-plus 500 MHz equipped with a triple resonance 5-mm probe with a selfshielded z gradient coil. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (mixing times between 100 and 250 ms), two-dimensional homonuclear total correlation spectroscopy (isotropic mixing time of 80 ms), and 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments were performed with conventional optimized pulse sequences as detailed previously (27Montserret R. McLeish M.J. Bockmann A. Geourjon C. Penin F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8362-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Penin F. Geourjon C. Montserret R. Bockmann A. Lesage A. Yang Y.S.

Deutscher J. Penin F. Marion D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; and references therein). Vnmr was used to process all data and Sparky (from T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco, available at www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky) was employed for analysis of two-dimensional spectra. To determine whether domain D2 could target a heterologous protein to LDs, the coding region for GFP was linked upstream from sequences encoding amino acids 118-171 from HCV core, generating a construct that produced chimeric GFP/D2 (Fig. 1). The intracellular distribution of GFP/D2 and untagged GFP in HuH-7 cells was compared with that of LDs by confocal microscopy. The locations of LDs were established by incubating cells with a BODIPY-labeled fatty acid, which accumulates in these structures following cellular uptake (10Targett-Adams P. Chambers D. Gledhill S. Hope R.G. Coy J.F. Girod A. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15998-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Untagged GFP was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas GFP/D2 was detected at the periphery of LDs (Fig. 2A). We noted also that LDs had a tendency to cluster in cells expressing GFP/D2 (Fig. 2A, compare panels ii and v; data not shown). A similar phenomenon was observed in cells expressing the full-length core protein (20Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We assume that the association of core and GFP/D2 with LDs contributes to the change in their characteristics. To provide additional biochemical evidence that GFP/D2 behaved similarly to LD-associated proteins, extracts from transfected cells were fractionated by flotation centrifugation on sucrose gradients (Fig. 2B). Individual fractions were probed with antibodies against GFP, ADRP, a marker for LDs (10Targett-Adams P. Chambers D. Gledhill S. Hope R.G. Coy J.F. Girod A. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15998-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and calnexin, a marker for ER membranes (30Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.J. Doherty 2nd, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to determine the mobility profiles of these various proteins in gradients. GFP/D2 displayed an identical mobility profile to ADRP, which differed from that for GFP alone (Fig. 2B). Compared with GFP/D2 and ADRP, calnexin was detected only in the lower portion of the gradient. These data provided further conclusive evidence that GFP/D2 associated with LDs. Thus, D2 of core contains targeting determinants that are sufficient for directing proteins to LDs.FIGURE 2Targeting of GFP/D2 to LDs. A, subcellular localization of LDs and GFP/D2 (i-iii) and GFP (iv-vi) in HuH-7 cells by confocal microscopy.

Vanbelle C. Ebel C. Penin F. Lavergne J.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11353-11365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As a first stage to identify the locations of structural elements within D2, its sequence was analyzed by a suite of secondary structure prediction programs using euHCVdb data base facilities (available at euhcvdb.ibcp.fr (31Combet C. Penin F. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Appl. Bioinformatics. 2004; 3: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The predictions suggested that two α-helical segments were present in D2. One helix was predicted in region 144-161 by all of the methods, whereas only some programs identified a second helix in region 118-135. 4S. Boulant, R. Montserret, R. G. Hope, M. Ratinier, P. Targett-Adams, J.-P. Lavergne, F. Penin, and J. McLauchlan, unpublished data. Other reports have predicted α-helices between positions 116-134 (32Suzuki R. Sakamoto S. Tsutsumi T. Rikimaru A. Tanaka K. Shimoike T. Moriishi K. Iwasaki T. Mizumoto K. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Suzuki T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and 144-165 (11Ostermeyer A.G. Ramcharan L.T. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Brown D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been suggested also that the second helix exists as two shorter α-helices between residues 145-152 and 155-159 (32Suzuki R. Sakamoto S. Tsutsumi T. Rikimaru A. Tanaka K. Shimoike T. Moriishi K. Iwasaki T. Mizumoto K. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Suzuki T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To gain experimental evidence for the existence of the predicted helices and to clarify their positions within D2, we analyzed the secondary structures of two overlapping, synthetic peptides, C-(118-149) and C-(141-171), that encompassed the sequences needed for efficient targeting to LDs, by CD and NMR. CD Analysis—Peptide C-(118-149) was poorly soluble in water and gave a complex spectrum with a large negative band around 200 nm and a shoulder at ∼220 nm (Fig. 3A), indicating a mixture of random coil structure with some poorly defined secondary structures. As an alternative to aqueous solution, TFE is known to stabilize the folding of peptidic sequences with an intrinsic propensity to adopt an α-helical structure (33Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 34Montserret R. Aubert-Foucher E. McLeish M.J. Hill J.M. Ficheux D. Jaquinod M. van der Rest M. Deleage G. Penin F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6479-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dissolving the peptide in 50% TFE generated a spectrum that was typical of α-helical folding with two minima at 208 and 222 nm and a maximum at 192 nm (Fig. 3, A and B). Titration of C-(118-149)-peptide folding with increasing proportions of TFE gave spectra that were characteristic for α-helices above 20% TFE. 4S. Boulant, R. Montserret, R. G. Hope, M. Ratinier, P. Targett-Adams, J.-P. Lavergne, F. Penin, and J. McLauchlan, unpublished data.Maximal amplitudes were reached at 45% TFE, and no change was found at higher TFE proportions of up to 75%. 4S. Boulant, R. Montserret, R. G. Hope, M. Ratinier, P. Targett-Adams, J.-P. Lavergne, F. Penin, and J. McLauchlan, unpublished data.The results were consistent with the suggestion that, for a peptide with helical propensity, helicity is generally evident at 20-30% TFE and folding is complete by 50% (35Jasanoff A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In the presence of various detergents used to mimic a membranous environment, CD spectra of C-(118-149)-peptide again showed the typical shape of α-helix folding (Fig. 3, A and B). This behavior was indicative of the capacity of the peptide to adopt an α-helical structure on binding to lipid-like molecules. Interestingly, except for l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine, the amplitude maxima in CD spectra were higher in the various detergents than those observed in 50% TFE (Fig. 3, A and B). Quantitatively, ∼40% helical content within the peptide was estimated at 222 nm in the presence of n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and dodecyl phosphocholine; in 50% TFE, this figure dropped to ∼30%. Such different values were consistent with improved stabilization of the helical region of C-(118-149)-peptide in a micellar context. The amplitude variations observed in the various detergents could be attributed to altered peptide interactions with the different polar head groups of detergents. In summary, CD spectral analysis indicated the high propensity of C-(118-149) to bind to lipids and adopt an α-helical structure upon binding. Peptide C-(141-171) was very soluble in water and exhibited a typical CD spectrum of random structure, as denoted by the large negative band around 200 nm (Fig. 3C). Addition of TFE induced helical folding of the peptide (Fig. 3, C and D), although the shape of the spectrum was less typical of an α-helix fold, and helical content was limited to 26% when estimated at 222 nm. In the presence of detergents, CD spectra of C-(141-171) did show the characteristic shape of α-helix folding with double minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast to C-(118-149), amplitude maxima were lower in the various detergents than those observed in 50% TFE, except for dodecyl phosphocholine. Analysis of α-helix content for the various detergents at different pH values indicated that electrostatic interactions between the peptide and the polar head of detergents were important for stabil"
https://openalex.org/W2089450057,"In mammals, the functional unit for definitive erythropoiesis is the erythroblastic island, a multicellular structure composed of a central macrophage surrounded by developing erythroblasts. Erythroblast-macrophage interactions play a central role in the terminal maturation of erythroblasts, including enucleation. One possible mediator of this cell-cell interaction is the protein Emp (erythroblast macrophage protein). We used targeted gene inactivation to define the function of Emp during hematopoiesis. Emp null embryos die perinatally and show profound alterations in the hematopoietic system. A dramatic increase in the number of nucleated, immature erythrocytes is seen in the peripheral blood of Emp null fetuses. In the fetal liver virtually no erythroblastic islands are observed, and the number of F4/80-positive macrophages is substantially reduced. Those present lack cytoplasmic projections and are unable to interact with erythroblasts. Interestingly, wild type macrophages can bind Emp-deficient erythroblasts, but these erythroblasts do not extrude their nuclei, suggesting that Emp impacts enucleation in a cell autonomous fashion. Previous studies have implicated the actin cytoskeleton and its reorganization in both erythroblast enucleation as well as in macrophage development. We demonstrate that Emp associates with F-actin and that this interaction is important in the normal distribution of F-actin in both erythroblasts and macrophages. Thus, Emp appears to be required for erythroblast enucleation and in the development of the mature macrophages. The availability of an Emp null model provides a unique experimental system to study the enucleation process and to evaluate the function of macrophages in definitive erythropoiesis.

The availability of an Emp null model provides a unique experimental system to study the enucleation process and to evaluate the function of macrophages in definitive erythropoiesis. In mammals, erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow or fetal liver in distinct anatomic units called erythroblastic islands, which consist of a central macrophage surrounded by a ring of developing erythroblasts (1.Sasaki K. Iwatsuki H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2.Naito M. Hasegawa G. Takahashi K. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 350-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of erythroblasts with macrophages plays a central role in the formation of erythroblastic islands. Scanning electron microscopy of these islands reveals the typical macrophage topography and cytoplasmic extensions. These extensions surround peripheral erythroid cells providing intimate membrane contact between the macrophage and developing erythroblasts (3.Allen T.D. Dexter T.M. Differentiation. 1982; 21: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to the interactions between macrophages and erythroblasts, the formation and integrity of erythroblastic island structure involves multiple adhesive interactions between adjacent erythroblasts and between cells of the island and the extracellular matrix (4.Arkin S.

Cell-cell interactions must determine specificity because only erythroblasts and a few lymphocytes (reported recently in Ref. 15.Dong L. Wang G.-Y. Liu Z.-F. Shi Y.-X. Zhang H. Bai Z.-L. Cell Biol. Int. 2004; 28: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are found associated with macrophages in erythroblastic islands.The molecular interaction(s) that support formation of the erythroblastic islands have only been partially defined. Previously, we identified Emp 3The abbreviations used are: Emp, erythroblast macrophage protein; FLM, fetal liver macrophage; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor 1; ES, embryonic stem; En, embryonic day n; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: Emp, erythroblast macrophage protein; FLM, fetal liver macrophage; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor 1; ES, embryonic stem; En, embryonic day n; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Blood. 1994; 84: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cultures support the formation of erythroblastic islands that are similar morphologically to those reported in vivo in the bone marrow. In the presence of anti-Emp antibody in cultures, erythroblastic islands were not formed, and terminal maturation of erythroblasts was impaired. Based on these in vitro studies, we proposed that Emp mediates the association of erythroblasts with macrophages and that this attachment promotes terminal maturation of erythroid cells. In addition to the Emp-induced association between erythroblasts and macrophages (16.Hanspal M. Hanspal J. Blood. 1994; 84: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hanspal M. Smockova Y. Uong Q. Blood. 1998; 92: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another molecular interaction reported between these two cell types is the very late antigen-4 (or α4β1 integrin)-VCAM-1 interaction (18.Sadahira Y. Yoshino T. Monobe Y. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The interaction between erythroblast very late antigen-4 and macrophage VCAM-1 plays a critical role in maintaining island integrity because antibodies to either molecule disrupt island structure (18.Sadahira Y. Yoshino T. Monobe Y. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Treatment of mice with very late antigen-4 antibodies in utero specifically induces anemia (19.Hamamura K. Matsuda H. Takeuchi Y. Habu S. Yagita H. Okumura K. Blood. 1996; 87: 2513-2517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other macrophage receptors, which could be involved in adhesion to erythroid cells, include erythroblast receptor, EbR, (20.Morris L. Crocker P.R. Gordon S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 106: 649-656Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and a lectin-like sheep erythrocyte receptor, SER (21.Crocker P.R. Gordon S. J. Exp.

Gordon S. Bainton D.F. Blood. 1990; 76: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither of these receptors nor their corresponding ligands have been fully characterized.The central macrophages of the erythroblastic islands are thought to induce several key biologic processes in the erythroid precursors including proliferation and differentiation, prevention of apoptosis, and promotion of erythroblast enucleation. The role of macrophages in enucleation has been suggested for a long time (24.Seki M. Yoneyama T. Shirasawa H. Acta Pathol. Jpn. 1965; 15: 295-316PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Skutelsky E. Danon D. Anat. Rec. 1972; 73: 123-126Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but only recently gene targeting studies have shown conclusively that DNase II in macrophages is responsible for destroying the nuclear DNA expelled from erythroblasts (26.Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Kondoh G. Takeda J. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Science. 2001; 292: 1546-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 27.Krieser R.J. MacLea K.S. Longnecker D.S. Fields J.L. Fiering S. Eastman A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 956-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Also, MEK kinase I activity appears to be required for macrophage-mediated nuclear DNA destruction (28.Bonnesen B. Orskov C. Rasmussen S. Jahannes Holst P. Christensen J.P. Eriksen K.W. Qvortrup K. Odum N. Labuda T. Blood. 2005; 106: 3396-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The importance of central macrophages in inducing attachment to immature erythroblasts was illustrated by recent studies of the mouse retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, which demonstrated that Rb-deficient embryos carry profound abnormalities in fetal liver macrophages (FLMs) that prevent physical interactions with erythroblasts (29.Iavarone A. King E.R. Dal X.-M. Leone G. Stanley E.R. Lasorella A. Nature. 2004; 432: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).In the present study, we utilized gene targeting to evaluate the in vivo function of Emp. Emp null mice are nonviable and exhibit differentiation defects in both erythroid and macrophage lineages. Our studies reveal that Emp is involved in erythroblast enucleation and macrophage development and may exert its effects through interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. The availability of the Emp null model provides a novel experimental system to study the erythroid cell enucleation process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAn Insertional Mutation in Emp—Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells containing a gene trap insertion in Emp (cell line XG702) were obtained from BayGenomics (San Francisco) (30.Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A. L'Italien L. Chuang P.T. Young S.G. Skarnes W.C. Babbitt P.C. Ferrin T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Insertion of the gene trap vector (containing coding sequence for β-geo, a β-galactosidase-neomycin hybrid) into Emp was verified by direct sequencing of cDNA obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (31.Townley D.J. Avery B.J. Rosen B. Skarnes W.C. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ES cells carrying the Emp mutation were injected into mouse blastocysts, and chimeric offspring were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to create heterozygous (Emp+/–) mice. Offspring were genotyped by PCR of genomic DNA with primers specific for the wild type Emp allele (Emp forward, EMP-F, 5′-TTGCTGCTGCTGAGAATGGG-3′; Emp reverse, R31, 5′-TGATGAGTGCCTCTTGATGTCCTCTG-3′) and for the mutant allele carrying the gene trap insertion (Emp forward, as above; vector reverse, 5′-AGTGGTAGGGGCCTTGGGTTAGAG-3′), and confirmed by Southern hybridization using a 632-bp DNA probe from the wild type gene.Wild type and heterozygous embryos were indistinguishable morphologically as well as in all the parameters tested. Therefore, throughout this study, only wild type and homozygous mutant data are shown.Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry—Freshly collected embryos from timed pregnancies were analyzed. For blood smears, peripheral blood cells collected from fresh embryos were cytospun and stained with Wright-Giemsa. Freshly collected livers from timed pregnancies were either minced to make cytospin preparations or were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut as 5-μm serial sections. Both the cytospins and sections were stained with Wright-Giemsa or processed for immunohistochemistry using biotin-labeled F4/80 antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ER-MP12 antibodies (BD Pharmingen). A Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to detect biotin-labeled primary antibodies.Isolation of Native Erythroblastic Islands and Reconstitution of Heterologous Erythroblastic Islands—Clusters composed of FLMs and erythroblasts were isolated essentially as described previously (29.Iavarone A. King E.R. Dal X.-M. Leone G. Stanley E.R. Lasorella A. Nature. 2004; 432: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers from individual E15.5 embryos were placed in prewarmed 0.05% collagenase (Sigma) and 0.02% DNase (Sigma) in RPMI and digested for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle rotation. After tissue dissociation, the cells were washed three times, suspended in 100 μl of complete medium (RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum), and allowed to attach to glass coverslips for 20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Complete medium was then added to cover the cells, and incubation was continued for an additional 4 h. Thereafter, the coverslips were gently dipped in RPMI to remove nonadherent cells from adherent macrophages with attached erythroid cells (“native” islands). To strip erythroblasts from macrophages, the cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline lacking calcium and magnesium for 10 min and washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove erythroblasts. The resulting “stripped” macrophages were allowed to respread in complete medium for 2 h before the addition of fresh erythroblasts to obtain “reconstituted” islands. Collagenase-digested fetal livers from wild type or mutant E14.5 embryos were used as the source of erythroblasts. The cells were plated in 100-mm dishes for 4 h at 37°C to remove the attached macrophages. Nonadherent erythroid cells were recovered by flushing and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. 106 cells in 50 μl of medium were incubated for 20 min with stripped macrophages derived from individual embryos. Finally, the reconstituted islands were dipped in RPMI to remove the unbound cells before being processed for double F4/80-TER119 (Caltag Laboratories) immunofluorescence using standard procedures. The number of erythroblasts attached to macrophages was determined by counting the total number of cells present in each island visualized using a Leica Confocal fluorescence microscope (Tufts University, Center for Neuroscience Research).To analyze erythroid differentiation and enucleation after association with FLMs, wild type FLMs were stripped and reconstituted with 106 +/+ or –/– erythroblasts, and the reconstituted, heterologous erythroblastic islands were cultured on glass coverslips for 12 h in medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum, 1 unit/ml recombinant erythropoietin (Epo), and 1000 units/ml human recombinant colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1). The cells were fixed and stained for F4/80 and TER119. The presence or absence of nuclei was established by costaining with Hoechst (Bisbenzimide Trihydrochloride, H 33258, Calbiochem) for 1 min at room temperature by using a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline.Cell Culture—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from individual E14.5 embryos using standard protocols (32.Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 260-262Google Scholar). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine.Primary cultures of fetal liver-derived macrophage progenitors were generated from E15.5 wild type and Emp null embryos and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus 5% Pokeweed media as a source of CSF-1 (StemCell Technologies), 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. After 7 days of culture, the cells were used for immunoprecipitation and immunolabeling experiments.Protein Analysis—For Western blot analysis, the cellular protein extracts were electrophoresed on 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gels and blotted to nitrocellulose for detection by chemiluminiscence (Pierce).Coimmunoprecipitation of Emp and actin was performed from erythroblasts or macrophages isolated from wild type and mutant embryos. The cells were solubilized in coimmunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2% CHAPS, protease inhibitors) and passed through a 21-gauge needle 20 times. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was precleared with normal rabbit IgG. Subsequently, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit IgG, affinity-purified anti-Emp antibody, or anti-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich). The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-Emp antibody produced in mice, and anti-actin monoclonal antibody (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH).RESULTSEmp Mutation Is Lethal at Birth—To produce Emp mutant mice, we used an ES cell line carrying an insertional mutation in intron 1 of the Emp gene (BayGenomics cell line XG702) (Fig. 1A). Correct targeting of the Emp allele in ES cells was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization using a probe from the wild type gene (Fig. 1B). Because the position of the probe overlaps the insertion site, it is expected to hybridize with new BamHI fragments at the beginning and end of the insert. As shown in Fig. 1B, wild type ES cells (+/+) show the expected 12.6-kb BamHI fragment, whereas the targeted ES cells (+/–) yield three fragments of 12.6, 7.3, and 6.0 kb, respectively. The 7.3- and 6.0-kb fragments originate from internal BamHI sites within the β-geo gene. One of the positive ES clones was injected into mouse blastocysts to generate chimeric mice, which were mated to generate heterozygous mice. Heterozygotes were intercrossed, and the offspring were genotyped by PCR of genomic DNA with primers specific for the wild type Emp allele, EMP-F, and R31 and for the mutant allele carrying the gene trap insertion, Emp-F, and Geo-R (Fig. 1A). The expected PCR products of 442 and 351 bp from wild type and mutant alleles were detected (Fig. 1C). Heterozygous mice were fertile and phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type mice. However, no live Emp (–/–) mice were found among 250 offspring of the Emp (+/–) intercrosses. To determine when Emp (–/–) embryos died, we followed their fate during embryonic development. The percentage (23.7%) of Emp–/– embryos conforms to the expected Mendelian ratio through embryonic day 19.5 (Table 1), suggesting that Emp (–/–) embryos die perinatally.TABLE 1Genotypes of viable progeny derived from heterozygous parentsStagesGenotypeTotal+/++/--/-E10.55050E11.55122E12.554123210E13.57331E14.515654E15.555102817E16.59441E17.59342E18.59243E19.59342Embryos177449142Postnatal250861640 Open table in a new tab To confirm the absence of Emp protein, primary fibroblast cultures were established from wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous embryos at E14.5. The extracts were prepared from mouse embryonic fibroblasts and examined by Western blot analysis using affinity purified anti-Emp antibody. Emp was detected in wild type and heterozygous fibroblasts but not in homozygous fibroblasts (Fig. 1D). Absence of Emp from the homozygotes was also verified by Western blot analysis of E14.5 fetal liver lysates (data not shown).Emp Null Embryos Exhibit Defective Erythropoiesis—In the mouse embryo, primitive erythropoiesis is initiated in the yolk sac at ∼E7.5. At ∼E9.5, erythropoiesis is initiated in the fetal liver (33.Houssaint E. Cell Differentiation. 1981; 10: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34.Palis J. Robertson S. Kennedy M. Wall C. Keller G. Development. 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and yolk sac erythropoiesis gradually declines; by ∼E14.5, 90% of the erythrocytes in circulation are of fetal liver origin (35.Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schreiner C.M. Miller T.A. Pietryga D.W. Scott Jr., W.J. Potter S.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 36.Trimborn T. Gribnau J. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The development of definitive erythropoiesis in the fetal liver proceeds through two distinct phases. In the first (E11–13), erythroid maturation proceeds in the absence of macrophages, whereas the second phase involves the establishment of erythroblastic islands (1.Sasaki K. Iwatsuki H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).To determine the effect of Emp gene deletion on definitive hematopoiesis, we examined embryos at E12.5–16.5. Homozygous Emp (–/–) embryos appeared normal until E12.5. However, at E14.5 and beyond, homozygous Emp (–/–) embryos became small and pale as compared with their littermates (Fig. 2A). Giemsa-stained smears showed that the peripheral blood of E14.5–16.5 wild type and heterozygote embryos contained a large number of mature, enucleated erythrocytes, whereas that of –/– embryos contained mostly nucleated erythrocytes (Fig. 2B). At E14.5, wild type embryos contained only 25% nucleated erythrocytes as compared with 65–70% in the mutant embryos. As development proceeded in the wild type embryos, this percentage decreased to 8% at E15.5 and 5% at E16.5. In contrast, the mutant embryos showed virtually no change in the proportion of nucleated erythrocytes (data not shown). To determine whether the increased proportion of nucleated cells in mutant embryos is due to a continuous production or a failure of maturation, we determined the absolute number of nucleated and enucleated cells in the fetal blood. As shown in Table 2, mutant embryos contained significantly increased number of circulating nucleated erythroid cells as compared with the wild type embryos, suggesting a defect in terminal maturation and enucleation of nucleated precursor cells in the absence of Emp.FIGURE 2A, comparative morphology of wild type (+/+) and Emp null (–/–) embryos at E15.5 dissected free of the yolk sacs. B, peripheral blood cells collected from E15.5 +/+ and –/– embryos were cytospun and stained with Wright-Giemsa. C and D, livers isolated from +/+ and –/– E15.5 embryos were either minced to make cytospin preparations or fixed in 10% neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut as 5-μm serial sections. Both the cytospins (C) and sections (D) were stained with Wright-Giemsa. Note the large number of more mature erythroblasts and enucleated erythrocytes in wild type cytospins and sections compared with the null fetal livers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Increased number of nucleated erythroid cells in the peripheral blood of Emp(–/–) embryosStagesNumber of cells (×106)Wild typeaEach value is mean number of cells/5 μl of peripheral blood ± S.D. Two or three independent embryos were examined at each stage. Peripheral blood cells collected from each embryo were counted by hemacytometer, and 50,000 cells were used to make each cytospin. The number of nucleated and enucleated erythroid cells were assessed from Giemsa-stained cytospins (at least 10 different fields were counted from each cytospin).

Wild type (+/+) and heterozygous (+/-) embryos gave indistinguishable results and were therefore combined. Open table in a new tab Because fetal liver is the primary site of definitive erythropoiesis, we examined Giemsa-stained fetal liver cytospins from E15.5 +/+ and –/– embryos. Wild type fetal livers showed a large number of nucleated erythroid precursors as well as enucleated erythrocytes. In contrast, the mutant livers contained predominantly large immature erythroblasts with very few enucleated erythrocytes (Fig. 2C). Although nucleated erythrocytes were found in both wild type and mutant embryos, their relative proportions were very different; less mature forms (proerythroblasts) predominated in –/– embryos, whereas more mature forms (polychromatophilic/orthochromatic and enucleated erythrocytes) were most common in +/+ embryos. Similarly, upon examination of the paraffin-embedded liver sections, we found few mature erythroid cells in the sinusoids of homozygotes, in contrast to those of either wild type or heterozygotes, where abundant enucleated red blood cells were observed (Fig. 2D).Emp Null Fetal Liver Macrophages Show Immature Morphology and Are Unable to Form Erythroblastic Islands—FLMs are indispensable for definitive erythropoiesis (26.Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Kondoh G. Takeda J. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Science. 2001; 292: 1546-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Hence we examined the effect of Emp deficiency on FLM development. The expression of CSF-1 receptor was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Densitometric quantitation showed that the mutant livers contained ∼40–50% of the wild type CSF-1 receptor in three separate experiments, suggesting a reduction in the number of macrophages in mutant livers. Immunohistochemical staining of fetal liver cytospins (Fig. 3B) or paraffin-embedded sections (Fig. 3C) with F4/80 antibody, a marker of mature macrophages (37.Austyn J.M. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 38.Morioka Y. Naito M. Sato T. Takahashi K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), revealed numerous F4/80-positive cells throughout the liver of normal embryos. In mutant livers, however, the number of F4/80-positive macrophages was reduced to 25–30% of the normal values. Furthermore, morphologically, Emp null FLMs were generally round and small and appeared to lack the cytoplasmic extensions typically seen in wild type FLMs, suggesting an immature morphology. However, ER-MP12, an antigen expressed by immature macrophage precursors, was similar in wild type and Emp (–/–) fetal livers (Fig. 3D), suggesting that loss of Emp in FLMs impairs terminal differentiation but not commitment to the macrophage lineage.FIGURE 3Abnormal development of FLMs in Emp null embryos.

https://openalex.org/W2003071799,"Staphylococcus aureus continues to be a major cause of infection in normal as well as immunocompromised hosts, and the increasing prevalence of highly virulent community-acquired methicillin-resistant strains is a public health concern. A highly expressed surface component of S. aureus, protein A (SpA), contributes to its success as a pathogen by both activating inflammation and by interfering with immune clearance. SpA is known to bind to IgG Fc, which impedes phagocytosis. SpA is also a potent activator of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling, inducing both chemokine expression and TNF-converting enzyme-dependent soluble TNFR1 (sTNFR1) shedding, which has anti-inflammatory consequences, particularly in the lung. Using a collection of glutathione S-transferase fusions to the intact IgG binding region of SpA and to each of the individual binding domains, we found that the SpA IgG binding domains also mediate binding to human airway cells. TNFR1-dependent CXCL8 production could be elicited by any one of the individual SpA IgG binding domains as efficiently as by either the entire SpA or the intact IgG binding region. SpA induction of sTNFR1 shedding required the entire IgG binding region and tolerated fewer substitutions in residues known to interact with IgG. Each of the repeated domains of the IgG binding domain can affect multiple immune responses independently, activating inflammation through TNFR1 and thwarting opsonization by trapping IgG Fc domains, while the intact IgG binding region can limit further signaling through sTNFR1 shedding.

Each of the repeated domains of the IgG binding domain can affect multiple immune responses independently, activating inflammation through TNFR1 and thwarting opsonization by trapping IgG Fc domains, while the intact IgG binding region can limit further signaling through sTNFR1 shedding. Staphylococcus aureus is a common human pathogen associated with diverse types of infection, ranging from trivial pustules to overwhelming toxic shock and death (1.Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). Much of its success as a pathogen can be attributed to the expression of surface proteins that enable the organism to bind efficiently to many host tissues (2.Foster T.J. Hook M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to other potential pathogens, staphylococci also have evolved numerous mechanisms to evade the immune responses that they evoke (3.Foster T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The initial colonization of host tissues is mediated by the many proteins that promote adherence to extracellular matrix materials such as fibrinogen (clumping factors A and B, ClfA and ClfB), fibronectin (fibronectin-binding proteins, FnBPs), collagen (collagen-binding protein, Cna), and elastin (elastin-binding protein, EbpS) (4.Roche F.M.

These are not simply inert adhesins but often activate host responses. For example, FnBPs stimulate internalization of bacteria into epithelial and endothelial cells via a fibronectin bridge to the α5β1 integrin (8.Sinha B. Francois P.P. Nusse O. Foti M. Hartford O.M.

Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Along with ClfA the FnBPs also activate platelets (10.Fitzgerald J.R. Loughman A. Keane F. Brennan M. Knobel M.

Cox D. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 804-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), likely to be important in endovascular infections such as endocarditis. Although many staphylococcal surface components are proinflammatory, activating chemokine expression and evoking the influx of leukocytes and especially phagocytic cells, the organism also has mechanisms to avoid phagocytic clearance. Protein A (SpA) expression has an important anti-phagocytic effect through its interactions with the Fc component of immunoglobulin. Although the interactions between SpA and human immunoglobulin chains have long been recognized, there is only recently a growing appreciation for the central importance of SpA in the pathogenesis of S. aureus infection. SpA is a 42-kDa protein covalently anchored in the staphylococcal cell wall through its carboxyl terminal end. The protein is comprised of five repeated domains (E, D, A, B, C) of ∼58 residues linked to the cell surface by region Xr, which contains a variable number of short 8-residue repeats (12.Langone J.J. Adv. Immunol. 1982; 32: 157-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 13.Uhlen M. Guss B. Nilsson B. Gatenbeck S. Philipson L. Lindberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1695-1702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variability in the number and sequences of these repeated regions has been exploited as an epidemiological marker, although their significance is not established (14.Shopsin B. Gomez M. Montgomery S.O. Smith D.H. Waddington M. Dodge D.E. Bost D.A. Riehman M. Naidich S. Kreiswirth B.N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 3556-3563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each SpA domain can bind with high affinity to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G and to the Fab region of immunoglobulin of the VH3 subclass (15.Jansson B. Uhlen M. Nygren P.A. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 20: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16.Moks T. Abrahmsen L. Nilsson B. Hellman U. Sjoquist J. Uhlen M. Eur. J.

Mannik M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2778-2783PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction with IgG Fc hinders phagocytosis (3.Foster T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) because bacteria become coated with IgG in an inappropriate conformation not recognized by the Fc receptor on neutrophils. Moreover, SpA-bound IgG cannot stimulate complement fixation by the classical pathway. An additional consequence of the ability of SpA to bind to B lymphocytes displaying IgM bearing VH3 heavy chains is the induction of proliferation resulting in depletion of a significant part of the B cell repertoire (19.Goodyear C.S.

SpA can also act directly as an immune effector itself through its ability to bind and activate tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) 3The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; TNFR1, TNF-α receptor 1; sTNFR1, soluble TNFR1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TACE, TNF-converting enzyme; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PMN, polymorphonuclear; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. receptor 1 (TNFR1) (26.Gomez M.I.

This interaction is particularly important at sites of infection where TNF-α signaling is critical, as in the lung. Protein A-TNFR1 interaction is essential for the pathogenesis of pneumonia as TNFR1 null mice are not susceptible to S. aureus pneumonia and SpA-defective mutants of S. aureus do not cause infection in wild-type animals. SpA activates proinflammatory signaling through binding to TNFR1 and activation of TRAF2, the p38/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase MAPKs, and NF-κB (26.Gomez M.I. Lee A. Reddy B. Muir A. Soong G. Pitt A. Cheung A. Prince A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). TNFR1 ectodomain shedding is induced by SpA (26.Gomez M.I. Lee A. Reddy B. Muir A. Soong G. Pitt A. Cheung A. Prince A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), presumably by activating the TNF-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM 17) through a signaling pathway not yet elucidated. As there is no apparent homology between the trimeric TNFR1 and IgG, both of which function as receptors for SpA, we were interested in defining the molecular basis for the SpA-TNFR1 interaction. In the experiments detailed in this report, we compared the binding of intact SpA and isolated regions of the protein expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions to TNFR1 to determine whether the same domains activate TNFR1 signaling and shedding and to establish whether the known IgG binding domains recognize multiple targets, including TNFR1. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—DNA cloning was performed in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Qiagen). E. coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) was used for expression of recombinant proteins. E. coli was routinely grown in Luria Bertani broth at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was incorporated into the medium where appropriate. DNA Constructions—The full-length spa, the five- and single-domain repeats of spa encoding the extracellular immunoglobulin binding domains, and the fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal region of SpA (Fig. 1) were cloned into plasmid pGEX-KG. Oligonucleotides were designed to allow amplification of each individual SpA repeated domain (Table 1). Cross-reaction of primers due to high sequence homology of the repeats was prevented by digestion of the spa template with unique restriction endonucleases prior to single-domain amplifications.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides for single spa domain constructsNameSequence (5′-3′)aRestriction sites are indicated in boldface type.Fw_spaECCGGAATTCATGCTGCGCAACACGATGAAGRv_spaECCGCCATGGTTATTTTGGTGCTTGAGAGTCAFw_spaDCCGGAATTCAAGCTGATGCGCAACAAAATAACFw_spaACCGGAATTCAAGCTGATAACAATTTCAACAAAGRv_spaD/ACCGCCATGGTTATTTCGGTGCTTGAGATTCGFw_spaBCCGGAATTCAAGCGGATAACAAATTCAACAAAGFw_spaCCCGGAATTCAAGCTGACAACAAATTCAACAAAGRv_spaB/CCCGCCATGGTTATTTTGGTGCTTGAGCATCATa Restriction sites are indicated in boldface type. Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—For expression of recombinant SpA truncates, pGEX-KG constructs were purified from E. coli XL1-Blue and transformed into E. coli BL21. Overnight cultures were inoculated into fresh medium and grown to an A600 of 0.5. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for a further 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall GS-3 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), lysozyme (200 μg/ml), and DNase I (3 μg/ml). Cells were lysed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Recombinant proteins expressed from pGEX-KG contained an amino-terminal GST fusion of 26 kDa. The GST fusion proteins were purified using the MicroSpin GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed against PBS. Recombinant five- and single-domain GST fusion proteins had approximate molecular masses of 59 and 32 kDa, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into SpA domain D using a PCR-based mutagenesis strategy. Briefly, overlapping oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutation were combined with standard flanking primers to yield two overlapping mutant products. These were combined and amplified using the flanking primers alone to yield the mutant fusion product. In some cases, mutations were introduced using the QuikChange® method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The following amino acid substitutions were constructed: F5A, F13A, Y14A, L17A, N21A, I31A, Q32A, and K35A. Oligonucleotides used to introduce mutations are listed in Table 2. Mutated domains were cloned directionally into pGEX-KG and expressed as described above. Each mutant protein was tested for binding to human IgG Fc domain and to human VH3 IgM. For each mutant that was defective in binding to IgG, normal levels of binding to IgM occurred (data not shown). This shows that the mutant proteins were likely to have taken up the proper conformation.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used for spaD variantsNameForward primer (5′-3′)aReverse primers are the reverse complement of forward primer.,bUnderlined bases indicate a changed codon.F5AGCAACAAAATAACGCGAACAAAGATCF13ACAAAGCGCCGCGTATGAAATCY14AGCGCCTTCGCGGAAATCTTGL17ACTATGAAATCGCGAACATGCCN21AGAACATGCCTGCGTTAAACGAAG131AGTAACGGCTTCGCGCAAAGTCQ32AGGCTTCATTGCGAGTCTTAAAGK35AGTCTTGCGGACGACCCAAGa Reverse primers are the reverse complement of forward primer.b Underlined bases indicate a changed codon.

Primary airway epithelial cells isolated from human nasal polyps were grown on Transwell clear filters (Corning Costar) in M3 medium as previously described (29.DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A Binding to Epithelial Cells—Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C and then incubated with increasing amounts of full-length SpA or the domain constructs for 1 h. Cells were washed three times and stained with anti-protein A monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), was used. An irrelevant isotype-matched antibody was used as a control, and the fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the fluorescence intensity obtained with the SpA-specific antibody. Cells were analyzed with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur using CellQuest software. For the competition assays the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-labeled SpA and increasing amounts of unlabeled IgG binding domain (GST-E-C), full-length SpA (GST-SpA), or the carboxyl-terminal region of SpA (GST-X). Cells were washed, and fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry. Confocal Microscopy—16HBE cells were grown on Transwell-Clear filters (Corning Costar) at an air-liquid interface to form polarized monolayers. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with SpA or the IgG binding domains (E-C) for 1 h. After washing, rabbit polyclonal anti-TNFR1 antibody (Santa Cruz) and mouse monoclonal anti-protein A antibody were added for 1 h. Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) were then added for 1 h. After washing, filters were removed from transwells and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc.) onto glass slides. CXCL8 and sTNFR1 Detection—1HAEo- cells, weaned from serum for 24 h, were exposed to the GST fusion proteins (2.5 μm) for 4 h. CXCL8 in the supernatant was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (BD Biosciences). Soluble TNFR1 (sTNFR1) in the supernatants was detected by using DuoSet ELISA for human sTNFR1 (R&D Systems). Mouse Studies—C57BL/6 mice or C57BL/6-Tnfrsf1atm1Imx (TNFR1 null; Jackson Laboratories) (7–10 days old) were intranasally inoculated with 10 μl of S. aureus (108 CFU), full-length SpA (GST-SpA, 50 μm), the IgG binding domains (GST-E-C, 50 μm), SpA domain D (GST-D, 50 μm), SpA domain D with Ile-31 replaced by alanine (GST-I31A, 50 μm), SpA domain D with Leu-17 replaced by alanine (GST-L17A, 50 μm), or PBS (control). For neutrophil detection in the lungs, cell suspensions were obtained from lung homogenates and red cells were lysed. Remaining cells were suspended in PBS containing 10% normal mouse serum and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then double stained with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD45 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Ly6G (BD Biosciences). Negative control samples were incubated with irrelevant, isotype-matched antibodies. Cells were gated based on their forward scatter/side scatter profile and analyzed for the double expression of CD45 and Ly6G. For KC mRNA quantification, mouse lungs were obtained at 16–18 h post inoculation and stored in RNAlater (Qiagen). RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. cDNA was made from 1 μg of RNA using the iScript synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). For quantitative real-time PCR, amplification was done in a Light Cycler using the DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). Primers used for KC amplification were 5′-CCGCGCCTATCGCCAATGAGCTGCGC-3′ and 5′-CTTGGGGACACCTTTTAGCATCTTTTGG-3′, and 35 cycles were run with denaturation at 95 °C for 8 s, amplification at 56 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 12 s. Actin was amplified on each individual sample and used as control for standardization. Primers used for actin amplification were 5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-CGGTTGGCCTTGGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′, and 35 cycles were run with denaturation at 95 °C for 8 s, amplification at 63 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 12 s. Soluble TNFR1 was assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage from adult mice intranasally inoculated with SpA domain D (GST-D, 50 μm), SpA domain D with Leu-17 replaced by alanine (GST-L17A, 50 μm), SpA domain D with F5A replaced by alanine (GST-F5A, 50 μm), or PBS (control). Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by instilling 1.5 ml of PBS into the lungs. The fluid recovered (∼1 ml) was concentrated to 100 μl and stored at –80 °C. Mice protocol number AAAA1718 was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University. The SpA IgG Binding Region Mediates the Biological Activity of SpA Binding to Human Airway Cells—We postulated that multiple copies of the IgG binding region of SpA are highly conserved in clinical isolates of S. aureus because of their ability to recognize multiple eukaryotic receptors that are important in pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we compared the properties of intact SpA isolated as a GST fusion protein (GST-SpA), the complete IgG binding region (SpA GST-E-C), individual IgG binding domains (GST-E, GST-D, GST-A, etc.), and the carboxyl-terminal X domain (Fig. 1). The intact SpA and the E-C domain displayed similar binding kinetics to 1HAEo- cells (Fig. 2A). Increasing amounts of the E-C fragment effectively competed with intact SpA for binding to airway cells (Fig. 2B). The carboxyl-terminal X region neither binds to the human cells (Fig. 2A) nor significantly competes with SpA for binding (Fig. 2B). The interaction between the IgG binding region of SpA and TNFR1 on the surface of polarized airway cells was visualized by confocal imaging (Fig. 2C). Both the intact SpA and the E-C fragment co-localized with TNFR1 along the apical surface of the polarized airway cells. SpA-TNFR1 co-localization was confirmed using primary airway epithelial cells (Fig. 2D). Each of the individual IgG binding domains was capable of binding to airway cells but with less affinity than the entire E-C domain, because 5–10-fold more protein was required to achieve saturation (Fig. 2E). The binding of the isolated domains E and A was not saturable in contrast to that of the other IgG binding domains (D, B, and C). SpA IgG Binding Domains Are Sufficient to Activate CXCL8 Production—In response to ligation of TNFR1 by SpA a proinflammatory signaling cascade is activated (26.Gomez M.I. Lee A. Reddy B. Muir A. Soong G. Pitt A. Cheung A. Prince A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To determine whether the IgG binding domains of SpA are sufficient to mediate this response, we incubated intact SpA, the complete IgG binding domain (GST-E-C), or each individual IgG binding domain (GST-A, GST-B, GST-C, etc.) with 1HAEo- (Fig. 3, A and B) or primary (Fig. 3C) airway epithelial cells and monitored CXCL8 production. The entire E-C domain as well as each of the individual IgG binding domains was comparable with the intact SpA in activating CXCL8 expression. Neither the COOH-terminal X domain nor the GST tag had immunostimulatory activity. SpA IgG Binding Domains Activate sTNFR1 Shedding—SpA ligation of TNFR1 initiates shedding of the soluble portion of TNFR1 from the surface of airway cells by activating the TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM 17) (26.Gomez M.I. Lee A. Reddy B. Muir A. Soong G. Pitt A. Cheung A. Prince A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We compared the ability of intact SpA, the IgG binding domains, and the carboxyl-terminal X region to induce sTNFR1 shedding (Fig. 3D). The IgG binding region E-C was equivalent to the intact SpA in activating sTNFR1 shedding. As with CXCL8 induction, the COOH-terminal X domain was inactive. However, individual IgG domains were substantially less potent than the intact E-C fragment in stimulating sTNFR1 shedding (Fig. 3E), and the isolated A and E domains were less potent that the other individual IgG binding domains. TNFR1 shedding in response to the IgG binding domain D was confirmed in primary airway epithelial cells (Fig. 3F). Thus, two consequences of SpA-TNFR1 binding are differentially activated by the same IgG binding region of SpA, with the TNFR1-CXCL8 pathway apparently less constrained by ligand-receptor affinities than the TNFR1-TACE-dependent cascade. SpA Amino Acids That Interact with IgG Are Involved in TNFR1 Recognition—Having established that the SpA IgG binding domains are responsible for the TNFR1 recognition, we then tested whether the same amino acids that mediate SpA binding to the IgG Fcγ fragment also bind to TNFR1. A collection of domain D alanine substitution mutants, each with a substitution affecting an amino acid previously demonstrated to be involved in IgG recognition (Fig. 4A), was tested for binding to human airway cells, for CXCL8 induction, and for the ability to stimulate sTNFR1 shedding (Fig. 4). A substitution in asparagine 21 (not involved in IgG binding) was used as control. Alanine substitutions in phenylalanine 13 and tyrosine 14 almost completely abolished binding to airway epithelial cells (Fig. 4B) as well as CXCL8 production (Fig. 4C) and sTNFR1 shedding (Fig. 4D). A second group of mutants (phenylalanine 5, leucine 17, isoleucine 31, and lysine 35) resulted in decreased levels of binding when compared with unmodified domain D (Fig. 4B). Despite the decrease in binding, only the substitution in isoleucine 31 impaired CXCL8 production, whereas shedding of TNFR1 was completely abolished by all the substitutions (Fig. 4C). The replacement of leucine 17 by alanine did not affect CXCL8 induction as compared with the unmodified domain D but totally inhibited sTNFR1 shedding (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the SpA residues that bind to TNFR1 form a cluster of mainly hydrophobic residues between helices I and II (Fig. 4E). In addition, a substitution in glutamine 32, which is the only amino acid involved in both Fab and Fcγ recognition by SpA, did not affect binding, CXCL8, or sTNFR1 induction (Fig. 4, B–D). Thus, the IgG binding domain in SpA mediates apparently discrete responses mediated through TNFR1, as well as two independent interactions with the Fcγ and Fab chains of IgG. SpA Activity in Vivo—To verify that the SpA IgG binding domains are functional in vivo, we monitored expression of the murine chemokine KC and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte recruitment following intranasal inoculation of mice with various SpA constructs (Fig. 5). Stimulation of KC mRNA was significantly increased by the E-C fragment (p <0.05 compared with control mice) (Fig. 5A), the SpA D fragment, and the L17A mutant but not by the I31A mutant (Fig. 5B). The SpA IgG binding domain D did not stimulate KC mRNA in TNFR1 null animals, confirming the requirement for TNFR1 in this pathway (Fig. 5B). Mice inoculated with either intact SpA, the IgG binding domain E-C, or wild-type S. aureus strain Newman all had significant PMN recruitment into their lungs at 18 h post-inoculation (Fig. 5C). As predicted by the in vitro studies, the isolated D fragment, but not the I31A mutant, induced PMN recruitment in wild-type but not TNFR1 null mice (Fig. 5D). We then determined in vivo TNFR1 shedding in response to SpA. Soluble TNFR1 was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage 24 h after intranasal inoculation of SpA D fragment but not in mice inoculated with either the L17A or F5A mutant (Fig. 5E). SpA is a pluripotent virulence factor capable of several important interactions with host components. In infection of the airways where serum components are lacking, S. aureus potently activates epithelial signaling through TNFR1 activation, induction of chemokine expression, and recruitment of neutrophils, a hallmark of staphylococcal infection (26.Gomez M.I. Lee A. Reddy B. Muir A. Soong G. Pitt A. Cheung A. Prince A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The SpA-TNFR1 interaction initially provokes a proinflammatory response eliciting CXCL8 expression immediately after binding. The resulting tissue damage at the site of infection and extravasation of PMNs and serum components provide IgG and complement to promote phagocytosis and clearance of bacteria. However, SpA-IgG interactions act to impede phagocytosis and foster bacterial persistence (3.Foster T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In addition, SpA ligation of TNFR1 initiates TACE-dependent cleavage of the receptor and release of the soluble form of TNFR1 from the cell surface (26.Gomez M.I. Lee A. Reddy B. Muir A. Soong G. Pitt A. Cheung A. Prince A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The induction of TNFR1 shedding has anti-inflammatory consequences as it prevents further signaling through the membrane-bound portion of the receptor and neutralizes free TNF-α in the airway, limiting the potential for further TNF-dependent signaling. By analyzing a series of amino acid substitutions in the SpA D domain, it became apparent that the residues important in the interaction between SpA D and the Fc region of IgG are also involved in binding to and activating TNFR1. SpA residues that are on the opposite face of the protein that are involved in IgM Fab binding are not involved in the interaction with TNFR1. As shown both in vitro and in vivo, the activation of sTNFR1 shedding is eliminated by the F5A and L17A substitutions, changes that have little effect on CXCL8 or KC activation. While phenylalanine 13, tyrosine 14, and isoleucine 31 are the most critical residues for CXCL8 production, the induction of sTNFR1 shedding appears to require either a larger ligand domain or perhaps a higher affinity interaction between SpA and TNFR1 than the induction of CXCL8 involves. TNFR1 shedding involves the stimulation of TACE, which occurs through an anti-inflammatory pathway that is entirely distinct from that involved in the canonical proinflammatory cascade initiated by TNFR1-TRAF2-MAPK/NF-κB and exhibits different kinetics. 4M. I. Gomez and A. S. Prince, unpublished data. Thus, differences in the conformation of the ligand-receptor complex that activate two discrete responses are not unanticipated. Moreover, it is likely that the recruitment of additional co-receptors or kinases may also affect the stoichiometry of the binding complex. These questions can be resolved by solving the structure of the SpA-TNFR1 complex, as was done for SpA-Fc, and by defining the components of the TACE induction cascade. As the structural requirements for proinflammatory activation of TNFR1 as well as IgG binding appear to be less stringent than for the activation of TACE and the anti-inflammatory effects of sTNR1 shedding, identification of SpA variants with activity skewed toward receptor shedding would be particularly interesting. Epidemiological studies show that SpA is expressed by the majority of S. aureus commensal and clinical isolates (30.Peacock S.J. Moore C.E. Justice A. Kantzanou M. Story L. Mackie K. O'Neill G. Day N.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4987-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and at especially high levels in strains causing pneumonia (31.Goerke C. Campana S. Bayer M.G. Doring G. Botzenhart K. Wolz C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The prevalence of infection in healthy individuals caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains is increasing and is predominant at several major medical centers (32.Said-Salim B. Mathema B. Kreiswirth B.N. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2003; 24: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These strains can cause a severe form of necrotizing pneumonia (33.Gillet Y. Issartel B. Vanhems P. Fournet J.C. Lina G. Bes M. Vandenesch F. Piemont Y. Brousse N. Floret D. Etienne J. Lancet. 2002; 359: 753-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) that might indicate an important role for protein A in pathogenesis. The structural organization of SpA, as well as other staphylococcal surface proteins with tandem arrays of repeated sequences, suggests environmental pressure for the conservation of these genes although they are not essential for the growth of the organism in vitro (34.Cheung A.L. Eberhardt K. Heinrichs J.H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their multiplicity ensures that random mutation does not eliminate their function. As there has been great interest in developing therapeutic agents that target the TNF-α signaling cascade, it may also be possible to target the SpA-TNFR1 interaction to prevent or treat S. aureus pneumonia.

Vox Sang. 1966; 11: 519-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but not those of blood groups B or O (14.Hammarström S. Kabat E.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2696-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The binding preference was established to be Forssman antigen (αGalNAc1–3GalNAc-R) >blood group A substance (αGalNAc1–3[αFuc1–2]Gal] >Tn antigen (αGalNAc-Ser/Thr) >GalNAc >GlcNAc, therefore confirming the specificity for terminal α-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (αGalNAc) residues (15.Wu A.M. Sugii S. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 127-143Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HPA was identified as a hexamer with a total molecular mass of 79 kDa (14.Hammarström S. Kabat E.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2696-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Further characterization led to the conclusion that the snail hemagglutinin consists of six identical polypeptide subunits, each containing one intra-chain disulfide bond and a carbohydrate binding site. In fact, two chains associate by a disulfide bridge, and the hexamer therefore consists of a non-covalent trimer of covalent dimers (16.Hammarström S. Westoo A. Bjork I. Scand. J. Immunol. 1972; 1: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HPA is a glycoprotein with ∼7% carbohydrate content, and because this glycoprotein could be fractionated into at least 12 components by isoelectric focusing (17.Vretblad P. Hjorth R. Laas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the presence of different glycoforms is probable. Materials—HPA was purchased from Sigma and Vector (Burlingame, CA). Oligonucleotides for PCR were purchased from MWG SA. Biotech (Courtaboeuf, France). One H. pomatia snail was kindly donated by the snail farm, Escargot du Pont Chardon (Chevrieres, France). Peptide Sequencing and Mass Spectrometry—CNBr fragments of HPA were prepared by addition of a 10-fold by weight excess of CNBr to the protein (10 mg/ml) in 70% HCOOH, and the mixture was kept in the dark for 20 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then diluted 1:10 with water and freeze dried. The digest was dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl, pH 2.5, and separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a C4 column (2.1 × 100 mm) using a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 70% CH3CN containing 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid. Amino acid sequence determination of collected fractions was performed using a Procise Sequencer model 492 (Applied Biosystems). Phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives were identified and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography analysis on-line as recommended by the manufacturer. MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded on a Bruker Autoflex (Centre de Recherche sur les Macromolécules Végétales) and Applied Biosystems Voyager 125 (Institut de Biologie Structurale). Reverse Transcription PCR and cDNA Cloning of Helix pomatia Agglutinin—PCR was used to amplify the coding region of HPA using degenerated primers that were designed with regard to the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein as deduced from the high resolution crystal structure of the HPA·GalNAc complex. Total RNA was obtained by grinding one albumen gland in liquid nitrogen followed by an extraction using TRI reagent (Sigma). cDNAs were synthesized using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE kit; Invitrogen) with the following primers: pr-hpa (sense 5′-TGYGGNAAYGAYGCNGGNTGG-3′), which codes for the peptide sequence CGNDAGW, and UAP (Universal Amplification Primer; Invitrogen). PCR was performed using cDNA as the template and Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) with the following temperature profile: 4 min at 95 °C first and then 45 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 45 °C, 5 min at 72 °C, for 39 cycles. These conditions permitted the amplification of a fragment of 650 bp. The purified PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Five independent clones were sequenced on both strands (Genome Express, Meylan, France). The 5′-end of the sequence was obtained using the 5′-RACE kit from Invitrogen. cDNA was synthesized using an HPA gene-specific antisense oligonucleotide (GSP1-HPA: 5′-TCTATGACAGTGCGAAGACG-3′). PCR was then performed using this cDNA preparation as the template, Taq DNA polymerase, and the primers AAP (Abridged Anchor Primer; Invitrogen) and a second HPA gene-specific primer GSP2-HPA (antisense 5′-TGAGAATTCCCTGATCTCTCTCGAAAGTAAG-3′). PCR was performed with the following cycling temperature profile: 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, for 35 cycles. The purified PCR fragment was ligated in the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Six independent clones were sequenced on both strands. Crystallization and Data Collections—Crystallization trials were performed with Hampton crystallization screens I and II (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). After optimization, crystals were obtained using the hanging drop method with precipitation solution containing lithium sulfate (2 m) and ammonium sulfate (3.5 m) in sodium citrate buffer (1.5 m, pH 6.5). Drops were made of an equal volume of reservoir solution and protein solution at 10 mg/ml. For the co-crystallization assays, the ligand was added to the protein solution with a 3-fold excess in molarity. Crystals were cryocooled at 100 K after soaking them for the shortest possible time in precipitant solution with 25% polyethylene glycol 3000 and 25% glycerol added. Data images were recorded on an ADSC Q4R CCD detector (Quantum Corp.) at beamline ID14–2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France). Diffraction images were processed using MOSFLM (18.Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and scaled and truncated to structure factors using the CCP4 (19.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determinations—The crystal structure of the HPA· GalNAc complex was determined using the single wavelength anomalous diffraction technique with highly redundant data from the crystals of the HPA·GalNAc·zinc complex to 1.7 Å resolution. Harker sections of the anomalous difference Patterson map showed peaks corresponding to one zinc atom/monomer in the asymmetric unit. The location of the zinc ion was found with HySS (20.Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and experimental phases were calculated and the position of the zinc refined with autoSHARP (21.de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). A first model was built automatically with ARP/wARP (22.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) and used to prepare primers for cloning of the hpa gene and then completed using the obtained HPA sequence. Cycles of refinement with REFMAC (26.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding with O (24.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) resulted in an initial model of the lectin. This model was used as the search probe for molecular replacement for the native protein and the GalNAc·zinc complex using MOLREP (25.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar). In both the native structure (2.4 Å) and the high resolution HPA·GalNAc complex (1.3 Å), several amino acids missing in the search model could be added and sugar residues clearly defined in density were positioned manually using O (24.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Cycles of refinement with REFMAC (26.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar), including automatic water molecule placement using ARP/wARP (22.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar), for the native structure and with ShelX (23.Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) using anisotropic B-factors for the complex and manual rebuilding with O resulted in the final models. The refinement statistics are listed in Table 2. Stereochemical checks were performed with the PROCHECK program (27.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Glycan Microarray Analysis—HPA was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-TFP (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled protein was purified on a D-Salt polyacrylamide desalting column (Pierce). Alexa-labeled HPA was used to probe the printed glycan arrays (28.Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.H. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) following the standard procedure of Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (www.functionalglycomics.org/). Titration Microcalorimetry Measurements—ITC experiments were performed with a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal). The experiments were carried out at 25 °C. GalNAc (Sigma) and HPA were dissolved in the same buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Two experiments were conducted with HPA concentrations in the microcalorimeter cell (1.4478 ml) of 0.32 and 0.35 mm. GalNAc solution, in 30 injections of 10 μl at concentrations varying from 2.8 to 3.0 mm, was added at intervals of 5 min while stirring at 310 rpm. Control experiments performed by injections of buffer in the protein solution yielded insignificant heats of dilution. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal with ΔH (enthalpy change), Ka (association constant), and n (number of binding sites/monomer) as adjustable parameters, from the classical relationship (29.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with c values 100 <c <200 (c = Ka × M where M is the initial concentration of the macromolecule). Sequence Determination and Biochemical Characteristics—On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under strong reducing conditions, the commercial HPA preparation showed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 13 kDa, while the MALDI-TOF spectra (data not shown) indicated the presence of major peaks corresponding to a monomer (12.7 kDa), dimer (24.6 kDa), and hexamer (76 kDa) in agreement with previously published data (16.Hammarström S. Westoo A. Bjork I. Scand. J. Immunol. 1972; 1: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cyanogen bromide cleavage and subsequent peptide sequencing led to the determination of three peptide sequences (Fig. 1). The sequence of a heptapeptide from the N-terminal region of the mature protein (CGND-AGW) was unambiguously deduced from the high resolution x-ray crystal structure of HPA·GalNAc complex, and this information allowed for cloning the corresponding hpa gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes for a 121-amino acid polypeptide, including a peptide signal of 20 residues as deduced from prediction servers (CBS, www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/). The mature protein consists of 101 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 11.3 kDa and an estimated pI of 8.20 (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence reported here was deposited in GenBank™/EBI data bank with accession number DQ341310. The peptide sequence displays only 53% identity with an HPA sequence deposited by an independent study under accession number Q575S3 (discussed below). HPA has been described as a glycoprotein, and one potential N-glycosylation site is present at Asn-34 (mature protein numbering). Mass spectrometry experiments (data not shown) indicated the existence of several glycoforms for the dimer, with three major peaks corresponding to molecular masses of 22,795, 23,967, and 25,139 Da. These peaks are interpreted as non-glycosylated, monoglycosylated, and diglycosylated dimers, respectively. Indeed, the difference of 1,172 Da observed between each form corresponds closely to the low molecular mass N-glycan (molecular mass 1,170 Da) that has been characterized as the most represented on H. pomatia α-hemocyanin (30.van Kuik J.A. van Halbeek H. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been described as a classical core pentasaccharide (Man3-GlcNAc2) with the addition of an α1–6-linked fucose residue to the inner GlcNAc and a β1–2-linked xylose residue to the branching mannose residue. The unusual presence of xylose in an animal glycoprotein was later confirmed in several gastropods (Ref. 31.Gutternigg M. Ahrer K. Grabher-Meier H. Burgmayr S. Staudacher E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1348-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and references therein). Heavier glycoforms were also observed in the mass spectrum and could correspond to Gal, GalNAc, and MeGal-containing diantennary N-glycans that have also been characterized in H. pomatia α-hemocyanin (32.Lommerse J.P. Thomas-Oates J.E. Gielens C. Preaux G. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 195-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Binding Specificity Study—Screening for oligosaccharide specificity (Fig. 2) confirmed the binding of HPA to glycans with terminal αGalNAc residue, such as the blood group A and Forssman antigens and related oligosaccharides. HPA also appears to tolerate substitution on position 3 of αGalNAc by a β-galactosidase residue as shown by its binding to Thomsen-Freidenreich (T) antigen and its sulfated or sialylated derivatives. Oligosaccharides containing a terminal β-GalNAc or α-GlcNAc residues are also recognized. These binding data confirm, although with some interesting variations (see “Discussion”), the observations made earlier (15.Wu A.M. Sugii S. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 127-143Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33.Hammarström S. Kabat E.A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1684-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34.Piller V. Piller F. Cartron J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The only discrepancy is the binding of βGlcNAc1–4βGal1–4βGlcNAc trisaccharide. Because HPA does not bind any of the other βGlcNAc-topped oligosaccharides present in the microarray, this observation will need to be confirmed using a different methodological approach. Thermodynamics of the Interaction—To characterize the interaction between HPA and GalNAc, the Ka values and the thermodynamic binding parameters were determined using titration microcalorimetry, a method that is well suited to the characterization of protein-carbohydrate interactions (35.Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 387-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). A typical titration curve for HPA binding to GalNAc is shown in Fig. 3. Using a mathematical model corresponding to a simple binding mode, the value of the dissociation constant was calculated to be 1.3 × 10–4 m, which is in agreement with the modest affinity reported previously for blood group A pentasaccharide (33.Hammarström S. Kabat E.A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1684-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The interaction is strongly driven by enthalpy because the free energy of binding (ΔG value of –22 kJ/mol) has an enthalpic contribution, ΔH, of –35 kJ/mol counterbalanced by a strong unfavorable entropy contribution, TΔS, of –13 kJ/mol. Such an entropy barrier is often observed for the binding of carbohydrates to lectins (35.Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 387-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Overall Structure and Oligomerization—Native HPA crystallized in lens-shaped crystals of space group P6322 (a = b = 61.6 Å, c = 104.9 Å) isomorphous to that previously described in a crystallization report (36.Lisgarten J.N. Chattopadhyay T.K. Pitts J.E. Palmer R.A. Reynolds C.D. Dao-Thi M.H. Van Driessche E. Beeckmans S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1903-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the 2.5 Å resolution x-ray crystal structure, the asymmetric unit contains one monomer consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich (Fig. 4A). The β-strands are connected by short loops except for one longer loop that connects strands A and B, forming a hairpin at one extremity of the β-sandwich. Strands A and E are connected by a disulfide bridge between cysteine residues 9 and 80. The refined electron density map suggested the presence of glycosylation at Asn-34 but was insufficient to be able to model the glycan, probably because of flexibility of the sugars. The 3-fold crystallographic symmetry axis generates a tightly associated trimer (Fig. 4B). Strand C plays a special role in the trimerization because the first half (amino acids 45–50) participates in a strong hydrophobic cluster with the amino acids in the N- and C-terminal regions of the neighboring monomer, while its second half (52–56) creates a β-sheet with facing strand D (Fig. 5A). The disulfide bridge between monomers is centered on a 2-fold axis with the involvement of two facing Cys-42 residues that are located on one loop of the monomer, close to both the N and C termini, creating a very elongated, tail-to-tail type of dimer (Fig. 5B). The resulting rod-shaped hexameric molecule (trimers of dimers) is shown in Fig. 4C. The Monosaccharide Binding Site—Complexes obtained for HPA from co-crystallization with GalNAc produced prismatic crystals of space group H32 (a = b = 48.4 Å, c = 286.2 Å). Again, the asymmetric unit consists of one monomer and the hexamer is created by the 3-fold and 2-fold axes. The overall hexameric structure is very similar to that of native HPA, albeit with a few degrees difference in the orientation of one trimer relative to the other. In this high resolution structure (1.3 Å), electron density could be detected for one GalNAc residue in each monomer (Fig. 6A) in a binding site away from the dimerization interface. In addition, one Zn2+ cation is present close to the GalNAc binding site (Fig. 6B). This cation lies on a special position on the 2-fold axis of symmetry and is hexacoordinated by one nitrogen from the side chain of His-84, the two oxygen atoms of one acetate ion, and the symmetry equivalents of these three atoms. The presence of this cation occurred in only one commercial lot of protein and is likely due to an exposure of living snails to metal ions, because these animals have the capacity to accumulate metals (including zinc) in their midgut gland and other organs (37.Dallinger R. Wieser W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1984; 79: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The presence of the divalent cation is accidental but promoted intermolecular contacts that yielded a different space group and higher resolution. The GalNAc binding site consists of a shallow pocket at the interface between two monomers (Fig. 6C) made up by part of the long loop connecting strands A and B, the extremities of strands D and E of the same monomer, and of strands C and F of the neighboring one. Eight hydrogen bonds are observed between the monosaccharide and the protein (Table 3. The axial O4 oxygen is the most buried and establishes three hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg-63, Trp-83, and Asp-55 from the neighboring monomer. Arg-63 is also hydrogen bonded to the GalNAc ring oxygen O5 and to O6. This O6 atom of the hydroxymethyl moiety is directed inside the site and interacts with the side chains of Asn-61 and Asp-55 of the second monomer. The oxygen O3 forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain oxygen of Gly-24 and bridges through a water molecule to the side chain of Arg-25. The carbonyl oxygen of the sugar N-acetyl group is hydrogen bonded to the Gly-24 main chain nitrogen. Interestingly, the methyl group of GalNAc is not involved in any hydrophobic contacts. Such contacts are rather limited because only the CH2 group of C6 makes van der Waals contacts with Tyr-89 of the neighboring monomer and the CH group of C1 with His-84.TABLE 3Contacts between HPA and GalNAcGalNAcHPADistances (Å)Hydrogen bonds O7Asp-26 N2.95 O3Gly-24 O2.79Wat1aBridging to Arg-25 NE.2.80 O4Trp-83 NE12.93Asp-55 OD2bNeighboring monomer.2.67Arg-63 NE3.00 O5Arg-63 NH22.88 O6Asn-61 ND12.84Asp-55 OD1bNeighboring monomer.2.62Arg-63 NH23.24Van der Waals C1His-84 C6Tyr-89bNeighboring monomer.a Bridging to Arg-25 NE.b Neighboring monomer. Open table in a new tab The reported higher affinity for αGalNAc can therefore be attributed to two main contributions. First, three hydrogen bonds are established with the axial O4 oxygen, therefore creating higher affinity for monosaccharides with the galacto configuration. Second, His-84 establishes a strong contact with C1 and sterically favors the occurrence of the α-anomer at this position. N-Glycosylation Site—In the highest resolution crystal structure, i.e. the HPA·GalNAc complex, the refined electron density map confirmed the presence of glycosylation at Asn-34. Only the first GlcNAc could be unambiguously located. The density was not sufficient to be able to model the whole oligosaccharide, probably due to flexibility of the sugars located in the solvent channel between HPA hexamer. Structural Similarities with Other Proteins—Although many lectins adopt a β-sandwich, or β-barrel fold, none of them has the same topology and binding site location as HPA. The β-sandwich fold with six strands arranged in a Greek key is shared by a large number of protein domains adopting the so-called immunoglobulin-like fold, and structural similarity searches result in a large list of crystal structures of unrelated function. Most of them include one or more additional strands. Disulfide bridges creating tail-totail dimers of β-sandwiches have been previously observed in HSP 90 co-chaperone p23 although with a different connectivity of the strands in each monomer (38.Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23045-23052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The trimeric arrangement is reminiscent of that observed in another lectin involved in innate immunity, the fucose binding agglutinin from Anguilla anguilla eel (AAA) (39.Bianchet M.A. Odom E.W. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar). The β-barrel of AAA has a different fold than HPA, and the binding site also has an unrelated architecture and specificity. Nevertheless, the presentation of three binding sites on the flat surface formed by the association of the three monomers has strong similarities with distances between the sites going from 20 Å for HPA to 25 Å for AAA. Occurrence of HPA-like Proteins—When searching databases, the peptide sequence that presents the highest identity with HPA (60%) is the recently characterized CH-IIL, the Gal-NAc binding lectin from the albumin gland of the garden snail Cepaea hortensis (40.Gerlach D. Schlott B. Zahringer U. Schmidt K.H. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). HPA also has homology, albeit lower (54%), with a sequence deposited by the same group and described as H. pomatia lectin (Q575S3_HELPO). Because this latter sequence is much closer to the C. hortensis lectin sequence (81% identity), it would appear to be from a different snail subspecies than the one from which the commercial lectin is available. The three gastropod lectins have a similar size and are predicted to share the same hexameric arrangement because the cysteine residue involved in making the intermolecular disulfide bridge is conserved as displayed in the alignment of Fig. 7. SLL-2, a lectin isolated from the octocoral Sinularia lochmodes, also displays significant similarity in both size (94 amino acids) and sequence (23–25%, depending on the isoforms) to HPA. This galactose-specific lectin is involved in the surface recognition of symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, and the sequence has been shown to be related to the C-terminal region of discoidins (41.Jimbo M. Koike K. Sakai R. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These proteins, which mediate the intercellular cohesiveness of D. discoideum cells, are developmentally regulated lectins with a binding preference for GalNAc for discoidin-1 and for Gal or GalNAc for discoidin-2 (42.Frazier W.A. Rosen S.D. Reitherman R.W. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7714-7721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of all of the HPA-like invertebrate lectins or lectin domains is shown in Fig. 7. The similarity is stronger in the C-terminal region, and all of the amino acids that are necessary for binding to O4 of galactose (Asp, Arg, and Trp) are strictly conserved. There are more variations in the region predicted to correspond to the first β-strand and the long loop. This loop, which in HPA is responsible for binding the N-acetyl group of GalNAc, has the same length in the other gastropod lectins and in discoidin-1, which all bind GalNAc, but is shorter in coral lectins and in discodin-2, which are reported to bind preferentially to galactose. Because of its specificity and multimeric molecular architecture, the HPA lectin appears to be a powerful weapon to agglutinate pathogens. Although the oligosaccharide target recognized by HPA on the surface of pathogens has not yet been identified, its specificity is close to that of tachylectin-2 that binds to GlcNAc and GalNAc and recognizes staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides from several Gram-negative bacteria (6.Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). N-Acetyl groups are very frequently observed in active substances present on pathogen surfaces and are now referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The architecture of HPA brings two sets of three binding sites on opposite hydrophilic and charged faces of the molecule in an architecture that allows two bacteria to be bound at the same time, therefore promoting aggregation and efficient protection of the snail eggs."

Purification of YKL-40 from resorbing bovine nasal cartilage and chondrocyte monolayers demonstrated the existence of three isoforms, a major and minor form from resorbing cartilage and a third species from chondrocytes. Affinity chromatography experiments with purified YKL-40 demonstrated specific binding of all three forms to collagen types I, II, and III, thus identifying collagens as potential YKL-40 ligands. Binding to immobilized type I collagen was inhibited by soluble native ligand, but not heat-denatured ligand, confirming a specific interaction. Binding of the chondrocyte-derived species to type I collagen was also demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis, and the dissociation rate constant was calculated (3.42 × 10-3 to 4.50 × 10-3 s-1). The chondrocyte-derived species was found to prevent collagenolytic cleavage of type I collagen and to stimulate the rate of type I collagen fibril formation in a concentration-dependent manner. By contrast, the cartilage major form had an inhibitory effect on type I collagen fibrillogenesis. Digestion with N-glycosidase F, endoglycosidase H and lectin blotting did not reveal any difference in the carbohydrate component of these two YKL-40 species, indicating that this does not account for the opposing effects on fibril formation rate.

Furthermore, one study has indicated that persistently high serum YKL-40 levels are associated with a risk of radiological disease progression in early RA (44Johansen J.S. Stoltenberg M. Hansen M.

Macrophages appear to be the principal source of synovium-derived YKL-40, although it is also expressed at a much lower level by the synovial fibroblasts (14Kirkpatrick R.B. Emery J.G. Connor J.R.

Immunohistochemical studies have shown that YKL-40 is present in the cytoplasm of arthritic chondrocytes, but not in the surrounding cartilage matrix (36Volck B. Østergaard K. Johansen J.S.

In osteoarthritic cartilage, YKL-40 positive chondrocytes are more abundant when histopathological changes are evident and they are also particularly prominent in areas with a considerable biomechanical load (36Volck B. Østergaard K. Johansen J.S. Garbarsch Price P.A. Scand. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 28: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In early OA, YKL-40 expression is confined primarily to the superficial zone, but spreads to the remaining middle and deep zones as disease progresses (48Connor J.R. Dodds R.A. Emery J.G. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Gowen M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is absent from healthy cartilage from young adults, but sparse expression is sometimes found in healthy cartilage from older adults (36Volck B. Østergaard K. Johansen J.S. Garbarsch Price P.A. Scand. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 28: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting deterioration of the tissue with age. Chondrocytes appear to rapidly synthesize large amounts of YKL-40 in response to an altered biochemical and/or biomechanical environment, because newly established explant cultures of healthy human cartilage do not produce YKL-40, but secretion as a major protein occurs after a few days of culture (4Hakala B.E.

The exact functions of YKL-40 in joint destruction and connective tissue turnover in general, remain unclear. In particular, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the identity of physiological ligands. A vertebrate enzyme (DG42) has been identified which may catalyze the synthesis of chito-oligosaccharides (49Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4523-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and it is also possible that short chito-oligosaccharides are used as primers for hyaluronan synthesis (49Semino C.E. Specht C.A.

Recently, YKL-40 has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of connective tissue cells through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B-mediated signaling pathways (52DeCeuninck F.

J. 2002; 365: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The cellular receptors responsible for mediating these effects have not yet been identified and cell surface HS moieties are potential candidates for this role. YKL-40 also stimulates the directional migration and tubulogenesis of endothelial cells (54Malinda K.M. Ponce L. Kleinman H.K. Shackelton L.M. Millis A.J.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and the adhesion and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (55Nishikawa K.C. Millis A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and dampens the response of chondrocytes and synovial cells to inflammatory cytokines (56Ling H. Recklies A.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the molecules with which it interacts to elicit these effects are also unknown. A clearer understanding of the exact physiological ligands with which YKL-40 interacts is therefore critical to uncovering its precise role and functions in vivo. Although carbohydrate structures are implicated by the existing evidence, it has not yet been conclusively demonstrated that these actually serve as YKL-40 ligands, either in cell culture models, or in vivo and the existence of protein ligands has not been reported. In this study, we describe the ability of YKL-40 to bind collagen, thus identifying this important extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecule as a novel, non-carbohydrate ligand. The physiological role of this interaction is also"

In this study we investigated whether protein C (PC) activation by thrombin on the endothelial cell surface may be linked to efficient protective signaling. To minimize direct thrombin effects on endothelial permeability we used the anticoagulant double mutant thrombin W215A/E217A (WE). Activation of PC by WE on the endothelial cell surface generated APC with high barrier protective activity. Comparable barrier protective effects by exogenous APC required a 4-fold higher concentration of APC. To demonstrate conclusively that protective effects in the presence of WE are mediated by APC generation and not direct signaling by WE, we used a PC variant with a substitution of the active site serine with alanine (PC S360A). Barrier protective effects of a low concentration of exogenous APC were blocked by both wildtype PC and PC S360A, consistent with their expected role as competitive inhibitors for APC binding to EPCR. WE induced protective signaling only in the presence of wild type PC but not PC S360A and PAR1 cleavage was required for these protective effects. These data demonstrate that the endogenous PC activation pathway on the endothelial cell surface is mechanistically linked to PAR1-dependent autocrine barrier protective signaling by the generated APC.

Thrombin plays a key role in the blood coagulation system because it not only activates platelets and clots fibrinogen but also initiates the anticoagulant protein C (PC) 2The abbreviations used are: PC, protein C; APC, activated protein C; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EPCR, endothelial protein C receptor; PAR, protease activated receptor; WE, double mutant thrombin W215A/E217A; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NAP, nematode anticoagulant protein.2The abbreviations used are: PC, protein C; APC, activated protein C; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EPCR, endothelial protein C receptor; PAR, protease activated receptor; WE, double mutant thrombin W215A/E217A; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NAP, nematode anticoagulant protein. pathway. When thrombin binds to its receptor thrombomodulin on the surface of endothelial cells it loses its procoagulant functions and generates activated PC (APC) (1.Esmon C.T.

Endothelial PC receptor (EPCR) binds both PC and APC and activation of EPCR-bound PC by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex is enhanced (3.Esmon C.T. Xu J. Gu J.M. Qu D. Laszik Z. Ferrell G.

The generated APC in turn degrades cofactors Va and VIIIa that are required for efficient prothrombin activation, providing critical negative feedback regulation of thrombin generation. Intravenous infusion of recombinant APC reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis (4.Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S.

It is likely that many, if not all of these effects, require binding of APC to EPCR and activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) on the endothelial surface. Specifically activation of the thrombin receptor PAR1 is required for APC signaling in endothelial cells (7.Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W.

Compared with thrombin, APC is a very inefficient PAR1 activator, and recent studies indicate that some PAR1-dependent responses of endothelial cells such as gene induction and barrier disruption require ∼104-fold higher concentrations of APC than thrombin (13.Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 16.Ludeman M.J. Kataoka H. Srinivasan Y. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our previous results demonstrate that low concentrations of APC (∼1 nm) have powerful PAR1-dependent endothelial barrier protective effects that can be recapitulated by incubation with very low (∼40 pm) but not higher concentrations of thrombin (13.Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that APC-PAR1 signaling may protect in systemic inflammation precisely because APC is a relatively inefficient PAR1 activator. Whereas intravenous infusion of APC has protective effects that are not entirely explained by its anticoagulant function, it is currently unknown whether the endogenously generated APC has an anti-inflammatory or other protective role in addition to its well established function as an antithrombotic agent. How can activation of the prototypical thrombin receptor PAR1 on endothelial cells by endogenously generated APC be relevant if the generation of APC is thrombin-dependent and thrombin is a much more efficient PAR1 activator? Compared with APC the half-life of thrombin in the circulation is very short (17.Lollar P. Owen W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and one possibility is that APC acts on endothelial cells that are not exposed to thrombin and are thus not involved in the activation of PC. However, the APC concentration in normal plasma is only 20–40 pm (18.Gruber A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 2340-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Liaw P.C. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and this APC would have to compete for EPCR binding with PC, which circulates in plasma at ∼80 nm (20.Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Zimmerman T.S. Kleiss A.J. Wideman C. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 21.Heeb M.J. Schwarz H.P. White T. Lammle B. Berrettini M. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Res. 1988; 52: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to induce endothelial cell signaling. Although at sites in close proximity to ongoing clotting higher local APC concentrations may be achieved while PC is depleted, an intriguing other possibility is that autocrine APC signaling is directly coupled to the process of zymogen activation, especially given that EPCR binding supports both PC activation and APC signaling. Accordingly, we set out in the present study to determine whether protective signaling by endogenously generated APC is enhanced compared with exogenous APC. We used a thrombin variant with higher relative specificity for PC activation to demonstrate that the endogenous PC activation pathway is indeed linked to efficient PAR1-dependent barrier protective signaling, indicating that the generated APC can be directly channeled into the protective signaling pathway.

Cell Culture—The transformed human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 (28.Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Cora Edgell (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Cells were grown to confluence in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and grown according to the manufacturer's recommendations. APC Activity Assay—APC activity was measured by adding 50 μl of conditioned medium to 100 μl of HEPES-buffered saline containing 100 nm hirudin to block thrombin. 50 μl of the APC substrate S-2366 (diaPharma) or Spectrozyme PCa (#336; American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT) was added to obtain a final substrate concentration of 0.25 mm, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by analyzing the change in absorbance at 405 nm over time (milliunits at A405 nm/min) at room temperature using a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Xa activity was determined in control experiments using Spectrozyme Xa (American Diagnostica). Permeability Assay—Macromolecular monolayer permeability was analyzed in a dual chamber system using Evans Blue-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) as described previously (13.Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 23.Feistritzer C. Lenta R. Riewald M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 2798-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, EA.hy926 cells were plated on Transwell polycarbonate membranes of 3-μm pore size and 12-mm diameter (Costar, Corning, NY). The upper and lower chambers were filled with 500 and 1500 μl of growth medium, respectively. Cells were grown for 2 days to obtain a monolayer with less well established cell-cell contacts (“subconfluent cells”) or for 3–4 days to obtain a tight monolayer (“confluent cells”). Agonists were added in serum-free medium containing 0.4% BSA (Calbiochem) and permeability was assayed 3 h later using 0.67 mg/ml Evans Blue (Sigma) diluted in growth medium containing 4% BSA. Fresh growth medium was added to the lower chamber, and the medium in the upper chamber was replaced with Evans Blue/BSA. After 10 min the optical density at 650 nm was measured in a 1:3 diluted 50-μl sample from the lower chamber. For thrombin treatment of the monolayers, medium was removed, and 5 nm thrombin was added for 10 min in serum-free medium followed by analysis of permeability. Analysis of Mitogen-activated Protein (MAP) Kinase Activation—MAP kinase phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting of whole cell lysates using an anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (Erk1/2) antibody (#9101; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) in an enhanced chemiluminescence-based detection system as described (7.Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 13.Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Staining with anti-actin (Sigma) served as loading control. Statistical Analysis—A two-tailed t test was used to calculate the indicated p values. APC Generation on the Endothelial Cell Surface—When EA.hy926 endothelial cells were incubated in the presence of 80 nm purified human PC and different concentrations of thrombin a dose-dependent linear increase in amidolytic activity toward a chromogenic APC substrate was observed over time in the culture medium (Fig. 1A). The amidolytic activity was identified as APC using the activity blocking monoclonal anti-PC antibody C1 (21.Heeb M.J. Schwarz H.P. White T. Lammle B. Berrettini M. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Res. 1988; 52: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). C1 reduced the activity of purified APC as well as the generated amidolytic activity to 10–15% of control without C1, whereas the amidolytic activity of factor Xa was not affected by C1 (results not shown). No detectable amidolytic activity was generated in the absence of either PC or cells (data not shown), demonstrating cell surface-dependent APC generation in our assay. The activity of 10 nm exogenously added APC decreased only slightly under the conditions of the assay (92% of the initial amidolytic activity of 34 milliunits at A405 nm/min after 3 h). Some APC generation was consistently observed in the absence of exogenous thrombin, even when the cell layer had been extensively washed. The rate of this APC generation increased over time, and it was blocked by both hirudin and the factor Xa inhibitor NAP5 (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of factor Xa with NAP5 did not affect PC activation by exogenously added thrombin in this assay (data not shown), and all subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 1 μm NAP5 to allow a strict control of the thrombin concentration in the system. Barrier Protective Effects in Response to Low Dose Thrombin in the Presence and Absence of PC—We have previously shown in a dual chamber system measuring albumin flux that incubation with very low concentrations of thrombin (∼40 pm) can increase barrier integrity of a subconfluent layer of endothelial cells and can protect a confluent monolayer from barrier disruption by a higher dose of thrombin. This protective effect was not mediated by receptor desensitization (13.Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). to test whether endogenously generated APC can support barrier protection in response to even lower concentrations of thrombin, we incubated confluent cells with 10–40 pm thrombin in the absence and presence of PC. Consistent with our previous results, 40 pm thrombin was barrier protective, whereas a significant protective effect in response to 20 pm thrombin was found only in the presence of PC (Fig. 1B). Although these results are consistent with the hypothesis that barrier protective effects of low dose thrombin and generated APC are additive, they also indicate that it will be difficult to compare protective effects of exogenous and endogenously generated APC in this system because the thrombin concentrations required to support APC generation are similar to the concentrations that lead to direct barrier protective effects. WE Supports PC Activation at Concentrations That Do Not Induce Direct Signaling—The double mutant thrombin WE has a higher relative specificity for thrombomodulin-dependent PC activation than for PAR1 activation compared with the wild type in a purified system using human PC/rabbit thrombomodulin and a soluble PAR1 fragment corresponding to the extracellular portion of the receptor (24.Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because relative specificities on the cell surface in the presence of cofactors could be different, PC activation and PAR1-dependent signaling were analyzed on the endothelial cells. In this system, WE was almost 100-fold less active than wild type thrombin for PC activation (Fig. 2A). However, the PAR1-dependent induction of MAP kinase phosphorylation required more than 1000-fold higher concentrations of the thrombin mutant (Fig. 2B). Thus, 2–10 nm WE lead to significant APC generation without directly inducing PAR1-dependent signaling. As shown in Fig. 2C, incubation in the presence of up to 16 nm WE did indeed not lead to barrier protective effects in the dual chamber system. These results suggest that the mutant thrombin may allow the analysis of protective signaling by endogenously generated APC in the absence of direct thrombin signaling. Efficient Barrier Protective Signaling in Response to WE in the Presence of PC—Cells were incubated with a series of different concentrations of either WE in the presence of 80 nm PC or exogenous APC. After 3 h, the APC concentration in the cell medium and barrier integrity of the monolayer were measured (Fig. 3). The lowest concentration of WE that induced a significant barrier protective response in the presence of PC was 2 nm, and 1.3 nm APC was generated under these conditions (Fig. 3D). For a similarly effective response 5 nm exogenous APC was required. Thus, based upon the amount of APC present after the 3-h incubation, protective signaling by WE in the presence of PC is about four times more efficient compared with exogenous APC. Importantly, APC is generated from PC at a constant rate during the incubation period while exogenous APC loses some activity. Therefore, the differential between exogenous and endogenously generated APC is at least 8-fold when the average APC concentrations during incubation are compared. We used HAECs to confirm that these results are not a specific property of the endothelial EA.hy926 cell line. These cells formed a tight and thrombin-responsive monolayer in our dual chamber system and exogenous APC was barrier protective at concentrations of 2 nm and higher. HAECs supported PC activation at a somewhat lower rate (∼20%) compared with EA.hy926 cells, presumably because thrombomodulin expression is lower. Barrier protective signaling in response to 2 nm exogenous APC and 2 nm WE in the presence of 80 nm PC was comparably effective (Fig. 4). WE in the absence of PC had no effect. Only 0.2 nm APC were generated on HAECs during the 3-h incubation with 2 nm WE/80 nm PC. Thus, the results are consistent with those shown in Fig. 3, and they demonstrate that enhanced signaling by endogenously generated APC is not an anomalous property specific for the EA.hy926 cell line. Taken together, these data suggest that the endogenous PC activation pathway is indeed linked to efficient protective signaling. However, additional control experiments are required to rule out two alternative explanations that involve direct signaling by WE in the presence of PC: (i) direct protective signaling by WE may be enhanced in the presence of the substrate PC independent from APC generation, and (ii) subthreshold direct signaling by WE may potentiate signaling by APC.FIGURE 4Efficient barrier protective signaling in response to endogenous APC generation on HAECs. Confluent HAECs were incubated for 3 h with WE in the absence and presence of PC or with exogenous APC as indicated. Permeability was tested before (open bars) and after (closed bars) an additional 10-min incubation with 5 nm thrombin. APC activity in the upper chamber after the 3-h incubation was determined using the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme PCa. Means ± S.E. are shown (n = 6; *, p < 0.05 compared with control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Barrier Enhancement by APC Is Mechanistically Coupled to the Endogenous PC Activation Pathway—Recombinant wild type PC and a PC variant with a substitution of the active site serine with alanine (PC S360A) were used to address these possibilities. Control experiments demonstrated that after activation of the zymogens, recombinant wild type APC was similarly effective as plasma APC in our permeability system, and as expected, the proteolytically inactive APC S360A was ineffective (Fig. 5). Cells were incubated without PC (control), with wild type PC, or with PC S360A, in the presence or absence of WE (4 nm) and exogenous APC as indicated in Fig. 6. A low concentration of exogenous APC (3.3 nm) was used, and barrier protective effects of exogenous APC were blocked by both wild type PC and PC S360A, consistent with the expected role of zymogen PC as a competitive inhibitor for APC binding to EPCR. Incubation with exogenous APC in the presence of PC S360A actually led to a slight increase of permeability that barely reached statistical significance. WE induced protective signaling only in the presence of wildtype PC but not PC S360A, demonstrating that WE does not lead to barrier enhancement in the presence of the substrate PC unless proteolytically active APC can be generated. Finally, there was no protective effect by the combination of 3.3 nm exogenous APC and WE in the presence of PC S360A. Incubation with WE in the presence of wild type PC led to the generation of only 0.9 nm APC, and the barrier protective effects were therefore not mediated by additive direct effects of WE and APC. Taken together, these data conclusively demonstrate that efficient barrier enhancement by APC is indeed mechanistically coupled to the endogenous PC activation pathway.FIGURE 6Mechanistic coupling of PC activation and barrier protective signaling by APC. Confluent EA.hy926 cells were incubated with control or 80 nm recombinant wild type PC or PC S360A in the upper chamber as indicated. In each group 4 nm WE and 3.3 nm APC were also present either alone or in combination. After 3 h, APC activity in the upper chamber was determined using the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme Pca, and permeability was tested before (open bars) and after (closed bars) an additional 10-min incubation with 5 nm thrombin. Shown are means ± S.E. (n = 8; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005 compared with no agonist).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PAR1 Cleavage Is Required for Barrier Protective Signaling by Endogenously Generated APC—Preincubation with cleavage blocking antibodies against PAR1 had no effect on APC generation but blocked barrier protective effects of the endogenously generated APC (Fig. 7). Hyperpermeability in response to the PAR1 agonist peptide was analyzed in these experiments because in contrast to thrombin the cleavage independent PAR1 agonist peptide can disrupt barrier integrity in the presence of the blocking antibodies (13.Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, barrier protective responses not only to exogenous APC but also to endogenously generated APC are dependent on cleavage of PAR1. Using a thrombin variant with a relative specificity that favors PC activation, we demonstrate that the endogenous PC activation pathway on the endothelial cell surface is linked to PAR1 cleavage dependent autocrine barrier protective signaling by the generated APC. When APC is generated endogenously, the concentration of solution phase APC close to the endothelial cell surface carrying the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex is expected to be higher than the average concentration measured in the cell medium. Is it possible that the elevated local concentration is the reason why signaling by endogenously generated APC is enhanced? Barrier protection was obtained in our system when 1.3 nm APC were generated during the 3-h incubation (Fig. 3). The volume in the upper chamber is 500 μl, and thus, 3.9 × 1011 molecules APC were generated. About 50,000 cells constitute the cell layer on the transwell membrane (1 cm2). Because the rate of APC generation is constant over time (Fig. 1), it can be calculated from these numbers that one cell generates APC in our system at a rate of about 700 molecules/s. Francis and Palsson (29.Francis K. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12258-12262Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have developed mathematical models of diffusion for protein molecules secreted from cells and the maximal local concentration of solution phase APC directly above the cell surface at this rate of generation can be estimated to be on the order of only 0.1–0.5 nm higher than the average concentration in the supernatant, still much lower than the concentration of exogenous APC (5 nm) that was required for a similarly efficient protective response. In addition, solution phase APC generated endogenously would have to compete with 80 nm zymogen PC for EPCR binding to induce signaling. Therefore, our results cannot be explained by effects of the local concentration, and we conclude that protective signaling by APC is mechanistically linked to PC activation. The Kd for the interaction of both PC and APC with EPCR is about 30 nm (30.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Liaw P.C. Mather T. Oganesyan N. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8364-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, at the PC plasma concentration of ∼80 nm a large fraction of the endothelial cell surface EPCR is expected to be PC-bound. EPCR-PC is activated by thrombomodulin-thrombin, and our data indicate that the generated APC can activate PAR1 while still bound to EPCR. Thus, at least part of the endogenously generated APC can be directly channeled into the PAR1-dependent signaling pathway. Previous data demonstrating that PAR1 signaling by EPCR-bound exogenous APC is rapidly induced (32.Domotor E. Benzakour O. Griffin J.H. Yule D. Fukudome K. Zlokovic B.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 4797-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that the half-life of EPCR-bound PC as analyzed by surface plasmon resonance is approximately 9 s (33.Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are consistent with this conclusion. Could it be that the PC pathway and not thrombin may emerge as the relevant activator of endothelial cell PAR1 in response to low thrombin concentrations? Thrombin activity in vivo is rigorously controlled to prevent excessive platelet activation/fibrin formation. It is difficult to estimate thrombin concentrations that may be present at the endothelial cell surface in vivo, but a series of studies in PAR-deficient mice suggest that thrombin is generated during hemostasis and thrombosis at concentrations just above threshold levels for PAR activation. In mouse platelets PAR4 cleavage is required for thrombin signaling and PAR3 acts as a non-signaling cofactor that recruits thrombin and decreases the concentration required for half maximal signaling between 6- and 15-fold (34.Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, PAR3- and PAR4-deficient mice showed similar degrees of bleeding time prolongation and protection in thrombosis models, indicating that an about 10-fold decrease in platelet responsiveness to thrombin has the same effect as complete unresponsiveness (35.Sambrano G.R. Weiss E.J. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 36.Weiss E.J. Hamilton J.R. Lease K.E. Coughlin S.R. Blood. 2002; 100: 3240-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In our in vitro experiments the lowest concentrations of wild-type thrombin that supported detectable PC activation and direct PAR1-dependent signaling were similar (∼20 pm). However, it is possible that in vivo low concentrations of thrombin preferentially lead to PC activation and PAR1-dependent protective signaling by the endogenously generated APC. Thrombin binding to thrombomodulin blocks the PAR1-interactive exosite I of thrombin, and blood flow could affect the relative efficiency of thrombin for thrombomodulin binding versus PAR1 cleavage. In addition, thrombin inhibitors and substrates, foremost fibrinogen, that occupy exosite I of thrombin are present in plasma at a high concentration and may shift thrombin responses from PAR1 toward PC pathway activation. Na+ binding to thrombin is required for efficient cleavage of PAR1 whereas PC activation by thrombin proceeds relatively normal in the presence of low Na+ concentrations (37.Dang O.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The Na+ concentration close to thrombus formation may be relatively low (38.Owen W.G. Bichler J. Ericson D. Wysokinski W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9277-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), again potentially favoring PC relative to PAR1 activation by thrombin in the endothelial microenvironment. The concept that thrombin may be able to initiate protective PC pathway signaling without activating PARs is also supported by in vivo evidence. Infusion of a low concentration of wild type thrombin leads to activation of the PC pathway and blocks the lethal inflammatory response to endotoxin in animal models without eliciting platelet activation, a highly sensitive PAR-dependent response (39.Taylor Jr., F.B. Chang A. Hinshaw L.B. Esmon C.T. Archer L.T. Beller B.K. Thromb. Res. 1984; 36: 177-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40.Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In a recent study, no difference in PAR1 cleavage was observed in response to a range of thrombin concentrations in the presence and absence of PC, indicating that locally generated APC did not contribute to PAR1 cleavage beyond that effected by thrombin (16.Ludeman M.J. Kataoka H. Srinivasan Y. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In these experiments cleavage of an overexpressed tagged PAR1 construct in transiently transfected endothelial cells was analyzed. It is possible that compared with the endogenous receptor the overexpressed PAR1 is less susceptible to cleavage by EPCR-APC. PAR1 cleavage by APC is restricted by the coreceptor requirement for EPCR, whereas thrombin is expected to directly bind and cleave the overexpressed PAR1, even on cells with a very high level of the overexpressed receptor. In addition, in this study fairly high thrombin concentrations (>100 pm) were required to generate detectable conversion of PC to APC, suggesting that thrombomodulin and/or EPCR expression might have been relatively low, again favoring PAR1 cleavage by thrombin compared with APC. Our findings raise the possibility that through endogenous APC generation the infusion of WE may induce more powerful protective effects in patients with sepsis than exogenous APC. Previous data from a baboon model indicate that WE infusion can be antithrombotic without detectable prothrombotic activity or bleeding complications (41.Gruber A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Hanson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27581-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that WE can be safely administered in vivo. Protective signaling in response to WE would be expected to depend on an intact capacity to activate PC on endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that both thrombomodulin and EPCR expression on endothelial cells in purpuric skin lesions is reduced in children with meningococcal sepsis (42.Faust S.N. Levin M. Harrison O.B. Goldin R.D. Lockhart M.S. Kondaveeti S. Laszik Z. Esmon C.T. Heyderman R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Expression levels were variable, and compared with thrombomodulin the loss of EPCR was on average less pronounced, suggesting that even endothelial cells with a strongly down-regulated ability to endogenously activate PC may still respond to the EPCR-dependent protective signaling by exogenous APC. Consistent with these results, Liaw et al. (43.Liaw P.C. Esmon C.T. Kahnamoui K. Schmidt S. Kahnamoui S. Ferrell G. Beaudin S. Julian J.A. Weitz J.I. Crowther M. Loeb M. Cook D. Blood. 2004; 104: 3958-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the PC level and the ability to generate APC vary widely and independently in adult patients with severe sepsis. Therapy in patients with sepsis could be tailored to different subgroups based upon the PC level in plasma and the capacity for PC activation as follows. (i) Patients with a relatively normal capacity to activate PC might benefit from WE infusion to trigger powerful barrier protective effects through the endogenous PC activation pathway. Zymogen PC could be substituted in the subgroup of patients with low PC levels. (ii) On the other hand, patients with more severe disease and lower PC activation capacity may be more likely to respond to exogenous APC. Clinical studies suggest that only patients with severe sepsis and a high but not low risk of death respond favorably to therapy with exogenous APC (4.Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher C.J. N. Engl. J.

At least part of the reason for this finding may be that patients with a high risk of death are also expected to have on average lower levels of circulating PC and less competition for EPCR binding. A higher dose of APC may be required for protective effects in patients with relatively high PC levels and infusion of a variant APC with reduced anticoagulant, but normal anti-inflammatory activity (25.Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) may help prevent hemorrhagic complications in these patients. In addition, especially in this group of patients a variant of APC with increased affinity to EPCR would be expected to be beneficial. It is difficult to measure the capacity for APC generation in patients. In the study by Liaw et al. (43.Liaw P.C. Esmon C.T. Kahnamoui K. Schmidt S. Kahnamoui S. Ferrell G. Beaudin S. Julian J.A. Weitz J.I. Crowther M. Loeb M. Cook D. Blood. 2004; 104: 3958-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) the ability to activate PC was estimated in different patients by measuring F1 + 2 (a marker for thrombin generation) and APC levels. A low APC level despite elevated F1 + 2 levels suggested that the ability to activate PC is impaired. However, the plasma level of APC and/or F1 + 2 is dependent not only on the generation but also on clearance rates of these markers, which may vary in different patients. In addition, the half-life of thrombin in the circulation is very short (17.Lollar P. Owen W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and it is important to keep in mind that an estimate of APC generation capacity based upon these markers applies only for endothelial cells where sufficient concentrations of thrombin are present in the microenvironment to actually support PC activation. It is therefore possible that WE infusion can support PC activation even in patients with elevated F1 + 2 levels and a low APC level by targeting endothelial cells that are not exposed to the thrombin generated endogenously. In conclusion, our finding that powerful autocrine barrier protective signaling is mechanistically linked to the endogenous PC activation pathway has important implications for novel approaches to treat systemic inflammation in patients.

The mechanisms whereby acid reflux may accelerate the progression from BE to EA are not known. We found that NOX1 and NOX5-S were the major isoforms of NADPH oxidase in SEG1-EA cells. The expression of NOX5-S mRNA was significantly higher in these cells than in esophageal squamous epithelial cells. NOX5 mRNA was also significantly higher in Barrett tissues with high grade dysplasia than without dysplasia. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased H2O2 production in both SEG1-EA cells and BE mucosa, which was blocked by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. In SEG1 cells, acid treatment increased mRNA expression of NOX5-S, but not NOX1, and knockdown of NOX5 by NOX5 small interfering RNA abolished acid-induced H2O2 production. In addition, acid treatment increased intracellular Ca2+ and phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Acid-induced NOX5-S expression and H2O2 production were significantly inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and by knockdown of CREB using CREB small interfering RNA. Two novel CREB-binding elements TGACGAGA and TGACGCTG were identified in the NOX5-S gene promoter. Overexpression of CREB significantly increased NOX5-S promoter activity. Knockdown of NOX5 significantly decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation, which was restored by 10−13 m H2O2. Knockdown of NOX5 also significantly decreased retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and increased cell apoptosis and caspase-9 expression. In conclusion, in SEG1 EA cells NOX5-S is overexpressed and mediates acid-induced H2O2 production. Acid-induced NOX5-S expression depends on an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of CREB.

Knockdown of NOX5 significantly decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation, which was restored by 10−13 m H2O2. Knockdown of NOX5 also significantly decreased retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and increased cell apoptosis and caspase-9 expression. In conclusion, in SEG1 EA cells NOX5-S is overexpressed and mediates acid-induced H2O2 production. Acid-induced NOX5-S expression depends on an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of CREB. NOX5-S contributes to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased in incidence over the past 3 decades (1.Blot W.J. Devesa S.S. Kneller R.W. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1991; 265: 1287-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar), at a rate exceeding that of any other cancer in the last 10 years (2.Howe H.L. Wingo P.A.

Oncol. 1999; 26: 2-8PubMed Google Scholar). Esophageal adenocarcinoma is characterized by a uniformly poor prognosis, with a median survival time following diagnosis of less than 18 months, and a 5-year survival rate of less than 20% in operable tumors (4.Thomas P. Doddoli C. Lienne P. Morati N. Thirion X. Garbe L. Giudicelli R. Fuentes P. Br. J. Surg. 1997; 84: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 2The abbreviations used are: GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; Fura 2AM, 1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-2-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxy]-2-(2′-amino-5′-methylphenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid pentaacetoxymethyl; BE, Barrett esophagus; CREB, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein; EA, esophageal adenocarcinoma; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; LCM, laser capture microdissection; NOX, NADPH oxidase; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. complicated by Barrett esophagus (BE) (5.Lagergren J. Bergstrom R. Lindgren A. Nyren O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of GERD patients develop BE, where esophageal squamous epithelium damaged by acid reflux is replaced by a metaplastic, intestinal type epithelium. The specialized intestinal metaplasia of BE is associated with a 30-125-fold increased risk for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, with the best estimates of cancer incidence of about 0.5-1.0% per year, i.e. one cancer per 100-200 patients for each year of observation (6.Kim R. Weissfeld J.L. Reynolds J.C. Kuller L.H. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 1997; 6: 369-377PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Haggitt R.C. Hum. Pathol. 1994; 25: 982-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 8.Wild C.P. Hardie L.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A middle-aged individual with BE for 20 years or more has an estimated 10-20% lifetime risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is similar to the risk of lung cancer among heavy smokers or of liver cancer among chronic hepatitis B virus carriers (8.Wild C.P. Hardie L.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of the progression from metaplasia to adenocarcinoma are not fully understood. Acid reflux may play an important role in the progression from metaplasia to dysplasia and to adenocarcinoma in patients with BE because of the following. 1) Cultured biopsy specimens of intestinal metaplastic cells demonstrate a significant increase in tritiated thymidine uptake when explants are briefly exposed to acid (9.Fitzgerald R.C. Omary M.B. Triadafilopoulos G. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2120-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). 2) Long term inhibition of esophageal acid exposure by administration of proton pump inhibitors to patients with BE has been shown to decrease proliferation of metaplastic cells (10.Ouatu-Lascar R. Fitzgerald R.C. Triadafilopoulos G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 327-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). 3) A prospective study has shown that proton pump inhibitor treatment significantly reduces the incidence of dysplasia in BE patients when compared with no therapy or treatment with H2 receptor antagonist (11.El-Serag H.B. Aguirre T.V. Davis S. Kuebeler M. Bhattacharyya A. Sampliner R.E. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2004; 99: 1877-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby acid reflux accelerates this progression are not known. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be an important factor mediating acid reflux-induced damage. ROS may damage DNA, RNA, lipids, and proteins, leading to increased mutation and altered functions of enzymes and proteins (e.g. activation of oncogene products and/or inhibition of tumor suppressor proteins) (12.Ohshima H. Tatemichi M. Sawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 13.Farhadi A. Fields J. Banan A. Keshavarzian A. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2002; 97: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of ROS are present in BE (14.Olyaee M. Sontag S. Salman W. Schnell T. Mobarhan S. Eiznhamer D. Keshavarzian A.

In addition, ROS levels are elevated, and antioxidant defenses are decreased in the metaplastic cells (14.Olyaee M. Sontag S. Salman W. Schnell T. Mobarhan S. Eiznhamer D. Keshavarzian A. Gut. 1995; 37: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15.Wetscher G.J. Hinder R.A. Klingler P. Gadenstatter M. Perdikis G. Hinder P.R. Dis. Esophagus. 1997; 10: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as evidenced by the reduced levels of glutathione and vitamin C and decreased activity of superoxide dismutase (15.Wetscher G.J. Hinder R.A. Klingler P. Gadenstatter M. Perdikis G. Hinder P.R. Dis. Esophagus. 1997; 10: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17.Fountoulakis A. Martin I.G. White K.L. Dixon M.F.

Besides metaplastic cells, other cells in BE mucosa may also produce ROS and affect metaplastic cells. Low levels of ROS, seen in nonphagocytic cells, were thought to be by-products of aerobic metabolism. More recently, however, superoxide-generating homologues of phagocytic NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit gp91phox (NOX1, NOX3-NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2) and homologues of other subunits (p41phox or NOXO1 and p51phox or NOXA1) have been found in several cell types (18.Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar, 19.Banfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H.

Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), suggesting that ROS generated in these cells may have distinctive cellular functions related to immunity, signal transduction, and modification of the extracellular matrix. Two types of NOX5 have been described as follows: NOX5-S and NOX5-L (21.Vignais P.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). NOX5-L has EF-hand motifs at its N terminus (22.Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), whereas NOX5-S does not (23.Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). NOX5-L has the following four isoforms: α, β, δ, and γ (22.Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Whether these NADPH oxidases play a role in acid-induced H2O2 production has not been established, and the transcription factor responsible for NOX5 expression is not known. We now show that NOX5-S is the major isoform of NADPH oxidase present in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells and that NOX5-S contributes to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of SEG1 esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. To our knowledge we are the first to report that cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is responsible for acid-induced expression of NOX5-S mediating acid-induced production of H2O2. Cell Culture and Acid Treatment—Human esophageal squamous HET-1A cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in the bronchial epithelial cell medium (BEGM BulletKit, Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) containing a basal medium (BEBM) plus the additives (BEGM SingleQuots®) in wells precoated with a mixture of 0.01 mg/ml fibronectin, 0.03 mg/ml vitrogen 100, and fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human Barrett adenocarcinoma cell lines SEG1 were derived from human esophageal Barrett adenocarcinomas (24.Hughes S.J. Nambu Y. Soldes O.S. Hamstra D. Rehemtulla A. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Beer D.G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5571-5578PubMed Google Scholar) and generously provided by Dr. David Beer. These cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. For acid treatment, cells were exposed to acidic DMEM, pH 4.0, DMEM (calcium-free and 1 mm EGTA), pH 4.0, or normal DMEM (control) for 1 h, washed, and cultured in fresh medium (pH 7.2, without phenol red) for an additional 24 h. The culture medium and cells were collected for measurements. Acidic DMEM (pH 4.0, 300 μl) was added to each well in a 12-well plate, and the final pH was about 4.9 after a 1-h incubation. Mucosal Organ Culture—Endoscopic mucosal biopsies were obtained from patients with documented BE undergoing endoscopy for cancer surveillance. As clinically recommended, one biopsy was taken from each quadrant every 2 cm in the entire length of the Barrett esophagus. All mucosal samples were divided in half using an aseptic technique. One-half was used for histology and examined by a pathologist; the other half was placed immediately in ice-cold culture medium and transported to the laboratory. BE mucosa confirmed to be intestinal metaplasia by pathological examination were used for the studies. The experimental protocols were approved by the Human Research Institutional Review Committee at Rhode Island Hospital. Biopsies were cultured as described previously (25.Trier J.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; 365-384Google Scholar, 26.Shirvani V.N. Ouatu-Lascar R. Kaur B.S. Omary M.B. Triadafilopoulos G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 487-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, BE mucosal biopsy specimens were randomly assigned to acid, acid plus apocynin, acid plus vehicle, or control groups. The biopsy specimens were placed on a sterilized stainless wire mesh (Flynn & Enslow, Inc., San Francisco) within a Falcon center-well organ culture dish (BD Biosciences) so that culture medium (0.9 ml) just covered the surface of the biopsy. Organ culture dishes were then placed on racks in the modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA) and perfused with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide and then cultured at 37 °C. Organ culture was performed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 μg/ml insulin, CaCl2 (1.377 mm), glutamine (2 mm), glucose (3.66 mg/ml), 500 units/ml streptomycin, and 250 units/ml penicillin. The final concentration of calcium in the medium was 1.8 mm. BE mucosal biopsy tissues were first equilibrated in culture for 2 h and then exposed to acidic medium, pH 4.0, acidic medium with apocynin (10−4 m), or control medium, pH 7.2, for 1 h. After washing twice, BE mucosa biopsies were cultured in fresh medium without phenol red, pH 7.2, for an additional 24 h. For the apocynin and vehicle group, apocynin (10−4 m) or vehicle was added to the culture medium in this additional 24-h culture. Finally, the culture medium was collected for measurement of H2O2, and the levels of H2O2 were normalized for protein content. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—Twenty-four hours before transfection at 40-50% confluency, cells were trypsinized and diluted 1:5 with fresh medium without antibiotics (1-3 × 105 cells/ml) and transferred to 12-well plates (1 ml per well). Transfection of siRNAs was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 75 pmol of siRNA duplex of NOX5 or CREB or scrambled siRNA formulated into liposomes were applied per well; the final volume was 1.2 ml per well. After a 4-h transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with regular medium. 12 h later, cells were exposed to acidic medium, washed, and cultured in fresh medium (pH 7.2, without phenol red) for an additional 24 h. Finally, the culture medium and cells were collected for measurements. Transfection efficiencies were determined by fluorescence microscopy after transfection of Block-it fluorescent oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) and were about 90% at 48 h. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for the cultured cells and extracted by RNAqueous kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) for the biopsy tissues according to the protocols of the manufacturers. 1.5 μg of total RNAs from cultured cells or 0.5 μg of total RNA from tissues were reverse-transcribed by using a kit SUPERSCRIPT™ firststrand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), or a Sensiscript RT kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively.

Three primers (3R for RT and 4R and 5R for nested PCR) were used to amplify the 5′ end of NOX5 using a 5′-RACE kit (Invitrogen). PCR products were gelextracted and sequenced by W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT). Construction of NOX5-S Reporter Plasmid Construct—The fragment (-1396 to -6 from ATG) of the NOX5-S promoter was amplified by PCR by using SEG1-EA cell genomic DNA as template with the primers containing an XhoI restriction site at the 5′ end and an HindIII restriction site at 3′ end. The primers used for the PCR were AAACTCGAGACAGGTAGCTGGCTTCACCCAG and AAAAAGCTTCGGGGAAGCGCTGCAGCTCGTC. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and HindIII, and cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-Basic (Promega). Luciferase Assay—Twenty four hours before transfection, SEG1 EA cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Each well of cells was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μg of either pGL3-Basic (as no promoter control) or luciferase reporter plasmid containing the NOX5-S promoter fragment. In co-transfection experiments, 0.6 μg of CREB expression vector or pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen) was used. CREB expression vector was generously provided by Dr. Marc R. Montminy (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego) (27.Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was assayed 24 h after transfection. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells with lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined. The luciferase activities in the cell lysates were measured using luciferase assay substrate (Roche Applied Science) and normalized to protein content. Data reflect the fold change in luciferase activity in experimental cells over cells co-transfected with empty pGL3-Basic. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was carried out on a Stratagene Mx4000® multiplex quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used were specific for NOX1 as follows: sense 5′-TGGTCATGCAGCATTAAACTTT-3′ and antisense 5′-AAAACTCATTGTCCCACATTGG-3′; NOX5, sense 5′-AAGACTCCATCACGGGGCTGCA-3′ and antisense 5′-CCTTCAGCACCTTGGCCAGA-3′; GAPDH, sense 5′-CATGACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and antisense 5′-AGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. All reactions were performed in triplicate in a 25-μl total volume containing a 1× concentration of Brilliant® SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), each sense and antisense primer at 100 nm, 1 μl of cDNA, and 30 nm reference dye. Reactions were carried out in a Stratagene Mx4000® multiplex quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; one cycle at 94 °C for 1 min, and one cycle at 55 °C for 30 s. Fluorescence values of SYBR Green I dye, representing the amount of product amplified at that point in the reaction, were recorded in real time at both the annealing step and the extension step of each cycle. The Ct value, defined as the point at which the fluorescence signal was statistically significant above background, was calculated for each amplicon in each experimental sample using Stratagene Mx4000 software. This value was then used to determine the relative amount of amplification in each sample by interpolating from the standard curve. Transcript level of each specific gene was normalized to GAPDH amplification. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in Triton X lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined. Western blot was done as described previously (28.Cao W. Sohn U.D. Bitar K.N. Behar J. Biancani P. Harnett K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G86-G95Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, after these supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 30 V overnight. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies followed by 60 min of incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Detection was achieved with an enhanced chemilumines-cence agent (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were as follows: phospho-CREB antibody (Ser-133) (1:1000), CREB antibody (1:1000), normal rabbit IgG (1:1000), human caspase-9 monoclonal antibody (1:1000), phospho-Rb (Ser-780) antibody (1:1000), Rb antibody (1:1000), and GAPDH antibody (1:2000). NOX5 antibody prepared against a mixture of unique NOX5 peptides (NH2-YES-FKASDPLGRGSKRC-COOH; and NH2-YRHQKRKHTCPSCOOH) was generously provided by Dr. David Lambeth (29.Brar S.S. Corbin Z. Kennedy T.P. Hemendinger R. Thornton L. Bommarius B. Arnold R.S. Whorton A.R. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Krenitsky K. Ardie K.G. Lambeth J.D. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C353-C369Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Cytosolic Calcium Measurements—SEG1 cells were loaded with 1.25 μm Fura 2AM for 40 min and placed in a 5-ml chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The cells were allowed to settle onto a coverslip at the bottom of the chamber. The bathing solution is the HEPES-buffered solution, pH 7.4, containing 112.5 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 2.0 mm KH2PO4, 10.8 mm glucose, 24.0 mm HEPES (sodium salt), 1.9 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml BME amino acid supplement, and 0.08 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The Ca2+-free medium is the HEPES-buffered solution without CaCl2 but with 200 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), which completely blocked KCl-induced Ca2+ influx (30.Cao W. Vrees M.D. Kirber M.T. Fiocchi C. Pricolo V.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G833-G843Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When the Ca2+-free medium was used, bathing solution was changed twice with Ca2+-free medium after the cells had settled to the bottom of the chamber. Ca2+ measurements were obtained using a modified dual excitation wavelength imaging system (IonOptix Corp. Milton, MA) as described previously (31.Cao W. Chen Q. Sohn U.D. Kim N. Kirber M.T. Harnett K.M. Behar J. Biancani P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C980-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ratiometric images were masked in the region outside the borders of the cell because low photon counts give unreliable ratios near the edges. We developed a method for generating an adaptive mask that follows the borders of the cell as Ca2+ changes. A pseudoisosbestic image (i.e. an image insensitive to Ca2+ changes) was formed in computer memory from a weighted sum of the images generated by 340 nm excitation and 380 nm excitation. This image was then thresholded, i.e. values below a selected level were considered to be outside the cell and assigned a value of 0. For each ratiometric image, the outline of the cell was determined, and the generated mask was applied to the ratiometric image. This method allows the imaging of the changes in Ca2+. Our algorithm has been incorporated into the IonOptix software. This algorithm calculates the conversion of the ratios of fluorescence elicited by 340 nm excitation to 380 nm excitation to Ca2+ concentrations using techniques described in detail previously by Grynkiewicz et al. (32.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) following manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, SEG1 cells grown in plastic dishes for 2 days (∼1 × 106 cells) were treated with acidic medium, pH 4.0, for 1 h and then treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min to cross-link CREB to DNA. After removal of the formaldehyde, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% EDTA and protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture) and gently scraped into a conical tube, centrifuged for 5 min at 700 × g at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 400 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitors. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min, and the lysate was sonicated eight times for 10 s each time on ice to shear the genomic DNA to lengths of 0.2-1 kb. The debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was then diluted 10× with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 16.7 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors, pH 8.0). Five hundred microliters of the diluted lysate was kept for input control. The chromatin solution was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Anti-CREB (Upstate) antibody was added, respectively, to the supernatant fraction and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The mixture was then incubated with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 1 h at4°C with rotation. Normal rabbit IgG (Upstate) or c-Myc antibody (SeroTec, Raleigh, NC) was used instead of the specific antibody for the negative control. The protein A-agarose-antibodyhistone complex was pelleted by gentle centrifugation (1000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min). The pellet was washed sequentially (3-5 min per wash) on a rotating platform with 1 ml each of low salt washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), high salt washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), LiCl washing buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). After the final wash, the pellet was eluted by two 15-min incubations with 250 μl of freshly made elution buffer (1% SDS and 50 mm NaHCO3). Two fractions of elutes were combined, and 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to the supernatant. Crosslinking was reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h, followed by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 2 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K. The sample was incubated at 45 °C for 2 h, and DNA was then extracted by phenol chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of H2O, and 5 μl was used for PCR analysis. PCR was carried with the primer pairs that targeted the-1"

Mechanisms by which the Psp system detects the stress signal and responds have so far remained undetermined. Here we demonstrate that PspA and PspG directly confront a variety of inducing stimuli by switching the cell to anaerobic respiration and fermentation and by down-regulating motility, thereby subtly adjusting and maintaining energy usage and pmf. Additionally, PspG controls iron usage. We show that the Psp-inducing protein IV secretin stress, in the absence of Psp proteins, decreases the pmf in an ArcB-dependent manner and that ArcB is required for amplifying and transducing the stress signal to the PspF regulon. The requirement of the ArcB signal transduction protein for induction of psp provides clear evidence for a direct link between the physiological redox state of the cell, the electron transport chain, and induction of the Psp response. Under normal growth conditions PspA and PspD control the level of activity of ArcB/ArcA system that senses the redox/metabolic state of the cell, whereas under stress conditions PspA, PspD, and PspG deliver their effector functions at least in part by activating ArcB/ArcA through positive feedback.

Transcription of the PspF regulon in Escherichia coli, which consists of the pspABCDE operon and pspG gene, is driven by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase containing the alternative σ factor, σ54 (for review, see Refs. 1Model P.

PspF is constitutively expressed but is autogenously negatively regulated to maintain a low intracellular concentration (3Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Model P. J.

The psp operon and pspG are strongly induced in response to protein IV (pIV) 3The abbreviations used are: pIV, protein IV; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone; pmf, proton motive force; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; ΔΨ, electron potential; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodine. from filamentous phage and a number of pIV homologues, which are often secretins from type II and type III bacterial secretion systems (for review, see Refs. 1Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and 2Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). PspA is induced under conditions that block or reduce the efficiency of the protein export apparatus. Mutants in secA, secD, and secF, depletion of YidC, and mutations in components of the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway lead to PspA induction. Additionally, psp operon expression can be transiently induced by a variety of membrane-altering stresses including extreme heat shock (50 °C), hyperosmotic shock, ethanol treatment (10%), inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis, and exposure to hydrophobic organic solvents (7Kobayashi H. Yamamoto M. Aono R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or proton ionophores such as CCCP. In E. coli, PspB and PspC are absolutely required for the expression of the PspF regulon when induced with a secretin (for review, see Refs. 1Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and 2Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) but are only partially required when psp is induced by ethanol treatment or hyperosmotic shock and are not required for induction by extreme heat shock. The common factor that may link psp-inducing conditions is an uncoupling or depletion of the proton motive force (pmf). In E. coli PspF is a cytoplasmic protein, PspA is a peripheral inner membrane protein and resembles a coiled coil protein, PspB, PspC, and PspD are inner membrane proteins containing putative leucine zipper motifs, PspE is periplasmic, and PspG is predicted to be an integral inner membrane protein (Ref. 8Brissette J.L.

PspA specifically and directly binds to the AAA+ transcription activation domain of PspF, inhibiting pspA-E and pspG transcription (Ref. 9Elderkin S. Bordes, S. P. Jones M. Rappas Buck M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3238-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and for review, see Ref. 1Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol.

Under Psp inducing conditions, the interaction between PspA and PspF is disrupted, allowing activation of the pspA-E and pspG promoters (for review, see Ref. 2Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). With pIV, the inducing signal is transduced via PspB and PspC, positive regulators of psp transcription, and signal transduction is most likely achieved via protein-protein interactions (for review, see Ref. 1Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and 2Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). PspD, PspE, and PspG are not known to have any major involvement in psp transcription regulation. PspA acts as an effector of the psp system and is thought to serve to prevent proton loss during conditions where the psp operon is induced, but the precise mechanism used is unknown (for review, see Ref. 2Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). PspG is also thought to act as an effector of the Psp system (6Lloyd L.J. Jones S.E. Jovanovic G. Gyaneshwar P.

The psp operon genes are up-regulated during swarming in Salmonella typhimurium (10Wang Q. Frye J.G. McClelland M. Harshey R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and during biofilm formation in E. coli and are among the most highly up-regulated genes in S. typhimurium during macrophage infection. pspC mutants of Yersinia enterocolitica are severely attenuated for virulence during infection and exhibit growth defects when the type III secretion system is expressed (for review, see Ref. 2Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although regulation of the PspF regulon has been extensively studied, little is known about the biological function of the Psp proteins, and the nature of the signal transduction process involved in the induction of the Psp response remains undetermined. Here we have analyzed the roles of Psp proteins in E. coli under either normal or stress growth conditions (i) by using transcription profiling, (ii) by measuring cell motility, and (iii) by determining the electron potential component of pmf in individual E. coli cells. We have analyzed the signal transduction pathway required for the induction of the PspF regulon and identified ArcB as required for induction of Psp.

PspG peptide antibodies were generated by Eurogentec (Ougree, Belgium) against the sequence NH2-CAPKVPKYQRYDRWRY-COOH. β-Galactosidase Assay—Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing the appropriate antibiotic and diluted 100-fold into the same medium. After growth to mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.4) cultures were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described by Miller (15Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Motility Assay—Motility assays were carried out using motility agar SA (soft agar) (1% Tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.3% agar) with the appropriate antibiotic and 1 mm IPTG or 0.02% arabinose where required. 2 μl of a 10× concentrated LB culture at A600 ∼ 0.6 was pipetted into the motility agar, plates were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, and zones of motility were measured in millimeters (6Lloyd L.J.

Because growth rate and density of cells can influence the motility of bacteria, growth was measured after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24 h by A600 and counting the colony forming units. Numbers of cells used were adjusted to be the same, according to estimates of colony forming units. Microarray Analysis—Microarray experiments were as described (6Lloyd L.J. Jones S.E. Jovanovic G.

These experiments were performed in quadruplicate, consisting of two biological replicates and two technical replicates using PCR product microarrays printed at IFR (Norwich, UK). Bioinformatics—Microarray data were preprocessed to identify genes changing >2-fold in their differential expression level using GeneSpring 6.1 (Silicon Genetics), genes were ordered by expression level, and then separate genes or biologically linked sets of genes were tested for co-regulation phenotypes. We used a conservative approach to estimate an upper boundary for the p values; in each case we determined the minimum rank (maximum rank when testing for down-regulation) of the set of genes under consideration (e.g. the 43 flagellar genes) in the ordered list of n-fold increase in expression level (e.g. for the ΔpspA mutant the smallest relative expression level of a flagellar gene was ≈0.7, and this was the 3571th highest ratio of n = 4340 observed values). We calculated the probability of observing all m genes under consideration among the top n highest expression levels, which yields an upper boundary for the p value p ≤ (n/m)/(N/m) (for the flagellar genes in the ΔpspA mutant, this results in an upper bound for the p value of p < 0.0005). The alternative would be to use a histogram-based test or to estimate the density, which would also only be approximate, or would require computationally expensive simulations. Because the p value is only estimated, it is not straightforward to adjust for multiple comparisons. If we only consider the tests performed, then a simple Bonferroni corrections allowed us to consider sets of genes with p < 0.001 for further biological analysis and interpretation. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy to Assess Membrane Potential (ΔΨ)—The ΔΨ was measured as described by Becker et al. (18Becker L.A. Bang l.-S. Crouch M.-L. Fang F.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1004-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells from an overnight LB culture were subcultured into fresh LB and grown to an A600 of 0.8. 1 ml of culture was spun down and resuspended in 1 ml of permeabilization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose). 2 μl of 5 mg ml-1 JC-1 (Molecular Probes) was added for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were spun down and resuspended in 500 μl of permeabilization buffer. Microscope slides were prepared as described by Glaser et al. (19Glaser P. Sharpe M.E. Raether B. Perego M. Ohlsen K. Errington J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Fluorescent bacteria were examined using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a krypton/argon laser with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm. Leica confocal software (Leica Microsystems) was used to calculate the green/red fluorescence emission ratio from 100 individual cells taken from three independently grown cultures of each strain. Strategy for Experimental Design and Transcriptome Data Analysis—Previous results demonstrated that the transcriptome response of the PspF regulon after induction by pIV secretin overproduction is largely limited to the members of the PspF regulon (6Lloyd L.J. Jones S.E. Jovanovic G. Gyaneshwar P. Rolfe M.D. Thompson A. Hinton J.C. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55707-55714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting a fine-tuning adaptation of the cell to stress growth conditions. The main aim of this work was to determine whether there is a genetic program specific to the Psp response and so elucidate a possible biological function for this system. To assess whether the Psp proteins predicted to have an effector function, PspA and PspG, or with no ascribed function, PspD, exert their roles under normal growth conditions, we compared the transcriptome profiles of pspA, pspG, and pspD mutants to that of wild type cells. To analyze the transcriptome profiles of cells expressing Psp effectors at levels higher than those found for the Psp response under pIV inducing conditions, we overexpressed the Psp effectors PspA and PspG. We reasoned that a more pronounced expression of Psp effectors than seen under physiological conditions and in the absence of stimuli will force the cell to respond at a measurable level. We assumed that the stress-inducing stimulus acts to release the PspA-imposed negative regulation of the PspF regulon in a PspB/PspC-dependent manner and that subsequently intracellular levels of Psp effector proteins then increase. We identified genes that showed at least a 2-fold differential expression between wild type versus either ΔpspA or ΔpspD or ΔpspG cells and wild type versus wild type overproducing either PspA or PspG and with a p cut-off value of 0.05 (supplemental Tables 1-5). From this initial list we analyzed either single gene expression or used hierarchical clustering and self-organized maps to arrange genes in groups or clusters (based solely on the similarity of their gene expression and function) with a fold change ≥2 compared with expression in wild type cells and a p cut of value <0.001. The biological function of up-regulated (Up) or down-regulated (Down) genes or sets of genes is given in Table 2. By focusing on gene sets (groups of genes that share common biological function or regulation), we successfully revealed the changes occurring in orchestrated gene expression underlying the basic cellular processes controlled by PspA, PspD, and PspG. All genes referred to here are annotated on the Eco-Cyc™ web site.TABLE 2Microarray analyses A, gene groups up-regulated (Up), down-regulated (Down), or not affected (NA) in MG1655ΔpspA (ΔpspA), MG1655ΔpspD (ΔpspD), MVA40 (ΔpspG) strains compared to MG1655 (wild type). -Fold change with respect to wild type cells is presented in parentheses. B, gene groups Up, Down, or NA in strains overexpressing PspA (from pPB10 in MG1655) or PspG (from pLL11 in MG1655) compared to MG1655 wild type carrying control vector plasmid pBAD18-cm. -Fold change with respect to wild type cells carrying control vector is presented in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Transcriptional Profiles of ΔpspA, ΔpspD, and ΔpspG Mutants—To compare the transcription profile of wild type (MG1655) cells to that of cells lacking the pspA gene (MG1655ΔpspA; a non-polar deletion of pspA), to cells lacking the pspD gene (MG1655ΔpspD), or to cells lacking the pspG gene (MVA40), MG1655, MG1655ΔpspA MG1655ΔpspD, and MVA40 were grown to A600 0.6-0.8, and cells were harvested for RNA extraction. The deletion mutants did not show any growth rate defects or reduced yields of cells compared with the wild type strain, establishing that these deletion mutations are not toxic to the cell (data not shown). The results of this transcriptome analysis are presented in Table 2A and supplemental Tables 1-3. The microarray data of ΔpspA, ΔpspD, and ΔpspG clearly show for the first time that the protein products of pspA, pspD, and pspG function under normal growth conditions and not only after encountering stress, since relative changes in gene expression are Psp-dependent and are apparent without any added inducing stimulus or stress present. The transcriptional profiles of ΔpspA and ΔpspD are strikingly similar (Table 2A and supplemental Table 1 and 2), and so it is likely that PspA and PspD have overlapping functions or might work synergistically. A possible synergistic relationship between PspA and PspD is further reasoned by results from motility assays and ΔΨ measurements (see below). In general, ΔpspD cells showed more pronounced up-regulation of all genes affected compared with ΔpspA cells (Table 2A). The transcription profile of ΔpspG cells does not show any clear similarity to the profiles of ΔpspA and ΔpspD cells with only a small set of genes significantly changing (Table 2A and supplemental Table 3). Microarray analyses showed increased levels of pspB, pspC, pspD, pspE, and pspG transcripts in cells lacking pspA compared with wild type (supplemental Table 1). Comparing the transcription profile of wild type cells to cells lacking pspD or to cells lacking pspG, the level of transcription of the psp genes remained constant (supplementary Tables 2 and 3), establishing that PspD or PspG do not control transcription from the psp operon or pspG promoters under normal growth conditions (6Lloyd L.J.

The level of pspF transcription remained constant in all three experiments, consistent with control of Psp being exerted at the level of PspF activity (3Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5232-5237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear from the transcriptional profiles of ΔpspA and ΔpspD cells that there is up-regulation of genes involved in the motility of bacteria (Table 2A). These genes include the fliA, flhC, and flhD flagellar master regulators, genes for flagellar function and biosynthesis, and chemotaxis genes including tar, tap and tsr receptors. In ΔpspG cells, transcription of flagellar genes remains unchanged compared with the wild type, consistent with the observation that ΔpspG cells do not show changes in motility compared with wild type cells (6Lloyd L.J.

Genes glpF, glpK, and glpD involved in the uptake and metabolism of glycerol during the most efficient aerobic respiration reaction, “glycerol shift,” in ΔpspA and ΔpspD cells are up-regulated compared with wild type (Table 2A). In ΔpspD the gene encoding putative oxidoreductase, ydhY, which is predicted to contain a Fe-S cluster and be involved in aerobic respiration, is highly up-regulated, and the putative pmf-dependent transporter (yghK) is up-regulated in ΔpspG cells (Table 2A). Notably, in ΔpspA and ΔpspD cells expression of the arcB gene is up-regulated (Table 2A). The up-regulation of ArcB can deactivate ArcA-P (20Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the inactivation of ArcA can then cause up-regulation of genes involved in aerobic respiration (such as glpD).

https://openalex.org/W1968962291,"Sall1 is a multi-zinc finger transcription factor that represses gene expression and regulates organogenesis. In this report, we further characterize the domain of Sall1 necessary for repression. We show that endogenous Sall1 binds to the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase corepressor complex (NuRD) and confirm the functionality of the Sall1-associating macromolecular complex by showing that the complex possesses HDAC activity. NuRD is involved in global transcriptional repression and regulation of specific developmental processes. The mechanism by which sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins associate with NuRD is not well understood. We have identified a highly conserved 12-amino acid motif in the transcription factor Sall1 that is sufficient for the recruitment of NuRD. Single amino acid substitutions defined the critical amino acid peptide motif as RRKQ<i>X</i>K-P<i>XX</i>F. This motif probably exhibits a more general role in regulating gene expression, since other proteins containing this domain, including all Sall family members and an unrelated zinc finger protein Ebfaz, mediate transcriptional repression and associate with NuRD. These results also have important implications for the pathogenesis of Townes-Brocks, a syndrome caused by SALL1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2066735039,"Activation by diazoxide and inhibition by 5-hydroxydecanoate are the hallmarks of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels. Opening of these channels is thought to trigger cytoprotection (preconditioning) through the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, we found that diazoxide-induced oxidation of the widely used reactive oxygen species indicator 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein in isolated liver and heart mitochondria was observed in the absence of ATP or K<sup>+</sup> and therefore independent of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. The response was blocked by stigmatellin, implying a role for the cytochrome <i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex (complex III). Diazoxide, though, did not increase hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) production (quantitatively measured with Amplex Red) in intact mitochondria, submitochondrial particles, or purified cytochrome <i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex. We confirmed that diazoxide inhibited succinate oxidation, but it also weakly stimulated state 4 respiration even in K<sup>+</sup>-free buffer, excluding a role for K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Furthermore, we have shown previously that 5-hydroxydecanoate is partially metabolized, and we hypothesized that fatty acid metabolism may explain the ability of this putative mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker to inhibit diazoxide-induced flavoprotein fluorescence, commonly used as an assay of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity. Indeed, consistent with our hypothesis, we found that decanoate inhibited diazoxide-induced flavoprotein oxidation. Taken together, our data question the ""mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channel"" hypothesis of preconditioning. Diazoxide did not evoke superoxide (which dismutates to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) from the respiratory chain by a direct mechanism, and the stimulatory effects of this compound on mitochondrial respiration and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation were not due to the opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels."

Munc13s are essential for priming synaptic vesicles to a fusion competent state, and their specific active zone localization contributes to the active zone restriction of transmitter release and the speed of excitation-secretion coupling. However, the molecular mechanism of the active zone recruitment of Munc13s is not known. We show here that the active zone recruitment of Munc13 isoforms Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 is regulated by their binding to the Rab3A-interacting molecule RIM1α, a key determinant of long term potentiation of synaptic transmission at mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus. We identify a single point mutation in Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 (I121N) that, depending on the type of assay used, strongly perturbs or abolishes RIM1α binding in vitro and in cultured fibroblasts, and we demonstrate that RIM1α binding-deficient ubMunc13-2I121 is not efficiently recruited to synapses. Moreover, the levels of Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 levels are decreased in RIM1α-deficient brain, and Munc13-1 is not properly enriched at active zones of mossy fiber terminals of the mouse hippocampus if RIM1α is absent.

The release of neurotransmitters at chemical synapses between nerve cells is spatially restricted to specialized compartments of the axonal plasma membrane. These so called active zones, at which exocytosis takes place in a temporally highly coordinated manner, are typically localized in axon terminals, face the postsynaptic signal reception apparatus, and consist of electron-dense, insoluble proteinaceous material (1Rosenmund C.

Most presynaptic axon terminals contain hundreds of vesicles that are clustered in close proximity of the active zone. Usually, only a fraction of vesicles docked at the active zone are in a fusion-competent primed state, and only these primed vesicles, which are referred to as the readily releasable pool, can fuse with the plasma membrane in response to an elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The readily releasable vesicle pool represents a reservoir that allows a synapse to repetitively release neurotransmitters during bursts of action potentials, and its size determines synaptic release probability and signaling capacity (1Rosenmund C.

These interactions between active zone components are likely to serve functions beyond mere recruitment and anchoring of the active zone protein complement. Rather, the active zone protein network is thought to be responsible for the temporal coordination of synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and fusion, and for the spatial restriction of these processes to the active zone subdomain of the presynaptic plasma membrane (1Rosenmund C. Rettig J. Brose N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The molecular processes that are mediated by individual active zone-specific proteins are in most cases still unknown. An exception are the members of the Munc13 family of essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins, Munc13-1, ubMunc13-2, bMunc13-2, and Munc13-3. Studies on deletion mutant mice showed that in the absence of Munc13s, synaptic vesicle priming is abolished, resulting in a complete block of spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission (31Augustin I.

Hippocampal neurons lacking RIM1α exhibit reduced synaptic vesicle priming, altered short term synaptic plasticity, and changes in evoked asynchronous transmitter release (25Calakos N. Schoch S.

In addition to its role in basal synaptic transmitter release, RIM1α is essential for long term potentiation (LTP) 2The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; RIM, Rab3A-interacting molecule; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; RIM, Rab3A-interacting molecule; GST, glutathione S-transferase. of synaptic transmission at mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus and at parallel fiber synapses in the cerebellum (23Castillo P.E.

Both types of LTP are expressed presynaptically and require the activity of protein kinase A, and protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of RIM1α is necessary for the expression of mossy fiber LTP (24Lonart G.

This role of RIM1α in mossy fiber LTP appears to be critical for cognitive functions as RIM1α-deficient mice exhibit severely impaired learning and memory (41Powell C.M. Schoch S. Monteggia L.

Whereas the evidence for a functional interaction of Munc13s and αRIMs in vivo is extensive, the exact role of this interaction is not known. The currently available data are compatible with a role of αRIMs in both, anchoring and direct regulation of Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2. In the present study, we determined the role of RIM1α in the synaptic recruitment of Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2. Our data show that RIM1α regulates the active zone recruitment of Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2. Identification of RIM Binding-deficient ubMunc13-2 Mutants—αRIM binding-deficient ubMunc13-2 constructs were generated by random mutagenesis and reverse yeast two-hybrid screening using a LexA/VP16 reporter system with L40 as the yeast reporter strain (30Betz A.

For that purpose, the αRIM-binding yeast two-hybrid bait construct pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181), which encodes LexA in-frame with residues 1-181 of ubMunc13-2 and represents the minimal αRIM binding region of ubMunc13-2 (30Betz A.

PCR products were subcloned into pLexN to generate a library of mutant pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)mut constructs in-frame with N-terminal LexA. This library was used in a reverse yeast two-hybrid screen with pPrey-RIM1α(1-344), which encodes VP16 in-frame with residues 1-344 of RIM1α and contains the binding site for Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 (30Betz A.

Using this approach, we isolated 26 RIM1α binding-deficient pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)mut constructs, 18 of which contained nonsense mutations. In addition to these nonsense mutants, we identified eight αRIM binding-deficient pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)mut constructs that carried one or several missense mutations (Fig. 1C). In cases of constructs carrying multiple missense mutations, individual mutations were introduced into pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181) using QuikChange (Stratagene) and analyzed separately for their effects on RIM1α binding in yeast two-hybrid screens. Using this approach, we identified a total of six missense mutations (pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)T22I, pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)T22A, pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)Y23N, pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)H119R, pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)I121N, and pLexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)P169L) that abolished binding of LexN-ubMunc13-2(1-181)mut to VP16-RIM1α(1-344) (Fig. 1, C and D). As all affected residues are conserved in the αRIM binding regions of ubMunc13-2 and Munc13-1 (Fig. 1B), the second αRIM binding Munc13 isoform, 4 homologous mutations were introduced individually into a previously characterized (30Betz A.

As was the case with the corresponding ubMunc13-2 constructs, all these LexN-Munc13-1(1-150)mut constructs failed to bind VP16-RIM1α(1-344) in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1E). The Munc13-1 mutations T22I, H119R, I121N, and P168L, and the ubMunc13-2 mutations T22I, I121N, and P169L were analyzed further in biochemical binding assays, whereas the consequences of the I121N mutation were further analyzed in the context of full-length Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 function. All DNA manipulations were verified by sequencing. Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Bacterial expression vectors encoding GST in-frame with the RIM1α binding N termini of Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 were constructed in pGex-KG (pGEX-Munc13-1(3-317) and pGEX-ubMunc13-2(3-320)) (43Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Mutant variants (pGEX-Munc13-1(3-317)T22I, pGEX-Munc13-1(3-317)H119R, pGEX-Munc13-1(3-317)I121N, pGEX-Munc13-1(3-317)P168L, pGEX-ubMunc13-2(3-320)T22I, pGEX-ubMunc13-2(3-320)I121N, and pGEX-ubMunc13-2(3-320)P169L) were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene). The Munc13 binding Zn2+ finger region of RIM1α was expressed as a His-tagged bacterial fusion protein from a pET32c expression vector (Novagen) (pET-RIM1α(131-214)). Mammalian expression vectors encoding full-length Munc13-1, Munc13-1I121N, ubMunc13-2, and ubMunc13-2I121N with C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tags were constructed in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) using a combination of previously published cDNA fragments (28Brose N.

The I121N mutation in the full-length pEGFP-N1 expression constructs was generated by replacement of part of the wild-type sequence with mutated cDNA fragments from the corresponding pGEX-KG vectors. Lentivirus expression vectors encoding ubMunc13-2 variants in-frame with a C-terminal EYFP tag (ubMunc13-2-EYFP and ubMunc13-2I121N-EYFP) were constructed in pRRLsinPPT-CMV-WPRE (44Follenzi A.

Cosedimentation Assays—For cosedimentation experiments using synaptosomal extracts, crude synaptosomes from rat brain were solubilized at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% sodium cholate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. After stirring on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (60 min at 250,000 × gmax). The equivalent of 4 mg of total extracted protein was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg of GST-Munc13 fusion protein, immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Beads were then washed three times with solubilization buffer containing 0.1% sodium cholate. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 μlof SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblots for native αRIMs were performed using a monoclonal anti-αRIM antibody (Transduction Laboratories). For cosedimentation assays using purely recombinant His-RIM1α(131-214), the His-tagged proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The assay procedure was as described above for native RIM1α from crude synaptosomes, with the exception that 1% Triton X-100 was used for solubilizing bacterially produced His-RIM1α(131-214) and a monoclonal anti-His6 antibody (Qiagen) was used for immunoblotting. Expression of Munc 13s and RIM1α and Assay of Phorbol Ester-dependent Protein Translocation in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells grown on glass coverslips coated with 0.5% gelatin in 6-cm dishes were transfected with pEGFP-Munc13-1, pEGFP-Munc13-1I121N, pEGFP-ubMunc13-2, pEGFP-ubMunc13-2I121N, or pCMV5-RIM1α, either using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (45Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer 24 h after transfection. The Munc13 fusion proteins were visualized directly by the EGFP signal, and RIM1α was detected using indirect immunofluorescence with a monoclonal anti-RIM1α antibody and a secondary Alexa 594-conjugated antimouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). For the analysis of phorbol ester-induced protein translocation, HEK293 cells were transfected with Munc13 and RIM1α expression constructs 2 days prior to the experiment, as described above. The medium was changed before the experiment, and 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (Sigma) was added from an acetone stock solution directly to the cell culture (100 nm final concentration). Cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Munc13s and RIM1α were detected as described above.

Expression of LpxR in the E. coli K-12 strain W3110 results in a significant production of 3′-O-deacylated lipid A species but does not affect growth. Orthologues of S. typhimurium LpxR are found in the genomes of several other Salmonella species, including both typhi and paratyphi, as well as several other Gram-negative pathogens. The function of LpxR is not known; however, partial 3′-O-deacylation of lipid A might be advantageous during infection, allowing S. typhimurium to evade the innate immune response by remodeling its lipid A. Materials—32Pi and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Silica gel 60 (0.25 mm) thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from Merck. Chloroform, ammonium acetate, and sodium acetate were obtained from EM Science. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco. The bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit and Triton X-100 were from Pierce. All other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from either Sigma or Mallinckrodt. Bacterial Strains—The bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table 1. Typically, bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (28Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Transformation-competent cells of E. coli were prepared by the method of Inoue et al. (30Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). When required, E. coli cells were prepared for electroporation by the method of Sambrook and Russell (29Sambrook J.G. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated using the Qiagen Spin Prep kit. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. Genomic DNA was isolated using the protocol for bacterial cultures in the Easy-DNA™ kit (Invitrogen). T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen), restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs), and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed with an ABI Prism 377 instrument at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility. Primers were purchased from MWG-Biotech. Screening of a S. typhimurium Genomic DNA Library for the 3′-O-Deacylase—A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library generated from genomic DNA of the S. typhimurium strain LT2 and harbored in an E. coli K-12 background was obtained from the Salmonella Genetic Stock Center (University of Calgary). Each of the 71 BAC clones harbors the pBeloBAC11 vector (31Shizuya H. Birren B. Kim U.J. Mancino V. Slepak T. Tachiiri Y. Simon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8794-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) with inserts of S. typhimurium genomic DNA. The BAC clones were grown in 5 ml of LB medium with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an A600 ∼ 1.0. The membrane fraction of each BAC clone was prepared as previously described (32Reynolds C.M. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21202-21211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and assayed for 3′-O-deacylase activity. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Construction of lpxR Expression Vectors—S. typhimurium lpxR, formerly STM1328, was cloned into pET23a (Novagen) behind the T7 promoter. The predicted coding region for lpxR was amplified by PCR from S. typhimurium strain LT2 genomic DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The forward primer contained a clamp region, an NdeI site (underlined), and the lpxR-coding region with its start codon (bold). The reverse primer contained a clamp region, a BamHI site (underlined) and the coding region with its stop codon (bold). Sequences of the forward and reverse primers were 5′-GCGCGCCATATGAACAAATACAGCTATTGCGCAACG-3′ and 5′-GCGCGCGGATCCTCAGAAGAAGAAGGTGATGTCTCC-3′, respectively. The PCR product and the vector were both digested with NdeI and BamHI, ligated together, and transformed into XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene) for propagation of the plasmid, designated pLpxR1. For some experiments, pLpxR1 was used directly for LpxR expression in E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) (Table 1). Alternatively, the lpxR gene was transferred from pET23a to pWSK29 (33Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), a lac-inducible, low-copy expression vector. The XbaI/BamHI-digested fragment, consisting of the lpxR gene as well as the pET23a-derived ribosome binding site, was ligated to the corresponding restriction sites of pWSK29. This plasmid, designated pLpxR2, was then transformed into competent E. coli W3110 or S. typhimurium LT2. Heterologous Expression of Salmonella LpxR—E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) harboring either the pET23a vector or pLpxR1 were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.4. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 1 mm was then added, and the cultures were shifted to 25 °C for 4 h more. Washed membranes were prepared as previously described (32Reynolds C.M. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21202-21211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and stored in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, at −80 °C. Cultures of W3110 harboring either pWSK29 or pLpxR2 were grown at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside present throughout the growth. Cells were harvested when the A600 of the cultures reached 1.0, and washed membranes were prepared as previously described (32Reynolds C.M. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21202-21211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Membranes were also prepared from LB-grown cultures of S. typhimurium LT2 grown without CaCl2 or in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 using the methods described above. Preparation of Radiolabeled and Carrier Substrates—The 4′-32P-labeled lipid IVA was generated from 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and the disaccharide 1-phosphate lipid acceptor using the overexpressed 4′-kinase present in membranes of E. coli BLR(DE3)/pLysS/pJK2 (18Trent M.S.

Kdo2-4′-32P-labeled lipid IVA was prepared by adding purified E. coli Kdo transferase (WaaA) immediately after the 4′-kinase reaction (35Basu S.S. York J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Carrier Kdo2-lipid IVA was synthesized in vitro by WaaA-catalyzed Kdo additions to lipid IVA (40Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carrier Kdo2-lipid A was isolated from the heptose-deficient E. coli strain WBB06 (41Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), described previously (42Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Assay of the 3′-O-Deacylase—The 3′-O-deacylase activity of LpxR was assayed under optimized conditions in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm CaCl2, and either 10 μm Kdo2-4′-32P-labeled lipid A, Kdo2-4′-32P-labeled lipid IVA, or 4′-32P-labeled lipid IVA (each at 50,000 cpm/nmol) as the substrate. Washed membranes were employed as the enzyme source. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. Reactions were stopped by spotting 4-μl portions of the mixtures onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate, and the plate was dried under a cool air stream for 20 min. Reaction products were separated using the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v), whereas reactions containing Kdo2-4′-32P-labeled lipid IVA were analyzed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v). The reactions that were carried out with the hexa-acylated substrate, Kdo2-4′-32P-labeled lipid A, were analyzed in the solvent chloroform, methanol, water, acetic acid (25:15:4:4, v/v). After chromatography, the plates were dried, and radioactive substrates were detected using a GE Healthcare PhosphorImager (STORM 840) equipped with ImageQuant software. The enzyme units (nmol/min) were calculated by determining the percentage of the substrate converted to product. Purification of the Salmonella 3′-O-Deacylase in Vitro Reaction Product—A large scale 3′-O-deacylase reaction mixture was prepared by assembling the following components: 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 μm Kdo2-lipid A, and either 1 mg/ml S. typhimurium strain LT2 membranes or 0.1 mg/ml NovaBlue(DE3)/pLpxR1 membranes, as described below. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the membranes and incubated at 30 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was then converted into a two-phase Bligh/Dyer (43Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) system consisting of chloroform, methanol, and 0.1 m HCl (2:2: 1.8, v/v). The phases were separated by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 8 min. The organic phase was removed, and the resulting aqueous phase was extracted a second time by the addition of pre-equilibrated acidic organic phase. The organic phases were pooled and neutralized by the addition of a few drops of pyridine. The sample was dried by rotary evaporation, and lipids were fractionated using a DEAE cellulose anion-exchange column as previously described (44Kanipes M.I. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the desired lipid species were pooled and converted to an acidic two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture by the addition of appropriate amounts of chloroform and HCl. The organic phase was dried under a stream of N2 and stored at −80 °C. Separation of Inner and Outer Membranes—Membranes isolated from either W3110/pWSK29 or W3110/pLpxR2 were separated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation using previously described methods (45Guy-Caffey J.K. Rapoza M.P. Jolley K.A. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Each gradient fraction (0.5 ml) was assayed for NADH oxidase (inner membrane marker) and phospholipase A (outer membrane marker) (47Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The amount of protein in each fraction was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (48Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Each fraction was also assayed for 3′-O-deacylase activity using the standard conditions described above. Protein Microsequencing of LpxR—Inner and outer membranes of W3110/pWSK29 and W3110/pLpxR2 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a Bio-Rad Protean II XI apparatus with a 12% polyacrylamide, 1.5 mm thick gel (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). A piece of the gel containing LpxR was excised. The protein was blotted onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore) equilibrated in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% methanol at 15 V for 30 min using a Bio-Rad Semi-Dry apparatus. The blot was stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid for 1 min followed by destaining with 1% acetic acid for 10 min. The band corresponding to LpxR was excised, rinsed three times with distilled water, and analyzed by high sensitivity protein microsequencing at the Harvard Microchemistry and Proteomics Facility (Cambridge, MA). Large Scale Isolation of Lipid A from LpxR-expressing Cultures—Cultures of E. coli strain W3110 harboring either pWSK29 or pLpxR2 were grown in 1 liter of LB medium as described above. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min when the A600 reached 1.0. The cells were washed once with 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The final cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Lipid A was released from the LPS, purified as described previously (38Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J.

Lipid A was also prepared from CaCl2 (10 mm)-treated cultures of S. typhimurium strain LT2 harboring either pWSK29 or pLpxR2, as just described. Mass Spectrometry of Kdo2-Lipid A or Lipid A Samples— Spectra were acquired in the negative-ion linear mode using an AXIMA-CFR (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. The instrument was operated with a 20-kV extraction voltage and time-delayed extraction, providing a mass resolution of about ±1 atomic mass unit for compounds with a Mr of ∼2, 000. Each spectrum was the average of 100 laser shots. Samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis by depositing 0.3 μl of the lipid dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) followed by 0.3 μl of a saturated solution of 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile and 10% tribasic ammonium citrate (9:1, v/v) as the matrix. The samples were dried at room temperature before the spectra were acquired. Mass Spectrometry of the Released 3′-Acyloxyacyl Moiety— Spectra were acquired on a QSTAR XL quadrupole TOF tandem mass spectrometer (ABI/MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Spectra were acquired in the negative-ion mode and typically were the accumulation of 60 scans collected from 200-2000 atomic mass units. For mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, the extracted lipids were dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and infused into the ion source at 5-10 μl/min. The negative-ion ESI was carried out at −4200 V. Data acquisition and analysis was performed using the Analyst QS software. NMR Spectroscopy of 3′-O-Deacylated Lipid A—The lipid A of E. coli W3110 harboring pLpxR2 was isolated as described above and further purified by DEAE cellulose anion exchange chromatography (44Kanipes M.I. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fractions containing 3′-O-deacylated lipid A were pooled, and the lipid was extracted by conversion into a two-phase Bligh/Dyer system (43Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The lower phase was dried under a stream of N2, and 0.5 mg of the dried lipid was dissolved in 0.35 ml of CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O (2:3:1, v/v) in a 3-mm NMR tube. NMR spectroscopy was carried out at the Duke University NMR Spectroscopy Center. Proton chemical shifts are reported relative to tetramethylsilane at 0.00 ppm. NMR spectra were obtained on Varian Inova 800 or 500 MHz NMR spectrometers, each equipped with a Sun Ultra 10 computer and 5-mm Varian probe. 1H NMR spectra at 800 MHz were obtained with a 7.2-kHz spectral window, a 67° pulse field angle (4.5 μsec), a 4.5-s acquisition time, and a 1-s relaxation delay. The spectra were digitized using 64,000 points to obtain a digital resolution of 0.225 Hz/point. Two-dimensional NMR experiments with solvent suppression (correlation spectroscopy, two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, multiple quantum coherence) were performed as previously described (50Ribeiro A.A. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. Magn. Res. Chem. 1999; 37: 620-630Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 51Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Directly detected, 1H-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 202.37 MHz with a spectral window of 12143.3 Hz digitized into 25,280 data points (digital resolution of 1 Hz/point or ∼0.005 ppm/point), a 60° pulse flip angle (8 μs), and a 1.6-s repeat time. 31P chemical shifts were referenced to 85% H3PO4 at 0.000 ppm. Inverse decoupled difference spectra were recorded as 1"
https://openalex.org/W2027698698,"Indirubin, an isomer of indigo, is a reported inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as well as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Indirubin is the active ingredient of a traditional Chinese medicinal recipe used against chronic myelocytic leukemia. Numerous indirubin analogs have been synthesized to optimize this promising kinase inhibitor scaffold. We report here on the cellular effects of 7-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (7BIO). In contrast to its 5-bromo- and 6-bromo- isomers, and to indirubin-3'-oxime, 7BIO has only a marginal inhibitory activity towards CDKs and GSK-3. Unexpectedly, 7BIO triggers a rapid cell death process distinct from apoptosis. 7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime induces the appearance of large pycnotic nuclei, without classical features of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. 7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime-induced cell death is not accompanied by cytochrome c release neither by any measurable effector caspase activation. Furthermore, the death process is not altered either by the presence of Q-VD-OPh, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, or the overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. Neither AhR nor p53 is required during 7BIO-induced cell death. Thus, in contrast to previously described indirubins, 7BIO triggers the activation of non-apoptotic cell death, possibly through necroptosis or autophagy. Although their molecular targets remain to be identified, 7-substituted indirubins may constitute a new class of potential antitumor compounds that would retain their activity in cells refractory to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2118447752,"Clathrin-coated vesicles mediate sorting and intracellular transport of membrane-bound proteins. The formation of these coats is initiated by the assembly of adaptor proteins (AP), which specifically bind to membrane cargo proteins via recognition of endocytic sorting motifs. The lipid signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is critical for this process, as it serves as both a targeting and regulatory factor. PI(4,5)P2 is synthesized by type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKI). We have discovered a direct interaction between the μ2-subunit of the AP2 complex and PIPKIγ661 via a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was confirmed using both the μ2-subunit in glutathione S-transferase pulldowns and via coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous PIPKIγ661 with the AP2 complex from HEK293 cells. The interaction is mediated, in vivo, by a tyrosine-based motif in the 26-amino acid tail of PIPKIγ661. Because AP2 regulates endocytosis of transferrin receptor from the plasma membrane, we also examined a role for PIPKIγ661 using a flow cytometry endocytosis assay. We observed that stable expression of wild type PIPKIγ661 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells enhanced transferrin uptake, whereas stable expression of kinase-dead PIPKIγ661 had an inhibitory effect. Neither condition affected the overall cellular level of PI(4,5)P2. RNA interference-based knockdown of PIPKIγ661 in HeLa cells also had an inhibitory effect on transferrin endocytosis using the same assay system. Collectively, this evidence implies an important role for PIPKIγ661 in the AP2-mediated endocytosis of transferrin.

The surface expression level of plasma membrane receptors is highly regulated via balanced vesicular trafficking to and from the plasma membrane. An important aspect of this regulation is the internalization of receptors by the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. This process not only internalizes and delivers extracellular ligands to the endosomal transport system, but it also serves to recycle receptors or target them for degradation. Assembly of the clathrin coat is a highly orchestrated process that requires the action of several distinct proteins (1.Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Several AP complexes have been identified, with each complex having a distinct function (2.Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). For example, AP1B is thought to modulate sorting to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells, whereas AP2 is thought to regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis from the plasma membrane (3.Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 4.Gan Y. McGraw T.E. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nat.

Pypaert M. Schu P. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The AP complexes consist of four distinct subunits. The crystal structure of the AP2 complex has recently been solved and consists of two large subunits, α and β2, a medium subunit, μ2, and a small subunit, σ2 (7.Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The μ2-subunit is critical for the function of the complex as it specifically binds to membrane cargo proteins via tyrosine-based sorting motifs within their cytoplasmic domains (8.Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). This subunit consists of an N-terminal domain, which is buried within the core of the AP2 complex, joined by a flexible linker to a solvent exposed C-terminal domain. In the AP2 crystal, the μ2-subunit C-terminal domain was found to be buried within a pocket formed by the other three subunits of the complex (7.Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In this “closed” conformation, the μ-subunit is thought be unable to interact with membrane-bound cargo proteins. The current model for the AP2 cargo binding suggests that the complex shifts into an “open” conformation upon binding to the plasma membrane in the presence of cargo (7.Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 9.Kirchhausen T. Cell. 2002; 109: 413-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The displaced μ-subunit can then bind to cargo and dock to the membrane. Assembly of the AP2 complex onto membranes is mediated by a specific phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (10.Gaidarov I. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 also regulates numerous proteins that participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including AP180, epsin, and dynamin (11.Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, PI(4,5)P2 is an important regulatory factor for modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and subsequently vesicular transport (12.Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 13.Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Two PI(4,5)P2 binding sites have been identified within the AP2 complex. One binding site is located on the α-subunit and is positioned to dock the AP2 complex to membranes (5.Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 7.Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The other binding site is located on the μ2-subunit and formed by a cluster of conserved lysine residues (14.Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The AP2 structure suggests that the μ2-subunit binds PI(4,5)P2 only when AP complex is docked to the membrane and the μ2-subunit is bound to cargo (7.Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 15.Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). This model has recently been demonstrated using an in vitro reconstituted system coupled with surface plasmon resonance (16.Honing S. Ricotta D. Krauss M. Spate K. Spolaore B. Motley A. Robinson M. Robinson C. Haucke V. Owen D.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 519-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This collection of evidence emphasizes the critical role for PI(4,5)P2 in both the initial targeting of AP2 to endocytic sites and for stabilizing the μ-subunit/cargo interaction at the plasma membrane upon transition of the complex into the open conformation. PI(4,5)P2 is synthesized at the plasma membrane by type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKI). By generating PI(4,5)P2, PIPKIs are important not only for regulation of vesicular trafficking, but also have functions in cytoskeletal assembly, cell proliferation, apoptosis, signal transduction, and nuclear functions (15.Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 17.D'Santos C.S. Clarke J.H. Divecha N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18.Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). All three of the known PIPKI isoforms (α, β and γ; using the human nomenclature) have been implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Previous work has shown that expression of PIPKIα in NR6 cells resulted in increased endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor, whereas expression of kinase inactive PIPKIα inhibited endocytosis (19.Barbieri M.A. Heath C.M. Peters E.M. Wells A. Davis J.N. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47212-47216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Another study found that PIPKIβ expression had a similar effect on transferrin receptor endocytosis in HeLa cells and that RNAi-based knockdown of PIPKIβ expression had an inhibitory effect (20.Padron D. Wang Y.J. Yamamoto M. Yin H. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PIPKIγ has been implicated as the major producer of PI(4,5)P2 in synaptic nerve terminals and this role has been supported by observed phenotypes in PIPKIγ knockout mice, where synaptic vesicle endocytosis is generally impaired (21.Wenk M.R. Pellegrini L. Klenchin V.A. Di Paolo G. Chang S. Daniell L. Arioka M. Martin T.F. De Camilli P. Neuron. 2001; 32: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22.Di Paolo G. Moskowitz H.S. Gipson K. Wenk M.R. Voronov S. Obayashi M. Flavell R. Fitzsimonds R.M. Ryan T.A. De Camilli P. Nature. 2004; 431: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PIPKIs are specifically targeted to sites of endocytosis for localized generation of PI(4,5)P2 remains unclear. The PIPKIγ isoform is alternatively spliced in cells, resulting in two major variants, PIPKIγ635 and PIPKIγ661, which differ only by a 26-amino acid C-terminal extension. We have discovered a direct interaction between PIPKIγ661 and the μ2-subunit of AP2 via a yeast two-hybrid approach employing the C-terminal 178 amino acids of PIPKIγ661 as bait. Here we confirm that this interaction is direct and occurs in vivo. Using cell lines stably expressing PIPKIγ661 and siRNAs specifically knocking down expression of PIPKIγ, we have also found that this interaction has direct implications on the endocytosis of the transferrin receptor from the plasma membrane. These combined results suggest that PIPKIγ661 may be an important regulatory factor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Expression Constructs—PIPKIγ661, PIPKIγ635, and PIPKIγ661KD mammalian and bacterial expression vectors were described previously (23.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PIPKIγ C-terminal truncation constructs were also described previously (24.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The following PIPKIγ661 mutants were generated using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following mutagenic primers and their complements: IγS645F, 5′-GGAGCTGGGTGTACTTCCCGCTTCACTATAGC; IγP646F, 5′-GGAGCTGGGTGTACTCCTTCCTTCACTATAGCGCG; IγL647V, 5′-GGGTGTACTCCCCGGTTCACTATAGCGC; and IγP646R, 5′-GCTGGGTGTACTCCCGGCTTCACTATAGCGC. The IγY644F mutant was described previously (24.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The full-length murine μ2-subunit yeast two-hybrid clone was obtained from a murine brain cDNA library (Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin). A soluble truncation of this subunit was generated by digestion of the μ2-subunit open reading frame with an internal EcoRI site and an external 5′ XhoI site. The resulting fragment was cloned into pET28 and pET42 bacterial expression vectors (EMD Biosciences). Cell Cultures and Transfection—HEK293, HeLa, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells were transfected via calcium phosphate with 2 or 5 μg of each expression vector. The cells were used for immunoprecipitation 48 h after transfection. MDCK Stable Cell Lines—MDCK cells were stably transfected with various PIPKIγ661 constructs, which are under the control of the tetracycline responsive promoter. The transfected MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml puromycin, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B to select for stable transfection. The medium was supplemented with 2 μg/ml doxycycline to suppress transgene expression, as doxycycline withdrawal results in expression of transfected PIPKIγ. Antibodies—Monoclonal mouse anti-human transferrin receptor was purchased from BD Bioscience. Monoclonal anti-α-adaptin (C-8) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal mouse anti-HA (16B12) was obtained from Covance and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from Upstate. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and monoclonal anti-T7 antibodies were obtained from Novagen. Monoclonal antitalin antibody (8d4) was purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate. Polyclonal PIPKIγ antiserum was generated and purified as described previously (23.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Polyclonal PIPKIα antiserum was generated and purified as described previously (25.Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subsequently resuspended and lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2). Cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of 1:1 diluted protein A-Sepharose™ and 2 μg of the specified antibody as indicated at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.). Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for visualization on x-ray film (RPI Corp.). Protein Expression and Purification in Escherichia coli—Constructs in pET28 or pET42 expression vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen). Proteins were expressed and purified using His-Bind™ resin following the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen) or using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B Fast Flow as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Tyrosine-phosphorylated recombinant PIPKIγ661 was generated via coexpression with Src and purified as described previously (26.Bairstow S.F. Ling K. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23884-23891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown Assays—Recombinant T7-tagged PIPKIγ was incubated with GST-μ2 together with glutathione-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 μl of buffer B (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 1 ml of buffer B four times, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed via Western blot. GST was used as a negative control for nonspecific binding. All other GST pulldowns were performed with the proteins indicated in the same manner. Transferrin Uptake Assays—Stable MDCK cells were grown in 10-cm dishes. Expression of exogenous PIPKIγ was induced for 72 h by withdrawing doxycycline from medium. For transferrin uptake assays, cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 2 h. The serum-starved cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 transferrin (5 μg/ml, Invitrogen) in binding medium at 37 °C for 20 min. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS, three times with ice-cold acid (0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.1), and three times with PBS again. Cells were finally collected by trypsinization and washed once with PBS. Half of the cells were used to determine PIPKIγ expression by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were first incubated with primary anti-HA antibody and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. The fluorescence intensities of fluorescein isothiocyanate staining were detected from ∼10,000 cells and used to determine PIPKIγ expression. The other half of the cells was suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS for determination of transferrin uptake using a FACS Calibur™ (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Fluorescence intensities of internalized Alexa Fluor 647 transferrin were quantified from ∼10,000 cells. RNA Interference—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were passed into 60-mm dishes 1 day prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with a PIPKIγ-specific siRNA oligo (5′-AAGGACCUGGACUUCAUGCAG) using Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. Scrambled control siRNA (5′-AAGUACCUGUACUUCAUGCAG) or PIPKIα-specific siRNA (5′-AAGAAGUUGGAGCACUCUUGG) were used as controls. After 24 h, the cells were transfected again in the same manner. The cells were then used for transferrin uptake assays 72 h post-transfection. Metabolic Labeling and Determination of Cellular PI(4,5)P2 Levels—MDCK cells were metabolically labeled with 20 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the lipids were extracted and deacylated as described previously (27.Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The deacylated glycerophosphoinositol phosphates were resuspended in water prior to analysis by HPLC. The deacylated lipids were separated using a Zorbax SAX column and a gradient of 1.3 m ammonium phosphate (pH 3.85). The level of cellular PI(4,5)P2 was determined with a Packard in-line liquid scintillation flow detector using deacylated [3H]PI(4,5)P2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a standard. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Cells were washed with PBS at room temperature, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were then incubated with fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 45 min and washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The coverslips were mounted to glass slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium. Fluorescent images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope with a CoolSNAP CCD camera (RS Photometrics) or using a ×60 Plan oil immersion lens on a confocal laser-scanning microscope (model MR-1000; Bio-Rad) mounted transversely to an inverted microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon; W. M. Keck Laboratory for Biological Imaging, Madison, WI). Images were processed as described previously using Photoshop™ CS (23.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To visualize the colocalization between AP2 and PIPKIγ661 constructs, MDCK cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of each expression vector. After 16 h of expression, the cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h and then treated with 50 μg/ml of transferrin (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently fixed and stained as described above. PIPKIγ661 Directly Interacts with the μ-Subunit of AP2 in Vitro and in Vivo—Our laboratory performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal 178 amino acids of PIPKIγ661 as bait (23.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This screen indicated a direct association with the μ2-subunit of AP2. The prey, obtained from a murine brain library, contained the entire mouse μ2-subunit with the exception of the start codon. To confirm that this interaction was indeed direct, a GST pulldown approach was used. Because the full-length μ2-subunit is primarily insoluble in E. coli, a truncation mutant was generated. This was accomplished by deleting of the bulk of the N-terminal domain and replacing it with GST. The resulting soluble construct contained the complete linker domain and the C-terminal domain. The GST pulldown was then performed by incubating PIPKIγ661 with GST-μ2 in the presence of glutathione-conjugated Sepharose™ beads. As shown in Fig. 1A, PIPKIγ661 directly associated with GST-μ2, but did not associate with GST alone. In vivo, AP2 serves as an adaptor for binding to several other proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Consequently, to ensure that this interaction was relevant in vivo, we immunoprecipitated endogenous AP2 from HEK293 cells using a monoclonal antibody specific for α-adaptin. The precipitated complexes were washed extensively and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Using a polyclonal antibody described previously, PIPKIγ was detected in the α-adaptin lane but not in the normal mouse IgG lane (Fig. 1B) (23.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The reciprocal experiment, using the monoclonal antibody specific for α-adaptin, yielded concurrent results (Fig. 1B). It was surprising to observe that only the highest molecular weight band was retained by immunoprecipitated AP2. This band corresponds to PIPKIγ661, as the PIPKIγ polyclonal antibody detects both PIPKIγ661 and PIPKIγ635 splice variants, as seen in the lysate lane. Because PI(4,5)P2 has extensively been shown to be an integral component of the endocytic process, we sought to determine whether PIP kinase activity was necessary for this interaction in vivo. Wild type and kinase inactive PIPKIγ661 were transfected into HEK293 cells via calcium phosphate. AP2 was then immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies specific for the α-subunit. As shown in Fig. 1C, both wild type (WT) and kinase-dead (KD) PIPKIγ661 associated with AP2 in vivo. In addition, KD PIPKIγ661 appears to associate with the AP2 complex with slightly higher affinity as compared with WT PIPKIγ661. The endogenous coimmunoprecipitation data indicated that AP2 preferentially associates with the highest molecular weight species of PIPKIγ detected by the PIPKIγ polyclonal antibody. A coimmunoprecipitation approach was used to confirm which of the two splice variants could associate with AP2 in vivo. HEK293 cells were transfected with PIPKIγ661 or PIPKIγ635 and endogenous AP2 was immunoprecipitated with the α-adaptin-specific antibody. As seen in Fig. 1D, only PIPKIγ661 was capable of binding to AP2 in vivo. This result indicated that the in vivo binding site for μ2 was localized in the C-terminal 26 residues of PIPKIγ661. To narrow the specific binding site, three previously generated truncations of PIPKIγ661 were employed in the same coimmunoprecipitation approach (24.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, truncation at Trp642 resulted in reduction of associated PIPKIγ to background levels observed in the normal mouse IgG control. A Tetrapeptide Motif on PIPKIγ661 Mediates the Interaction with AP2—Upon closer inspection of the sequence contained between the Trp642 and Tyr649 truncations, there is a putative tyrosine sorting motif (644YSPL647). These motifs generally consist of a tetrapeptide sorting sequence YXXφ, where φ corresponds to a bulky hydrophobic residue (8.Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). Through an exhaustive peptide library screen, Ohno et al. (28.Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 29.Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) has presented extensive evidence documenting the tyrosine sorting motif specificity for each of the μ-subunits of the AP complexes. Using these results as a guide, several point mutations were generated with the intention of weakening PIPKIγ661 binding to AP2. A mutation intended to strengthen binding was also generated as a positive control. Each of these HA-tagged constructs was transfected into HEK293 cells and endogenous AP2 was immunoprecipitated with a α-adaptin-specific antibody. Associated PIPKIγ661 was then detected by immunoblot with an HA-specific monoclonal antibody. The observed results, shown in Fig. 2A, followed the affinities predicted by Ohno et al. (28.Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr644, Pro646 (Tyr+2), or Leu647 (Tyr+3) to the most disfavored residues resulted in disruption of the interaction. The Tyr+1 position was previously shown to have little contribution to binding affinity in the Ohno et al. (28.Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) peptide screen, and mutation of Ser645 to the least favored residue, phenylalanine, had little effect on AP2 binding. Likewise, mutation of Pro646 (Tyr+3) to the most favored residue, arginine, did not alter PIPKIγ661 binding to AP2. These in vivo results were confirmed via GST pulldown experiments. As in Fig. 1A, GST-μ2 was used to pull down PIPKIγ661, PIPKIγ635, PIPKIγ Y644F, or PIPKIγ L647V. The incubation buffer was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin to inhibit nonspecific interactions. As shown in Fig. 2B, PIPKIγ661 was specifically retained by GST-μ2, whereas none of the PIPKIγ constructs were associated with GST alone. These combined results suggest that PIPKIγ661 contains a tyrosine sorting motif that is recognized by the μ2-subunit of AP2 and mediates the direct interaction between these two proteins. Previous work performed by Ohno et al. (28.Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) has also demonstrated that phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within YXXφ sorting motifs disrupts the association of such motifs with the μ2-subunit. We have previously shown that Tyr644 of PIPKIγ661 is phosphorylated by Src in a focal adhesion kinase-dependent manner (23.Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420:"
https://openalex.org/W2168746329,"Gliomas are primary brain tumors with a complex biology characterized by antigenic and genomic heterogeneity and a propensity for invasion into normal brain tissue. High grade glioma cells possess a voltage-independent, amiloride-inhibitable, inward Na+ current. This current does not exist in normal astrocytes or low grade tumor cells. Inhibition of this conductance decreases glioma growth and cell migration making it a potential therapeutic target. Our previous results have shown that the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), members of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC)/degenerin (DEG) family of ion channels are part of this current pathway. We hypothesized that one member of the ENaC/DEG family, ASIC2, is retained intracellularly and that it is the lack of functional expression of ASIC2 at the cell surface that results in hyperactivity of this conductance in high grade gliomas. In this study we show that the chemical chaperone, glycerol, and the transcriptional regulator, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, inhibit the constitutively activated inward current and reduce cell growth and migration in glioblastoma multiforme. The results suggest that these compounds induce the movement of ASIC2 to the plasma membrane, and once there, the basally active inward current characteristic of glioma cells is abolished by inherent negative regulatory mechanisms. This in turn compromises the ability of the glioma cell to migrate and proliferate. These results support the hypothesis that the conductance pathway in high grade glioma cells is comprised of ENaC/DEG subunits and that abolishing this channel activity promotes a reversion of a high grade glioma cell to a phenotype resembling that of normal astrocytes. Gliomas are primary brain tumors with a complex biology characterized by antigenic and genomic heterogeneity and a propensity for invasion into normal brain tissue. High grade glioma cells possess a voltage-independent, amiloride-inhibitable, inward Na+ current. This current does not exist in normal astrocytes or low grade tumor cells. Inhibition of this conductance decreases glioma growth and cell migration making it a potential therapeutic target. Our previous results have shown that the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), members of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC)/degenerin (DEG) family of ion channels are part of this current pathway. We hypothesized that one member of the ENaC/DEG family, ASIC2, is retained intracellularly and that it is the lack of functional expression of ASIC2 at the cell surface that results in hyperactivity of this conductance in high grade gliomas. In this study we show that the chemical chaperone, glycerol, and the transcriptional regulator, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, inhibit the constitutively activated inward current and reduce cell growth and migration in glioblastoma multiforme. The results suggest that these compounds induce the movement of ASIC2 to the plasma membrane, and once there, the basally active inward current characteristic of glioma cells is abolished by inherent negative regulatory mechanisms. This in turn compromises the ability of the glioma cell to migrate and proliferate. These results support the hypothesis that the conductance pathway in high grade glioma cells is comprised of ENaC/DEG subunits and that abolishing this channel activity promotes a reversion of a high grade glioma cell to a phenotype resembling that of normal astrocytes. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) 2The abbreviations used are: ASIC, acid-sensing ion channel; ENaC, ephithelial Na+ channel; DEG, degenerin; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RT, reverse transcription; Endo H, endoglycosidase H. are proton gated cation channels of the epithelial Na+ channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) superfamily. ASICs have been discovered in sensory neurons originating from dorsal root ganglia in many parts of the body including the heart (1Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Not only have ASICs been implicated in pH detection, but they also play a role in normal touch sensation (2Price M.P. McIlwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C. Qiao J. Tarr D.E. Sluka K.A. Brennan T.J.

These same channels have also been found in the brain, although their function there is less clear. ASICs are present in hippocampal neurons and, because of the pH fluctuations that are known to occur during synaptic activity (3Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), this channel has been hypothesized to be involved in synaptic plasticity (4Baron A. Waldmann R.

In situ hybridization studies in mouse brain revealed ASIC expression in the Purkinje, the granular cell layers of the cerebellum, dentate regions of hippocampus, and the olfactory bulb (12Garcia-Anoveros J.

Thus, these channels are primarily found in neurons. One exception to this generalization is the presence of ASICs in cells obtained from high grade brain gliomas (13Bubien J.K. Keeton D.A. Fuller C.M. Gillespie G.Y. Reddy A.T. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These tumors are of astrocyte cell origin. In grade IV gliomas, also called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), there exists a constitutively activated, amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ current. This glioma cation current is mediated by mixed ASIC and ENaC components, including ASIC1 and ASIC2 (14Berdiev B.K. Xia J. McLean L.A. Markert J.M. Gillespie G.Y. Mapstone T.B. Naren A.P. Jovov B.

Interestingly, this current is absent in normal astrocytes and low grade gliomas. We hypothesize that GBM cells express this basal current because of the lack of ASIC2 in the plasma membrane. If this current could be blocked either pharmacologically or by manipulation of its regulatory pathway, the high rate of migration of the GBM cells, proliferation, and invasiveness could be corrected. The chemical chaperone, glycerol, and the transcriptional regulator, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, are known to stabilize protein conformation, increase the rate of protein refolding, and accelerate oligomeric protein assembly (15Skach W.R.

Homer R.J. Duncan H.A. Rozental J. J. Neurooncol. 1998; 37: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Baker M.J. Brem S. Daniels S. Sherman B. Phuphanich S. J.

Sweatt W.H. Campbell P.A. Nelson W.G. Simons J.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 379-387PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying the action of sodium 4-phenylbutyrate in glioma cells is unknown. Using a combination of electrophysiological, cell biological, and biochemical techniques, we have tested the hypothesis that glycerol and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate promote the delivery of ASIC2 to the surface of tumor cells. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that the movement of ASIC2 to the surface inhibits the basally active, amiloride-sensitive, inward cation current of glioma cells. Cell proliferation and migration assays demonstrated that the translocation of ASIC2 to the plasma membrane inhibits the proliferation and mobility of GBM cells. The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that a basally active, multimeric ASIC/ENaC constitutes the conduction pathway responsible for inward Na+ current seen in high grade gliomas. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of normal human astrocytes and primary cultured human glioblastoma cells (GBM) were obtained from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Neurosurgery Brain Tissue Bank (Institutional Review Board approval X030403011). U87-MG cells were purchased from ATCC. SK-MG-1 and D54-MG cells were gifts from Dr. Gregory Caincross, University of Calgary and Dr. Darell Bigner, Duke University, respectively. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 humidified incubator. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells in log phase using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The ASIC1 and ASIC2 forward and reverse primer sequences were as follows: ASIC1 5′-GGACTCGGATTTGGATT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TGTTGGCAGCGTATGT-3′ (reverse primer); ASIC2, 5′-CCGTCACTGTGTGCAACAA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′ATCCTCGCCTGAGTTAAACATG-3′ (reverse primer). These primers skip introns allowing us to distinguish between products derived from mRNA as opposed to genomic DNA. RT-PCR was carried out under standard conditions (50 °C, 30 min × 1; 95 °C, 15 min × 1; 95 °C, 1 min, 54 °C, 1 min, 72 °C, 1 min × 35; 72 °C, 10 min × 1) using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with 200-400 ng of total RNA per reaction and a primer concentration of 0.6 μm. Bands were visualized by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels. A negative control containing no RNA was always run to guard against generating product as a result of reagent contamination. All assays were performed at least three times. The identity of all products was confirmed by sequencing of the PCR product. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, and Western Blots—Rabbit anti-ASIC1 and -ASIC2 antibodies raised against the peptide sequences DVKRHNPCESLRGHP and DLKESPSEGSLQPSSIQC, respectively, or the rabbit anti-ASIC1 and rabbit anti-ASIC2 antibodies from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot detection. Briefly, normal astrocytes, GBM, and glioblastoma cell lines were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were then lysed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS, supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were scraped and placed into microcentrifuge tubes where they were sheared with a 23-gauge needle. Supernatant from the lysate after centrifugation (15,800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) was incubated with 2 μg of either anti-ASIC1 or anti-ASIC2 antibody, overnight at 4 °C on a rotator followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads. Beads were washed with PBS and pelleted five times. Samples were resuspended 1:1 (v/v) with Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Standard electrophoresis and blotting protocols were followed. Briefly, proteins were run on 8% SDS-PAGE minigels with 4% stacking gels. Gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk/Tris-buffered saline-Tween, overnight at 4 °C, and probed with the appropriate anti-ASIC antibodies. After washing, blots were reacted with either a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or an Alexa 680-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and visualized using either chemiluminescent reagents (Super Signal West Pico, Pierce) imaged onto Kodak X-Omat AR film or the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Specificity of the anti-ASIC antibodies for immunoprecipitation was demonstrated by substitution of ChromoPure non-immune rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for the primary antibodies. Cell Surface Biotinylation—SK-MG-1 and normal astrocytes were grown on 100-mm plates for 48 h before biotinylation experiments. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated 15 min with 1.5 mg/ml EZ-link TM Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in cold biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) with gentle agitation. Cells were washed once with quenching buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS) and incubated for 10 min in quenching buffer with light agitation. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS, scraped in cold PBS, and pelleted at 2000 rpm at 4 °C. They were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and incubated on ice 30 min before centrifugation, 10 min at 15,800 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube and after the addition of 50 μl of a 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were rotated for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation, and aliquots of the supernatant were taken to represent the unbound, intracellular pool. Beads were then washed three times with HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Endoglycosidase Treatment—SK-MG-1 cells were immunoprecipitated either with anti-ASIC1 or anti-ASIC2 antibodies. Samples were treated with Endo H (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer's protocol and incubated overnight at 37 °C. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Viability Assay—The MTT cell viability assay investigates the number of viable cells by measuring the mitochondria-dependent reduction of water-soluble tetrazolium into insoluble formazan product. The absorbance obtained is directly proportional to the activity of functional mitochondria and represents the number of viable cells. Cells were counted with a hemocytometer, resuspended in phenol red-free medium, and seeded at various densities (1250, 2500, and 5000 cells/well for human primary GBM, SK-MG-1, and D54-MG cells, respectively, and 5000 cells/well for human normal astrocytes) in 96-well plates. After 24 h cells were treated with different concentrations of either glycerol or sodium 4-phenylbutyrate. The MTT viability assay (Vybrant, Molecular Probes) was performed 48 h later. The cell culture medium was replaced with 100 μl of phenol red-free medium mixed with 10 μl of a 12 mm MTT stock solution in PBS. The cells were incubated for 4 h before adding 100 μl of 100 mg/ml SDS dissolved in 0.01 n HCl. The absorbance was measure at 570 nm in a microplate reader. The absorbance of the wells with no cells was subtracted as background. This experiment was repeated three times per cell line. Proliferation Assay—SK-MG-1, D54-MG, and GBM cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/dish (24 h). After 1 day (0 h), one dish was harvested and stained with 0.2% trypan blue, and viable cells (excluding trypan blue) were counted using a hemocytometer. The other dishes were treated with glycerol (final concentration 500 mm) and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (final concentration 5 mm). Cells were harvested at 24 and 48 h after treatment, stained, and counted as described above. This experiment was repeated four times per cell line. Wound-healing Migration Assay Time-lapse Videomicroscopy—SK-MG-1 cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 4 × 105 cells/dish. Once they reached confluence, they were scarred with a 1-ml pipette tip and washed three times with cell culture medium. They were treated with either 500 mm glycerol, 5 mm sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, or 100 μm amiloride and placed in a chamber mounted on the stage of a Nikon TE 200 inverted microscope attached to a CoolSNAP ES monochrome camera (Photometrics) linked to IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.). Cells were maintained under cell culture conditions, i.e. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C using a temperature controller B600 (20/20 Technology, Inc.) and an atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 using an IC50 controller (20/20 Technology, Inc). Cells were visualized with phase contrast optics at ×10 magnification. Images were recorded every 5 min for 24 h. We measured the remaining area at the end of the 24-h period and subtracted it from the area at the beginning of the experiment and normalized to the control to obtain the percentage of cell migration. This experiment was repeated three times per each condition. Plasma Membrane Preparation—D54-MG cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and treated with either 500 mm glycerol or 5 mm sodium 4-phenylbutyrate for 48 h. They were scraped and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The plasma membrane protein extraction kit (BioVision) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to isolate specifically the plasma membrane from the total cellular membranes. The plasma membrane fraction was dissolved in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and plasma membrane protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Whole-cell Patch Clamp—Cells were treated with either 500 mm glycerol or 5 mm sodium 4-phenylbutyrate for 48 h. They were placed in a chamber filled with RPMI 1640 culture medium (133 mm Na+, 5.3 mm K+, and 108.3 mm Cl-) and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. Once the cells adhered to the glass bottom of the chamber, micropipettes that were connected to an Axon 200A patch clamp amplifier and filled with an electrolyte solution containing (in mm) 100 potassium gluconate, 30 KCl, 10 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, <10 free Ca2+, and 4 ATP at a pH of 7.2 were abutted against the plasma membrane of individual cells. Gigaohm resistance seals between the pipette tips, and the cells were obtained by applying suction to the pipettes. Once the pipette tips were sealed to the cells, a sharp suction pulse was applied to rupture the membrane within the sealed area, leaving the seal intact. This procedure produced a low resistance electrical connection to the cellular interior. This is the whole-cell patch configuration. In this configuration, the entire plasma membrane can be voltage clamped and specific ionic conductance pathways can be identified. Once the whole-cell configuration had been achieved, the stability of each preparation was monitored between voltage clamp protocols and during drug superfusions by clamping the membrane to positive and negative potentials continuously. The cells were held at a membrane potential of -60 mV and clamped sequentially for 800 ms each to membrane potentials of -160 to 40 mV at intervals of 20 mV, returning to the holding potential of -60 mV for 800 ms between each test voltage. The continuous monitoring shows, in real time, the effects of inhibitors, such as amiloride, and acts as a quality control for the stability of the preparations. The currents were recorded digitally and filed in real time using the pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments). Each recording under a given experimental condition was done on at least three different cells. Transwell Migration Assay—To measure U87-MG cell mobility, the transwell migration assay was used. Transwell chambers were obtained from B-D Falcon. The bottom of the filters (8 μm pore diameter) was coated overnight with 5 μg/ml vitronectin in PBS. As a control, migration was measured in chambers with filters coated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The next morning, U87-MG cells were lifted from their culture dishes, pelleted, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 1% bovine serum albumin. Fifty-thousand cells were added to the upper chamber. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, and stained with crystal violet. Cells on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated through the pores to the lower side of the filter were counted manually in five random fields per filter. Five filters equal an n of 1. This experiment was repeated three times. Expression of ASIC1 and ASIC2—One of our goals was to test the hypothesis that ASIC1 and ASIC2 are present in astrocytes and glioma cells. To this end, we used RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) and Western blotting (Fig. 1B) to test for the presence of both ASIC1 and ASIC2 in normal human astrocytes, human primary GBM cells, and three continuous cell lines; namely, SK-MG-1, D54-MG, and U87-MG. Our results showed that both ASIC1 and ASIC2 mRNA and protein are present in normal astrocytes, human primary GBM, SK-MG-1, and D54-MG cells, but only ASIC1 was found in U87-MG cells. ASIC2 Is Retained in an Intracellular Pool in Glioma Cells— To provide evidence that ASIC1 and/or ASIC2 were expressed in the plasma membrane, surface biotinylation, followed by immunoprecipitation of both ASIC1 and ASIC2, were performed on normal human astrocytes, SK-MG-1, D54-MG, and human primary GBM tumor cells. From Western blot analysis of the intracellular fraction, both ASIC1 and ASIC2 can be detected (Fig. 2). However, in the cell surface fraction of SK-MG-1 (Fig. 2A), D54-MG (Fig. 2B), and human primary GBM (Fig. 2C) only ASIC1 is present. In human normal astrocytes, both ASIC1 and ASIC2 are present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). ASIC2 Is Trapped in the ER/Golgi in GBM Cells—To analyze the processing of ASICs, cells were lysed and ASIC immunoprecipitated. The precipitate was incubated with the endoglycosidase enzyme, Endo H, and separated by SDS-PAGE. We compared the glycosylation pattern of ASIC1 and ASIC2 in SK-MG-1 cells. The extent of glycosylation allowed us to determine how far ASIC1 and ASIC2 progress along the biosynthetic pathway. As shown in Fig. 3B, Endo H, which cleaves the saccharide chains characteristic of the ER and/or cis-Golgi but cannot cleave processed chains or other terminal sugars added later in the Golgi, caused a shift in the molecular mass of ASIC2 immunoprecipitated protein, consistent with ASIC2 being trapped in the ER and/or cis-Golgi. However, ASIC1 was resistant to Endo H (Fig. 3A), suggesting that it is processed through the trans-Golgi. Effect of Glycerol and Sodium 4-Phenylbutyrate on Cell Viability—The MTT cell viability assay was used to test the effect of glycerol and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate on cell viability for 48 h. The percentage loss mitochondrial function is proportional to non-viable cells remaining in the population. We found that glycerol was effective above 100 mm (Fig. 4), whereas sodium 4-phenylbutyrate worked above 1 mm (Fig. 5). For further experiments we used 500 mm glycerol and 5 mm sodium 4-phenylbutyrate.FIGURE 5Effects of sodium 4-phenylbutyrate on cell viability. A, representative dose-response curve for sodium 4-phenylbutyrate in D54-MG cells measured with the MTT viability assay. B, LD50 values for glioma cell lines at different cell densities.

They represent mean values from three independent experiments ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Glycerol and Sodium 4-Phenylbutyrate on Cell Proliferation—Based on the results obtained from the MTT viability assay, we tested whether 500 mm glycerol and 5 mm sodium 4-phenylbutyrate induced cell death or just decreased cell proliferation of glioma cells. We found that both compounds slowed down proliferation at 24 h and stopped it after 48 h in each cell type examined (Fig. 6). Thus while both glycerol and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate stopped proliferation, neither compound induced cell death after 48 h at these concentrations. Normal human astrocytes grow extremely slowly and exhibited no proliferation within 48 h. As measured with the MTT viability assay, treatment with glycerol affected normal astrocytes viability to much lesser extent than glioma cells (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate had almost no effect (Fig. 7E).FIGURE 7Glycerol and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate do not affect normal human astrocytes viability. A-C, untreated (A), glycerol-treated (B), and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate-treated (C) for 48 h normal astrocytes cells.

Electrophysiological experiments were done in D54-MG, SK-MG-1, human primary GBM, U87-MG, and normal human astrocytes after 48 h treatment with 500 mm glycerol or 5 mm sodium 4-phenylbutyrate. In all cells, inward currents that are amiloridesensitive were measured. However, after glycerol or sodium 4-phenylbutyrate treatments, the amiloride-sensitive current in the human primary GBM, D54-MG, and SK-MG-1 cells was no longer present (Fig. 8, A-C). In contrast, glycerol and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate had less effect on amiloride-sensitive current in the U87-MG cells, which do not express ASIC2 (Fig. 8D). We have previously shown that the constitutively active, amiloride-sensitive current in glioma cells is permeable to both Na+ and K+ (PNa+/PK+ ∼ 0.15-0.36) (26Bubien J.K. Ji H.L. Gillespie G.Y. Fuller C.M. Markert J.M. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1282-C1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amiloride-sensitive outward current present in these traces most likely corresponds to K+ currents (Fig. 8D).

https://openalex.org/W1999150011,"Phospho-CDK2/cyclin A, a kinase that is active in cell cycle S phase, contains an RXL substrate recognition site that is over 40 Å from the catalytic site. The role of this recruitment site, which enhances substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency, has been investigated using peptides derived from the natural substrates, namely CDC6 and p107, and a bispeptide inhibitor in which the γ-phosphate of ATP is covalently attached by a linker to the CDC6 substrate peptide. X-ray studies with a 30-residue CDC6 peptide in complex with pCDK2/cyclin A showed binding of a dodecamer peptide at the recruitment site and a heptapeptide at the catalytic site, but no density for the linking 11 residues. Kinetic studies established that the CDC6 peptide had an 18-fold lower Km compared with heptapeptide substrate and that this effect required the recruitment peptide to be covalently linked to the substrate peptide. X-ray studies with the CDC6 bispeptide showed binding of the dodecamer at the recruitment site and the modified ATP in two alternative conformations at the catalytic site. The CDC6 bispeptide was a potent inhibitor competitive with both ATP and peptide substrate of pCDK2/cyclin A activity against a heptapeptide substrate (Ki = 0.83 nm) but less effective against RXL-containing substrates. We discuss how localization at the recruitment site (KD 0.4 μm) leads to increased catalytic efficiency and the design of a potent inhibitor. The notion of a flexible linker between the sites, which must have more than a minimal number of residues, provides an explanation for recognition and discrimination against different substrates.

Protein kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in target proteins. They provide the signaling pathways by which extracellular signals (hormone, growth factor, etc.) are converted to intracellular responses through changes in metabolism or gene expression. There are over 500 protein kinases in the human genome (1Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanan S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6075) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between differently activated protein kinase signaling pathways is regulated by a variety of mechanisms that target the activity of an individual protein kinase to a select group of substrates. Most protein kinases exhibit specificity for a defined epitope around the site of phosphorylation, as first elaborated for cAMP-dependent kinase (2Kemp B.E. Bylund D.B. Huang T.S. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3448-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PK, pyruvate kinase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; RMSD, root mean square deviation.2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PK, pyruvate kinase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; RMSD, root mean square deviation. families of protein kinases phosphorylate a serine or threonine residue as part of an (S/T)P motif that in CDK2 substrates is enhanced by a preference for basic residue in the P + 3 position (i.e. (S/T)PX(K/R)). The proline residues act as a powerful discriminator for other kinases (3Zhu G. Fujii K. Belkina N. Liu Y. James M. Herrero J. Shaw S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10743-10748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) but may be insufficient to prevent cross-talk between CDK and MAPK pathways. Further mechanisms are utilized to enhance kinase specificity. CDK2 in complex with cyclin A is active during S phase of the cell cycle. Its activity is controlled in a temporal fashion through regulated transcription (and subsequent degradation) of the activatory cyclin subunits and the Kip/Cip p21 family of inhibitory proteins (4Harper J.W. Adams P.D. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2511-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Activation of CDK2/cyclin A requires phosphorylation on a threonine residue (Thr160 in the human CDK2 sequence) in the activation segment of the kinase by the cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase CAK1. Levels of cyclin A remain high throughout S and G2 until cells enter mitosis where activation of the anaphase-promoting complex results in ubiquitination and destruction of cyclin A. At G2/M, levels of cyclin B rise, and CDK1/cyclin B initiates mitosis. The activities of the CDKs are governed by the cyclins relative to the phases of the cell cycle. The cyclins not only serve as activatory subunits but may also function in substrate recognition through direct interaction with substrates. Recruitment sites for phospho-CDK2/cyclin A (pCDK2/cyclin A) substrates that contain an RXL motif (where X is any amino acid) were first observed with the substrates p107 and p130 (5Ewen M.E. Faha B.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Many other CDK2 substrates that are important for cell cycle progression contain the recruitment motif RXLorKXLat a site that is remote from the site of phosphorylation (e.g. pRb, p53, E2F1, human papilloma virus (HPV) replication factor E1, CDC6, endomexin, Myt1, CDC25A (11Wohlschlegel J.A.

Nature. 2005; 434: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar)). Structural studies of pCDK2/cyclin A in complex with the p27Kip1 inhibitor (15Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) and with peptides from p107, pRb, E2F, p53 (16Lowe E.D. Tews I. Cheng K.Y. Brown N.R. Gul S. Noble M.E. Gamblin S.J. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15625-15634Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) showed that the RXL recognition site is located on the cyclin A molecule at an exposed non-polar site containing the characteristic MRAIL cyclin sequence that is conserved in cyclins A and E (17Honda R. Lowe E.D. Dubinina E. Skamnaki V.T. Cook A. Brown N.R. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 452-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The recruitment site is some 40 Å from the catalytic site (as measured from the Cα of the serine at the substrate phosphorylation site and the Cα of the R of the RXL motif) (18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nature Cell Biology. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Mutation of the hydrophobic patch on cyclin A eliminates phosphorylation of substrates that require an RXL motif but not those CDK2 substrates, such as histone H1, that do not contain an RXL motif (19Schulman B. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Fusion of an RXL motif to deletion mutants can restore activity (20Adams P.D. Li X. Sellars W.R. Baker K.B. Leng X. Harper J.W. Taya Y. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recognition of the RXL motif by pCDK2/cyclin A or pCDK2/cyclin E may be sufficiently tight so that stable complexes can be observed as with p107, E2F, and the inhibitor p27Kip1. In other instances there is no stable association of the substrate with CDK2 but the integrity of the RXL (or KXL) motif has been shown to be essential for phosphorylation of target residues such as in the substrates pRb and p53 (19Schulman B.

Paradoxically stronger physical association between the CDK/cyclin and the substrate does not necessarily lead to a more efficient phosphorylation than weaker interaction, as shown with studies E2F/DP1 phosphorylation (23Guida P. Zhu L. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments with p107 and kinetic experiments with model peptides have shown that one of the roles of the RXL motif is to make a poor substrate with suboptimal consensus phosphorylation motif an effective pCDK2/cyclin A substrate (24Leng X. Noble M.E.M. Adams P.D. Qin J. Harper J.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2242-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Stevenson-Lindert L.M. Fowler P. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50956-50960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RXL-containing peptides are effective inhibitors of the activity of pCDK2/cyclin A against RXL-containing substrates and have potential therapeutic applications (26Andrews M.J. McInnes C.

Wickramasinghe D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1020-1024PubMed Google Scholar). The structural mechanism by which the RXL recognition site on cyclin A promotes substrate phosphorylation by pCDK2 is not understood. There are no conformational changes when the RXL site is occupied (16Lowe E.D. Tews I. Cheng K.Y. Brown N.R. Gul S. Noble M.E. Gamblin S.J. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15625-15634Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nature Cell Biology. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The most likely mechanism is that the RXL motif serves as an entropic effector, localizing the CDK close to the substrate leading to an increase in the local substrate concentration (19Schulman B. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) but mechanisms that envisage a more direct participation between the RXL and catalytic site are also possible (29Takeda D.Y. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To explore the relationship between the recruitment site and catalytic site, we have carried out structural and kinetic studies with a substrate peptide that contains the recruitment motif. We based our peptide on the naturally occurring CDC6 protein that contains a phosphorylation site twenty amino acids N-terminal to the RXL site. To make direct comparison with the optimal heptapeptide (HHASPRK) identified from library screening (30Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and which we used in previous structural studies, we changed the CDC6 peptide sequence from the wild-type sequence: 71PPCSPPKQGKKENGPPHSHTLKGRRLVFDN100 to 71HHASPRKQGKKENGPPHSHTLKGRRLVFDN100, where the sequences around the phosphorylated serine and the RXL motif are highlighted in bold. In a mechanism-based approach to protein kinase inhibitors, bis-substrate compounds have been introduced in which the γ-phosphate of ATP is covalently attached by a linker to the amino analogue of the OH acceptor amino acid located in a peptide of cognate substrate sequence (31Ablooglu A.J. Till J.H. Kim K. Parang K. Cole P.A. Hubbard S.R. Kohanski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30394-30398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Parang K. Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Hubbard S.R. Cole P.A. Nat. Structural Biology. 2001; 8: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Hines A.C. Cole P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 2951-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Noting that with the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain (IRK), the bis-substrate was not only an effective inhibitor but that, in the crystal structure, the peptide component was located with more order than in the complex of the non-covalently linked peptide with AMPPNP, we have explored the use bis-substrate compounds (hereafter referred to as bispeptides) in which the peptides are based on the model heptapeptide and the modified CDC6 peptide and in which the serine analogue amino-alanine is linked to ATPγS via an acetyl bridge (Fig. 1). Structural, kinetic, and binding studies with the substrate peptides and the bispeptide inhibitors show that the presence of the recruitment motif significantly increases affinity for substrates and inhibitors, respectively. Kinetic studies show that there is an obligation for a covalent path between the catalytic site and the RXL motif, but no direct stereochemical path is observed in the crystal studies. A model is proposed based on localization effects and a flexible linker, which must be greater than a specified minimal length (about 15-16 residues), to explain the nanomolar potency of the CDC6 bispeptide inhibitor. Peptides—The heptapeptide substrate, the modified CDC6 peptide, and the recruitment HTL peptide HTLKGRRLVFDN, were synthesized by Dr. G. Bloomberg (University of Bristol Peptide Synthesis Laboratory) and purified by HPLC. The mass of the CDC6 peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry and concentration determined by amino acid analysis. The p107 peptide (Fig. 1) was expressed as a GST fusion protein with the vector pGEX-6P from B834 DE3 pLyS cells at 18 °C overnight, purified on a glutathione-Sepharose fast flow 4B affinity chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences), and the GST tag cleaved by 3C protease. The cleaved peptide was further purified by reverse phase chromatography on a HPLC column (Jupiter 10u C5 by Phenomenex) followed by lyophilization. The lyophilized peptide was dissolved in aqueous solution, and its molecular mass confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Its concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Synthesis of ATP-conjugated Peptides I and II—Peptides were synthesized following the same strategy as described previously (33Hines A.C. Cole P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 2951-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amino-alanine-containing peptides were assembled on Wang resin using automated solid-phase peptide synthesis via the Fmoc strategy. The allyloxycarbonyl (alloc) protection of the side chain of amino-alanine was removed by a 2-h treatment under nitrogen with 5 eq of Pd(PPh3)4, 10 eq of N-methylmorpholine, and 20 eq of acetic acid in chloroform. The side chain of amino-alanine was then bromoacetylated in dimethylformamide for 30 min using symmetric anhydride formed by a 10-min mixing of 10 eq of di-isopropylcarbodiimide and 5 eq of bromoacetic acid in methylene chloride. Trifluoroacetic acid cleavage (with 5% phenol, 5% thioanisole, 5% water, 2.5% ethanedithiol, and 1% triisopropylsilane as scavengers), reverse phase HPLC, and lyophilization gave the bromoacetylated peptides confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS (the long peptide I, calculated [M] 3588, found [M+H]+ 3588 ± 1; the short peptide II, calculated [M] 993, found [M+H]+ 993 ± 1). Treatment of the bromoacetylated peptides with ATPγS (1.5 eq; Roche Applied Science) in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) (∼10 mg peptide in 1 ml of solution) overnight at room temperature followed by gel filtration using Bio-Gel P-2 Gel (∼15 mg purified over ∼50 ml resin) in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) and lyophilization gave the desired ATP-conjugated peptides confirmed by ESI MS (the long peptide I, calculated [M] 4034, found [M+5H]5+ 808, [M+4H]4+ 1009, [M+3H]3+ 1346, [M+2H]2+ 2018, [M+H]+ 4034 ± 1 (reconstructed); the short peptide II, calculated [M] 1431, found [M+Li]+ 1437 ± 1). Crystallization and Crystal Structure of pCDK2/Cyclin A-CDC6 Peptide Complex—Phospho-CDK2/cyclin A was prepared as previously described (18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nature Cell Biology. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). CDC6 peptide (0.5 mm) was mixed with 10 mg/ml purified pCDK2/cyclin A (0.15 mm) together with 1 mm AMPPNP and left on ice for 30 min. Crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in which 1 μl of the protein sample was mixed with 1 μl of precipitant from the reservoir containing 10-17% (v/v) PEG monomethylether 5000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m MES pH 5.6 at 4 °C. Crystals were briefly cryoprotected with 20% (v/v) glycerol solution (in precipitant solution), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and diffraction data collected to 2.4-Å resolution at ESRF station 14.1. The data were processed using MOSSFLM and CCP4 programs (34Leslie A.G.W. MOSFLM. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington1992Google Scholar, 35P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) and a difference electron density map calculated. There was clear binding of the CDC6 peptide at the RXL site for residues HTLKGRRLVFDN and for AMPPNP at the catalytic site, but there was no clear density for a peptide at the catalytic site. Previously we had observed peptide binding at the CDK2 catalytic site by transferring the crystals, which had been grown with lithium sulfate as the precipitant, to a non-polar solvent in order to strengthen polar interactions (18Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nature Cell Biology. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the ammonium sulfate in the present crystallization condition, albeit at a concentration of only 0.2 m, could have affected binding of the CDC6 peptide to the catalytic site. Crystals of the ternary complex were grown as described above and back-soaked into a solution that was the same as the original conditions but without ammonium sulfate and which contained 10 mm CDC6 peptide, 3 mm AMPPNP, and 5 mm MgCl2 (to facilitate nucleotide binding) for 30 min at 4 °C before brief cryoprotection with 20% (v/v) glycerol solution and freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data to 2.7-Å resolution were collected at ESRF station 14.1 (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for pCDK2/cyclin A-CDC6 peptide and pCDK2/cyclin A-CDC6 bispeptide complexesCDC6 peptide: cocrystallized (0.5 mm)CDC6 peptide: back-soak (10 mm)CDC6 bispeptide: back-soak (0.58 mm with 5 mm Mg2+)CDC6 bispeptide: back-soak (0.58 mm with no Mg2+)Data collectionBeamlineESRF station ID 14.1ESRF station ID 14.1ESRF station ID 29ESRF station ID 23.1Space groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Unit cell (Å)a = 74.1a = 74.4a = 74.8a = 74.53b = 113.6b = 114.4b = 114.7b = 114.48c = 181.3c = 170.7c = 181.5c = 181.30Resolution (highest range) (Å)2.4 (2.53-2.4)2.7 (2.85-2.7)2.4 (2.53-2.4)1.7 (1.79-1.7)Observations142,61886,854272,633612,349Unique reflections58,62639,62961,844167,702% Completeness (highest resolution)97.3 (96.7)97.6 (98.5)99.9 (99.9)98.0 (91.5)RsymaRsym = ΣhΣi<Ih>—Ihi/ΣIhi where Ihi is the intensity of the ith observation of unique reflection h.

X-PLOR: Version 3.8; A System for Protein Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1996Google Scholar) using an initial temperature of 2500 K with subsequent cooling step of 25 K per cycle of dynamics. Crystallization and Crystal Structure of the pCDK2/Cyclin A-CDC6 Bispeptide Complex—The complex was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in which 1 μl of pCDK2/cyclin A (18 mg/ml; 0.28 mm) containing 0.29 mm CDC6 bispeptide was mixed 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 13% PEG monomethylether 5000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m citrate/acetate buffer pH 5.6 at 4 °C. Three weeks later a crystal was taken and back-soaked in a ammonium sulfate-free solution containing 13% PEG monomethylether 5000, 0.1 m citrate/acetate buffer pH 5.6, 15% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.58 mm bispeptide overnight before freezing with liquid nitrogen and data collection (Table 1). In a second experiment, magnesium was omitted from the final soak so as to minimize any possible ATPase activity. The pCDK2/cyclin A (18 mg/ml) was co-crystallized with 0.29 mm bispeptide at 4 °C with 14% PEG monomethylether 5000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m citrate/acetate buffer pH 5.6. Ten weeks later, a crystal was taken and back-soaked in 14% PEG monomethylether 5000, 0.1 m citrate/acetate buffer, 15% glycerol, 0.58 m bispeptide for 4-5 min before freezing with liquid nitrogen and data collection (Table 1). Both experiments showed binding at the recruitment site for a dodecamer peptide and weak binding at the catalytic site in which only the modified ATP was clearly located. Two conformations were visible for the ribose and triphosphate in both CDK2 molecules and also two conformations for residues Asp145 and Leu148. The structure for the 1.7-Å data (Table 1) for the pCDK2/cyclin A-bispeptide complex, including the recruitment peptide, ATP, and waters assigned by ARP/wARP, was further refined using TLS (a procedure that allows correlation of internal torsional motion with overall molecular motion in crystals) and isotropic B factors, followed by TLS with anisotropic B factors with strong restraints toward isotropic values, and finally with TLS and anisotropic B values and hydrogen atoms as determined by REFMAC. At each stage the Rfree value was carefully monitored. The refinement statistics (Table 1) support the incorporation of anisotropic B values and hydrogen atoms. Kinetics—Pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), ATP, NADH, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The pCDK2/cyclinA concentration was determined according to Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the peptides was measured by a spectrophotometric assay in which ADP production was coupled to the NADH oxidation by PK and LDH as previously described (40Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Cook F.N. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskowski R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The molar extinction coefficient for NADH was assumed to be 6220 m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm. All reactions were performed at 30 °C. The assay mixture (volume 0.25 ml) for measurement of pCDK2/cyclin A activities with the heptapeptide contained 30 units/ml LDH, 12 units/ml PK, 1 mm PEP, 0.128 mm NADH, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm dithiothreitol with the heptapeptide substrate concentration between 0.106-2.13 mm. After incubation for 1-2 min, the reaction was initiated by the simultaneous addition of 0.74 mm ATP and pCDK2/cyclin A (0.48 μg/ml). Aliquots (0.08 ml) were withdrawn at 3, 6, and 9 min and transferred into 0.08 ml of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.2%). Assays with the heptapeptide substrate were also performed in the presence of 0.75 mm of the recruitment HTL peptide. Control reactions in the absence of peptide substrate were used to monitor any ATPase activity. Reaction rates were found to be linear with enzyme concentration. Measurements with the CDC6 peptide were made using similar conditions. CDC6 peptide concentrations were varied from 0.032-0.48 mm, and reactions were stopped at 13 min with 20 mm triethanolamine pH 8.0, 200 mm EDTA to avoid precipitation of the longer peptides that occurred with SDS. Kinetic data were analyzed with the nonlinear regression program GraFit (42Leatherbarrow R.J. GrafFit Version 3.0. Erithakus Software, Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). The assay mixture for inhibition measurements with the CDC6 bispeptide against the heptapeptide and the p107 peptide substrates was as above except the reaction volumes were 0.08 ml and NADH 0.14 mm. Concentrations of the CDC6 bispeptide inhibitor were 58 nm"

Nuclear import of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev has been suggested to depend on the classic nuclear transport receptor importin β, but not on the adapter protein importin α. We now show that, similar to importin α, Rev is able to dissociate RanGTP from recycling importin β, a reaction that leads to the formation of a novel import complex. Besides importin β, the transport receptors transportin, importin 5, and importin 7 specifically interact with Rev and promote its nuclear import in digitonin-permeabilized cells. A single arginine-rich nuclear localization sequence of Rev is required for interaction with all importins tested so far. In contrast to the importin β-binding domain of importin α, Rev interacts with an N-terminal fragment of importin β. Transportin contains two independent binding sites for Rev. Hence, the mode of interaction of importin β and transportin with Rev is clearly distinct from that with their classic import cargoes. Taken together, the viral protein takes advantage of multiple cellular transport pathways for its nuclear accumulation.

Hence, the mode of interaction of importin β and transportin with Rev is clearly distinct from that with their classic import cargoes. Taken together, the viral protein takes advantage of multiple cellular transport pathways for its nuclear accumulation. The machinery for transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope consists of the nuclear pore complex, which is embedded between the inner and outer nuclear membrane (1Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and a large variety of soluble transport factors (for reviews see Refs. 2Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 3Fried H. Kutay U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 4Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The transport cargoes are characterized by recognition sequences for soluble transport receptors: nuclear export sequences mediate the interaction of proteins with exportins, allowing transport out of the nucleus, whereas nuclear localization signals (NLSs) 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization sequence; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IBB domain, importin β-binding domain; MBP, maltose-binding protein; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. bind to importins, promoting transport of proteins into the nucleus. Importins and exportins, collectively also referred to as karyopherins, belong to the importin β superfamily of transport receptors. They interact not only with their transport cargo but also with proteins of the nuclear pore complex, as well as with the small GTP-binding protein Ran, a factor that plays an important role in the assembly or disassembly of transport complexes (3Fried H. Kutay U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Importin β, the prototype of this family, was originally identified as the transport receptor that is involved in nuclear import of proteins containing a “classic” NLS, i.e. a short stretch of amino acids enriched in basic residues, forming either a single or a bipartite transport motif. These NLSs do not bind to importin β directly but via an adapter protein, importin α. Importin α contains a characteristic importin β-binding- (IBB) domain. A ternary complex containing the import cargo, importin α, and importin β assembles in the cytoplasm, translocates across the nuclear pore complex, and dissociates in the nucleus upon binding of RanGTP to importin β. The import receptor then recycles back to the cytoplasm in a complex with RanGTP. A dedicated exportin, CAS, is used for export of importin α out of the nucleus (5Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Hundreds of proteins have been shown or suggested to take this classic importin α/β-dependent pathway for nuclear import. By far fewer proteins appear to use alternative transport pathways. Adapter proteins like importin α are not involved in most of these import routes. Instead, the import cargo binds directly to the importin. The best characterized alternative transport receptor is transportin, which is distantly related to importin β. Transportin was originally identified as the importin for the M9 sequence, a 38-amino acid stretch of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 protein (6Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Transportin is also involved in nuclear import of a number of basic proteins like histones (7Baake M. Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and ribosomal proteins (8Jäkel S. Görlich D.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another importin that may function without an adapter is importin β itself. The T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (10Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) directly interact with importin β and are thus imported into the nucleus in an importin β-dependent, yet importin α-independent, manner. Another prominent example of a direct importin β cargo is the Rev protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV Rev (for review see Ref. 16Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) is a shuttling protein that is required for nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNAs (17Fischer U. Meyer S. Teufel M. Heckel C. Lührmann R. Rautmann G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It was one of the first proteins identified to contain a so-called leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (18Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lührmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) that links the protein to its exportin, CRM1 (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). A stretch of basic residues in the RNA-binding domain of Rev is required for nuclear import (20Cochrane A.W. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 881-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kubota S. Siomi H. Satoh T. Endo S. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast to the “classic” NLS, where lysine is the predominant amino acid, the Rev-NLS is characterized by arginines as the basic component. Consequently, Rev does not bind to importin α and its nuclear import has been suggested to occur directly via importin β, independent of the adapter protein (22Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used in vitro nuclear import assays and biochemical binding studies to characterize nuclear import of Rev in detail. Our results clearly demonstrate that Rev binds specifically to the nuclear transport receptors importin β, transportin, importin 5, and importin 7 and, hence, can be imported into the nucleus via multiple transport pathways. Interaction of Rev with importin β and transportin is clearly distinct from that with the classic interaction partners of these transport receptors, importin α and the M9 sequence of the hnRNP A1 protein, respectively. Molecular Clones—HIV-1 Rev and HIV-1 RevM5 (24Malim M.H. Bohnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) were PCR amplified from pGEX-Rev and pGEX-RevM5, respectively, and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of a pGEX-2T vector. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification and Labeling of Recombinant Proteins—GST-Rev was expressed in BL21(-DE)-RIL (Stratagene). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in Rev buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm K2SO4) containing 0.4 mg/ml of lysozyme, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. After sonification, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 12–16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Rev buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with Rev buffer containing 15 mm reduced glutathione. Rev was bound to heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the beads were washed with Rev buffer containing 450 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted with Rev buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl. Rev was desalted using PD10-columns (Amersham Biosciences). For RanGAP assays and for in vitro nuclear import using Rev as a competitor, Rev was cleaved from the GST tag with Tev protease. RanBP1 was expressed in BL21(-DE3). Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml of lysozyme, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin), subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. A precipitate resulting from a 50–75% saturation ammonium sulfate cut of the supernatant was resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as above) and subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a POROS HQ column (PerSeptive Biosystems). RanBP1 (95% pure) eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl and was dialyzed against transport buffer (TP buffer; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EGTA).

All proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. GST-Rev and GST-M9 were labeled with Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences).

Binding Studies—Binding studies were essentially performed as described (9Arnold M. Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 5 μg of GST or GST-Rev were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose FF beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had been preincubated with 10 mg/ml of BSA. 5 μg of recombinant transport receptors in 400 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2 mg/ml of BSA) were added. In some experiments, import receptors were preincubated with 2 μm RanQ69LGTP. After incubation for 2 h at 4°C, beads were washed three times with binding buffer without BSA and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining or immunoblotting. Import Assays—Import assays were performed as described (9Arnold M. Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Adherent HeLa cells were permeabilized with 30 μg/ml of digitonin in KP buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EGTA) for Rev or TP buffer for other substrates. A standard 20-μl reaction contained 250 nm import substrate, 4 μm Ran or RanQ69L, 2 mm GTP, an ATP regenerating system (28Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and either 2 mg/ml of HeLa cytosol or 1.5 μm import receptors. In some experiments, HeLa cytosol was preincubated with 3 μl of a monoclonal α-importin β antibody (clone 3E9; Affinity BioReagents; see Ref. 28Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J.

Import reactions were performed for 40 min at 18 °C for Rev or for 30 min at 30 °C for other substrates. For detection of GST-M9 and GST-NLS, cells were subjected to indirect immunostaining using an anti-GST-antibody as described (9Arnold M. Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Cy3-labeled GST-M9 was used. The import substrates HIV-Rev, BSA-NLS, and histone H1.2 were fluorescently labeled. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope. Pictures were processed using Adobe PhotoShop. RanGAP Assays—Labeling of Ran with [γ-32P]GTP and RanGAP assays were essentially performed as described (29Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff F.R.

A standard reaction in 50 μl of KP buffer contained 40–80 nm [γ-32P]RanGTP, preincubated with 50–80 nm importin β (titrated to obtain maximal inhibition of GTP hydrolysis in the absence of importin β-binding proteins), 10 nm RanBP1, 4–8 nm RanGAP, unless otherwise indicated, and 200–400 μm GTP. Reactions in the presence of untagged Rev contained 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After 10 min at 20 °C, reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of stop solution (7% charcoal, 10% ethanol, 0.1 m HCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4). After centrifugation, the released [32P]phosphate in the supernatant was measured by scintillation counting. GTP hydrolysis was expressed as the percentage of the maximal value of recovered radioactivity as obtained in a reference reaction containing a high concentration of importin α. Values obtained in the absence of importin β-binding proteins were subtracted as background. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using standard methods. Rabbit anti-His antibodies (Santa Cruz) or rabbit anti-MBP antibodies (E8030S; New England Biolabs) were used for the detection of His-tagged importin β or MBP-tagged transportin, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova) was used as secondary antibody. The ECL system (Pierce) was used for visualization of proteins. Nuclear Import of HIV Rev Does Not Depend on Importin β or Transportin—The aim of this study was to investigate the requirements for nuclear import of HIV Rev with respect to soluble nuclear transport factors. Nuclear import of Rev has been suggested to depend on importin β as a nuclear import receptor (22Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the nuclear transport of Rev in detail, we established an import assay in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Import of Rev required somewhat different buffer conditions and lower temperatures compared with the classic transport system (31Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that GST-Rev was imported efficiently into nuclei of permeabilized cells at 18 °C in the presence of cytosol and wild-type Ran, yielding a characteristic nucleolar staining pattern that can also be observed in cells upon transfection (Ref. 32Felber B.K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Copeland T. Pavlakis G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar and data not shown). Import was inhibited at 4 °C in the absence of cytosol or in the presence of RanQ69L, a Ran mutant that is predominantly in the GTP-bound form (33Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). RanQ69L promotes the disassembly of nuclear import complexes (34Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and is often used to demonstrate the specificity of nuclear import reactions in vitro. Thus, our results show that Rev can be specifically imported into the nucleus in vitro in a reaction that appears to depend on Ran-binding proteins of the importin β superfamily. Rev has been shown to directly interact with the name-giving member of this family, importin β (22Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether inhibition of the importin β-dependent import pathway would affect nuclear import of Rev. In permeabilized cells, importin α/β-dependent transport can be specifically inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against importin β (35Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, preincubation of cytosol with this antibody strongly inhibited nuclear import of GST-NLS, a substrate for the classic importin α/β-dependent pathway. Inhibition was specific, as transport of GST-M9, a substrate for the import receptor transportin, was not affected. Strikingly, import of GST-Rev was almost as efficient in the presence of the antibody as in the control reaction, suggesting that other transport receptors besides importin β are present in the cytosolic extract and mediate nuclear import of Rev. Of course we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the monoclonal anti-importin β antibody inhibits importin α-dependent, but not importin α-independent, import. Another import receptor known to be involved in transport of basic proteins is the importin β family member transportin. We therefore tested whether inhibition of transportin would affect nuclear import of the basic Rev protein. For inhibition we now used an excess of a transportin-dependent import substrate, the M9 sequence fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP-M9). Nuclear import of GST-M9 was strongly inhibited in the presence of an excess of MBP-M9 (Fig. 2B), demonstrating the saturation of the pathway. We also showed that under similar conditions the transportin-dependent import of c-Fos is inhibited (9Arnold M. Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inhibition was specific for the transportin pathway, as import of BSA-NLS (a substrate for importin α/β) was not affected by MBP-M9 (Fig. 2B). Likewise, GST-Rev was imported into the nuclei whether or not MBP-M9 was present in the reaction. We conclude from these results that neither importin β nor transportin is absolutely required for nuclear transport of Rev. Some basic nuclear proteins have been shown to be imported into the nucleus by multiple transport receptors. We therefore used the ribosomal protein L23 and the histone H2B, which interact with importin β, transportin, importin 5, importin 7, and importin 9 (8Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 36Mühlhausser P. Müller E.C. Otto A. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), in combination with GST-Rev in nuclear import reactions. As shown in Fig. 2C, L23 and H2B efficiently inhibited nuclear accumulation of GST-Rev. In a reciprocal approach, we performed nuclear import reactions with various substrates to test whether their nuclear import can be inhibited by Rev. In the absence of competing Rev, GST-M9 was efficiently imported into the nucleus (Fig. 2D). When high concentrations of Rev were included in the reaction, nuclear import of GST-M9 was clearly reduced. Similarly, histone H1.2, which uses the importin β/importin 7 heterodimer as an import receptor (56Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was imported into the nucleus in the absence, but not in the presence, of Rev (Fig. 2D). Nuclear import of BSA-NLS, in contrast, was hardly affected by Rev (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that multiple transport receptors of the importin β superfamily serve as importins for the viral protein HIV-Rev. HIV-Rev Can Be Imported into the Nucleus by Various Transport Receptors—We directly tested this hypothesis, using bacterially expressed transport receptors. Recombinant importin β, transportin, importin 5, and importin 7 all promoted nuclear import of GST-Rev (Fig. 3A). Transport was specific, as no nucleolar accumulation of Rev was observed when cells were incubated at 4 °C. Furthermore, RanQ69L inhibited import mediated by importin β, transportin, and importin 5 (Fig. 3B). Import of GST-Rev in the presence of importin 7 was not sensitive to RanQ69L, probably reflecting the low affinity of RanGTP for this specific transport receptor (37Görlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). For histone H1, individual transport receptors do not promote nuclear import and a heterodimer of importin β and importin 7 has been shown to function as the physiological import receptor (38Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). For Rev, no further stimulation of import was observed when these two importins were added together to the reaction (data not shown), suggesting that dimer formation is not required for nuclear import of Rev. Rev has been shown to directly bind to importin β (22Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now tested whether other import receptors would specifically interact with Rev as well. As shown in Fig. 4, not only importin β, but also transportin, importin 5, and importin 7, bound to immobilized GST-Rev, but not to immobilized GST. Furthermore, binding of Rev to importin β, transportin, and, to some extent, importin 5 was sensitive to RanQ69L, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. Only a small reduction in binding of importin 7 to GST-Rev was observed when RanQ69L was included in the reaction, probably reflecting the low affinity of importin 7 for RanGTP (compare Fig. 3B). The arginine-rich domain of Rev is required for its nuclear import (20Cochrane A.W. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 881-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kubota S. Siomi H. Satoh T. Endo S. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as well as for the interaction with importin β (22Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the interaction of Rev with other import receptors would also depend on this basic region. In the Rev mutant M5, two arginines are exchanged for aspartic acid and leucine, respectively. This mutation was shown to inhibit nuclear import of Rev as well as Rev function in general (24Malim M.H. Bohnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Importin β, transportin, importin 5, and importin 7 all interacted with GST-Rev (wild type), but not with the mutant GST-Rev-M5 (Fig. 5). This result shows that the arginine-rich NLS of Rev serves as a recognition sequence for various transport receptors. Mutations in regions besides the arginine-rich NLS have been described as leading to reduced nuclear import of Rev. We tested the Rev mutants MA4 and MA5 (39Hope T.J. McDonald D. Huang X.J. Low J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for their interaction with the transport receptors importin β, transportin, importin 5, and importin 7 but did not detect significant differences compared with the wild-type protein (data not shown). Possibly, these mutations affect the general conformation of the Rev protein without perturbing the receptor-substrate interaction. The reasons for reduced nuclear accumulation of these mutants remain to be investigated. How does the interaction of importins with Rev compare to that with their established import cargoes? To answer this question for the two best described importins, we expressed N- and C-terminal fragments of importin β and transportin and analyzed their binding to immobilized GST-Rev. As control cargoes, we immobilized GST-IBB (the importin β-binding domain of importin α) for importin β and the M9 sequence of the hnRNP A1 protein for transportin. As expected, the IBB domain bound to full-length importin β and to the C-terminal, but not to the N-terminal, fragment (Fig. 6A). Rev, in contrast, interacted with full-length importin β and both its N- and C-terminal fragments. Binding of Rev to full-length importin β is inhibited in the presence of RanQ69L (compare Fig. 4), suggesting that its interaction with the fragments is specific, too. We could confirm this assumption for the N-terminal fragment of importin β, which contains the Ran-binding site. As shown in Fig. 6B, RanQ69L prevented the interaction of GST-Rev with this importin β fragment. As a control, RanQ69L did not affect binding of Rev to the C-terminal fragment of importin β, as this part does not contain a Ran-binding site. Taken together, binding of importin β to Rev is clearly distinct from that to the IBB domain of importin α. In similar experiments, the M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 bound exclusively to a C-terminal fragment of transportin, whereas GST-Rev interacted with both an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment (Fig. 6C). Again, binding of full-length transportin to Rev was specific, as it could be blocked by RanQ69L (compare Fig. 4). We performed a specificity control for the N-terminal fragment of transportin, which contains the Ran-binding domain. As shown in Fig. 6D, binding of Re"

Within the epidermis there exists a complex array of cell adhesion structures, and many of the cellular events within the epidermis (differentiation, proliferation, and migration) require that these adhesion structures be remodeled. The link between cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation within the epidermis is well established, and in particular, there is strong evidence to link the process of terminal differentiation to integrin adhesion molecule expression and function. In this paper, we have analyzed the role of a transcriptional repressor called Slug in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function in epidermal keratinocytes. We report that activation of Slug, which is expressed predominantly in the basal layer of the epidermis, results in down-regulation of a number of cell adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin, and several integrins, including α3, β1, and β4. We demonstrate that Slug binds to the α3 promoter and that repression of α3 transcription by Slug is dependent on an E-box sequence within the promoter. This reduction in integrin expression is reflected in decreased cell adhesion to fibronectin and laminin-5. Despite the reduction in integrin expression and function, we do not observe any increase in differentiation. We do, however, find that activation of Slug results in a significant reduction in keratinocyte proliferation.

We do, however, find that activation of Slug results in a significant reduction in keratinocyte proliferation. The human epidermis is a self-renewing epithelial tissue composed of several layers of keratinocytes. Cells are continually lost from the tissue surface and require constant replacement by a process known as terminal differentiation. Terminal differentiation involves cells in the basal layer of the epidermis withdrawing from the cell cycle and migrating into the suprabasal differentiated layers (1Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This migration process, whereby cells detach from a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) 4The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, estrogen receptor; CFE, colony forming efficiency; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. 4The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, estrogen receptor; CFE, colony forming efficiency; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine.known as the basal lamina and move upwards through the epidermis, requires that cellular junctions with the underlying basal lamina (focal adhesions and hemidesmosomes) and with neighboring cells (adherens junctions and desmosomes) be regulated. There is considerable evidence that integrin adhesion molecules play key roles in regulating epidermal function. In normal epidermis, integrins (with the exception of αvβ8) are not expressed in the suprabasal, differentiating layers of the epidermis and are instead generally confined to the basal layer (1Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2Hertle M.D. Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development. 1991; 112: 193-206PubMed Google Scholar). Keratinocyte stem cells express high levels of integrins in vivo and in vitro, and disruption of integrin-ECM interactions results in initiation of terminal differentiation in vitro (3Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 4Jones P.H. Watt F.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 5Jones P.H.

The Snail family of transcriptional repressors are conserved throughout evolution, with well documented roles in a number of vertebrate and invertebrate developmental processes. These include control of mesoderm differentiation and neurogenesis in Drosophila and left-right asymmetry in vertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 6Barrallo-Gimeno A. Nieto M.A. Development. 2005; 132: 3151-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). All Snail family proteins are zinc finger-containing transcriptional repressors that bind to DNA at E-box motifs (CANNTG) on target gene promoters (7Hemavathy K. Guru S.C. Harris J. Chen J.D. Ip Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5087-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Originally, Snail family members were thought to be determinants of developmental processes, such as mesoderm induction, but increasingly the evidence suggests that Snail family members control developmental processes by regulating genes involved in cell adhesion and migration rather than inducing these processes directly (6Barrallo-Gimeno A. Nieto M.A. Development. 2005; 132: 3151-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of reports have implicated Snail family members in tumor progression. Snail has been reported to be up-regulated in a number of human tumors, including breast, colon, and gastric cancer, and there is a strong correlation between Snail expression and degree of invasiveness in these tumors (9Blanco M.J.

Another Snail family member, Slug, has also been shown to be up-regulated in breast cancer and in malignant mesothelioma (12Catalano A. Rodilossi S. Rippo M.R. Caprari P. Procopio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46706-46714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). One role of Snail family proteins in human tumors may be to repress E-cadherin expression, thus contributing to the invasive, migratory phenotype of these cells (13Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with mouse tumor models, where Snail has been shown to be active in the invasive region of the tumor (14Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). Whereas much is known about the function of Snail proteins during development, and their potential role in malignant progression is becoming more apparent, relatively little is known about their role in normal adult tissue. Slug mRNA has been detected in a variety of adult human tissues, and recently expression of a Slug-β-galactosidase fusion protein has been detected in mouse epidermis (15Cohen M.E. Yin M. Paznekas W.A. Schertzer M. Wood S. Jabs E.W. Genomics. 1998; 51: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Parent A.E. Choi C. Caudy K. Gridley T. Kusewitt D.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used conditional activation of Slug in human keratinocytes to analyze the role of Slug in the epidermis. We provide evidence that components of focal adhesions (α3 and β1 integrin) and hemidesmosomes (β4 integrin) are novel targets for Slug and that activation of Slug results in inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation. Reagents and Antibodies—Antibodies used were involucrin (SY-5; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Slug (G-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), E-cadherin (HECD-1), α3 integrin (VM-2 and DH4; CRUK, London, UK), β1 integrin (210H and P5D1), β4 integrin (450-11A), α-tubulin (DM 1A; Sigma), PAKα (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK (9102; Cell Signaling), phospho-ERK (pTEpY; Promega), Rb (9302; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-Rb (9308S; Cell Signaling Technology), and caspase-3 (552037; BD Biosciences). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Primary human keratinocytes were cultured using the method of Rheinwald and Green as described elsewhere (17Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3836) Google Scholar). In some experiments Slug activity was induced by the addition of 100 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT). 293T HEK cells were cultured and transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (18Akhtar N. Hudson K.R. Hotchin N.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell culture medium and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmids—Full-length human Slug cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector pBabePuroGFP:ER (19Croft D.R. Sahai E. Mavria G. Li S. Tsai J. Lee W.M. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8994-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) to give pBabe-PuroGFP:Slug:ER, which encodes GFP:Slug:ER as a single fusion protein. pBabePuroGFP:ER, encoding GFP:ER, was used as an empty vector control. pCDNA3-Slug, encoding full-length human Slug, was a gift from Tony Ip (7Hemavathy K. Guru S.C. Harris J. Chen J.D. Ip Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5087-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). pMSCV-Slug-IRES-GFP was generated by subcloning Slug cDNA upstream of the IRES-GFP sequence in pMSCV. Retroviral Transduction—Stable polyclonal cell lines expressing pBabePuroGFP:ER or pBabePuroGFP:Slug:ER were established by retroviral transduction of primary human epidermal keratinocytes and selection with puromycin as described elsewhere (20Levy L. Broad S. Zhu A.J. Carroll J.M. Khazaal I. Peault B. Watt F.M. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All cell lines were used between passages 3 and 5. Colony Forming Efficiency—Keratinocyte colony forming efficiency was analyzed as described elsewhere (4Jones P.H. Watt F.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were seeded at a density of 1.33 × 102 cm-2 onto mitotically inactivated fibroblast feeder cells and cultured for 14 days in normal growth medium in the presence of 4-HT. Medium containing 4-HT was replaced every 3 days. After 14 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 1% rhodanile blue, and the number of keratinocyte colonies was recorded. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—Frozen sections were fixed, blocked with normal goat serum for 30 min, and then incubated for 1 h with a goat polyclonal Slug antibody (2 μg/ml). Sections were then incubated with peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-goat (1:100), and immunoreactivity was visualized using diaminobenzidine reagent followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Omission of primary antibody was employed as a negative control. For immunocytochemistry, keratinocytes, cultured on acid-washed glass coverslips, were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as described previously (18Akhtar N. Hudson K.R. Hotchin N.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Entry of cells into S phase was analyzed by incorporation of BrdUrd using a commercially available kit (Roche Applied Science). Immunostained cells were visualized using a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA camera, and images were captured and processed using OpenLab software (Improvision). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Protein lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot as described elsewhere (21Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Adhesion Assays—Keratinocytes were resuspended in serum-free medium and plated in 96-well plates (Immulon II; Thermo Electron) coated with either recombinant fibronectin FIII9-10 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline or a laminin-5-enriched substrate and blocked in bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h. After incubation for 1 h, non-adherent cells were removed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline, and numbers of adherent cells were assessed by analysis of endogenous hexosaminidase activity (22Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 and FIII9-10 were produced as described elsewhere (23Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 24Hotchin N.A. Kidd A.G. Altroff H. Mardon H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2937-2946PubMed Google Scholar). Real Time Q-PCR Analysis—RNA for real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis was extracted from keratinocyte cultures using a QIAgen RNEASY mini with on column DNase digestion (Qiagen). RNA was eluted into 50 μl of RNase free water, and concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using random hexamers and single strand RT polymerase II (Invitrogen), as per the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and equal RNA loading were checked by PCR with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers. Target primer and probe sequences were chosen with the assistance of Primer Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and Blast searches were performed to confirm gene specificity. To avoid amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, primers and probes spanned exon-exon boundaries. Primers were synthesized by Sigma. Dual labeled FAM-TAMRA (5-carboxyfluorescein-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) probes were synthesized by Eurogentech. Nucleotide sequences of primers and probes are listed in Table 1. 18 S ribosomal RNA control kit, including primers and VIC-labeled probe, was used as internal control (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sample cDNAs were subjected to Q-PCR in triplicate using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated using identical threshold values for all experiments and 18 S Ct values subtracted as control for loading (dCt). Relative expression was compared with keratinocytes expressing GFP:ER treated with 4-HT for 72 h, and -fold change was calculated by conversion through 2-ddCt. Data shown represent the mean and S.E. of three separate experiments.TABLE 1Primer and probe sequences used in real time quantitative PCR analysisPrimer/ProbeSequenceE-cadherinForward5′-GGCGCCACCTCGAGAGA-3′Probe5′-AAATTCACTCTGCCCAGGACGCGG-3′Reverse5′-TGTCGACCGGTGCAATCTT-3′α3 integrinForward5′-TGGCTCTGCCTTTGGTTTATCT-3′Probe5′-TGGCCAGCATTGGTGACATCA-3′Reverse5′-CAGCAATATCCTGAAATCCATCCT-3′β1 integrinForward5′-TTTCGATGCCATCATGCAA-3′Probe5′-TTGCAGTTTGTGGATCACTGATTGGCTG-3′Reverse5′-ACCAGCAGCCGTGTAACATTC-3′β4 integrinForward5′-ACTATTGGATTTGGCAAGTTTGTG-3′Probe5′-AAAGTCAGCGTCCCGCAGACGG-3′Reverse5′-TTCAGCTTCTCAGGCCTCATG-3′ Open table in a new tab Reporter Assays—The wild-type human E-cadherin promoter sequence (-301/+21) cloned into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter (EproWT) was a gift from Prof. van Roy (8Comijn J.

Tsuji (25Kato T. Katabami K. Takatsuki H. Han S.A. Takeuchi K. Irimura T. Tsuji T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). pGL-ES-EBM, containing the mutated, nonfunctional E-box sequence was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the E-box sequence in pGL-ES using the following primer sequence: 5′-AGGGTTCCCGATCGGTGTCTGAGAGA-3′ (mutated bases are underlined) (25Kato T.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). pGL3 basic, containing the firefly luciferase gene without a promoter sequence, was used as a control, with the Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid (pRL TK) used as a transfection control. 293T HEK cells were transiently transfected with 0.3 μg of either EproWT, pGL-ES, pGL-ES-EBM, or pGL3-basic in the presence of 1 μg of pCDNA3 control or pCDNA3-Slug vector and 0.1 μg of pRL TK. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed 48 h post-transfection using the dual reporter assay kit Stop 'N′ Glow (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity as a transfection control. Promoter activity is expressed as relative luciferase activity compared with that obtained in pGL3basic control-transfected cells. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described elsewhere (26Ray D.M. Akbiyik F. Bernstein S.H. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T HEK cells were transiently transfected with pMSCV-Slug-IRES-GFP. Cells were subsequently lysed, and the nuclear and cytosol fractions were purified. 10 μg of nuclear extract was allowed to bind to 100 fmol/μl5′ biotin-labeled α3 integrin oligonucleotide dimers with or without E-box mutations, in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor at 20 pmol/μl, and in the presence or absence of 2 μl of anti-Slug antibody as appropriate. Reactions were electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions and transferred to nylon membrane, and biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated strepavidin. Binding oligonucleotide sequences were taken from positions -254 to -218 of the murine α3 promoter and are listed in Table 2.TABLE 2α3 integrin oligonucleotide sequences used in EMSAOligonucleotideSequenceWild typeForward5′-TAAGGGTTCCCGACAGGTGTCTGAGAGAGAGG-3′Reverse5′-CCTCTCTCTCAGACACCTGTCGGGAACCCTTA-3′Mutated E-boxForward5′-TAAGGGTTCCCGAAGGGTGTCTGAGAGAGAGG-3′Reverse5′-CCTCTCTCTCAGACACCCTTCGGGAACCCTTA-3′ Open table in a new tab Slug Is Expressed Predominantly in the Basal Layer of the Epidermis—The expression and function of Slug in adult tissue is poorly characterized. We analyzed expression of Slug in human skin by immunohistochemistry of sections taken from foreskin. Expression of Slug was observed in both the dermis and in all layers of the epidermis, with high levels of expression in the basal layer of the epidermis (Fig. 1). Expression of Slug was not confined to the nucleus, with strong expression also observed in the cytoplasm of basal and suprabasal cells. This is consistent with data from Slug-β-galactosidase transgenic mice, where expression of the Slug-β-galactosidase fusion protein was detected in the basal layers of the epidermis and in other epithelial tissues (16Parent A.E. Choi C. Caudy K. Gridley T. Kusewitt D.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The same report also identified high level Slug expression in hair follicles absent from these sections. Strong Slug immunoreactivity was also detected in the outermost, anuclear cornified layers of the epidermis. However, this staining is probably nonspecific and has been observed with a number of other nonrelated primary antibodies (data not shown). Slug Regulates E-cadherin Expression in Epidermal Keratinocytes—To analyze the function of Slug in keratinocytes, we established, by retroviral transduction, cell lines stably expressing a protein consisting of full-length Slug fused to GFP and the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER). In this system, the GFP:Slug:ER fusion protein is constitutively expressed but is inactive due to the binding of a heat shock protein (HSP90) to the ER ligand-binding domain. The addition of the estrogen homologue, 4-HT, results in displacement of HSP90 and activation of Slug (27Picard D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We used retroviral transduction and selection in puromycin to establish keratinocyte cell lines expressing pBabePuroGFP:Slug:ER (GFP:Slug:ER) and pBabePuroGFP:ER (GFP:ER). We established expression of the respective constructs by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) and by analyzing GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2B). We observed expression of GFP in over 80% of cells, and the GFP:Slug:ER fusion protein was localized to the nucleus in the presence and absence of 4-HT (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Having established these cell lines, we analyzed expression of E-cadherin in epidermal keratinocytes following activation of Slug. E-cadherin is a known Slug target in other cell types and thus provides a suitable functional readout for the activity of Slug in our cells (28Bolos V. Peinado H. Perez-Moreno M.A. Fraga M.F. Esteller M. Cano A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Following the addition of 4-HT, we observed significant, but not complete, loss of E-cadherin from sites of cell-cell adhesion in cells expressing GFP:Slug:ER but not in control cells expressing a GFP:ER fusion (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis of the same cells also revealed a loss in E-cadherin expression in cells expressing GFP:Slug:ER following treatment with 4-HT to activate Slug (Fig. 3B). 4-HT treatment of control cells expressing GFP:ER resulted in no loss of E-cadherin expression, indicating that the loss in expression was a consequence of Slug activation and not a 4-HT-associated effect. The loss in E-cadherin expression at the protein level was mirrored by a decrease in E-cadherin mRNA levels as determined by real time Q-PCR (p < 0.01; Student's t test) (Fig. 3C). In promoter reporter assays, we also observed repression of E-cadherin promoter activity following co-transfection of 293T cells with plasmids encoding full-length Slug and the E-cadherin promoter fused to luciferase (p < 0.001; Student's t test) (Fig. 3D). This loss of E-cadherin expression and repression of transcription is consistent with previous reports identifying E-cadherin as a Slug target (7Hemavathy K. Guru S.C. Harris J. Chen J.D. Ip Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5087-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The reduction in E-cadherin expression, rather than complete loss, is also consistent with the report that Slug is a weaker repressor of E-cadherin than Snail (28Bolos V. Peinado H. Perez-Moreno M.A. Fraga M.F. Esteller M. Cano A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). These data confirm expression and activity of Slug and identify a role for Slug in the epidermis.FIGURE 3Conditional activation of Slug results in reduced E-cadherin expression in epidermal keratinocytes. A, GFP:Slug:ER- and control GFP:ER-expressing keratinocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nm 4-HT for 72 h prior to being fixed and immunostained using a E-cadherin antibody (HECD-1). Image capture times were the same for all conditions. Scale bar,25 μm. B, GFP:Slug:ER and control GFP:ER keratinocytes were cultured in the presence of 100 nm 4-HT for 0, 8, and 72 h before cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and immunodetection of E-cadherin using HECD-1 antibody. Expression of α-tubulin was also assessed as a loading control. C, real time Q-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from GFP:ER- and GFP:Slug:ER-expressing cells cultured for 72 h in the presence of 100 nm 4-HT. Data shown are the mean and S.E. from three separate experiments. D, 293T HEK cells were transiently transfected with 0.3 μg of EproWT (E-cadherin promoter construct), 0.1 μg of pRL-TK (transfection control), and 1 μg of either pcDNA3-Slug or pcDNA3, cultured for 48 h, and lysed, and luciferase activity was analyzed.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Analysis of α3, β1, and β4 integrin sequences revealed the presence of potential E-boxes in all three integrin promoters, suggesting that they might be potential Slug targets (25Kato T. Katabami K.

Activation of Slug resulted in loss of α3 from sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 4A), presumably as a consequence of the dramatic reduction in total α3 protein expression as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). No change in α3 localization or expression was observed in control keratinocytes treated with 4-HT (Fig. 4, A and B). Further experiments, involving real time Q-PCR analysis, revealed a significant decrease in α3 mRNA following activation of Slug (p < 0.05; Student's t test) (Fig. 4C). Co-transfection of 293T cells with a Slug cDNA expression vector and an α3 promoter reporter construct revealed a significant decrease in α3 promoter activity (p < 0.001; Student's t test) (Fig. 4D). Control experiments using an α3 promoter construct in which the E-box has been mutated indicated that Slug-mediated repression of α3 transcription requires an intact E-box (Fig. 4D). Slug Binds to the α3 Integrin Promoter in an E-box-dependent Manner—We used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to analyze whether Slug could bind the α3 promoter, which contains one E-box motif (25Kato T. Katabami K. Takatsuki H. Han S.A. Takeuchi K. Irimura T. Tsuji T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 293T HEK epithelial cells were transiently transfected with pMSCV-Slug-IRES-GFP, and 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed, and nuclear fractions were isolated. Protein from the nuclear fraction of Slug-transfected cells efficiently bound to the wild-type probe, giving a retarded complex halfway up the gel (Fig. 5A). This retarded complex was not observed with a mutated E-box probe, suggesting that mutation of the E-box was sufficient to block formation of the retarded complex and that the E-box is required for effective binding of the nuclear extract protein. The labeled retarded complex was significantly reduced when wild-type probe was mixed with excess unlabeled competitor probe, demonstrating the specificity of this retarded complex in binding to wild-type probe. A supershift band was observed when an anti-Slug anti-body was added, confirming that Slug was present in the retarded complex. Specificity was confirmed by loss of the supershift when excess unlabeled wild-type probe was introduced (Fig. 5B). This experiment confirms that Slug specifically binds to the α3 integrin promoter in an E-box-dependent manner.

Little, however, is understood about its mechanism of function. We used mass spectrometry to identify CD2AP-interacting proteins. Many of the proteins that we identified suggest a role for CD2AP in endocytosis and actin regulation. To address the role of CD2AP in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, we focused on characterizing the interaction of CD2AP with actin-capping protein CP. We identified a novel binding motif LXHXTXXRPK(X)6P present in CD2AP that is also found in its homolog Cin85 and other capping protein-associated proteins such as CARMIL and CKIP-1. CD2AP inhibits the function of capping protein in vitro. Therefore, our results support a role of CD2AP in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

It is composed of three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains at the NH2 terminus followed by proline-rich sequences and a coiled-coil domain at the extreme COOH terminus. It is expressed in all tissues except brain. Interestingly, CD2AP-deficient animals die of renal failure ∼6 weeks of age (2Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In the kidney, CD2AP is highly expressed in the glomerular epithelial cell, and it is implicated to play a role in a specialized cell junction known as a slit diaphragm (3Shih N.Y. Li J. Cotran R.

A homolog of CD2AP, Cin85, was cloned as an interacting protein with the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-cbl (4Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and as an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Gout I. Middleton G. Adu J. Ninkina N.N. Drobot L.B. Filonenko V.

Recently, several endocytic and actin-associated molecules have been reported to interact with CD2AP and Cin85. Some proteins have been demonstrated to interact with both CD2AP and Cin85, whereas others have only been shown to bind one or the other. CD2AP has been shown to play a role in vesicular trafficking because of interactions with c-cbl and an active form of Rab4 (6Cormont M. Meton I. Mari M. Monzo P. Keslair F. Gaskin C. McGraw T.E. Le March-Brustel Y. Traffic. 2003; 4: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cin85 has also been shown to bind to molecules involved in endocytosis, such as endophilin, synaptojanin 2B1, and SHIP-1 and the clathrin scaffold HIP1R (7Kowanetz K. Husnjak K. Holler D. Kowanetz M.

Interactions of CD2AP and Cin85 with the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-dependent GTPase for ARF1 and ARF5, known as ASAP1, as well as cortactin- and actin-capping protein suggest additional roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (7Kowanetz K.

To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of CD2AP function, we performed mass spectrometry to identify interacting proteins. We identified novel and previously known interacting proteins such as actin-capping protein CP (11Hutchings N.J. Clarkson N. Chalkley R. Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22396-22403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, there has been much progress in our understanding of how the actin cytoskeleton is regulated. Critical is the polymerization of monomeric G-actin to forming an asymmetric actin filament with a barbed and a pointed end. The barbed end is favored for polymerization. The Arp2/3 complex and formins can nucleate actin polymerization by creating free barbed ends, whereas gelsolin and actin-capping protein CP cap the barbed end (13Cooper J.A. Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 14Harris E.S. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R520-R522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CP is a ubiquitously expressed heterodimer of α and β subunits (15Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is enriched in lamellipodia, and it plays an important role in cell motility (13Cooper J.A. Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). CP binds to the barbed end of the actin filament and prevents the addition and removal of actin subunits (16Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). By limiting the growth of pre-existing actin filaments, CP enhances new actin filament branching by the Arp2/3 complex (17Pollard T.D. Beltzner C.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, several proteins (CARMIL, CKIP-1, and V-1) have been demonstrated to bind and inhibit CP activity (18Canton D.A.

To understand the role of CD2AP in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, we decided to focus on characterizing the interaction of CD2AP with CP. Even though this interaction was previously reported (11Hutchings N.J. Clarkson N. Chalkley R. Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22396-22403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the mode of binding and the effect of CD2AP on the activity of CP are not known. In this report, we confirmed the binding of CD2AP with CP, and we mapped the interaction. This allowed us to identify a novel capping protein binding motif recognized by CP that is present in CD2AP, Cin85, CKIP-1, and CARMIL. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (21Huber T.B. Hartleben B. Kim J. Schmidts M. Schermer B. Keil A. Egger L. Lecha R.L. Borner C. Pavenstadt H. Shaw A.S. Walz G. Benzing T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4917-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After incubation for 24 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaF, 12.5 mm Na4P2O7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) to remove cellular debris, the supernatant was subjected to an ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) for 30 min. Equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer. Preparation of Samples for Mass Spectrometry—Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with GelCode Blue Colloidal Coomassie reagent (MJS BioLynx Inc., Brockville, ON, Canada) as previously described (22Ingham R.J. Colwill K. Howard C. Dettwiler S. Lim C.S. Yu J. Hersi K. Raaijmakers J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Taylor L. Yeung B. Vassilovski G. Amin M. Chen F. Matskova L. Winberg G. Ernberg I. Linding R. O'Donnell P. Starostine A. Keller W. Metalnikov P. Stark C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7092-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Silver staining of gels was performed as described by Shevchenko et al. (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7785) Google Scholar). Individual bands were excised from the gel with a scalpel and placed into a single well of a 96-well microtitre plate (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Reduction, alkylation, and “in-gel” tryptic digestion of samples was performed with a Genomic Solutions ProGest digestion robot as previously described (24Houthaeve T. Gausepohl H. Mann M. Ashman K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were then extracted from the gel for analysis by mass spectrometry. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry— Tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a HP 1100 HPLC system (Palo Alto, CA) connected to an LCQ-Deca mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) as previously described (22Ingham R.J. Colwill K. Howard C. Dettwiler S. Lim C.S. Yu J. Hersi K. Raaijmakers J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Taylor L. Yeung B. Vassilovski G. Amin M. Chen F. Matskova L. Winberg G. Ernberg I. Linding R. O'Donnell P. Starostine A. Keller W. Metalnikov P. Stark C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7092-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with both the Mascot (4Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and Sonar ms/ms (Genomic Solutions) search engines. Plasmids—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were made using the PGEX-KG vector (25Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding the COOH-terminal CD2AP (residues 324–636) was cloned in-frame into vector cut with BamHI and EcoRI. Sequences encoding a COOH-terminal fragment of CD2AP lacking the proline-rich sequence CTΔPR (residues 424–636) was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned in-frame into the NcoI and SalI sites of PGEX-KG. The COOH-terminal construct lacking the coiled-coil domain CTΔCC (residues 424–588) was generated by deletion mutagenesis of residues encoding 589–636. Constructs encoding residues 424–528 and 474–588 were generated by deletion mutagenesis of CTΔPR. The construct encoding residues 474–528 was generated by deletion mutagenesis using the construct encoding residues 478–592 as the starting point. The construct encoding residues 474–528 was used to generate constructs with residues 474–513, 474–598, 490–528, and 506–528 by deletion mutagenesis. Point mutations in CTΔPR (L486A, H488A, T490A, N492A, R493A, K495A, R500A, and P502A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by PCR. Proteins—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified using standard procedures using glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Chicken-capping protein CP α1 and β1 subunits were co-expressed in E. coli using the pET-3d vector and purified as described previously (16Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The CP deletion mutants α1Δβ1 (α1 COOH-terminal 28-amino-acid deletion mutant), α1β1Δ (β1 COOH-terminal 34-amino-acid deletion mutant), and α1Δβ1Δ (double COOH-terminal region deletion mutant) were purified as described in Ref. 16Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar. Confirmatory sequencing of all constructs was done using Big-Dye 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and by absorbance measurement at 280-nm wavelength. BIAcore Analysis—The experiments were carried out using a BIAcore 2000 at 25 and 30 °C for both binding detection and affinity measurements. Goat anti-GST antibody (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) was cross-linked to CM5 chips using amine coupling (BIAcore). CD2AP constructs fused to GST were then loaded onto chips containing the immobilized anti-GST antibody in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. CP was injected at various concentrations at a flow rate of 25 μl/min. To measure the affinity by Scatchard analysis, CP was injected at various concentrations, and the equilibrium binding was obtained and plotted. The binding kinetic rate constants were obtained by using BIAevaluation version 3.1 software (BIAcore). The koff rate was measured by co-injecting soluble CD2AP during the dissociation phase of the reaction. To compare the binding of various mutated constructs, similar amounts of GST-CD2AP constructs were captured on the chip. Because the magnitude of the response is related to the mass of the analyte, we corrected for differences in the molecular weights of each construct and variances in the amount immobilized on the chip using the equation RUmax = RUligand × (molecular weight of analyte/molecular weight of ligand). This allowed us to calculate a relative RUmax for each construct. The percent binding of the mutated construct in comparison to the wild-type construct was then computed by comparing the actual RU of the bound CP at steady state (Req) to the calculated Rmax. Peptides—The 22-mer peptides used for the competition assay were synthesized by standard Fmoc chemistry using a multiple peptide synthesizer (Symphony/Multiplex; Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ).

The sequences of the peptides used were: CARMIL, RRLEHFTKLRPKRNKKQQTQA; CKIP-1, SYLAHPTRDRAKIQHSRRPPTR; CD2AP, ENLLHLTANRPKMPGRRLPGRF; and CD2AP (R493A), ENLLHLTANAPKMPGRRLPGRF (the bold letter indicates the mutation). Spectrin F-actin-seeded Actin Polymerization Assay—Proteins and spectrin F-actin seeds were prepared and assayed as described in Ref. 16Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr.

Actin was used at a final concentration of 1.5 μm (3% pyrene-labeled) in 1× polymerization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EGTA). Ca2+-G-actin was primed for 90 s prior to the initiation of polymerization by adding a 110 volume of 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 to exchange Ca2+ to Mg2+. A 120 volume of 20× polymerization buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm EGTA) was then added to initiate polymerization. CP, GST-CD2AP (CTΔPR), and GST-CD2AP-(474–513) were in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA. The CP and CP-CD2AP mixtures were added to the actin mixture immediately after priming, followed by the addition of 20× polymerization buffer, followed by 10 μl of spectrin F-actin seed. The solution was mixed and placed in the fluorometer with a total dead time of 20 s. The solution was then recovered and incubated overnight at 25 °C to reach equilibrium to allow for measurements at steady state. The steady-state binding data were analyzed using PRISM4 software. Actin Uncapping Assay—The uncapping assay was a modification of the actin polymerization assay using 1 μm actin (5% pyrene-labeled) and 2 nm CP.

Uncapping activity is defined as the rate of polymerization, calculated from the slope of the pyrene fluorescence versus time, following the addition of CARMIL or CD2AP-(474–513). Identification of CD2AP-associated Protein by Mass Spectrometry—To identify CD2AP-interacting proteins, an epitope-tagged version of CD2AP was overexpressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated. The co-precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The identification of protein bands was performed using mass spectrometry. In addition to CD2AP, several previously described CD2AP-interacting proteins were identified, such as actin (27Lehtonen S. Zhao F. Lehtonen E. Am. J.

The identification of multiple proteins involved in actin cytoskeletal regulation suggested that CD2AP participates in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Because CP plays an important role in the assembly of various actin structures, we hypothesized that CD2AP might regulate the activity of CP. We therefore focused on characterizing the interaction of CP with CD2AP in more detail. Mapping the Interaction Domain—Previously, an interaction of CP with the COOH-terminal half of CMS (Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains), the human ortholog of CD2AP, was reported (11Hutchings N.J. Clarkson N. Chalkley R. Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22396-22403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we generated a GST fusion protein containing residues 324–636 of CD2AP and tested it for interaction with purified CP using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). CD2AP was immobilized on the chip, and CP was used as the analyte. As predicted, the fragment encoding the COOH-terminal half of CD2AP interacted with CP (Fig. 1B). Scatchard analysis showed that this fragment bound to CP with a dissociation constant (KD) of 2.4 nm. Real-time measurements revealed binding kinetics of kon = 9.6 × 105 m–1 s–1 and k = 2.3 × 10–3 s–1off (Fig. 1C). The COOH-terminal half of CD2AP is notable for proline-rich sequences followed by a predicted coiled-coil domain near the extreme COOH terminus (1Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S. Desai N. Widder P. Rosenberger F. van der Merwe P.A. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We first tested the requirement of the coiled-coil domain for binding to CP by generating a construct lacking the coiled-coil domain CTΔCC (residues 324–588). Using SPR, we found that this construct still bound to CP. Therefore, the coiled-coil domain is not required for binding (Fig. 1B). Next, we tested whether the proline-rich sequences of CD2AP were required for binding. A construct, CTΔPR (residues 428–636), lacking the proline-rich sequences between 324 and 428, was generated and tested for its ability to bind CP by SPR. This construct also retained binding to CP, suggesting that the proline-rich sequences were not required for binding (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we deduced that the region of CD2AP between the proline-rich sequences and the coiled-coil domain (residues 424–588) contains the CP binding region. To define the interaction site further, we generated additional truncation mutants. Because this region has no predicted secondary structure, we generated constructs eliminating either 60 residues from the COOH terminus (residues 424–528) or 50 residues from the NH2-terminal end (residues 474–588). Both constructs retained binding to CP (Fig. 2A), narrowing the binding region to residues 474–528. The region 474–528 was sufficient for binding, because a construct encoding just these residues was able to bind to CP measured by SPR (Fig. 2A). We narrowed the binding site further by generating additional constructs, deleting residues from both the NH2 and COOH termini. Although the construct encoding residues 474–513 retained binding to CP, the construct encoding residues 474–498 had impaired binding. Thus, residues between 474 and 513 were sufficient for CP binding (Fig. 2A). We measured the binding affinity of this minimal binding region of CD2AP (residues 474–513) with CP. Scatchard analysis showed that CD2AP bound to CP with a KD of 5.6 nm, and real-time measurements showed binding kinetics of kon = 4.7 × 105 m–1 s–1 and koff = 2.6 × 10–3 s–1 (Fig. 2B). Because this affinity is similar to the one measured for the interaction of the entire COOH-terminal half of CD2AP with CP, this region was sufficient to account for CP binding. CP is a heterodimer of α and β subunits. The COOH termini of both subunits are known to be important for its actin-capping activity (16Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test the importance of these regions for the interaction with CD2AP, CP constructs lacking the α COOH-terminal region, the β COOH-terminal region, or both were tested for binding to CTΔPR. CP lacking the α COOH-terminal region or both the α and β COOH termini regions did not interact with CD2AP, whereas CP lacking just the β COOH-terminal region had an intermediate binding ability (Fig. 2C). Hence, CD2AP requires both α and β COOH termini regions of CP for efficient binding. These results predicted that CD2AP should inhibit capping activity of CP. Identification of CP Binding Motif—Recently, the binding regions for two CP-binding proteins, CKIP and CARMIL, were reported (18Canton D.A. Olsten M.E. Kim K. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Cooper J.A. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Yang C. Pring M. Wear M.A. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether these binding sites had similarities to residues 474–513 of CD2AP, we performed a CLUSTAL analysis. The sequence alignment illustrated in Fig. 3A shows that all three proteins share a similar pattern of residues, LXHXTXXRPK(X)6P (where X is any amino acid) suggesting that this may be the CP binding motif. To determine whether the residues in this motif are important for CP binding, we mutated each of the conserved residues to alanine in the CTΔPR construct (residues 428–636). Each mutant was tested for CP binding using SPR (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the conserved leucine, arginine, and proline residues (Lue-486, Arg-493, Pro-502) completely ablated binding, whereas mutations of the other conserved residues significantly impaired but did not completely ablate binding. Importantly, mutations of two non-conserved residues in CD2AP, N492 and R500, did not affect binding of CP to CD2AP. Therefore, we concluded that the LXHXTXXRPK(X)6P motif in CD2AP is necessary for binding. To verify that the LXHXTXXRPK(X)6P motif found in all three proteins (CD2AP, CARMIL, and CKIP-1) is the binding site, we tested 22-mer peptides corresponding to this motif from CKIP-1 and CARMIL in a competition assay against the CD2AP protein. The ability of the CKIP-1 and CARMIL peptides to inhibit CD2AP binding to CP (Fig. 3C) confirmed that all three of these proteins use this motif to bind to CP, and therefore this motif is sufficient for binding. Inhibition of CP Activity by CD2AP—Because both the actincapping activity and CD2AP binding required the COOH-terminal regions of CP, we were interested to test whether CD2AP binding could affect CP-capping activity. This was tested using a pyrene-actin polymerization assay for barbed end growth in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The polymerization of pyrene-actin as assessed by its fluorescence was measured over time. The addition of up to 500 nm CTΔPR alone to the reaction mixture did not have any effect on actin polymerization, and as expected, the addition of CP inhibited barbed end growth. Addition of CTΔPR to CP inhibited the activity of CP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). A similar effect was observed with the addition of the minimal binding domain (residues 474–513) (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of CD2AP on the activity of CP was saturated when the CTΔPR concentration reached ∼500 nm (Fig. 4A). Because this is much higher than the KD of CP for CD2AP, we suggest that the inhibition of CP by CD2AP is not complete. The partial inhibitory effect of CD2AP on CP actin-capping activity was confirmed using a steady-state polymerization assay. In this experiment, the effect of CD2AP was allowed to go to equilibrium by allowing the reaction to go to completion; actin fluorescence was measured after 18 h. Using PRISM4 software, the affinity of CD2AP for CP was found to be similar to that measured by SPR (Fig. 4B). In addition, because the activity of CP was not completely inhibited, this suggests that the CD2AP·CP complex still retains some filament-capping activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, after the complex had reached equilibrium, full actin polymerization had not been achieved, suggesting that the CD2AP·CP complex retains a low but detectable affinity for the barbed end. Taken together, the results show that CD2AP partially inhibits the capping activity of CP and that the CP·CD2AP complex has the ability to cap the barbed end but at a much slower rate. The ability of CD2AP to uncap actin filaments was also tested (Fig. 4C). 500 nm CD2AP"

Like all plasma lipoproteins, LDL takes the shape of a globular particle consisting of a non-polar lipid core surrounded by an amphiphilic coating of protein, phospholipid, and cholesterol (1Muller K. Laggner P. Glatter O. Kostner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Laggner P. Kostner G.M. Degovics G. Worcester D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). LDL is the principal plasma cholesterol carrier and serves as a source of cholesterol for most tissues of the body through receptormediated recognition of apoB-100. From the medical point of view, LDL may become involved in a variety of metabolic disorders, such as hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, or atherogenesis, which are often linked to a structurally determined dysfunction of apoB-100. Human apoB-100 is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 550 kDa, consisting of 4536 amino acid residues. It is a single chain protein that is associated with hydrophobic molecules in a noncovalent fashion to facilitate their transport and targeting in a hydrophilic environment. The apolipoprotein is synthesized in hepatocytes, where the assembly of the lipoprotein particle takes place, which is mediated by the first 884 amino acid residues of apoB-100 in the presence of a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (3Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoB-100 is a carrier of cell targeting signals that facilitate the uptake of lipoprotein particles by receptor-mediated endocytosis (4Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). A domain close to the COOH-terminal end, which is substantially enriched in basic amino acids (residues 3345-3381), was identified as the receptor binding domain (5Yang C.-Y. Chen S.-H.

A detailed analysis of the secondary structure by computational methods resulted in the so-called pentapartite model (8Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) proposing five consecutive domains with alternating α-helix and β-strand regions. According to this model the predicted domain organization for apoB-100 is NH2-βα1-β1-α2-β2-α3-COOH. The amphipathic nature of these secondary structural elements determines the extent of association with the lipid core. This information was gained by exploring the relative accessibility for trypsin digestion (9Yang C.Y. Kim T.W. Pao Q. Chan L. Knapp R.D. Gotto Jr., A.M. Pownall H.J. J. Protein Chem. 1989; 8: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain including residues 1-1000 (βα1) was found to be highly trypsin-releasable suggesting that it is not associated with the lipid core in LDL. In addition, this domain contains more than half of the total 25 cysteine residues of apoB-100, all of which are involved in disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues in the same domain. This is a strong indication for a very compact folding of this region, most likely in the form of an independent globular domain that was shown to be highly homologous to the structure of lipovitellin (10Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Kochl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C.

The remaining domains (β1-α2-β2-α3) are less characterized and were found to be more closely associated to the lipid core of LDL. Over time several strategies were followed to elucidate the structure and morphology of LDL and apoB-100 on LDL by different biophysical techniques (11Laggner P. Müller K. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 371-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Laggner P. Kostner G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Walsh M.T. Atkinson D.

The mapping of apoB-100 on the surface of LDL by triangulation techniques with monoclonal antibodies generated the generally accepted idea that the protein is a belt wrapped once around the LDL particle (15Chatterton J.E.

Other approaches were applied to investigate the morphology of apoB-100 after extraction from its native lipid environment. Several detergents were used to solubilize apoB-100, and the resulting protein-detergent complex was subjected to negative staining EM and cryo-EM in vitreous ice (21Zampighi G. Reynolds J.A. Watt R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Ikai A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Gantz D.L.

To a certain extent, these results differ depending on preparation procedure and imaging technique used. Curved shapes and horseshoe or thread-like morphologies were found. Flexible strings up to 1000 Å long, with width varying from 20 to 70 Å, were imaged. However, a common feature in all studies is that lipid-free apoB-100 adopts an elongated conformation. As outlined above, the most conclusive experimental results on the structure of apoB-100 are reported from EM imaging, but they lack three-dimensional information. To address this issue, we have applied small angle neutron scattering (SANS) combined with the contrast matching technique to elucidate three-dimensional characteristics of lipid-free apoB-100 and to assess its structural flexibility at the same time. We have restored a low resolution model of apoB-100 while eliminating contributions of the solubilizing detergent. Finally, based on our low resolution structure model in combination with a secondary structure prediction, a hypothetical arrangement of distinct modules of apoB-100 within LDL is proposed. Preparation of LDL from Human Plasma—Blood was taken from normolipidemic, single donors. To prevent clotting, oxidation, microbial degradation, and proteolytic cleavage, 1 mg/ml Na2EDTA, 0.05% gentamycin sulfate (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) were added. Whole blood was centrifuged at 4500 rpm, 10 min, 5 °C, and the supernatant was carefully separated from the pellet and stored in aliquots at -70 °C after addition of 10% (w/v) sucrose as a cryoprotectant. LDL (density range 1.02-1.063) was prepared by ultracentrifugation and dialyzed at 4 °C against standard buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mg/ml Na2EDTA, 0.05% gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). LDL samples were assessed for protein concentration by the BCA method (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce) Purity and homogeneity were determined by SDS-PAGE. Solubilization and Purification of ApoB-100—Delipidation of LDL was performed by modified procedures previously described by Watt and Reynolds (26Watt R.M. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and Melnik and Melnik (27Melnik B.C. Melnik S.F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, the non-ionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) at 55 mg/mg of LDL protein was added to LDL typically containing 8-10 mg of LDL protein in a total volume of 3 ml and stored under argon. After a minimum of 2 h of mild stirring in the dark at 4 °C, the solution was applied to a 1.5 × 50-cm column of Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma) equilibrated with an eluent buffer (0.5 mm Nonidet P-40 in standard buffer). Fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.66 ml/min while measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. All fractions from the first peak after the void volume (clear colorless solution) were pooled and brought to protein concentrations between 4.0 and 7.0 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with 100 kDa molecular mass cutoff. Excess detergent was slowly removed from concentrated samples by dialysis for 24 h against standard buffer containing a suspension of Amberlite XAD-2 hydrophobic porous beads (Sigma) and using a SpectraPor CE dialysis membrane with 300-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands). To make sure that delipidation was complete, the concentrations of total cholesterol and phospholipid were determined by use of enzymatic assay kits “Cholesterol C” and “Phospholipids B” (Wako, Neuss, Germany), respectively. The amounts of cholesterol and phospholipid found in the delipidated sample were negligible. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA method, and purity and homogeneity of solubilized apoB-100 were assessed by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of Nonidet P-40 was determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm. The absorption coefficient for Nonidet P-40 was calculated from linear regression of a standard dilution series in deionized water. The theoretical absorption from the protein was calculated from the amino acid composition (28Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar) and subtracted from absorption values of samples containing both protein and Nonidet P-40 to give accurate values for detergent concentration. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far-UV/CD spectra were obtained in a wavelength range from 190 to 250 nm with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) equipped with a personal computer. Each spectrum was recorded as an average of three scans taken with the following parameters: step resolution, 0.5 nm; scan speed, 50 nm/min; response, 1 s; and bandwidth, 1 nm. The spectra were base line-corrected by subtracting the signal of detergent in standard buffer. The results were expressed in terms of mean residue ellipticity [θ] (degree·cm2·dmol-1) defined as follows. [θ]=θobs10·c·l(Eq. 1) θobs is the measured ellipticity in degrees, c is the protein residue concentration in mol/liter, and l is the length of the light path in cm. The ellipticity data were analyzed for secondary structure by a non constrained least squares analysis using the CDSSTR algorithm based on reconstruction of experimental data (29Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 30Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). SANS Experiments—Neutron scattering data were obtained at beam lines D11 and D22 using the high flux reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). To determine the contrast match point of the detergent contrast variation experiments were performed on instrument D11. Scattering profiles were recorded of 28 mm Nonidet P-40 dissolved in buffer at several D2O/H2O ratios (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 100% D2O). This detergent concentration, which is about 10 times the critical micellar concentration, was chosen to be the same as in the apoB-100-Nonidet P-40 complex used for further SANS experiments. Sample-detector distances of 1.2, 3, and 12 m (collimations 5.5, 5.5, and 13.5 m), circular cells with a thickness of 2 mm, and a neutron wavelength of 6 Å(Δλ/λ of 10%) were used. The contrast match point is given by the D2O concentration at which the intensity of forward scattering approaches zero, I(0) = 0. I(0) values were determined by extrapolation of the scattering profiles to zero angle using the Guinier approximation (31Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar). The normalized intensities (I(0)/c)1/2 were plotted as a function of D2O content (data not shown). The intercept of this linear dependence on the abscissa indicates the contrast match point of the detergent. In case of Nonidet P-40, the scattering intensity was matched at 18% D2O. The apoB-100-Nonidet P-40 complex was measured at the match point concentration of 18% D2O/H2O on instrument D22 at a protein concentration of 6.4 mg/ml and a detergent concentration of 28 mm using a rectangular cell with a thickness of 2 mm positioned in a thermostatted sample rack at 8 °C. The typical acquisition time was 30 min. The exposure of the sample was repeated 12 times to verify sample stability. Sample-detector/collimation distances of 14.0/14.4 m and 2.8/2.8 m, a wavelength λ of 6 Å(Δλ/λ of 10%), and a rectangular beam aperture of 16 × 16 mm were used. To correct for background scattering the Nonidet P-40/buffer curve measured at 18% D2O/H2O was subtracted. Data reduction was based on standard ILL software using the programs DETEC, RNILS, SPOLLY, RGUIM, and RPLOT (32Ghosh R.E. A Computing Guide for Small Angle Scattering Experiments. Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France1989Google Scholar). The data acquired at both sample-detector distances were merged resulting in a total q-range of 0.004-0.32 Å-1 (q = 4πsinθ/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle) used for further calculations. Analysis of Reduced Scattering Data—Radius of gyration (RG) of apoB-100 was determined by the Guinier approximation from the low q-regions (q·RG ≤ 1.3) of the scattering profiles (31Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar) according to the following equation. ln(l(q))≅ln(l(0))-RG2·q23(Eq. 2) At small angles when plotted as log(I(q)) versus q2 the scattering profile should be linear although this relationship is rigorously valid only for q ≤ RG-1(33Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structural Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar) The pair-distance distribution function p(r), p(r)=12·π2∫0∞r·q·l(q)·sin(r·q)·dq(Eq. 3) was obtained by indirect Fourier transformation of the scattered intensities I(q) using the program GNOM (34Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The p(r) corresponds to the distribution of distances r between any two volume elements within one particle weighted by the product of their scattering length density relative to that of the solvent. This offers an alternative calculation of RG that is based on the full scattering curve and gives the maximum dimension of the macromolecule Dmax, as the distance where the p(r) function approaches zero (35Glatter O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1977; 10: 415-421Crossref Google Scholar). Ab Initio Modeling—The low resolution shape of apoB-100 was restored from experimental data using the program DAM-MIN (36Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The scattering curve up to qmax = 0.25 Å-1 was used for fitting corresponding to a resolution of ∼25Å (2π/qmax). DAMMIN calculates the scattering intensities from a multiphase model of a particle constructed of a finite number of dummy beads. The beads are characterized by a configuration vector (X) assigning them to a phase or to the solvent. The program starts searching for a model in a volume filled by hexagonally packed uniform beads. The dimensions were selected according to the resolution of the scattering profile while the overall dimension of the initial search object is taking into account. DAMMIN searches for the best model configuration minimizing the discrepancy function (f(X) = χ2 + α·P(X)) using the simulated annealing method (37Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt Jr., C.D. Vecci M.P. Science. 1983; 220: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31663) Google Scholar), where χ is the discrepancy between the calculated and experimental curve, and α·P(X) is a looseness penalty with positive weight α > 0. The aim of this method is to randomly modify the coordinates of the beads while always approaching the configurations that decrease the energy f(X). 3For further details the reader is referred to the web site www.embl-hamburg.de/ExternalInfo/Research/Sax/dammin.html showing an animation of this fitting approach. The bead radius used for the ab initio modeling of solubilized apoB-100 was set to 14 Å. This value was chosen due to experimental results (Dmax = 600 Å, resolution ∼25 Å) and certain constraints within the program DAMMIN. Different independent models with similar goodness of fit were obtained. Ten of these models were used for automated averaging by the program DAMAVER (38Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). This program computes the values for the normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) between each pair in the set. The average NSD value for each model was calculated with respect to the rest of the set and the model with the lowest NSD was selected as reference model. All other models were superimposed onto the reference model using the program SUPCOMB (39Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Finally, the entire assembly of beads was remapped onto a densely packed grid of beads where each grid point was characterized by its occupancy factor. The portion of points with higher non-zero occupancy was selected to yield the volume equal to the average excluded volume of the models. Secondary Structure Prediction—The complete amino acid sequence of apoB-100 was subjected to the automated secondary structure prediction service SSpro 2.0 using bidirectional recurrent neural networks (40Pollastri G. Przybylski D. Rost B. Baldi P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 47: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The results of this prediction were visualized using POLYVIEW (41Porollo A.A. Adamczak R. Meller J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2460-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—To assess the effects of delipidation on protein folding, circular dichroism spectra of both solubilized apoB-100 and native LDL were recorded and evaluated. Secondary structure contents were calculated from the normalized spectra (Fig. 1) and expressed as percent secondary structure as shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Secondary structure calculated from circular dichroic spectra by the CDSSTR methodSampleα-Helixβ-StrandTurnsCoilNRMSDaThe NRMSD value indicates the root mean square deviation of fits to measured spectra.LDL37%17%20%25%0.010ApoB-10040%21%19%16%0.007PredictedbResults are from the secondary structure prediction.

This algorithm is not capable of discerning turns and coil structures, thus a sum of both is given. Open table in a new tab These results are in agreement with a secondary structure prediction, and the values obtained for native LDL are consistent with data reported previously (42Walsh M.T. Atkinson D. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 316-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The content of α-helix and β-strands of detergent-solubilized apoB-100 appears slightly higher than that of native LDL, while the contents of turns and coil structures seem to be slightly lower. However, within the experimental error margin, the overall secondary structure of Nonidet P-40 solubilized apoB-100 is well conserved. Similar results were reported by Watt and Reynolds (26Watt R.M. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) for apoB-100 solubilized by n-dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether, a detergent that is closely related to Nonidet P-40, although due to the choice of a different evaluation method, the absolute values in the results vary. SANS Data—The final scattering curve was obtained by merging the scattering profiles of apoB-100 solubilized in Nonidet P-40 collected at two sample-detector distances (Fig. 2A). The RG value derived from the Guinier approximation was 150 ± 4 Å (Fig. 2A, inset). The linearity of the fit suggests that the data accurately reflect the non-aggregated state of the protein in solution. To verify this, the molecular weight of the protein was calculated. In a two-component system, the molecular weight of a particle in solution is proportional to I(0) according to the following equations (43Jacrot B. Zaccai G. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2413-2426Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 44Zaccai G. Jacrot B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1983; 12: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), l(0)=c·NAM∑i(bi-ρ0·vi)2(Eq. 4) whereas ∑i(bi-ρ0·vi)=MNA(B-ρ0·v¯).(Eq. 5) M is the molecular mass, c stands for the protein concentration, bi is the scattering length contained in a small volume, ν, ρ0 is the scattering length density of the solvent, B is the scattering length per unit mass, and v̄ represents the partial specific volume of the macromolecule. The amount of exchangeable protons was assumed to be 80% resulting in a B value of 2.55·10-14 cm. The scattered intensity at zero angle I(0) was obtained by extrapolation of the Guinier plot to q2 → 0. I(0) was found to be 0.61 cm-1. The molecular mass calculated from the zero angle intensity was 547,000 Da, somewhat higher than 512,816 Da as calculated from the amino acid sequence. The discrepancy between these values can be explained by the contribution of glycosylated residues accounting for up to 7% of the molecular mass and a certain error in the protein concentration. The protein concentration is generally considered critical for the calculation of molecular weight by scattering methods. For our samples c was determined by a colorimetric assay using bovine serum albumin as a reference standard, as a direct measurement was not feasible due to interference from the detergent near the absorption maximum of 280 nm. Assuming an elongated particle shape, the mean radius of gyration of the cross-section Rxs and the mean cross-sectional intensity at zero angle [I(q)q]q→0 are obtained from the following equation. lnlq·q≅lnlq·q→0-Rxs2·q22(Eq. 6) Applying this formalism to our results, two linear regions were identified in separate q ranges, q = 0.0075-0.016 Å-1 and q2 = 0.017-0.04 Å-1 (Fig. 2B). The cross-sectional radii of gyration Rxs1 = 80 ± 17 Å and Rxs2 = 33 ± 8 Å were obtained from the slopes of the linear regressions. In general, elongated and multimodular proteins with intrinsic flexibility exhibit a cross-sectional plot with two regions, a steeper innermost one and a flatter outermost one (45Pilz I. Kratky O. Licht A. Sela M. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This applies particularly for factor H (46Aslam M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1117-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), immunoglobulins IgA1 (47Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and IgA2 (48Furtado P.B. Whitty P.W. Robertson A. Eaton J.T. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 921-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For apo-B100 we can assume that the innermost steeper part of the cross-sectional plot represents the isotropic cross-section of the overall dimension whereas the outer flatter part reflects the anisotropic/modular organization of the protein (49Pilz I. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 239-293Google Scholar). The values RG, Rxs1, and Rxs2 were used to analyze the axial dimension of apoB-100. The length of an elongated elliptical cylinder can be calculated according to Glatter (50Glatter O. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 119-196Google Scholar), L=12·(RG2-Rxs2)(Eq. 7) yielding an estimated particle length of L = 440-507 Å for apo-B100. For an ideal elliptical cylinder this particle length L should be reflected in the maximum dimension Dmax from the p(r) function (Fig. 2C). The p(r) shows a tailing with a Dmax of 600 Å typical for an elongated particle, however, significantly longer as calculated from the Guinier radii of gyration. Accordingly, the calculation of RG from the p(r) function gives a value of 165 ± 10 Å, also higher as the value obtained from the Guinier approximation RG = 150 ± 4 Å. However, taking into consideration difficulties associated with the determination of such large RG values, they can be considered to be in good agreeme"

Consistent with this function, the recognition of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells, triggers a set of potent anti-inflammatory responses manifest on multiple levels. The immediate-early inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine gene transcription in the phagocyte is a proximate consequence of recognition of the apoptotic corpse, independent of subsequent engulfment and soluble factor involvement.

Innate apoptotic immunity provides an intrinsic anti-inflammatory circuit that attenuates proinflammatory responses dynamically and may act systemically as a powerful physiological regulator of immunity. The process of physiological cell death assures the elimination of functionally inappropriate cells in a manner that does not elicit inflammation (1.Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J.

For example, whereas stimulation of macrophages via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling complex (11.Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) upon engagement with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers significant cytokine secretion, the additional ingestion of apoptotic cells attenuates this response potently (9.Fadok V.A.

Nature. 1997; 390: 350-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The ability of apoptotic cells to be cleared in a noninflammatory manner by professional phagocytes, such as macrophages, is a consequence of their specific expression of determinants for recognition and modulation of proinflammatory responses. The acquisition of these apoptotic determinants represents a gain of function and is common to all physiological cell deaths, without regard to suicidal stimulus (10.Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells that die necrotically also are recognized by professional phagocytes; in contrast, however, necrotic corpses do not down-regulate inflammatory responses. Discrimination between apoptotic and necrotic corpses occurs on the level of binding and not engulfment and involves distinct and noncompeting mechanisms of recognition (10.Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The modulatory activity of the apoptotic corpse is manifest as an immediate-early inhibition of macrophage proinflammatory cytokine gene transcription and is exerted directly upon binding to the macrophage, independent of subsequent engulfment and soluble factor involvement (13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells target the proinflammatory transcriptional machinery of macrophages, with which they interact through a novel regulatory pathway. Inhibition appears to involve sequestration of critical transcriptional co-activator molecules without effect on proximal signaling events induced by inflammatory receptors, including innate immune receptors of the TLR family (13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The ubiquity of apoptotic cells in all tissues throughout organismal life prompted us to ask whether this innate discrimination of apoptotic cells is limited to professional phagocytes. Certainly, normal homeostatic cell turnover in vivo, and especially in solid tissues and intact cellular strata, results in apoptotic cells that are in immediate contact with their neighbors independent of (and before the arrival of) mobile phagocytes (6.Wood W.

We asked whether nonprofessional phagocytes discriminate and respond specifically to apoptotic cells in an anti-inflammatory manner. Here we describe studies that reveal that they do. Remarkably, this profound innate immune function is manifest fully and ubiquitously among professional and nonprofessional phagocytes and even nonphagocytic cell types.

Briefly, the embryo fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose (Mediatech) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, v/v; HyClone Laboratories), 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, replating at 3 × 105/60-mm diameter dish every 3 days. Immortalized cell lines were established from cells that grew from cultures that had become senescent. Physiological cell death (apoptosis) was induced by treatment of target cells with the macromolecular synthesis inhibitors actinomycin D (200 ng/ml, 12 h) or cycloheximide (1 μg/ml, 12 h) (19.Chang S.H. Cvetanovic M. Harvey K.J. Komoriya A. Packard B.Z. Ucker D.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were killed pathologically (necrotic death) by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 55 °C for 20 min (until trypan blue uptake indicated compromise of membrane integrity) (10.Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In all cases, target cells (viable, apoptotic, and necrotic) were washed twice and resuspended in the medium of the responder cells to be tested. In some experiments, apoptotic and viable target cells were fixed by incubation with formaldehyde (125 mm in PBS, 25 °C, 20 min; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) or were cycled through three rounds of freezing and thawing. Target preparations then were washed twice and resuspended in the medium of the responder cells to be tested. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from HeLa cells following the approach of Baumann et al. (20.Baumann N.A. Vidugiriene J. Machamer C.E. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7378-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Monolayers of cells, either untreated or induced to die with actinomycin D (and still adherent), were stimulated to vesiculate by incubation at 37 °C in Vesiculation Buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm formaldehyde). Supernatants were collected after ∼2.5 h (when abundant small membrane vesicles were apparent in the culture fluid). Nonadherent cells were removed (1,000 × g for 10 min), and vesicles were pelleted from the cleared supernatant by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). Cytofluorimetric analysis indicated that vesicles were ∼0.8 μm in diameter and free of contaminating intact cells. Phagocytosis Assay and Other Cytofluorimetric Analyses—Phagocytosis was assessed as previously described for macrophages (13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Target cells were labeled green with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA; 0.2 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and were then induced to undergo apoptotic cell death, killed pathologically by heat treatment, or left untreated. Phagocytes (or cells being tested for phagocytic activity) were labeled red with 5-(and 6)-(((4-chloromethyl)benzoyl)-amino) tetramethyl rhodamine (CMTMR; 10 μm; Molecular Probes). In all cases, cells were labeled on the day preceding the experiment and cultured in serum-containing medium overnight to eliminate unbound label. Labeled phagocytes were co-cultured with the apoptotic, necrotic, or viable target cells for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested with PBS supplemented with 0.4 mm Na2EDTA and analyzed cytofluorimetrically on a FACSCaliber instrument (BD Biosciences). Cytofluorimetric data were processed with WinMDI software (Joe Trotter, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Cells that were both CMTMR-positive (Exλ = 488 nm, Emλ = 610 ± 15 nm) and CFDA-positive (Exλ = 488 nm; Emλ = 530 ± 15 nm) and that had scatter properties of the phagocyte population represented phagocytes that had engulfed targets. Engulfment is calculated as the fraction of double-positive phagocytes (all CMTMR-positive cells that also are CFDA-positive). Most targets that are bound but not engulfed are disrupted and do not remain adherent during the analysis, although they could be enumerated under static microscopic examination (10.Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The accessibility of phosphatidylserine was revealed by the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Pharmingen; San Diego, CA; Exλ = 488 nm, Emλ = 525 nm). Cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 5 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V for 15 min in the dark at 25 °C. After incubation, 400 μl of binding buffer was added per sample, and cells were analyzed cytofluorimetrically. Propidium iodide (PI) was employed to assess plasma membrane integrity. PI was added to cells at 1 μg/ml immediately before cytofluorimetric analysis (Exλ = 488 nm, Emλ = 610 nm). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Apoptotic modulation of specific transcription (e.g. dependent on nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) or the IL-8 promoter) was assessed in various cell types following transfection of relevant transcriptional reporter constructs, using a dual luciferase strategy, as described previously (13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The efficiencies of transfection were measured in parallel with farnesylated green fluorescent protein as a transfection marker (21.Harvey K.J. Lukovic D. Ucker D.S. Cytometry. 2001; 43: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with pNF-κB-Luc, a plasmid containing the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene, the expression of which is driven by a basal transcriptional promoter linked to four copies of the κB motif (Clontech), together with pRL-SV40, a Renilla (sea pansy; R. reniformis) luciferase control vector, the constant expression of which is dependent on the SV40 early enhancer/promoter region (Promega, Madison, WI). RAW 264.7 macrophages (5.0 × 106 cells/60-mm diameter dish) and HeLa, 293T, and Chinese hamster ovary cells, at ∼75% confluence, were transfected using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 3T3 cells were transfected using the MEF1 Nucleofector Kit (AMAXA Biosystems; Gaithersburg, MD), with MEF Nucleofector Solution 1 and a machine setting of A-23. Jurkat, Ramos RA-1, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were transfected using GenePORTER2 Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). The next day, the cells were replated in 24-well plates (1.0 × 105 cells/well) and incubated without or with the indicated target cells (at a target cell/macrophage ratio of 10:1) and/or a proinflammatory stimulus in a final volume of 2 ml. The proinflammatory stimuli used included LPS (100 ng/ml; Escherichia coli O111:B4; Sigma), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα; 10 ng/ml; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN), IL-1β (5 ng/ml; R&D Systems), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 1.3 ng/ml; EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) alone or with ionomycin (200 ng/ml; Molecular Probes). Cell extracts were prepared after further incubation as indicated, and luciferase activities were measured by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in an FB12 luminometer (Zylux; Oak Ridge, TN). Each condition was repeated in triplicate wells, and the luciferase activities in cells from each well were determined independently. Within any experiment, Renilla luciferase activities among samples varied less than 6%. The firefly luciferase activity in each sample was normalized with respect to the internal Renilla luciferase activity, and the relative level of normalized firefly luciferase activity compared with the activity in an untreated population was taken as a measure of specific (e.g. NF-κB-dependent) transcriptional activity. Stably transfected reporter cells were generated by transfection of 293T cells with another NF-κB-Luc reporter construct, 4×NF-κB(HIV)tkluc (22.Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Koenderman L. van der Saag P.T. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and an unlinked vector conferring hygromycin resistance. Cells resistant to hygromycin (50 μg/ml) were selected, cloned at limiting dilution, and tested for NF-κB-dependent responsiveness. Extracts were prepared and analyzed as above, except that the luciferase assay system (Promega) was used. Data with one clone, B2, are described here. Quantification of Cytokine Release—Cytokine production was assessed following incubation of responder cells with target cells. Where indicated, proinflammatory stimuli were added simultaneously with the addition of targets. Culture supernatants were withdrawn from wells at the indicated times and frozen at –20 °C until analysis. Secreted cytokines were quantified by ELISA, using matched pair cytokine-specific capture and biotinylated reporter antibodies for murine IL-6 (eBiosciences; San Diego, CA) or human IL-8 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). The reporter reactions were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (R&D Systems) and measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm (corrected for turbidity at 550 nm; Microplate Autoreader model EL311; Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Cellular Extract Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—Activation of Akt and inhibition of ERK1/2 were assessed in 3T3 cells cultured overnight in serum-free medium and left unstimulated or stimulated for 15 min with a 5-fold excess of apoptotic DO11.10 cells (the apoptotic cells, which had been cultured under serum-free conditions, were centrifuged briefly onto the adherent 3T3 cells to initiate the interaction) and/or subsequent stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF; 10 nm; Calbiochem). After washing, cell extracts were prepared from the adherent 3T3 cells. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μm orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at –70 °C. Protein samples (20 μg each, determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay; Pierce) were boiled in 5× sample buffer, run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in 150 mm PBS, 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, before probing with a phospho-Akt(Thr308)-specific rabbit anti-serum (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or an affinity-purified phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185)-specific polyclonal rabbit IgG (Promega, Madison, WI). Following incubation with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, immunoreactive bands were visualized by the luminol reaction (ECLplus; Amersham Biosciences). Equivalent loading of protein samples was monitored by Ponceau S staining (0.25% (w/v) (Sigma) in 0.1% acetic acid; 5 min) of blotted proteins. Specific Recognition and Response to Apoptotic Cells Is Not Limited to Macrophages—The anti-inflammatory response triggered in macrophages by their specific recognition of apoptotic cells is exerted on the level of cytokine gene transcription (13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although key transcriptional activators of cytokine gene expression, such as NF-κB (23.Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 24.Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are not the molecular targets of apoptotic modulation, modulation is evident on the level of NF-κB-dependent transcription, and an NF-κB-dependent transcriptional reporter serves as a sensitive, reliable, and convenient readout for the modulatory effect exerted by apoptotic targets (13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The experiment in Fig. 1A exemplifies this analysis. We transiently transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages with pNF-κB-Luc, a plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene, the expression of which is driven by a basal transcriptional promoter linked to four copies of the κB motif. Macrophages were co-transfected with a constitutive (NF-κB-independent) Renilla luciferase control vector, which served as an internal normalization control for transfection efficiency and cell viability. Following transfection, macrophages were incubated with different target cell populations and/or bacterial LPS, a potent proinflammatory agonist. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities then were measured. As indicated by these luciferase reporters, LPS-activated NF-κB-dependent transcription (but not global transcription) in macrophages is inhibited specifically following their interaction with apoptotic cells; necrotic and viable cells do not exert this effect (13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This response is elicited by apoptotic cells generally, regardless of species, cell type, or suicidal stimulus. Here, murine DO11.10 T cells and human HeLa epithelial carcinoma cells, triggered to die with different suicidal stimuli (inhibitors of translation and transcription, respectively), were equally effective at triggering modulation in these murine macrophages. As a first test of the ability of nonprofessional phagocytes to recognize and respond to apoptotic cells, we examined the responsiveness of HeLa cells, the same cells used as targets in Fig. 1A, utilizing the identical transcriptional reporter strategy. The transfected HeLa cells were incubated with apoptotic, necrotic, or viable populations of target cells and/or the inflammatory cytokine TNFα as a stimulus of an NF-κB-dependent transcriptional response. Significantly, HeLa cells do not die in response to TNFα unless the NF-κB-dependent response is attenuated (e.g. by an inhibitor of macromolecular synthesis) (25.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 26.Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 27.Harvey K.J. Lukovic D. Ucker D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Just as with LPS-stimulated macrophage responsiveness, robust TNFα-activated NF-κB-dependent transcription in HeLa cells was inhibited specifically and profoundly following the interaction of those cells with apoptotic, but not necrotic or viable, targets (Fig. 1B). It is notable that the ranges of absolute values of NF-κB-dependent luciferase activities were quite different in HeLa cells and macrophages at comparably early times (as much as 300-fold; see Fig. 1), reflecting differences in the efficiencies of transfection and transgene expression. Still, expressed relative to basal luciferase levels, these data present a consistent pattern of modulation and reveal an identical response to apoptotic targets in different responder cell populations. Again, this selective response to apoptotic cells occurred without species restriction. Most dramatically, HeLa cells even were able to recognize and respond specifically to homotypic apoptotic cells. The Characteristic Repertoire of Anti-inflammatory Responses Elicited Specifically upon Apoptotic Cell Recognition Is Evident in Murine Fibroblasts—To begin a more comprehensive exploration of the recognition and response to apoptotic targets by nonprofessional phagocytes, we examined nontransformed murine fibroblasts. Immortalized murine embryo fibroblast cells, derived by the 3T3 protocol of Todaro and Green (18.Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar), were highly phagocytic for dead cells (Fig. 2A; for consistency, we used DO11.10 cells as targets in this and the following experiments). Apoptotic and necrotic cell targets were engulfed rapidly and to equal extents by 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas viable cells were not ingested (Fig. 2A; we take the low level of engulfment of “viable” cells to reflect the small fraction of dead and dying apoptotic cells present in any cell culture). These 3T3 fibroblasts secrete the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in response to a variety of proinflammatory stimuli, including IL-1β, TNFα, and, to a lesser degree, bacterial LPS (Fig. 2B and data not shown) (28.Kurt-Jones E.A. Sandor F. Ortiz Y. Bowen G.N. Counter S.L. Wang T.C. Finberg R.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 2004; 10: 419-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We characterized the release of IL-6 from fibroblasts following their interaction with target cells as one indication of inflammatory responsiveness; IL-6 secretion in macrophages reflects inflammatory responsiveness generally (10.Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13.Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). IL-1β-stimulated IL-6 secretion was potently attenuated when fibroblasts interacted with apoptotic targets, but not with necrotic or viable targets (Fig. 2B). Apoptotic target cell contact was necessary for this response, since supernatants from apoptotic cell cultures could not substitute for the target cells themselves to modulate IL-6 secretion (data not shown). The ability of apoptotic cells to block IL-6 secretion by IL-1β-stimulated fibroblasts parallels their ability to abrogate the secretion of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines by LPS-stimulated macrophages (10.Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (163"
https://openalex.org/W1981175925,"The tumor suppressor KLF6 is a member of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human carcinomas. Uncovering the transcriptional targets relevant for its tumorigenic properties, including cellular proliferation and invasion, will be essential to understanding possible mechanisms by which KLF6 and its antagonistic splice form, KLF6-SV1, regulate this development. To begin defining possible metastatic-related pathways, we analysed the effect of KLF6 dysregulation on a recognized suppressor of cellular invasion, E-cadherin. Targeted KLF6 reduction in an ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV-3, resulted in a 50% reduction of E-cadherin expression (P<0.01) and conversely, KLF6-SV1 silencing upregulated E-cadherin approximately fivefold (P<0.0001). These changes resulted from KLF6 directly transactivating the E-cadherin promoter as demonstrated by luciferase promoter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). KLF6-mediated changes in E-cadherin levels were accompanied by downstream changes in both the subcellular localization of β-catenin and c-myc expression levels. Moreover, and consistent with these experimental findings, patient-derived epithelial ovarian tumors with low KLF6 and high KLF6-SV1 expression ratios had significantly decreased E-cadherin expression (P<0.0001). These combined findings highlight the E-cadherin pathway as a novel and functionally important mediator by which changes in KLF6 and KLF6-SV1 can directly alter ovarian tumor invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2021568742,"The functional and structural chromatin roles of H2A.Z are still controversial. This work represents a further attempt to resolve the current functional and structural dichotomy by characterizing chromatin structures containing native H2A.Z. We have analyzed the role of this variant in mediating the stability of the histone octamer in solution using gel-filtration chromatography at different pH. It was found that decreasing the pH from neutral to acidic conditions destabilized the histone complex. Furthermore, it was shown that the H2A.Z-H2B dimer had a reduced stability. Sedimentation velocity analysis of nucleosome core particles (NCPs) reconstituted from native H2A.Z-containing octamers indicated that these particles exhibit a very similar behavior to that of native NCPs consisting of canonical H2A. Sucrose gradient fractionation of native NCPs under different ionic strengths indicated that H2A.Z had a subtle tendency to fractionate with more stabilized populations. An extensive analysis of the salt-dependent dissociation of histones from hydroxyapatite-adsorbed chromatin revealed that, whereas H2A.Z co-elutes with H3–H4, hyperacetylation of histones (by treatment of chicken MSB cells with sodium butyrate) resulted in a significant fraction of this variant eluting with the canonical H2A. These studies also showed that the late elution of this variant (correlated to enhanced binding stability) was independent of the chromatin size and of the presence or absence of linker histones.

These studies also showed that the late elution of this variant (correlated to enhanced binding stability) was independent of the chromatin size and of the presence or absence of linker histones. The histone H2A family possesses the largest number of variants of all the core histones. Most of the structural variability resides in the N- and C-terminal unstructured domains (tails) of the H2A molecule, and it confers a defined chromatin function to the members of this highly heterogeneous family (1.Ausió J. Abbott D.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5945-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One such member that has received a lot of attention in recent years is H2A.Z. Histone H2A.Z is a replication-independent histone replacement variant that is synthesized from an intron-containing, polyadenylated mRNA transcript (2.Hatch C.L. Bonner W.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast to other histone variants, H2A.Z has been shown to be indispensable for viability in protozoan (3.Liu X. Li B. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and metazoan organisms (4.van Daal A. Elgin S.C. Mol. Biol.

In particular, the C-terminal region has been shown to be critical for survival in Drosophila (6.Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although many attempts have been made to connect the structural variability of the molecule to its functional specialization, the one or more mechanisms involved still remain elusive. Indeed, both the functional and structural roles of H2A.Z have been and still are quite controversial (7.Dryhurst D. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At the functional level, results obtained in yeast show that H2A.Z can be implicated in transcriptional activation (8.Zhang H. Roberts D.N. Cairns B.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and in silencing at the HMR locus (9.Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been shown to mark the 5′-ends of active and inactive genes within euchromatin (10.Raisner R.M.

Madhani H.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, H2A.Z is localized in transcribed regions of euchromatin and in non-transcribed heterochromatin domains (12.Leach T.J. Mazzeo M. Chotkowski H.L. Madigan J.P. Wotring M.G. Glaser R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23267-23272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In mammals, H2A.Z has been described to be prevalent at pericentric heterochromatin (13.Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J.

To cite an example of the very recent functional (15.Guillemette B. Bataille A.R. Gevry N. Adam M. Blanchette M. Robert F. Gaudreau L. PloS Biol. 2005; 3: e384Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) debate, using cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis, H2A.Z has been shown to globally localize to the promoters of inactive genes in yeast. However, by using native, non-cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation in different chicken cell lines, it has been shown that H2A.Z is present within active genes (16.Bruce K. Myers F.A. Mantouvalou E. Lefevre P. Greaves I. Bonifer C. Tremethick D.J. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5633-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These contrasting putative roles for H2A.Z have been mirrored to some extent by earlier structural studies of reconstituted NCP consisting of this histone variant that independently found it to have stabilizing and destabilizing roles. When the crystal structure of an H2A.Z-containing NCP was first published (17.Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), it was pointed out that even though its overall structure was similar to that of the NCP consisting of canonical core histones (18.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6720) Google Scholar), “distinct localized changes result in the subtle destabilization of the interaction between the (H2A.Z-H2B) dimer and the (H3–H4) (2.Hatch C.L.

A subsequent study in solution, using nucleosomes reconstituted with recombinant H2A.Z, provided initial experimental support to this notion (19.Abbott D.W. Ivanova V.S. Wang X. Bonner W.M. Ausió J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), published by the same laboratory that produced the crystallographic data, indicated that H2A.Z produces a subtle but noticeable stabilization of the histone octamer within the NCP. To shed some additional light onto the current structural controversy, we decided to purify native H2A.Z from chicken erythrocytes to reconstitute several of the integral components (histone octamer and H2A.Z-H2B dimers) of the NCP and the NCPs themselves. Although most of the results reported here support the current data on the stabilizing role of H2A.Z within the NCP, preliminary HAP data using highly acetylated chromatin suggests that this effect can be abolished by histone acetylation. Cell Culture and Tissues—Chicken MSB Marek virus-transformed cells (21.Akiyama Y. Kato S. Biken J. 1974; 17: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. Vaughn Jackson. Cells were grown and butyrate-treated as described elsewhere (22.Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Chicken blood and chicken liver were processed as described previously (23.Abbott D.W. Chadwick B.P. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24.Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Native H2A.Z Purification—Native H2A.Z was purified from chicken erythrocyte histones by several rounds of high-performance liquid chromatography, which combined preparative 1 × 25 cm (300 Å and 5 μm) C4 and analytical 0.46 × 25 cm (300 Å and 5 μm) C18 columns from Vydac. Elution was with a gradient from buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to buffer B (100% acetonitrile) (25.Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods (San Diego). 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chromatin Preparation—Different chromatin fractions from the different cell sources were obtained by micrococcal nuclease digestion according to protocols previously described (23.Abbott D.W. Chadwick B.P. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24.Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclei from different tissues were digested with micrococcal nuclease and centrifuged to yield an SI supernatant (containing 10–20% of chromatin) and a P1 pellet. The nuclear pellet thus obtained was resuspended and lysed in 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) to produce, after centrifugation, an SE supernatant and a PE pellet (24.Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Additionally, a chromatin fractionation procedure modified from a method described earlier by Olins and Olins was also used (23.Abbott D.W. Chadwick B.P. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26.Olins A.L. Carlson R.D. Wright E.B. Olins D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 3271-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Accordingly, nuclei prepared as above were extensively digested with micrococcal nuclease to produce, after centrifugation, an SI (containing >30% of total chromatin) and P1 pellet. After extensive dialysis of the SI supernatant against 0.1 m KCl in Tris buffer (to precipitate H1/5-containing chromatin complexes), the cloudy suspension was subsequently centrifuged to produce an S2 supernatant and a P2 pellet. Supernatant S2 consisted mainly of linker histone-depleted nucleosome core particles (of ∼146-bp DNA) and P2 contained linker-histone-containing chromatosomes (of ∼168-bp DNA) in addition to some higher nucleosome oligomers that become negligible as the time of the initial micrococcal nuclease digestion increases (23.Abbott D.W. Chadwick B.P. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Chicken tissues (blood and liver) were used as a source of native chromatin. Chromatin consisting of hyperacetylated histones was obtained from chicken MSB Marek virus-transformed cells as described elsewhere (22.Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes and Histone Octamers—NCPs were obtained from chicken erythrocytes and prepared as described elsewhere (24.Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Histone octamers were usually obtained from NCPs (and occasionally from linker histone-stripped chromatin) adsorbed onto HAP and eluted with 2.5 m NaCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (22.Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes and histone octamers consisting of native H2A.Z were obtained by reconstitution using high-performance liquid chromatography-purified native chicken H2A.Z and the corresponding complement of chicken core histones (H2B and H3–H4) according to a previous study (25.Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods (San Diego). 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In some instances, the reconstituted histone octamers were purified by gel filtration on a 120-× 1.5-cm Sephacryl S-300 HR column eluted with 2 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer (see below) prior to their use in NCP reconstitution. AUT/SDS-Native PAGE and Agarose Electrophoresis—Electrophoretic analyses of histones (AUT- and SDS-PAGE) and of DNA (4.5% native PAGE and 1% agarose gels) were prepared and run as described elsewhere (19.Abbott D.W. Ivanova V.S. Wang X. Bonner W.M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41945-41949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27.Rabbani A. Iskandar M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18401-18406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out as described in a previous study (23.Abbott D.W. Chadwick B.P. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An H2A.Z antibody elicited against the acetylated N-terminal region of the molecule was a kind gift of Dr. Colyn Crane-Robinson and was used under the conditions outlined before (16.Bruce K. Myers F.A. Mantouvalou E. Lefevre P. Greaves I. Bonifer C. Tremethick D.J. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5633-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Analysis of the pH-dependent Stability of the Histone Octamer—Nucleosome octamers (∼2 mg/ml or higher) were dialyzed against 2 m NaCl at different pH at 4 °C. After dialysis, they were fractionated by gel filtration on a 120-× 1.5-cm Sephacryl S-300 HR column and diluted with the corresponding 2 m NaCl buffer at 4–5 ml/h at 4 °C. The buffers for the different pHs (5.5, 6.0, and 7.5) used were prepared using sodium phosphate and or Tris-HCl (28.Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—Jasco J-720 and Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeters were used for CD. The latter was equipped with a circulating water bath and a temperature controller. For the melting profiles, spectra were recorded at 222 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm and response time of 1 s. The temperature was increased at a rate of 1 °C per minute. The buffer used for the melting studies was 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) in different NaCl concentrations (29.Karantza V. Freire E. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13114-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Otherwise, histone spectra were recorded at 20 °C in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer as described previously (30.Li A. Maffey A.H. Abbott W.D. Conde e Silva N. Prunell A. Siino J. Churikov D. Zalensky A.O. Ausio J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2529-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An extinction coefficient of A230 = 3.1 cm2 mg–1 was used for histone H2A (31.Glover C.V. Gorovsky M.A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5705-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and H2A.Z. Sedimentation Analysis—Sedimentation velocity analysis of NCPs at different ionic strengths was carried out in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (30.Li A. Maffey A.H. Abbott W.D. Conde e Silva N. Prunell A. Siino J. Churikov D. Zalensky A.O. Ausio J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2529-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sedimentation analysis of NCPs at different salt concentrations using sucrose gradients was carried out as described previously (23.Abbott D.W. Chadwick B.P. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Scanning Densitometry Analysis Methodology—Scanning densitometry was used to quantify the relative distribution of H2A.Z throughout each of the sucrose gradient-fractionated mononucleosome analyses. The ChemiImager 4000 scanner was used with the AlphaEase™ Version 3.3d software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Density measurements were made in triplicate of H2A.Z, H2A, and the background within each lane. The density scale was adjusted such that black was assigned a value of 255 and white, 0. The background readings were subtracted from the values for H2A.Z and H2A, and H2A.Z values were normalized to H2A within each respective lane. Normalized H2A.Z/H2A values were plotted using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) with error bars indicating the standard mean ± S.E. Hydroxyapatite Chromatography of Chromatin and Histones—Hydroxyapatite chromatography of chromatin was carried out as described elsewhere (32.Abbott D.W. Laszczak M. Lewis J.D. Su H. Moore S.C. Hills M. Dimitrov S. Ausio J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hydroxyapatite fractionation of H2A and H2A.Z, and H2A-H2B and H2A.Z-H2B dimers was carried out under the same conditions as the chromatin fractions, except as indicated in the figure legends. The H2A and H2B histones used in these experiments were obtained from chicken erythrocytes, and H2A.Z was obtained from bacterial expression. Histone H2A-H2B and H2A.Z-H2B dimers were reconstituted and purified by heparin fast-protein liquid chromatography as described previously (33.Gloss L.M. Placek B.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14951-14959Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) prior to their HAP fractionation. The Histone H2A.Z-containing Octamer Is Less Stable at Low pH—The heterotypic histone core of the NCP consists of an octamer with a tri-partite organization in which a histone H3–H4 tetramer is flanked by two histone H2A-H2B dimers. In solution and at physiological ionic strength and above, the octamer exists in a multiple equilibrium that involves the H2A-H2B dimers, the (H3–H4)2 tetramers, the (H3–H4)2-(H2A-H2B) hexamer, and the octamers themselves (28.Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA it is possible to shift the equilibrium toward a stable octamer by increasing the ionic strength of the medium to 2 m NaCl or higher (28.Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The stability of the histone core octamer in 2 m NaCl at different pH can provide useful information on the interactions between the H2A-H2B dimer and (H3–H4)2 tetramer components (28.Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Following a slightly modified version of the method described in a previous study (28.Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) we used gel-filtration chromatography to characterize the stability of the histone octamer at different pH (Fig. 1). Our results with the histone octamer consisting of canonical histone variants (major component of the native octamers used in this experiment) exhibited a very similar behavior to that described before (see Fig. 7a in Ref. 28.Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, under physiological pH (pH 7.5), H2A.Z was present in the fractions corresponding to stable octamers, whereas, upon a decrease in pH, its distribution was observed within dissociated fractions. At pH 5.5 most of the H2A.Z partitioned with the dissociated H2A-H2B dimers. Histidine residues have been involved in the abrupt loss of stability when the pH drops from 6.5 to 5.5 due to the ionization of histidine (as the pK of the histidine imidazole ring is 6.0), which results in the loss of hydrogen bonding (28.Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this regard, the crystallographic structure of the H2A.Z NCP (17.Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) has shown that the loop L1 between helix α1 and α2 of the histone H2A.Z fold exhibits some significant changes between residues 38 and 44 (38SRTTSHG44) when compared with the equivalent region (36KGNYAE41) in H2A. These regions are at the interface between the two H2A molecules present in the histone octamer (34.Marino-Ramirez L. Kann M.G. Shoemaker B.A. Landsman D. Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2005; 2: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and hence the structural differences between these two equivalent domains would presumably prevent the existence of core histone octamer H2A.Z/H2A hybrids (17.Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Very interestingly, a highly conserved histidine residue (His43) is present at this interface in H2A.Z and another nearby (His35), which is also not present in canonical H2A. In contrast, no differences in histidine amino acids exist at the interface between either H3/H2A or H4/H2A (34.Marino-Ramirez L. Kann M.G. Shoemaker B.A. Landsman D. Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2005; 2: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Histone H2A.Z Destabilizes the H2B-H2A.Z Dimer—The results from the previous section show that, under neutral pH conditions, the native histone H2A.Z-containing octamer is very stable. However, a recent report using recombinant H2A.Z and H2B histones has shown that the reconstituted histone heterodimers are unstable (35.Placek B.J. Harrison L.N. Villers B.M. Gloss L.M. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, before proceeding with the reconstitution of H2A.Z-containing NCPs, we decided next to analyze the stability of the native H2A.Z-H2B dimer. To that end the thermal stability of the dimer at different ionic strengths was analyzed using CD spectroscopy as in previous studies (29.Karantza V. Freire E. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13114-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36.Karantza V. Baxevanis A.D. Freire E. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the CD spectra of H2A.Z in comparison to H2A. The two spectra are quite similar with an estimated α-helical content of 21% for H2A and 24% for H2A.Z as determined by the ellipticity at 222 nm (37.Bradbury E.M. Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C. Rattle H.W. Boublik M. Sautiere P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1876-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These values are lower than those expected from the crystallographic data (49%) due to the lack of interaction with H2B, which contributes in part to the stabilization of the secondary structure of the histone fold (32.Abbott D.W. Laszczak M. Lewis J.D. Su H. Moore S.C. Hills M. Dimitrov S. Ausio J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36.Karantza V. Baxevanis A.D. Freire E. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the CD spectra shown in this figure provide a strong indication that the purification process did not alter the ability of H2A.Z to fold into a native (monomeric) conformation. As a preamble to the salt-dependent thermal stability characterization of the H2A.Z-H2B complex interaction, we performed first a similar analysis for the native H2A-H2B histone heterodimer and compared our results with those previously published (36.Karantza V. Baxevanis A.D. Freire E. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38.Karantza V. Freire E. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, our results are in good agreement with this earlier data. However, attempts to produce the same data for H2A.Z-H2B completely failed due to the unfolded state adopted by the H2A.Z-H2B dimers under any of the buffer conditions (see Fig. 2C) required to perform this type of analysis. This experimental work was being carried out when a report was just published describing a similar finding (35.Placek B.J. Harrison L.N. Villers B.M. Gloss L.M. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our results hence come in support of this publication, corroborating the unfolded state of the H2A.Z-H2B dimer under physiological ionic and temperature conditions. It is not clear whether this is the result of compositional amino acid differences at the extensive interface between H2A.Z and H2B (34.Marino-Ramirez L. Kann M.G. Shoemaker B.A. Landsman D. Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2005; 2: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 35.Placek B.J. Harrison L.N. Villers B.M. Gloss L.M. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Alternatively a specialized metazoan H2B variant that specifically interacts with H2A.Z, such as that recently described in Trypanosome (39.Lowell J.E. Kaiser F. Janzen J.C. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5721-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), could help to maintain the stability of the heterodimer. Whatever the situation, the molecular mechanisms involved in the stability of the H2A.Z-H2B complex remain yet to be elucidated. H2A.Z-containing NCPs Exhibit a Very Similar Salt-dependent Conformation and Slightly Stabilize the Particle—Our ability to purify native H2A.Z allowed us to reconstitute native H2A.Z-containing NCPs as shown in Fig. 3A. It was thus possible to characterize the ionic strength dependence of the sedimentation coefficient of these particles and compare it to that of the canonical NCP (Fig. 3B). This approach has proven to be very useful in assessing the stability and dynamics of the NCP in solution (40.Ausió J. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 3B indicate that native H2A.Z NCPs behave very similarly to canonical NCPs with the sedimentation coefficients of the former being slightly higher than those of the latter at any given salt concentration. This suggests a slightly more compact conformation of the H2A.Z NCP. A subtle increase in compaction is also supported by the slight increase in electrophoretic mobility of these particles in native PAGE (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A, panel 3). To better characterize the salt-dependent stability of H2A.Z NCPs in a native setting, an electrophoretic analysis of native NCPs fractionated by sucrose gradients under different NaCl concentrations was performed as previously described by our laboratory (Fig. 3C) (23.Abbott D.W. Chadwick B.P. Thambirajah A.A. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16437-16445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When the PAGE loadings were normalized for approximately equal amounts of H2A, the fractions from the upper part of the gradient (fractions 19–21) in 0.6 m and 0.9 m NaCl exhibited a small but noticeable depletion in H2A.Z. The range between 0.6 m and 0.9 m NaCl corresponds to the range of ionic strength that causes dissociation of the histone H2A-H2B dimers from the NCP to begin. At 0.9 m and 1.2 m NaCl, there was a clear decrease in H2A.Z at lower sucrose concentrations with a concomitant increase in the relative amount of H2A.Z in earlier, more stable mononucleosome populations. Hence, the sl"

In M. tuberculosis, the non-reducing arabinan termini of the LAM are capped with α1→2 mannose residues; in some other species, the arabinan of LAM is not capped or is capped with inositol phosphate. The nature and extent of this capping plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. MT1671 in M. tuberculosis CDC1551 was identified as a glycosyltransferase that could be involved in LAM capping. To determine the function of this protein a mutant strain of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 was studied, in which MT1671 was disrupted by transposition. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the LAM of the mutant strain migrated more rapidly than that of the wild type and did not react with concanavalin A as did wild-type LAM. Structural analysis using NMR, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, endoarabinanase digestion, Dionex high pH anion exchange chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry demonstrated that the LAM of the mutant strain was devoid of mannose capping. Since an ortholog of MT1671 is not present in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, a recombinant strain was constructed that expressed this protein. Analysis revealed that the LAM of the recombinant strain was larger than that of the wild type, had gained concanavalin A reactivity, and that the arabinan termini were capped with a single mannose residue. Thus, MT1671 is the mannosyltransferase involved in deposition of the first of the mannose residues on the non-reducing arabinan termini and the basis of much of the interaction between the tubercle bacillus and the host cell.

Its structure is complex and heterogeneous with three distinct structural domains, including a phosphatidylinositol anchor (PI anchor), a branched mannan, and a branched arabinan (Fig. 1). The PI anchor is composed of a myo-inositol phosphoryl diacylglycerol substituted at the 2 position with a single mannopyranose (Manp) and at the 6 position with the mannan; this structure is identical to those found in the mycobacterial phosphatidylinositolmannosides and lipomannan (1.Khoo K.H.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The mannan core is linked to the 6 position of the myo-inositol residue of the PI anchor and consists of a linear α(1→6) Manp chain with varying degrees of α(1→2) Manp branching with single Manp residues (3.Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This structure is conserved in all mycobacterial species studied with two exceptions (4.Guerardel Y. Maes E.

The arabinan component consists of linear stretches of α(1→5) arabinofuranose (Araf) residues with some α(1→3) branching. Two distinct non-reducing termini are generated with a β-d-Araf-(1→2)-α-d-Araf disaccharide linked to the 5 position of α-d-Araf-(1→5)-α-d-Araf-(1→ or the 3 and 5 positions of α-d-Araf-(1→5)-α-d-Araf(1→, resulting in the formation of well characterized Ara4 and Ara6 motifs, respectively, when digested with an endoarabinanase obtained from a Cellulomonas species (Fig. 1; Refs. 3.Chatterjee D.

The situation is different in rapidly growing mycobacteria. LAM isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis and an unidentified Mycobacterium sp. is largely uncapped with a small fraction being capped with inositol phosphate (PILAM) (7.Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R.

Maes E. Elass E. Leroy Y. Timmerman P. Besra G.S. Locht C. Strecker G. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30635-30648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). LAM has been implicated in a plethora of biological functions; typically ManLAM is thought to be anti-inflammatory, while PILAM is thought to be pro-inflammatory. ManLAM has been implicated in inhibition of phagosomal maturation, apoptosis, and interferon-γ signaling in macrophages and interleukin-12 secretion of dendritic cells (reviewed in Refs. 3.Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the type of LAM capping is a major structural feature in determining how the immune system is modulated (14.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and a recent publication suggests that dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) may act as a pattern recognition receptor and discriminate between Mycobacterium species through selective recognition of the Manp caps on LAM molecules (16.Maeda N. Nigou J. Herrmann J.L. Jackson M. Amara A. Lagrange P.H. Puzo G. Gicquel B. Neyrolles O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5513-5516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, LAM structure is generally considered to be a crucial factor in mycobacterial pathogenesis. Despite the level of understanding of the structure of LAM and the variety of immunomodulatory effects it mediates, nothing was known of the enzymes involved in capping of Man-LAM. However, the facts that decaprenylphosphorylarabinofuranose is the only known donor of the Araf residues in the mycobacterial cell wall (17.Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and synthesis of polar phosphatidylinositolmannosides and linear LM can be inhibited by amphomycin (18.Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19.Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that the glycosyltransferases (GTs) involved in the later steps of ManLAM synthesis likely utilize prenylphosphorylglycoses as sugar donors. This idea was supported by the fact that in Corynebacterium glutamicum disruption of polyprenylphosphorylmannose synthase completely obviates lipoglycan synthesis (20.Gibson K.J.C. Eggeling L. Maughan W.N. Krumbach K. Gurcha S.S. Nigou J. Puzo G. Sahm H. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40842-40850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enzymes involved in ManLAM capping could have structural motifs similar to those reported in GTs that use dolichylphosphorylglycose as sugar donors in eukaryotes (21.Oriol R. Martinez-Duncker I. Chantret I. Mollicone R. Codogno P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These eukaryotic GTs have been classified as members of a superfamily of integral membrane GTs (GT-C), that have modified DxD signatures in the first extracellular loop (22.Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Iterative searches of sequence data bases, motif extraction, structural comparison, and analysis of completely sequenced genomes indicate that members of the GT-C superfamily have limited phylogenetic distribution in that representatives were found in all sequenced eukaryotic genomes, were absent from archaea, and were rare in other prokaryotes with the exception of mycobacteria (22.Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Approximately 40 putative members of the GT-C superfamily were identified in the genomes of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis CDC1551, M. leprae, and M. smegmatis (22.Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Of these putative GTs 16 were identified in M. tuberculosis H37Rv; these included putative arabinosyltransferases, the mycobacterial Emb proteins, and Rv1002c, which was subsequently shown to catalyze the initial Manp transfer in mycobacterial protein mannosylation (23.VanderVen B.C. Harder J.D. Crick D.C. Belisle J.T. Science. 2005; 309: 941-943PubMed Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the mannosyltransferases (MTs) involved in capping of ManLAM would be among these 16 putative GTs and would have orthologs in M. leprae, M. avium, and M. bovis but would not have an ortholog in M. smegmatis. Based on this hypothesis MT1671 from M. tuberculosis was identified as a gene encoding a potential GT involved in LAM capping. Therefore, LAM was isolated and structurally characterized from a transposition mutant in which the gene encoding the protein was disrupted and from a recombinant strain of M. smegmatis that expresses the protein. Materials—All chemical reagents were of the highest grade from Sigma unless otherwise specified. M. smegmatis mc2155 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. M. tuberculosis CDC1551 (ΔMT1671) strain was obtained by inactivation of the MT1671 gene in a M. tuberculosis ΔSigF background by transposition (24.Lamichhane G. Zignol M. Blades N.J. Geiman D.E.

Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5575-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); these strains along with the parental strain, M. tuberculosis CDC1551, were generously provided by Dr. W. R. Bishai (Center for Tuberculosis Research, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The insertion of the kanamycin cassette in MT1671 gene was checked by PCR (using primers MT1671f (5′-ATG TTG CTG TGC AAG GCT-3′) and MT1671r (5′-TTA CCG CGT TGA CTT GAC-3′) specific to the MT1671 gene; TSPf (5′-CGC TTC CTC GTG CTT TAC GGT ATC G-3′) and TPSr (5′-CCC GAA AAG TGC CAC CTA AAT TGT AAG CG-3′) specific to the transposon). Culture Conditions—M. smegmatis mc2155 and M. tuberculosis CDC1551 were grown in 7H9 containing oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and catalase and 0.05% Tween 80. M. smegmatis mc2155-pVV16 and M. smegmatis mc2155-pVV16-MT1671 were grown with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml) selection. M. tuberculosis ΔSigF was cultured with hygromycin selection (50 μg/ml), and M. tuberculosis ΔMT1671 was cultured with kanamycin and hygromycin (50 μg/ml each). All bacteria strains were cultured and harvested at late log phase. Construction of Recombinant M. smegmatis mc2155—The 1671-bp open reading frame of MT1671 from M. tuberculosis CDC1551 was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primers (MT1671f (5′-TTT TTT CAT ATG CAT GCG AGT CGT CCC G-3′) and MT1671r (5′-TTT TTT AAG CTT ACC GCG TTG ACT TGA CCA C-3′)) engineered to include NdeI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the vector pGEM (Promega) for sequence confirmation and subsequently ligated into pVV16 derived from pMV261 (26.Stover C.K. de la Cruz V. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) after digestion with NdeI and HindIII to create plasmid pVV16-MT1671. M. smegmatis mc2155 was then transformed with pVV16 or pVV16-MT1671 by electroporation. Extraction of LAM and LM—A quick method was used when LAM and LM were extracted from small samples of mycobacteria (50 mg) as described previously (27.Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) was added to the cell pellet and incubated 30 min at 55 °C. The sample was centrifuged, and the organic solvent was removed. Water and phenol saturated with phosphate-buffered saline (1:1) were added to the pellet and then incubated at 80 °C for 2 h. Chloroform was added, and the sample was centrifuged. The supernatant containing LAM and LM was dialyzed against water overnight, and the LAM and LM were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When LAM and LM were extracted from large quantities of M. tuberculosis for structural analysis the cell pellets from 5-liter cultures were delipidated by serial extractions of 2:1 chloroform/methanol and 10:10:3 chloroform/methanol/water. Subsequently, LAM and LM were extracted essentially as described (8.Khoo H.H. Tang J.B. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3863-3871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Wet, delipidated cells were resuspended in breaking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 8% Triton X-114 (Sigma), pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, DNase, and RNase). Cells were then disrupted using a French pressure cell. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was rocked overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting 27,000 × g pellet was resuspended in breaking buffer and centrifuged as before. The combined supernatant was placed at 37 °C to generate a biphase and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The aqueous layer and the detergent layer were back extracted twice, and 9 volumes of cold 95% ethanol was added to the combined detergent layers and incubated at –20 °C overnight. The ethanol precipitate was collected, dried, resuspended in water at 50 mg/ml, digested with 1 mg/ml Pronase (Roche Applied Science), and dialyzed against water. Extraction of LAM and LM from large quantities of M. smegmatis for structural analysis was done as described previously (28.Berg S. Starbuck J. Torrelles J.B. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5651-5663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cultures (10 liters) in late log phase were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were delipidated using organic solvents (29.Khoo K.H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusova K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles before mechanical disruption by sonication. The resulting suspension was refluxed in 50% ethanol three times. The extracts were pooled and debris removed by centrifugation. The solvent was evaporated, and the sample was resuspended in water at ∼50 mg/ml and digested with 1 mg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen). After dialysis the LAM/LM fractions from either M. tuberculosis CDC1551 or M. smegmatis were further purified by size fractionation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western or lectin blotting. Size Fractionation, SDS-PAGE, and Blotting—HPLC size fractionation was performed on a Rainin SD 200 series LC system fitted with a Sephacryl S-200 HiPrep 16/60 column in tandem with a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (29.Khoo K.H.

SDS-PAGE (6% stacking gel and 15% resolving gel) followed by periodic acid-Schiff base (PAS) staining (9.Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used to monitor the elution profile of the fractions containing LAM and LM, which were then pooled and dialyzed. Pooled fractions were re-analyzed by SDS-PAGE to check for purity prior to detailed analysis. Samples were also analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal antibody CS-35 (provided by National Institutes of Health/NIAID contract AI-25469) or lectin blot with concanavalin A (ConA) conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma). LAM and LM were electroeluted from 15% SDS-PAGE to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman Schleicher and Schuell Bioscience), which were then blocked and incubated with CS-35 (9.Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or conjugated ConA. In the case of the Western blots, membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase), and color was developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate (Sigma). In the case of the lectin blots, compounds were visualized using the 4-chloro-1-naphthol/3,3′-diaminobenzidine, tetrahydrochloride (CN/DAB) substrate kit according to manufacture's instructions (Pierce). Monosaccharide Composition and Linkage Analysis—LAM samples were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid, converted to alditol acetates, and analyzed by GC using scyllo-inositol as an internal standard (30.York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M.R. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). GC analysis of the alditol acetates was performed on an Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph model 5890 fitted with a SP 2380 column (30 m, 0.25-μm film thickness, 0.25-mm inner diameter; Supelco) using a temperature gradient of 50 °C for 1 min, 30 °C/min to 170 °C, and then 4 °C/min to 260 °C. For linkage analysis, LAM was permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method (31.Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. Mcdowell R.A. Morris H.R. Lennarz W.J. Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Techniques in Glycobiology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1994: 108-132Google Scholar), hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid, and acetylated (30.York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M.R. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). GC/MS of the partially methylated alditol acetates was carried out using a ThermoQuest Trace gas chromatograph 2000 (ThermoQuest) connected to a GCQ/Polaris MS mass detector (ThermoQuest). Sample was dissolved in chloroform prior to injection on a DB-5 fused silica capillary column (10 m, 0.18-μm film thickness, and 0.18-mm inner diameter (J&W Scientific)) at an initial temperature of 50 °C, which was held for 1 min. The temperature was then increased to 180 °C over 20 min and then to 250 °C over 8 min. NMR Spectroscopy—Spectra were acquired after several lyophilizations in D2O of 4 mg/0.6 ml in 100% D2O. Two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500-MHz NMR spectrometer using the supplied Varian pulse sequences. The HSQC data were acquired with a 7-kHz window for proton in F2 and a 15-kHz window for carbon in F1. The total recycle time was 1.65 s between transients. Adiabatic decoupling was applied to carbon during proton acquisition. Pulsed field gradients were used throughout for artifact suppression but were not used for coherence selection. The data set consisted of 1000 complex points in t2 by 256 complex points in t1 using States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation). Forward linear prediction was used for resolution enhancement to expand t1 to 512 complex points. A cosine-squared weighting function and zero filling were applied to both t1 and t2 prior to the Fourier transformation. The final resolution was 3.5 Hz/point in F2 and 15 Hz/point in F1. Endoarabinanase Digestion and Analysis by HPAEC—LAM (20 μg) was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with an endoarabinanase isolated from Cellulomonas gelida (3.Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 6.McNeil M.R. Robuck K.G. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the digestion mixtures containing both the mannan core and the released oligosaccharides was analyzed directly by Dionex analytical HPAEC performed on a Dionex liquid chromatography system fitted with a Dionex Carbopac PA-1 column. The oligosaccharides were detected with a pulse-amperometric detector (PAD-II) (Dionex). The remaining mixtures were peracetylated as described above and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—The peracetylated oligosaccharides (10 μg/μl) or the aqueous solutions of the native LAM (10 μg/μl) were mixed with an equal volume of matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in 10 mg/ml acetonitrile/water, 50:50, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) prior to analysis and the molecular mass was measured in negative ion mode by MALDI-TOF on a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Other Techniques—Protein sequences were obtained from the National Institute for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) world wide web site. BLAST searches were performed at the NCBI site or the TB Structural Genomics Consortium web site. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using the MultAlin (32.Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4228) Google Scholar) interface on the L'institut National de la Recherché Agronomique Chemin de Borde-Rouge-Auzeville web site. Standard molecular biology techniques were done as described previously (33.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Identification of MT1671 as a GT Potentially Involved in LAM Capping—MT1671 from M. tuberculosis CDC1551 met all of the criteria proposed for a GT involved in Manp capping of LAM; it is classified as a putative GT-C GT (22.Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), species of mycobacteria known to have ManLAM have orthologs of this protein, and M. smegmatis, which has PILAM, does not (Fig. 2A). The amino acid sequences of the orthologs in M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Rv1635c) and M. bovis AF2122/97 (Mb1661c) are identical to that of MT1671. M. leprae TN and Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis also have genes that encode proteins, ML1389 and MAP1338c, respectively, with a high degree of similarity (Fig. 2B). MT1671 is predicted to be a 60.3-kDa protein with an isoelectric point at pH 10.66. The protein is also predicted to have 10 (TMHMM 2.0, PHDhtm) or 11 (SOSUI) transmembrane helices. The program PHDhtm was utilized by Oriol et al. (21.Oriol R. Martinez-Duncker I. Chantret I. Mollicone R. Codogno P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to predict the secondary structure of GTs, which use dolichylphosphorylmonosaccharides as the donor substrate, and when used to predict the secondary structure of MT1671, a model was generated in which there were 10 transmembrane helices with the first loop on the extracellular face of the membrane. This loop contains an Asp residue and a Glu residue (DE motif) that are consistent with conserved amino acids in the first, extracellular loop of proteins in the α 2/6 MT superfamily (21.Oriol R. Martinez-Duncker I. Chantret I. Mollicone R. Codogno P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and is similar to that predicted for Rv1002c, an enzyme responsible for the addition of a Manp residue to protein acceptors in M. tuberculosis H37Rv (23.VanderVen B.C. Harder J.D. Crick D.C. Belisle J.T. Science. 2005; 309: 941-943PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of LAM from M. tuberculosis CDC1551 with a Disrupted Copy of MT1671—Since a M. tuberculosis CDC1551 transposon mutant in which MT1671 was disrupted had already been constructed in a ΔSigF background (24.Lamichhane G. Zignol M. Blades N.J. Geiman D.E. Do"
https://openalex.org/W2007697123,"Native lung surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a 4.2-kDa acylpeptide that associates with alveolar surfactant phospholipids via a transmembrane α-helix. This helix contains mainly Val, although poly-Val is inefficient in helix formation, and helical SP-C can spontaneously convert to β-sheet aggregates and amyloid-like fibrils. SP-C is cleaved out from a 21-kDa integral membrane protein, proSP-C, in the alveolar type II cell. Recently several mutations localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-lumenal (C-terminal) part of proSP-C (CTproSP-C) have been associated with intracellular accumulation of toxic forms of proSP-C, low levels of mature SP-C, and development of interstitial lung disease. CTproSP-C contains a ∼100-residue Brichos domain of unknown function that is also found in other membrane proteins associated with amyloid formation, dementia, and cancer. Here we find that recombinant CTproSP-C binds lipid-associated SP-C, which is in β-strand conformation, and that this interaction results in an increased helical content. In contrast, CTproSP-C does not bind α-helical SP-C. Recombinant CTproSP-C(L188Q), a mutation associated with interstitial lung disease, shows secondary and quaternary structures similar to those of wild type CTproSP-C but is unable to bind lipid-associated β-strand SP-C. Transfection of CTproSP-C into HEK293 cells that express proSP-C(L188Q) increases the amount of proSP-C protein, whereas no effect is seen on cells expressing wild type proSP-C. These findings suggest that CTproSP-C binds nonhelical SP-C and thereby prevents β-sheet aggregation and that mutations in CTproSP-C can interfere with this function. Native lung surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a 4.2-kDa acylpeptide that associates with alveolar surfactant phospholipids via a transmembrane α-helix. This helix contains mainly Val, although poly-Val is inefficient in helix formation, and helical SP-C can spontaneously convert to β-sheet aggregates and amyloid-like fibrils. SP-C is cleaved out from a 21-kDa integral membrane protein, proSP-C, in the alveolar type II cell.

Human surfactant protein C (SP-C) 2The abbreviations used are: SP-C, surfactant protein C; CTproSP-C, C-terminal proSP-C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonic kidney. 2The abbreviations used are: SP-C, surfactant protein C; CTproSP-C, C-terminal proSP-C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonic kidney. is synthesized as a 197-residue proprotein (proSP-C) that is processed to a 35-residue mature transmembrane peptide corresponding to residues 24-58 of proSP-C. ProSP-C is exclusively expressed by the alveolar type II cells and is an integral membrane protein with a type II orientation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (C-terminal in the ER lumen) (1Conkright J.J.

SP-C together with SP-B and phospholipids are responsible for lowering the surface tension at the air/liquid interface and by doing so prevent alveolar collapse, (see Ref. 7Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar for a review). SP-C is a highly conserved and very hydrophobic protein that lacks known structural homologues. The transmembrane part of SP-C is an α-helix made up of almost only valines. Valines are rare in α-helices and overrepresented in β-strands, and the SP-C α-helix is metastable and can convert to β-sheet aggregates and form amyloid-like fibrils (8Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M.

Such fibrils of SP-C have been isolated from patients suffering from pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a lung disease characterized by alveolar accumulation of proteinaceous material. Expression of mature SP-C in the absence of the N- and C-terminal proparts results in aggregation of SP-C in the secretory pathway and severe lung malformation during embryonic development, indicating that the proparts are necessary for correct SP-C maturation (1Conkright J.J.

Mutations in the gene encoding proSP-C are associated with familial and sporadic cases of interstitial lung disease in which the mutations cause the protein to misfold and form toxic intracellular aggregates (12Nogee L.M.

The so far characterized mutations have been identified on only one allele but can result in almost complete absence of mature SP-C. This suggests that mutations in the proSP-C gene generate a dominant-negative toxic gain of function. A mutation that causes exclusion of exon 4 by alternative splicing (SP-CΔExon 4) leading to a 37-amino acid C-terminally shortened proprotein results in total absence of mature SP-C (12Nogee L.M. Dunbar III, A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The exchange of glutamine for leucine at position 188 gives abnormal-appearing lamellar bodies, slowed cell growth, and signs of cytotoxicity (14Thomas A.Q. Lane K. Phillips III, J. Prince M.

Expression of proSP-C with mutations in positions 66 or 73 (E66K and I73T) give rise to detectable amounts of mature SP-C (15Brasch F. Griese M. Tredano M. Johnen G. Ochs M. Rieger C. Mulugeta S.

Thus it appears that the effect on proSP-C processing depends on where the mutation is located in the proprotein. The C-terminal part of proSP-C stretches from residues 59 to 197, and it has an unknown structure and function. In this region, a novel domain called Brichos (residues 94-197 in proSP-C) is located (17Sanchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Valencia A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Most of the mutations found in the proSP-C gene are located in the Brichos part of proSP-C (18Beers M.F. Mulugeta S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 663-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The Brichos domain contains about 100 amino acids and is also found in other previously unrelated proteins, such as Bri associated with amyloid formation and dementia, ChM-I associated with chondrosarcoma, and CA11 associated with stomach cancer (17Sanchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Valencia A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All of these proteins have a transmembrane sequence in the N-terminal region, and proSP-C and Bri are posttranslationally processed by proteases. One suggested function for the Brichos domain was a chaperone-like activity, which would prevent misfolding and aggregation of the parent protein; consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that the Brichos domain structurally matches the apical domain of GroEL (17Sanchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Valencia A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These findings provided the incentive to investigate the function of the C-terminal part of proSP-C in the relation to folding of the mature peptide. Protein Expression and Purification—A region from nucleotide 175 (in the codon for His59) to nucleotide 991 (in the codon for Ile197) of the proSP-C cDNA sequence (i.e. coding for CTproSP-C) was amplified from FirstChoice PCR-Ready human lung cDNA (Ambion, Cambridgeshire, UK). For the PCR amplification two primers (DNA Technology AIS, Aarhus, Denmark) were used: 5′-GGTGMCCATGGCACATGAGCCAGAAACACACGGCGATGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTCTAGAGGATCCGGATCCCTAGATGTAGTAGAGCGGCACCTCC-3′ (reverse primer); the underlined sequences are BamHI and NcoI cleavage sites, respectively. The amplified cDNA fragment was digested with BamHI and NcoI and ligated into the expression vector pET-32c (Novagen, Madison, WI) coding for thioredoxin, hexahistidine, and S tags upstream of the insertion site. Thrombin and enterokinase cleavage sites allow proteolytic removal of the tags from the fusion protein. The mutant CTproSP-C(L188Q) was created from the wild type cDNA using the forward primer 5′-AGCACCCAGTGTGGCGAGGTGCCGCTCTAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCCACACTGGGTGCTCACGGCCATGCCCAA-3′; the mutation sites are underlined. For expression of wild type and mutant CTproSP-C, transformed Escherichia coli strain Origami (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) were grown at 30 °C in LB medium (1 liter of LB medium contains 10 g of tryptone,5gof yeast, and 10 g of NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 16 h with constant stirring. Expression was induced at an A600 around 1.2 by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, the temperature was lowered to 25 °C, and the bacteria were grown for another 4 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and stored at -70 °C. The cells were lysed by lysozyme (1 mg/ml) treatment for 30 min on ice, followed by sonication for 10 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 6500 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was suspended in 2 m urea in buffer A (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 5 mm imidazole, pH 8, and sonicated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 6000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, then mixed with 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen Ltd., West Sussex, UK), and poured into a column. The column was washed with 100 ml of 2 m urea in buffer A, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8, and then with 100 ml 1 m urea in the same solution and finally with 100 ml of buffer A with 5 mm imidazole only. The fusion protein was then eluted with 300 mm imidazole in buffer A, pH 8. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The thioredoxin and His tags were removed by cleavage with thrombin (kind gift from Prof. Steven Olson, Chicago, IL) at an enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 0.002 for 5-16 h at 4 °C. After cleavage, the solution was reapplied to a Ni2+ column to remove the released thioredoxin-His tag fragment and uncleaved fusion protein. After elution from the Ni2+ column, the protein was applied on an anion exchange column (5 ml of HiTrap QFF from Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The protein eluted as a single peak using a linear gradient from 20 mm to 1 m NaCl and was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm NaH2PO4,5mm NaCl), pH 7.4. The protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.15 μm-1 cm-1. The protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and by nondenaturing PAGE. Protein-Peptide and Protein-Lipid Interactions—Phospholipids were isolated from the modified natural surfactant preparation, Curosurf, which contains 98% (w/w) phospholipids and about 1% each of SP-B and SP-C (Chiesei Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy). Curosurf paste was dissolved in MeOH/CHCl3 (4:1, v/v), and phospholipids were separated from SP-B and SP-C by reversed phase liquid chromatography using a Lipidex 5000 column (40 × 6.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) (19Stark M. Wang Y. Danielsson O. Jornvall H. Johansson J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Synthetic porcine SP-C (LRIPCCPVNLKRLLVVVVVVVLVVVVIVGALLMGL) was made and purified as described (20Johansson J. Nilsson G. Stromberg R. Robertson B. Jornvall H. Curstedt T. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and native SP-C was purified from pig lung homogenates as described (21Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Robertson B. Bergman T. Berggren P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Synthetic SP-C forms β-sheet aggregates that can only be dissolved in neat acids, e.g. formic acid (20Johansson J. Nilsson G. Stromberg R. Robertson B. Jornvall H. Curstedt T. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For reconstitution of peptides and phospholipids, surfactant phospholipids were dissolved in MeOH/CHCl3 (1:1, v/v) and peptides, synthetic SP-C, or native SP-C dissolved in formic acid or in MeOH/CHCl3 (1:1 v/v), respectively, were added, and the solutions were incubated at 37 °C until the solvents were evaporated. Lipids and peptides were then resuspended in buffer B, pH 7.4, by vortexing and sonication, giving a final concentration of 5 mg/ml phospholipids and 20 μm peptide. Phospholipids without peptide and Curosurf paste were resuspended in the same manner. Wild type or mutant CTproSP-C was then added to the phospholipids or phospholipid/peptide mixtures to a concentration of 50 μg/ml. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 40 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets and supernatants obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15% gel run under nonreducing conditions. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, CTproSP-C was visualized by Western blot using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-S tag antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI). For analysis of interactions between CTproSP-C and water-soluble poly-valine peptides, the peptides KKVVVVVVVKK (K2V7K2) and KKVVVVVKK (K2V5K2) were purchased from Thermo Electron GmBH, Germany. The Lys residues at the N and C termini were introduced to make the peptides soluble in water. CTproSP-C (10 μm) and peptides (10, 50, or 100 μm) were coincubated in buffer B, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 1 h, and thereafter the mixtures were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE using a 12% gel. CD Experiments—CD spectra in the far-UV region (190-260 nm) were recorded at 22 °C with a Jasco J-810-150S spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using a bandwidth of 1 nm and a response time of 2 s, and 10 data points/nm were collected. Each spectrum shown is the average of three consecutive recordings. Spectra were recorded of wild type or mutant CTproSP-C (10 μm) in (i) buffer B, pH 7.4, or in (ii) 2% (w/v) SDS micelles in buffer B and of (iii) synthetic or native SP-C (10 μm) in 2% (w/v) SDS micelles in buffer B and (iv) combinations of CTproSP-C and SP-C peptides in 2% (w/v) SDS micelles. For incorporation of peptides in SDS micelles, SDS was dissolved in MeOH, and synthetic or native SP-C (dissolved in formic acid or MeOH/CHCl3, respectively) was added, and the solutions were incubated at 37 °C until the solvents were evaporated. SDS micelles, with or without peptides, were then prepared by resuspension in buffer B, pH 7.4. For analysis of CTproSP-C in the presence of SDS micelles, the micelles were prepared first, and then the CTproSP-C was added. Estimation of secondary structure contents from the CD spectra were performed by deconvolution into four simple components (22Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) or by using the residual molar ellipticity values for 208 and 222 nm (23Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T.M. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Recombinant cystatin A (kind gift from Prof. Ingemar Björk, Uppsala, Sweden) was used instead of CTproSP-C in control experiments. Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 Cell Experiments— HEK293 cells stably transfected with human wild type proSP-C (24Bridges J.P. Na C.-L. Wong H.R. Weaver T.E. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 395-40722Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), proSP-C(L188Q), or empty vector (pTRE2-Hyg; BD Biosciences) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml PeSt (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden), and 75 μg/ml hygromycin B (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands), at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For testing the ability of CTproSP-C to rescue misfolded proSP-C(L188Q), 1 × 106 of each of the stably transfected cells were plated into 6-well plates and then grown in the same medium as described above, except for the omission of hygromycin B. After 24 h the cells were transfected with ∼1 μg/well of a vector (pIRES2) encoding human SP-B1-23-CT-proSP-C (SP-B1-23 encodes a signal peptide) and enhanced green fluorescent protein. For each transfection 250 μl of OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) was mixed with 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the mixture was left at room temperature for 5 min. The vector DNA was mixed with 250 μl of OPTI-MEM and then mixed with the Lipofectamine solution. Finally, the DNA/Lipofectamine solution was added dropwise to the cells, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested in Laemmli buffer and sonicated for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with antibodies against the N- or C-terminal proparts of proSP-C, and an antibody against enhanced green fluorescent protein. CTproSP-C Expression and Characterization—A fragment covering residues 59-197 of human proSP-C was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. This fragment starts just C-terminally of the part corresponding to the mature SP-C peptide and ends with the proSP-C C terminus. CTproSP-C was expressed as a fusion protein with thioredoxin, His, and S tags at the N-terminal end. Solubilization of the pellet obtained after cell lysis with 2 m urea followed by removal of urea, affinity chromatography, and cleavage of the thioredoxin and His tags, resulted in a yield of about 4 mg of S tag-CTproSP-C/liter of culture. The S tag was kept to allow Western blot analysis using commercially available anti-S tag antibodies. Analysis by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) shows that >90% of the purified protein corresponds to monomeric CTproSP-C. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C) indicates that the minor bands with higher molecular mass correspond to oligomeric forms of CTproSP-C. Nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 1B) likewise shows one major band, with a minor band migrating just anodally. Comparison of the migration of CTproSP-C upon nondenaturing PAGE with that of proteins with similar calculated sizes and isoelectric points indicate that CTproSP-C forms an oligomer, and gel filtration shows that the main form is a tetramer (data not shown). CD spectroscopy of CTproSP-C (Fig. 2) shows a broad minimum from 205 to 225 nm, indicating that the protein is folded and contains a mixture of helical and sheet structure. The rather low residual molar ellipticity suggests that CTproSP-C also contains unordered structure. From the spectrum in Fig. 2, a helical content of 20-30% and a β-sheet content of 30% is estimated. This is in reasonable agreement with the secondary structure content of CTproSP-C predicted using the ExPASy server (www.expasy.org), which yields about 30% helix and 20% β-sheet. In the presence of SDS micelles (see Fig. 5A) or phospholipid vesicles (data not shown), the amplitudes of the CTproSP-C residual molar ellipticity in the 200-230- and 190-nm regions are increased compared with the values in buffer (Fig. 2), indicating that CTproSP-C is more structurally ordered in the presence of detergents or phospholipids. The structure and stability of CTproSP-C under different conditions is currently under further investigation.FIGURE 2Far-UV CD spectra of wild type CTproSP-C and CTproSP-C(L188Q).

The residual molar ellipticity (θ) is expressed in kdeg × cm2 × dmol-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Association of CTproSP-C with Phospholipid Membranes and SP-C—In sproSP-C, the region corresponding to CTproSP-C is localized close to lipid membranes because the SP-C part forms a transmembrane region. We therefore investigated whether recombinant CTproSP-C binds to phospholipid membranes. CTproSP-C was incubated with surfactant phospholipids with and without incorporated SP-C peptides for 1 h at 37°C,andthe membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 40,000 × g. The CTproSP-C contents in the pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 3). Virtually no detectable CTproSP-C associates with the peptide-free phospholipid membranes. The presence of synthetic SP-C, which is non-helical (see below) in the phospholipid membranes, however, leads to a significant portion of membrane-associated CTproSP-C (Fig. 3, lane 9), whereas CTproSP-C does not bind to membranes containing native,α-helical, SP-C (lane 5). Incubation of phospholipid membranes containing both SP-B and SP-C resulted in detectable CTproSP-C exclusively in the supernatant after centrifugation, showing that CTproSP-C does not bind SP-B and that the presence of SP-B does not result in binding to helical SP-C. Centrifugation of CT-proSP-C in the absence of phospholipid membranes leads to no detectable pelleted protein (data not shown). These experiments show that CTproSP-C binds to phospholipid membranes harboring synthetic (non helical) SP-C. CTproSP-C Interactions with Soluble Poly-Val Peptides— The apparent interaction between CTproSP-C and membrane-bound nonhelical SP-C prompted us to investigate whether CTproSP-C can bind a poly-Val peptide in the absence of lipids. CTproSP-C and the peptide K2V7K2 were coincubated for 1 h, and then the mixture was resolved by nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 4). This resulted in the formation of a CTproSP-C-peptide complex when the peptide was present in excess. CTproSP-C incubated with peptides containing no or shorter poly-Val segments (K2V5K2 or peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 12 or 17 residues of SP-C; see “Experimental Procedures” for the amino acid sequence of SP-C) did not result in detectable complexes. CD Experiments of CTproSP-C-Peptide Mixtures in Detergent Micelles—Experiments were carried out to investigate whether interactions between CTproSP-C and SP-C peptides with helical (native SP-C; see CD spectrum in Fig. 5C) or non-helical (synthetic SP-C; see CD spectrum in Fig. 5A) structure result in a change in conformation. The strictly hydrophobic nature of SP-C necessitated the use of SDS micelles for these experiments. The far-UV CD spectra of CTproSP-C or synthetic SP-C in SDS micelles and the mixture thereof are shown in Fig. 5A. Fig. 5A also shows the calculated spectrum of the mixture of CTproSP-C and synthetic SP-C, obtained by combining the individual spectra of the two components. Evidently the experimental and calculated spectra of CTproSP-C-synthetic SP-C mixtures differ; the difference spectrum (Fig. 5B) indicates that the protein-peptide interaction results in an increase in helical content, as judged from the double minima around 205 and 222 nm. In contrast, mixing CTproSP-C and α-helical (native) SP-C does not result in any change in conformation (Fig. 5C), and the corresponding difference spectrum is consequently close to base line (Fig. 5B). The same experiment was performed with cystatin A instead of CTproSP-C, and with K2V7K2 instead of SP-C, in both cases resulting in no change in conformation (graphs not shown). Structure and Activity of CTproSP-C(L188Q)—CTproSP-C carrying the mutation L188Q was expressed and purified in the same manner as the wild type protein, yielding about 0.5 mg of protein/liter of cell culture. CTproSP-C(L188Q) migrates mainly as a monomer upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), shows the same response on Western blot as the wild type protein (Fig. 1C), and elutes like the wild type protein on size exclusion chromatography (not shown), and the secondary structure contents of wild type and L188Q CTproSP-C in aqueous buffer are virtually identical, as judged by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Denaturation experiments under nonreducing and reducing conditions show that wild type and L188Q CTproSP-C show similar stability properties and that both proteins contain disulfide bridge(s) that increase stability. 3H. Johansson, K. Nordling, and J. Johansson, unpublished data. However, CTproSP-C(L188Q) in contrast to the wild type counterpart does not change its structure in the presence of SDS micelles (compare Figs. 2 and 6A). From this we conclude that CTproSP-C(LI88Q) can form a soluble protein with an overall secondary structure in water that is similar to that of the wild type protein but that the two proteins differ in the way they are influenced by the presence of detergent micelles. Mixing CTproSP-C(L188Q) with phospholipids containing synthetic SP-C result in significantly lower membrane binding than for the wild type protein (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 11). Likewise, mixing CTproSP-C(L188Q) with synthetic SP-C in SDS micelles does not result in a change in conformation (Fig. 6). Like wild type CTproSP-C, the L188Q mutant does not bind pure membranes or membranes containing α-helical SP-C (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 7), nor does mixing CTproSP-C(L188Q) with helical SP-C result in a conformational change (Fig. 6, B and C). CTproSP-C Effects on Wild Type and Mutant proSP-C Levels in HEK293 Cells—The results described above suggest that CTproSP-C can bind β-sheet SP-C and thereby prevent aggregation (see “Discussion”). To investigate whether CTproSP-C can influence proSP-C in a cell, we used HEK293 cells stably transfected with either wild type proSP-C or proSP-C(L188Q). In these cells about 60-70% of the proSP-C(L188Q) protein is rapidly degraded and only a small fraction escapes to the secretory pathway. 4T. E. Weaver, unpublished data. Transient transfection of these cells with a CTproSP-C construct containing a signal peptide results in about 70% increase in the amounts of proSP-C(L188Q) but no"

Recent studies have shown that there are two distinct ig f1r genes in zebrafish, termed ig f1ra and ig f1rb. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zebrafish ig f1ra and ig f1rb resulted from a gene duplication event at the ig f1r locus and that this has led to their functional divergence. The genomic structures of zebrafish ig f1ra and ig f1rb were determined and their loci mapped. While zebrafish ig f1ra has 21 exons and is located on linkage group (LG) 18, zebrafish ig f1rb has 22 exons and mapped to LG 7. There is a strong syntenic relationship between the two zebrafish genes and the human IG F1R gene. Using a MO-based loss-of-function approach, we show that both Igf1ra and Igf1rb are required for zebrafish embryo viability and proper growth and development. Although Igf1ra and Igf1rb demonstrated a large degree of functional overlap with regard to cell differentiation in the developing eye, inner ear, heart, and muscle, they also exhibited functional distinction involving a greater requirement for Igf1rb in spontaneous muscle contractility. These findings suggest that the duplicated zebrafish ig f1r genes play largely overlapping but not identical functional roles in early development and provide novel insight into the functional evolution of the IGF1R/insulin receptor gene family."

Adenosine A1 receptor stimulation inhibits this response through a Gi protein-mediated pathway, but the distal inhibitory signaling mechanisms are unknown. In cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM), the A1 receptor agonist cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) inhibited the increase in NHE1 phosphorylation induced by the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine, without affecting activation of the ERK/RSK pathway. CPA also induced significant accumulation of the catalytic subunit of type 2A protein phosphatase (PP2Ac) in the particulate fraction, which contained the cellular NHE1 complement; this effect was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin to inactivate Gi proteins. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopic imaging of CPA-treated ARVM revealed significant co-localization of PP2Ac and NHE1, in intercalated disc regions. In an in vitro assay, purified PP2Ac dephosphorylated a GST-NHE1 fusion protein containing aa 625-747 of the NHE1 regulatory domain, which had been pre-phosphorylated by recombinant RSK; such dephosphorylation was inhibited by the PP2A-selective phosphatase inhibitor endothall. In intact ARVM, the ability of CPA to attenuate the phenylephrine-induced increase in NHE1 phosphorylation and activity was lost in the presence of endothall. These studies reveal a novel role for the PP2A holoenzyme in adenosine A1 receptor-mediated regulation of NHE1 activity in ARVM, the mechanism of which appears to involve Gi protein-mediated translocation of PP2Ac and NHE1 dephosphorylation.

Dyck J.R.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is one of nine known members of the solute carrier 9 (SLC9) gene family (2.Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The sarcolemmal NHE contributes significantly to the control of intracellular pH (pHi) in cardiac myocytes, particularly in response to intracellular acidosis (3.Leem C.H. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although basal activity of the sarcolemmal NHE is low under physiological conditions (3.Leem C.H. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), increased exchanger activity and resultant increases in intracellular [Na+] and/or pHi may mediate inotropic responses to neurohormonal stimuli, such as endothelin 1 (4.Kramer B.K. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), angiotensin II (5.Matsui H. Barry W.H. Livsey C. Spitzer K.W. Cardiovasc.

Res. 1992; 71: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Increased sarcolemmal NHE activity, as a result of the release and autocrine/paracrine actions of angiotensin II and endothelin 1 (7.Alvarez B.V. Pérez N.G. Ennis I.L. Camilion de Hurtado M.C. Cingolani H.E. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or by an independent mechanism (8.von Lewinski D. Stumme B. Fialka F. Luers C. Pieske B. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), may also underlie the slow increase in force development that occurs in response to myocardial stretch. With respect to cardiac pathophysiology, there is strong evidence that sarcolemmal NHE activity contributes to myocardial injury and dysfunction during ischemia and reperfusion. Thus, NHE1-selective pharmacological inhibitors, such as cariporide, have been shown to be cardioprotective in this setting in numerous animal studies (see reviews by Avkiran (9.Avkiran M. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 83: 10G-18GAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and Karmazyn et al. (10.Karmazyn M. Gan X.T. Humphreys R.A. Yoshida H. Kusumoto K. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar)). Clinical trial data suggest that NHE inhibitors also protect human myocardium in appropriate settings (11.Avkiran M. Marber M.S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 39: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), such as in high risk patients who undergo global myocardial ischemia and reperfusion during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (12.Boyce S.W. Bartels C. Bolli R. Chaitman B. Chen J.C. Chi E. Jessel A. Kereiakes D. Knight J. Thulin L. Théroux P. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 2003; 126: 420-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sarcolemmal NHE activity may play a causal or permissive role in myocardial hypertrophy and remodeling, as evidenced by studies in animal models of myocardial infarction (13.Yoshida H. Karmazyn M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H300-H304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pressure overload (14.Camilion de Hurtado M.C. Portiansky E.L. Perez N.G. Rebolledo O.R. Cingolani H.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), β-adrenergic hyperactivity (15.Engelhardt S. Hein L. Keller U. Klämbt K. Lohse M.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and rapid ventricular pacing (16.Aker S. Snabaitis A.K. Konietzka I. van de Sand A. Böngler K. Avkiran M. Heusch G. Schulz R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in which adverse changes in cardiac morphology and function have been attenuated by NHE1-selective inhibitors. Despite the apparent potential of the sarcolemmal NHE as a therapeutic target; however, in the recent EXPEDITION trial (17.Mentzer Jr., R.M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 3MGoogle Scholar), the significant cardioprotection afforded by cariporide treatment was tempered by serious non-cardiac adverse effects. Until the mechanisms of the adverse effects are delineated, the therapeutic application of agents that directly and globally inhibit the ubiquitously expressed NHE1 protein must remain in abeyance. Nevertheless, better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the sarcolemmal NHE may pave the way for therapeutic manipulation of exchanger activity in a cardiac- or disease-specific manner.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16113-16122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has revealed that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is necessary for the increase in sarcolemmal NHE activity induced by diverse stimuli, including α1-AR agonists (19.Snabaitis A.K. Yokoyama H. Avkiran M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Such stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity is thought to occur, at least in part, through activation of the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK or RSK) (19.Snabaitis A.K. Yokoyama H. Avkiran M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which lies immediately downstream of ERK (25.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous work has shown RSK to increase NHE1 activity in fibroblasts through direct phosphorylation of Ser703 in the exchanger regulatory C-terminal domain (26.Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM), stimulation of adenosine A1 receptors inhibits the increase in sarcolemmal NHE activity induced via Gq protein-coupled receptors, such as α1-ARs (27.Avkiran M. Yokoyama H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although this inhibitory effect has been shown to occur through a Gi protein-mediated pathway (27.Avkiran M. Yokoyama H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the distal signaling mechanism(s) have remained unclear. Therefore, the principal objective of the present study was to identify the pertinent signaling mechanism(s). This investigation was performed in accordance with the Home Office Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London. Materials—Antibodies were from the following sources: phospho-Ser 14-3-3 binding motif (polyclonal and monoclonal), phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-RSK, Cell Signaling Technology; NHE1 (polyclonal), PP1c, RSK (agarose-conjugated) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), Santa Cruz Biotechnology; NHE1 (monoclonal), Chemicon; PP2Ac, Upstate Biotechnology; phospho-Ser16 phospholamban, Badrilla; anti-rabbit AlexaFluor® 488 and anti-mouse AlexaFluor® 594, Molecular Probes. Bacterial expression vector (pGEX-KG) encoding the GST-NHE1 fusion protein was a gift from Dr. Bradford Berk (Rochester, NY). Recombinant RSK2 and purified PP2Ac were from Upstate Biotechnology. Ro-318220, endothall, okadaic acid, and pertussis toxin were from Calbiochem, phenylephrine and N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) from Sigma-Aldrich, and carboxySNARF-1 from Cambridge Bioscience. Signaling Studies in ARVM—ARVM were isolated and maintained in culture for 18 h, as described (28.Snabaitis A.K. Muntendorf A. Wieland T. Avkiran M. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ARVM were then exposed to the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA; 10 μmol/liter) or vehicle control (0.1% Me2SO) for 5 min, followed by exposure to phenylephrine (10 μmol/liter) or vehicle control (phosphate-buffered saline) for 3 min. At the end of the exposure period, ARVM were lysed in either Laemmli sample buffer (for immunoblotting) or lysis buffer (for immunoprecipitation or subfractionation). Western Immunoblotting—Western immunoblotting was carried out as previously described (28.Snabaitis A.K. Muntendorf A. Wieland T. Avkiran M. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, protein samples were separated by 9-12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to poly-vinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with primary antibodies raised against PP1c, PP2Ac, NHE1, phospho-Ser 14-3-3 binding motif, phosphorylated ERK1/2 or RSK, as appropriate. Primary antibodies were detected by appropriate donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Specific protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and phosphorylation status was quantified on a calibrated densitometer (GS-800, Bio-Rad) using Quantity One® one-dimensional analysis software (v 4.5.1). ARVM Subfractionation—ARVM were subfractionated using a previously described protocol (29.Fahimi-Vahid M. Gosau N. Michalek C. Han L. Jakobs K.H. Schmidt M. Roberts N. Avkiran M. Wieland T. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 441-453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, ARVM were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer at pH 7.5 containing (in mmol/liter) Tris-HCl 50, EGTA 5, EDTA 2, DTT 5, as well as 0.05% digitonin and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Germany). The samples were then frozen by floating the culture plate on a volume of liquid N2 and thawed at room temperature. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant, which comprised the cytosolic fraction, was removed. The pellet, which comprised the particulate fraction, was then solubilized in an equal volume of the digitonin-based lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. For PP2Ac determination, demethylation was performed by adding an equal volume of 0.2 mol/liter NaOH to each cytosolic and particulate fraction, incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, and subsequent pH neutralization by the addition of 1 mol/liter HCl, as previously described (30.Liu Q. Hofmann P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1314-H1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of Laemmli sample buffer were added to both fractions, and the fractionated proteins resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblotting. Preparation of Recombinant NHE1 Fusion Protein—Recombinant GST-NHE1 fusion protein was prepared as described earlier (31.Roberts N.A. Haworth R.S. Avkiran M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG encoding amino acids 625-747 of human NHE1 linked to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli. Cultures were grown to sublog phase and induced with 0.5 mmol/liter isopropyl-β-d-thioglactopyr-anoside. Cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS containing 1% v/v Triton X-100 and the GST-NHE1 fusion protein purified at 4 °C by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (Amersham Biosciences). RSK Activity in ARVM—ARVM were lysed by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer at pH 7.6 containing (in mmol/liter) HEPES 10, NaCl 50, NaF 50, sodium pyrophosphate 50, β-glycerophosphate 50, EDTA 5, EGTA 5, Na3VO4 2, and AEBSF 1, as well as 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. ARVM were scraped off the culture plate on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were incubated with 10 μg of RSK antibody, purchased as an agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with ice-cold wash buffer at pH 7.6 containing (in mmol/liter) Tris-HCl 100, LiCl 500, and DTT 1, as well as 0.1% Triton X-100, and twice with ice-cold wash buffer at pH 7.2 containing (in mmol/liter) HEPES 20, EGTA 2, MgCl2 10, DTT 1, as well as 0.1% Triton X-100. The immune complex was then incubated with 50 μl of reaction mixture containing (in mmol/liter) MgCl2 10, MnCl2 10, unlabeled ATP 0.1, as well as 0.1 μCi of [32P]ATP and 100 pmol of GST-NHE1 fusion protein. This reaction mixture was made up in Tris assay dilution buffer (TADB) at pH 7.5, containing (in mmol/liter) Tris-HCl 50, EGTA 0.1, and DTT 15. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and the gels dried by vacuum using Electrophoresis RapiDry (ATTO Corporation, Japan) and subjected to autoradiography. RSK2-mediated Phosphorylation of NHE1 in Vitro—The reaction mixture comprised recombinant active RSK2 (100 ng) and GST-NHE1 fusion protein (1 nmol) in TADB (containing 15 mmol/liter MgCl2), as well as unlabeled ATP (100 μmol/liter) with or without added [32P]ATP (1 μCi), and was incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after the start of the reaction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of these aliquots to an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were subsequently resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western immunoblotting or autoradiography. In the latter case, equal protein loading was determined by staining the gel overnight with colloidal Coomassie stain (containing 1.6% orthophosphoric acid, 0.08% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250, 8% ammonium sulfate, and 20% methanol); the gel was then destained with 20% methanol and a digital image obtained, prior to drying and autoradiography. PP2Ac-mediated Dephosphorylation of NHE1 in Vitro—The GST-NHE1 fusion protein was phosphorylated by recombinant RSK2 as described above, for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then incubated with Ro-318220 (10 μmol/liter) for 10 min at 30 °C, to inhibit RSK2 activity and further GST-NHE1 phosphorylation (31.Roberts N.A. Haworth R.S. Avkiran M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Subsequently, aliquots of the phosphorylated GST-NHE1 fusion protein were incubated with purified PP2Ac (0.003-0.3 units), in the absence or presence of okadaic acid (10-1000 nmol/liter) or endothall (1-100 μmol/liter), for 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins subsequently resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western immunoblotting or autoradiography. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopic Imaging—ARVM were cultured on sterile laminin-coated glass coverslips (Warner Instruments Inc.) and exposed to CPA (10 μmol/liter) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 5 min. The following procedures were then performed at room temperature, with all solutions filtered through a 0.2-μm filter unit prior to use. ARVM were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, after which they were washed twice with PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min. ARVM were then washed twice with PBS for 10 min and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS blocking buffer for 60 min. Following removal of blocking buffer, ARVM were incubated with 1% BSA/PBS containing both rabbit NHE1 antibody (1:50) and mouse PP2Ac antibody (1:200) for 60 min. ARVM were then washed twice with PBS for 10 min and incubated in the dark with the secondary antibodies (1:100) Alexa Fluor® 488 (goat anti-rabbit) and Alexa Fluor® 594 (goat anti-mouse) to detect cellular NHE1 and PP2Ac, respectively. ARVM were then washed twice with PBS for 10 min in the dark followed by a brief wash with ddH2O and the coverslips mounted on slides with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako-Cytomation). The slides were viewed on an inverted laser scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss Inc) equipped with a 40×/1.3NA Plan-Neofluar® oil immersion objective lens (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), and Z-stack images of 1-μm thick were acquired and processed using LSM510 software (v2.01). Immunoprecipitation of NHE1—ARVM were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer at pH 7.5 containing (in mmol/liter) Tris-HCl 50, EGTA 5, EDTA 2, NaF 100, and Na3VO4 1, as well as 0.05% digitonin and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The samples were then frozen by floating the culture plate on a volume of liquid N2 and thawed at room temperature. Cells lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was then solubilized in ice-cold immunoprecipitation lysis buffer at pH 7.5 containing (in mmol/liter) Tris-HCl 20, NaCl 150, EDTA 1, EGTA 1, sodium pyrophosphate 2.5, β-glycerophosphate 1, Na3VO4 1, and NaF 100, as well as 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant containing the solubilized membranes was removed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal NHE1 antibody or phospho-Ser 14-3-3 protein binding motif antibody. Immune complexes were mixed with protein A magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, and separated using a magnetic separation rack (New England Biolabs). The immune complexes were dissociated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 70 °C. Proteins were resolved on 10.5% SDS-PAGE analyzed by western immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal NHE1 antibody or phospho-Ser 14-3-3 protein binding motif antibody.

Briefly, ARVM cultured on laminin-coated glass coverslips were placed in a cell chamber (Model RC-25F, Warner Instrument Inc.) on the stage of an inverted microepi-fluorescence microscope (Nikon) and superfused (3 ml/min) with HCO−3-free Tyrode solution at pH 7.4 containing (in mmol/liter) HEPES 10, NaCl 137, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 0.5, and CaCl2 1.0. Cells were excited with light at 540 nm and carboxyS-NARF-1 fluorescence emission monitored simultaneously at 580 and 640 nm using a Dual Emission Microscope Photometer equipped with photon-counting photomultiplier tubes (Photon Technology International) (19.Snabaitis A.K.

The cells were treated with either CPA (10 μmol/liter) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 5 min, prior to treatment with phenylephrine (10 μmol/liter) or vehicle (PBS) during a transient (3 min) exposure to 20 mmol/liter NH4Cl to induce intracellular acidosis. The rate of acid efflux (JH) at a pHi of 6.90 (JH6.9), measured during subsequent recovery from intracellular acidosis, was used as the index of sarcolemmal NHE activity (19.Snabaitis A.K.

This series of experiments was carried out in a randomized manner in two separate subsets, in the absence or presence of endothall (100 μmol/liter). Statistical Analysis—Data are mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare two groups. Otherwise, data were subjected to ANOVA, with further analysis by Dunnett's test (for comparison of each group with a single control) or Student-Newman-Keuls test (for multiple comparisons). Receptor-mediated Regulation of NHE1 Phosphorylation in ARVM—We initially aimed to determine the effects of α1-AR stimulation, in the absence or presence of adenosine A1 receptor stimulation, on the phosphorylation status of native NHE1 protein in ARVM. The regulatory Ser703 phosphorylation site in NHE1 that is targeted by RSK lies within the sequence Arg-Ile-Gly-Ser-Asp-Pro (26.Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which, upon phosphorylation, creates a binding motif for 14-3-3 proteins (33.Lehoux S. Abe J. Florian J.A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15794-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that a phospho-Ser 14-3-3 binding motif antibody, which recognizes a motif comprised of phospho-Ser with Pro at the +2 position and Arg at the -3 position, might be useful to detect RSK-phosphorylated NHE1. To test this, we phosphorylated in vitro a GST-NHE1 fusion protein (containing amino acids 625-747 of the human NHE1) with recombinant RSK2, and tested whether the phosphorylated protein is recognized by the phospho-Ser 14-3-3 binding motif antibody by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the antibody detected a band migrating at ∼40 kDa, the molecular mass of the GST-NHE1 fusion protein. There was a progressive increase in the detected signal with increasing duration of the phosphorylation reaction, which reflected a similar progressive increase in GST-NHE1 phosphorylation as detected by autoradiography in parallel radioactive kinase assays utilizing 32P-labeled ATP (Fig. 1A). Notably, RSK-mediated phosphorylation was not seen by either method when GST was used as substrate (data not shown), confirming that the phosphorylation signal originated within the NHE1 domain of the fusion protein. These data indicated that the phospho-Ser 14-3-3 binding motif antibody might indeed be a useful tool for detecting RSK-mediated NHE1 phosphorylation. We then exposed intact ARVM to phenylephrine in the absence or presence of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist CPA and aimed to detect changes in NHE1 phosphorylation, using two complementary protocols. In the first protocol, cellular protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with NHE1 antibody and subsequent immunoblot analysis with phospho-Ser 14-3-3 binding motif antibody; in the second protocol, a reciprocal approach was used. A protein band migrating at ∼100 kDa, the expected molecular mass of the mature NHE1 protein, was detected by both approaches. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, with both protocols, the intensity of this band was increased in ARVM exposed to phenylephrine, but this increase was abolished by treatment with CPA. These data indicate that α1-AR stimulation induces NHE1 phosphorylation (at site(s) likely to include Ser703) and that this increase in phosphorylation is attenuated by stimulation of adenosine A1 receptors. This led us to hypothesize that adenosine A1 receptor stimulation may inhibit α1-AR-mediated activation of NHE1 kinase(s), such as RSK, which catalyze NHE1 phosphorylation in response to phenylephrine. Receptor-mediated Regulation of ERK and RSK Activity in ARVM—To test the above hypothesis, we studied the impact of adenosine A1 receptor stimulation on α1-AR-mediated activation of the ERK/RSK pathway in ARVM. As shown in Fig. 2A; however, CPA h"

We examined the role of Ca2+ influx induced by the depletion of Ca2+ stores in signaling TRPC1 expression in endothelial cells. Both thrombin and a protease-activated receptor-1-specific agonist peptide induced TRPC1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which was coupled to an augmented store-operated Ca2+ influx and increase in endothelial permeability. To delineate the mechanisms of thrombin-induced TRPC1 expression, we transfected in endothelial cells TRPC1-promoter-luciferase (TRPC1-Pro-Luc) construct containing multiple nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) binding sites. Co-expression of dominant negative IκBα mutant prevented the thrombin-induced increase in TRPC1 expression, indicating the key role of NF-κB activation in mediating the response. Using TRPC1 promoter-deletion mutant constructs, we showed that NF-κB binding sites located between –1623 and –871 in the TRPC1 5′-regulatory region were required for thrombin-induced TRPC1 expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay utilizing TRPC1 promoter-specific oligonucleotides identified that the DNA binding activities of NF-κB to NF-κB consensus sites were located in this domain. Supershift assays using NF-κB protein-specific antibodies demonstrated the binding of p65 homodimer to the TRPC1 promoter. Inhibition of store Ca2+ depletion, buffering of intracellular Ca2+, or down-regulation of protein kinase Cα downstream of Ca2+ influx all blocked thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and the resultant TRPC1 expression in endothelial cells. Thus, Ca2+ influx via TRPC1 is a critical feed-forward pathway responsible for TRPC1 expression. The NF-κB-regulated TRPC1 expression may be an essential mechanism of vascular inflammation and, hence, a novel therapeutic target.

In the present study we examined the role of Ca2+ influx induced by the depletion of Ca2+ stores in signaling TRPC1 expression in endothelial cells and its consequences in augmenting Ca2+ signaling. Utilizing TRPC1 promoter deletion mutant construct expression studies, we identified that NF-κB binding sites upstream of TRPC1 5′-regulatory region were critical for thrombin-induced TRPC1 expression. We showed that store-operated Ca2+ influx signaled NF-κB activation and induced TRPC1 expression and thereby augmented Ca2+ influx in response to Ca2+ store depletion. Thus, augmented Ca2+ influx signal may play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular inflammation and injury and provides a novel therapeutic target against vascular inflammatory diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human α-thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN).

After this period, the endothelial cells were treated with 50 nm thrombin in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (0.5 μm) in 1% FBS-containing medium for different time intervals. After thrombin treatment, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. RT-PCR was performed as described (16Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi. C. J. Biol.

Human TRPC1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified using the following primer sets: TRPC1 (forward, 5′-GATTTTGGAAAATTTCTTGGGATGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTTGTCTTCATGATTTGCTATCA-3′); GAPDH (forward, 5′-TATCGTGGAAGGACTCATGACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TACATGGCAACTGTG AGGGG-3′). RT product (2 μl) was amplified in a 50-μl volume containing 100 pmol of primers and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. Reaction conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles, and then 72 °C for 7 min. Amplification of GAPDH was also performed following the protocol described above. PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose gel and identified by ethidium bromide staining. The band intensity of scanned gel photograph was determined by using Scion imaging software (from the National Institutes of Health). Normalization of TRPC1 expression was achieved by comparing the expression of GAPDH for the corresponding sample.Immunoblotting—TRPC1 expression in response to PAR-1 activation in HUVEC was determined by immunoblotting cell lysate proteins with anti-TRPC1 antibody (16Paria B.C.

Cells grown on 25-mm diameter glass coverslips were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and loaded with 3 μm Fura-2 AM for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice in HBSS and imaged by using an Attofluor RatioVision digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted microscope and F-Fluar ×40, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Regions of interest in individual cells were marked and excited at 334 and 380 nm with emission at 520 nm at 5-s intervals. The 334/380 nm fluorescence ratio has been used to represent changes in [Ca2+]i.Transendothelial Electrical Resistance—The real-time change in endothelial monolayer resistance was measured to assess endothelial barrier function as described by us (20Tiruppathi C.

In brief, HUVEC were grown to confluence on a small gold electrode (4.9 × 10–4 cm2). The small electrode and the larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. An approximate constant current of 1 μA was supplied by a 1-V, 4000-Hz AC signal connected serially to 1-megaohm resistor between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode. The voltage between small electrode and large electrode was monitored by lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed by a personal computer. The same computer controlled the output of the amplifier and switched the measurement to different electrodes in the course of an experiment. Before the experiment, confluent endothelial monolayer was kept in 1% FBS-containing medium for 2 h, and then cells were either stimulated with thrombin or not stimulated with thrombin for 20 h. After this treatment, thrombin-induced change in resistance of endothelial monolayer was measured. The data are presented in resistance normalized to its value at time zero as described (20Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Deletion mutant constructs for NF-κB sites in the hTRPC1-Pro-Luc were prepared by the PCR method using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following sense and antisense oligonucleotides indicated in parenthesis were used (ΔNF-κB –1623, sense, 5′-GATAACATCTTGTAGACA-3′, antisense, 5′-TGTCTACAAGATGTTATC-3′; ΔNF-κB –880, sense, 5′-TGATCATGCAAAACTGCT-3′, antisense, 5′-AGCAGTTTTGACTGATCA-3′; ΔNF-κB –708, sense, 5′-CATTGTAGAGAACTAAAA-3′, antisense, 5′-TTTTAGTTCTCTACACTG-3′) for PCR amplification utilizing the hTRPC1-Pro-Luc (–1685 to +40 (wild type hTRPC1-Pro-Luc)) plasmid as template.

Plasmid DNA mixtures containing 1 μg of hTRPC1 promoter-luciferase (hTRPC1-Pro-Luc) in pGL2 vector and 0.035 μg of pRL/TK (Promega) were transfected using Lipofectamine. Lipofectamine-DNA complexes were diluted with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM I before being added to HMEC and prewashed two times with Opti-MEM I for 2–4 h. To end transfection, 2 ml of MCBD131 medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to each well.Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay—At 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in MCBD131 medium containing 1% FBS for 2 h and then stimulated with thrombin or PAR-1 agonist peptide. In some experiments cells were pretreated with either 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (75 μm) for 30 min before thrombin treatment. After stimulation, cells were lysed, and 20 μl of lysate was used to measure reporter gene expression (16Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi. C. J. Biol.

Firefly (P. pyralis) and sea pansy (R. reniformis) luciferase activity were assayed by the dual luciferase reagent assay system (Promega). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad reagents.Nuclear Protein Extraction—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HUVEC after thrombin treatment as described (18Rahman A. Anwar K.N. True A.L. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5466-5476PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown in 100-mm cell culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, scraped, and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was homogenized for 10 strokes using a Glass Dounce homogenizer and centrifuging at 3000 × g for 30 s. Nuclear pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of solution B (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 min. Supernatants containing nuclear proteins were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed as described (18Rahman A. Anwar K.N. True A.L. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5466-5476PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dignam J.D. Leowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). The probes used for EMSAs were 21-bp double-stranded TRPC1 promoter-specific NF-κB binding sequences that were listed in Fig. 4A. End labeling was performed by T4 kinase in the presence of [α-32P]ATP. Labeled oligonucleotides were purified on a Sephadex G-50 column. An aliquot of 10 μg of nuclear protein extract was incubated with the labeled double-stranded probe (∼80,000 cpm) in the presence of 2.5 μl of binding buffer (Promega). The binding reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. After adding non-denaturing sample buffer, the DNA-protein complexes were resolved by 6% native PAGE in low ionic strength buffer (0.5× Tris borate-EDTA). To study the effect of antibodies on DNA-protein binding, nuclear extracts were first incubated with NF-κB protein-specific antibodies (2 μg/assay) for 30 min at 25 °C, and then labeled double-stranded probe was added, and the incubation was continued for additional 20 min. After this incubation, non-denaturing sample buffer was added, and the DNA-protein complexes were separated as described above.PKC-α-specific siRNA Transfection—Validated human PKCα-specific siRNA targeted to exon 4 was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). HUVEC grown to ∼70 confluence on gelatin-coated culture dishes were transfected with either 100 nm PKCα-siRNA or scrambled sequence using GeneEraser siRNA transfection reagent (Stratagene) according to the manufacture's protocol."

A family of proteins containing at least one ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and one ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain have been shown to act as soluble ubiquitin receptors of the 26 S proteasome and introduce a new level of specificity into the degradation system. They bind ubiquitylated proteins via their UBA domains and the 26 S proteasome via their UBL domain and facilitate the contact between substrate and protease. NEDD8 ultimate buster-1 long (NUB1L) belongs to this class of proteins and contains one UBL and three UBA domains. We recently reported that NUB1L interacts with the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 and accelerates its degradation and that of its conjugates. Here we show that a deletion mutant of NUB1L lacking the UBL domain is still able to bind FAT10 but not the proteasome and no longer accelerates FAT10 degradation. A version of NUB1L lacking all three UBA domains, on the other hand, looses the ability to bind FAT10 but is still able to interact with the proteasome and accelerates the degradation of FAT10. The degradation of a FAT10 mutant containing only the C-terminal UBL domain is also still accelerated by NUB1L, even though the two proteins do not interact. In addition, we show that FAT10 and either one of its UBL domains alone can interact directly with the 26 S proteasome. We propose that NUB1L not only acts as a linker between the 26 S proteasome and ubiquitin-like proteins, but also as a facilitator of proteasomal degradation.

Ubiquitin, a small protein of 76 amino acids is one of the most conserved proteins known and has been found in all eukaryotic cells studied. It is essential for a variety of cellular processes, including degradation, cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, stress response, embryogenesis, apoptosis, signal transduction, and transmembrane and vesicular transport (1.Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar, 2.Hicke L.

Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Throughout the past years, a family of proteins containing structural motives related to ubiquitin has been described that can be grouped into the ubiquitin-like modifiers and the ubiquitin-domain proteins (7.Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-like modifiers have substantial sequence or structural homology to ubiquitin and form covalent conjugates with their target proteins. However, unlike ubiquitin, which can form large polymeric conjugates, usually only monomeric modifications are observed. As is the case for ubiquitin, a C-terminal diglycine motif is essential for conjugation of most modifiers to their target proteins (8.Yeh E.T. Gong L.M. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Prominent members of this group include SUMO-1, which serves several functions including nuclear transport and budding (9.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 consists of two UBL domains in a head to tail formation, which are about 29 and 36% identical to ubiquitin, respectively. Several key features of ubiquitin, like the lysine residues 48, 63, and 29, which are required for polyubiquitin chain formation, are conserved in both UBL domains (17.Fan W. Cai W. Parimoo S. Lennon G.G. Weissman S.M. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Its C terminus bears a free diglycine motif, which is necessary for the conjugation to so far unidentified target proteins (16.Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Like ubiquitin (18.Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), FAT10 causes rapid degradation of long-lived proteins when fused to the N terminus (19.Hipp M.S. Kalveram B. Raasi S. Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3483-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, unlike ubiquitin, which is recycled from the degraded target proteins, FAT10 is digested along with its substrates. FAT10 thus has a relatively short half-life (20.Hipp M.S. Raasi S. Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. J. Biol.

Several ubiquitin-domain proteins consist of an N-terminal UBL domain, which binds to the 19 S regulator of the 26 S proteasome (23.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and one or more UBA domains that bind mono- or polyubiquitin (24.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

Members of this group include Rad23, which is involved in nucleotide excision repair, and Dsk2, which plays a role in spindle pole duplication (26.Miller R.D. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 188: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27.Raasi S. Orlov I. Fleming K.G. Pickart C.M. J. Mol.

It has been suggested that these ubiquitin-domain proteins serve as linkers of ubiquitylated proteins and the 26 S proteasome (29.Miller J. Gordon C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3224-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but the role of these proteins in degradation is still controversial. Some artificial reporter substrates accumulate in rad23-deleted and dsk2-deleted cells, as do high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates (30.Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann Petersen R. Stone M.

Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of either hPlic or Rad23 leads to inhibition of substrate turnover by the 26 S proteasome (36.Kleijnen M.F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that UBL-UBA proteins, acting as multiubiquitin chain-binding proteins, define a new layer of substrate specificity, where different multiubiquitin chain-binding proteins are involved in the degradation of different proteins (39.Verma R. Oania R. Graumann J. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2004; 118: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The UBA domains are usually essential for this function. Rad23 lacking its UBA domains cannot inhibit degradation in vitro anymore (38.Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), nor can it bind polyubiquitin. The UBL domains, on the other hand, are required for binding to the 26 S proteasome (23.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). For example, only Rad23 with both UBA and UBL domains can rescue degradation by either Rad23- or Rpn10-depleted proteasomes in vitro (39.Verma R. Oania R. Graumann J. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2004; 118: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the impact of the UBL and UBA domains of NUB1L on the binding and degradation of FAT10 as well as the role of the two UBL domains of FAT10. We were able to show that all three UBA domains of NUB1L are required for FAT10 binding, whereas the NUB1L UBL domain mediates interaction with the 26 S proteasome. Surprisingly, a NUB1L mutant lacking the UBA domains was still able to accelerate the degradation of FAT10, even though the two proteins no longer interacted. This apparent contradiction could be reconciled by the finding that FAT10 and NUB1L as well as both UBL domains of FAT10 separately interacted with the 26 S proteasome. Taken together, we found no correlation between the binding of target proteins to NUB1L and the ability of NUB1L to accelerate their degradation, suggesting that NUB1L, by binding to the proteasome via its UBL domain, functions as a facilitator of proteasomal degradation of FAT10 without the necessity to serve as a linker.

A list of the primers used will be available on request. First we made the deletion mutant NUB1LΔUBA1–3. The parts of the DNA from the 5′-end of the full-length cDNA to the 5′-end of UBA1, and from the 3′-end of UBA3 to the 3′-end of the wild-type cDNA were amplified separately by PCR. A short overlap of the primers flanking the region to be deleted allowed for assembly of these two fragments that were completed by amplification using the 5′ and 3′ primers of the full-length cDNA. The short overlap of the two primers contained three unique restriction sites, which were introduced by conservative mutations. The UBA domain or domains of the other mutants were amplified by PCR and introduced into NUB1LΔUBA1–3 via the unique restriction sites. NUB1LΔUBL was generated the same way as NUB1LΔUBA1–3, but different primers were used. FAT10-N-GFP and FAT10-C-GFP were generated by PCR amplification of the N-terminal (FAT-N-GFP) or C-terminal (FAT10-C-GFP) UBL domain of FAT10 and replacing FAT10 in a FAT10-GFP expressing vector by restriction digestion. The two domains were cloned into pcDNA3.1 as well. All sequences were verified by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation of NUB1L mutants and His6-FAT10, and NUB1L and FAT10 mutants was performed as previously described (20.Hipp M.S. Raasi S. Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have identified several residues implicated in either NADPH oxidation or deprotonation activity of PBCV-1 ThyX. Chemical modification by diethyl pyrocarbonate and mass spectroscopic analyses identified a histidine residue (His53) crucial for NADPH oxidation and located in the vicinity of the redox active N-5 atom of the FAD ring system. Moreover, we observed that the conformation of active site key residues of PBCV-1 ThyX differs from earlier reported ThyX structures, suggesting structural changes during catalysis. Steady-state kinetic analyses support a reaction mechanism where ThyX catalysis proceeds via formation of distinct ternary complexes without formation of a methyl enzyme intermediate.

All cellular organisms need thymidylate (dTMP) for the replication of their chromosomes, as dTMP is required for the biosynthesis of dTTP, a building block of DNA. Cells can produce thymidylate either de novo from dUMP or incorporate thymidine using thymidine kinase. The de novo pathway of dTMP synthesis requires a specific enzyme, thymidylate synthase, that methylates dUMP at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. Two structurally and mechanistically distinct classes of thymidylate synthases exist. The well studied ThyA proteins (EC 2.1.1.45) catalyze the reductive methylation reaction of dUMP, with methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate) 6The abbreviations used are: CH2H4folate, methylenetetrahydrofolate; PBCV-1, P. bursaria chlorella virus-1; DEPC, diethylpyrocarbonate; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; r.m.s.d., root-mean-square distance. serving as one-carbon donor and as source of reductive power (reviewed in Ref. 1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the recently discovered ThyX (EC 2.1.1.148) family of thymidylate synthases contains FAD (2Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that is tightly bound by a novel fold (3Mathews I.I. Deacon A.M. Canaves J.M. McMullan D. Lesley S.A. Agarwalla S. Kuhn P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54340-54347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consequently, in the reaction catalyzed by ThyX, CH2H4folate serves only as a carbon donor, leading to the prediction that tetrahydrofolate (and not dihydrofolate as is the case for ThyA) is produced (2Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This prediction has recently been confirmed by identifying tetrahydrofolate as a reaction product of Chlamydia trachomatis ThyX using high pressure liquid chromatography (7Griffin J. Roshick C. Iliffe-Lee E. McClarty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5456-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The catalytic reaction of thymidylate synthase ThyA is a sequential ordered mechanism in which dUMP binding is followed by the entry of CH2H4folate, and subsequent ternary complex formation with dUMP and CH2H4folate simultaneously bound to the enzyme (8Daron H.H. Aull J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 940-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lorenson M.Y. Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3332-3344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was demonstrated by thorough steady-state kinetic measurements using varying concentrations of these two substrates of the ThyA reaction. Moreover, by using fluoro-dUMP in the reaction mixtures, this covalent ternary complex can readily be trapped for ThyA proteins (10Pogolotti Jr., A.L. Ivanetich K.M. Sommer H. Santi D.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although ThyX catalysis is of considerable interest for detecting and designing new anti-microbial compounds (2Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), our understanding of the reaction mechanism of this enzyme is still incomplete. Several models propose that the catalytic cascade of different ThyX proteins starts with oxidation of NADPH (4Agrawal N. Lesley S.A. Kuhn P. Kohen A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10295-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Gattis S.G. Palfey B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Graziani S.

We have proposed earlier that Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) ThyX uses a reaction mechanism with the formation of a ternary complex of CH2H4folate and dUMP bound to the enzyme (6Graziani S. Xia Y. Gurnon J.R. Van Etten J.L. Leduc D. Skouloubris S. Myllykallio H. Liebl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54340-54347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This proposal is compatible with a structural model where dUMP and CH2H4folate are simultaneously docked at the active site of ThyX from Thermotoga maritima (4Agrawal N. Lesley S.A. Kuhn P. Kohen A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10295-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, a ping-pong mechanism involving the formation of a methyl enzyme as a reaction intermediate has been proposed for C. trachomatis ThyX proteins (7Griffin J. Roshick C. Iliffe-Lee E. McClarty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5456-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fluoro dUMP does not seem to form a covalent intermediate with ThyX enzymes (11Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Marechal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), complicating the analysis of the ThyX reaction. Consequently, it is currently unknown whether this discrepancy results from experimental differences or rather indicates that ThyX proteins from viral and cellular sources might use different reaction mechanisms. The goal of this work is to obtain detailed insight into the enzymatic mechanism of the highly active PBCV-1 ThyX protein using a combination of biochemical and structural approaches. We therefore identified and further investigated several residues required for substrate binding and/or catalysis of PBCV-1 ThyX. Moreover, we report the crystal structure of the PBCV-1 ThyX tetramer that provides a structural basis for the interpretation of the obtained functional data. We observed that the conformation of active site key residues of PBCV-1 ThyX is different from earlier reported ThyX structures, suggesting that the active site undergoes structural changes during catalysis. Our detailed steady-state kinetic analyses continue to indicate that ThyX uses a reaction mechanism where catalysis proceeds via formation of distinct ternary complexes.

Protein Expression and Purification—The PBCV-1 wild-type and mutant ThyX proteins were expressed in either E. coli DH5α (ΔthyA) or BL21 at 37 °C in 800 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to early exponential phase cultures (A600 ∼ 0.5) for 3 h. His-tagged proteins were purified from cell-free extracts by gravity-flow chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and gel filtration using an S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted proteins were stored at -80 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, supplemented with 10% glycerol. Protein samples were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and were more than 95% pure. ThyX Activity Measurements—Tritium release assays for measuring PBCV-1 ThyX activity in vitro were performed essentially as described earlier for the Helicobacter pylori ThyX protein (11Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Marechal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with 37.5 pmol of enzyme in a 25-μl reaction mixture. Reactions were terminated after 3.5 min of incubation. Kinetic parameters were determined using nonlinear regression using the software package GRAPHPAD. Typical reactions contained 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NADPH, 60 μm FAD, 500 μm CH2H4folate, 12.5 μm dUMP, 10% glycerol in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The specific activity of the [5-3H]dUMP stock (Moravek) used in the experiments was 13.6 Ci/mmol. Activities of mutant proteins analyzed were compared with those of wild-type protein obtained in parallel experiments. In double titration experiments, the concentrations of dUMP and CH2H4folate were varied from 3 to 50 μm and from 3 to 100 μm, respectively; CH2H4folate and NADPH were varied from 3 to 100 μm and from 100 to 300 μm respectively, and the concentrations of dUMP and NADPH were varied from 3 to 100 μm and from 6.25-200 μm, respectively. Where indicated, deprotonation assays were also performed using enzyme treated with diethylpyrocarbonate (see below). NADPH oxidation activity of ThyX proteins was measured using a total volume of 100 μl. Reaction components were 50 μm dUMP, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 400 μm NADPH, 10 μm FAD. Control experiments established that the addition of 50 μm of CH2H4folate substantially inhibited NADPH oxidation activity. Activity was monitored by net decrease of absorbance at 340 nm using a CARY 50 spectrophotometer (Varian). An extinction coefficient of 6400 cm-1 at 340 nm (ϵ340) was used to quantify absorption changes. Note that this assay is different from the spectrophotometric assay established for ThyA proteins that catalyze the oxidation of tetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate resulting in net increase in absorption at 340 nm. Fluorescence detection measurements of oxidation activity were performed at 340 nm excitation and 460 nm emission, using a Chameleon II multilabel plate reader (Hidex Oy, Finland). Under these experimental conditions, nonmodified PBCV-1 enzyme decreased fluorescence intensity 1250 arbitrary units/min (corresponding to 100% indicated in Table 2), whereas the activity of DEPC-treated enzyme was not detectable.TABLE 2Biochemical analyses of the PBCV-1 ThyX mutant proteins For the oxidation test, 100% (1.56 pmol/min NADPH oxidized) corresponds to the level of activity measured for wild-type protein in the presence of 200 μm NADPH, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 μm dUMP, 10 μm FAD together with 0.17 μm enzyme. CH2H4folate was found to inhibit oxidation activity and was not included in reaction mixtures for oxidation tests.

In the presence of DEPC, histidine residues yield an N-carbethoxyhistidyl derivative that is reversible upon addition of hydroxylamine (NH2OH). In the experiments shown, DEPC was freshly diluted with absolute ethanol before each use. Its concentration was determined by reaction with imidazole as described (13Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Modification of PBCV-1 ThyX was performed at 25 °C for 20 min in 980-μl final volume containing 15 μm PBCV-1 ThyX wild-type protein (15 nmol), 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 250 μm DEPC (the final concentration of ethanol never exceeded 3% (v/v)). A control experiment was performed under the same conditions without DEPC. 54 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride (adjusted to pH 7.0) was added to 490 μl of DEPC-treated PBCV-1 ThyX wild type and control solutions, and the reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 20 min. DEPC and hydroxylamine were removed by size exclusion chromatography using a 5-ml Sephadex G-25 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Samples were routinely concentrated to 80 μl in a Microcon YM10 concentrator (Amicon) before proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry. Proteolytic Digestion and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry— 1 μl of trypsin (1 mg/ml) was added to 15 μl (∼1 nmol) of concentrated control protein and DEPC-inactivated ThyX before and after hydroxylamine treatment. The digestion was carried out for 5 h at 37°C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a final volume of 25 μl. Peptide mass fingerprints were recorded in reflector positive ion mode (accelerating voltage 20 kV, grid voltage 73%, guide wire 0.002%, delay 200 ns) on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive-Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser using a close external calibration covering the range 750-4000 Da. 1 μl of peptide solutions was mixed with 3 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, and 6 μl of saturated solution of μ-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 30% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. 1.3 μl of this premix was then deposited onto the sample plate and allowed to dry at room temperature. Chemicals—CH2H4folate was a generous gift of Dr. Moser (Eprova). FAD, dUMP, DEPC, and hydroxylamine were purchased from Sigma. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Protein samples were stored in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Protein crystals were grown at 18 °C from a 1:1 μl mixture of 10 mg/ml protein solution with 10% PEG 400, 0.1 m MgCl2, 18% isopropyl alcohol, and 5% PEG MME 550. The best crystals were obtained for the protein incubated with 1 mm FAD before crystallization. For data collection, crystals were transferred to a cryo-solution consisting of 30% PEG 400, 0.1 m MgCl2, 18% isopropyl alcohol, 5% PEG MME 550 and subsequently flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the ID14-EH2 beam line (ESRF, Grenoble, France). These data were processed using XDS package (14Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the P21212 space group with predicted two molecules per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 51%. Molecular replacement was done using the program Molrep (15Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar) and coordinates of the previously solved crystal structure of TSCP (TM0449) from T. maritima (Protein Data Bank code 1kq4 (3Mathews I.I.

In the resulting model, the two monomers of ThyX had an Rfactor of 58.8% for data in the 20 to 4 Å range. However, by applying symmetry operations, the biologically active tetramer previously observed for TM0449 is reconstituted (3Mathews I.I. Deacon A.M. Canaves J.M. McMullan D. Lesley S.A. Agarwalla S. Kuhn P. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that this model is correct. This was further confirmed by automated refinement and rebuilding of the model using the program ARP/wARP (16Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar), which led to automatic construction of 83% of the model and significant improvement of the Rfree. The structure was refined using the program Refmac (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar) and manually rebuilt with Turbo Frodo (18Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar). As some regions were found to adopt different conformations, NCS restraints were not used during refinement. The final model (the intact protein is made of 222 amino acids including the hexahistidine tag) contains residues 1-35, 39-89, and 124-216 for chain A and 1-88 and 125-215 for chain B. In addition, two FAD and 247 water molecules have been built. All these residues are well defined in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map and fall within the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot, as defined by Procheck (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the PBCV-1 ThyX monomer adopts the same hammerhead shark-shaped structure as T. maritima and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ThyX (named MtbThyX) with approximate dimensions 30 × 35 × 70 Å3 (3Mathews I.I. Deacon A.M. Canaves J.M. McMullan D. Lesley S.A. Agarwalla S. Kuhn P. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Sampathkumar P. Turley S. Ulmer J.E. Rhie H.G. Sibley C.H. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1091-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The monomer is made of a central α/β domain consisting of a curved four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β1, β2, β4, and β3) and six helices (α1, α2, α3, α6, α7, and α8) packed against the same face of the sheet. Two additional long α-helices (α4 and α5) form a distinct domain on top of the core. The r.m.s.d. value between PBCV-1 and TmThyX or MtbThyX monomers is 1.5 or 1.95 Å, respectively (values calculated for 160-170 Cα atoms). The differences between these structures reside mainly in small variations in the orientation of the helices that are not in direct contact with the β-sheet of the central core domain (α1, α2, α8, α4, and α5). Although only two PBCV-1 ThyX monomers (chains A and B) are present in the asymmetric unit (r.m.s.d. between these two chains is 0.27 Å for all main chain atoms), a homotetramer similar to the one described previously for TmThyX and MtbThyX can be obtained by applying the space group symmetry operations (Fig. 1B, r.m.s.d. between the tetrameric forms of T. maritima and PBCV-1 ThyX is 3.81 Å for Cα atoms only) (3Mathews I.I.

Turley S. Ulmer J.E. Rhie H.G. Sibley C.H. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1091-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The homotetramer has approximate dimensions of 50 × 60 × 85 Å3. As observed previously, the tetramer is mostly formed by stacking of helices from the core domains as well as by pairwise interaction of the long helices α4 and α5 that are detached from the core domain. FAD Binding Mode—The purified PBCV-1 ThyX protein is characterized by a yellow color, indicating that the oxidized form of the flavin cofactor remains tightly bound to this viral protein during all the purification steps (3Mathews I.I. Deacon A.M. Canaves J.M. McMullan D. Lesley S.A. Agarwalla S. Kuhn P. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Sampathkumar P. Turley S. Ulmer J.E. Rhie H.G. Sibley C.H. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1091-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly to other structures of ThyX proteins, the FAD cofactors lie in large clefts at the interface between the four monomers and adopt an elongated conformation. The FAD molecules are deeply buried because only 15% from each FAD molecule surface remains solvent-accessible. This accessible region corresponds to the isoalloxazine (flavin) ring of the FMN moiety where the redox chemistry takes place. On the opposite side of the FAD cofactor, the ribityl and AMP parts are strongly fixed onto the protein and fully buried. Surprisingly, superposition of the T. maritima and M. tuberculosis structures of flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase ThyX onto the PBCV-1 ThyX-FAD complex shows that the FAD adenosine ring adopts a different conformation in the PBCV-1 enzyme (Fig. 1, C and D). In PBCV-1 ThyX, two adenosine moieties bound to two distinct monomers are stacked together (mean distance of 3.6 Å between adenosine rings) and sandwiched inbetween two histidine rings (His177 from chain A and B′, distances of 4.1 and 3.5 Å, respectively), thus forming a four-layered ring stack. In Tm- and MtbThyX, the corresponding adenosines point away from each other and lie on the side chain from the residue directly following the RHR signature, His98 (MtbThyX) and Ile81 (TmThyX). In PBCV-1 ThyX, the pocket that is equivalent to the Mtb- and TmThyX AMP-binding site is blocked by the side chains from His83 from monomer A and Glu58, Thr171, Arg173, and Asp174 from monomer B. The phosphoribityl binding mode exhibits a high degree of similarity with structures described previously and hence will not be described here. The tricyclic isoalloxazine carries the reactive moiety of FAD. In the absence of bound dUMP, the isoalloxazine ring in PBCV-1 ThyX is solvent-accessible on its si-face, and the re-face packs onto the His53 side chain, involving this residue in hydrophobic packing interactions. In the Mtb- and TmThyX structures, the ring of the corresponding histidine and the isoalloxazine ring are not stacked but bound in a perpendicular direction at the edge of this ring. Comparison of the residues homologous to His53 in these three enzymes shows that in PBCV-1 ThyX, helix α2, which precedes the loop bearing His53, has slipped along the helical axis by about 2.7 Å, resulting in a more buried position for His53 (Fig. 1D). In addition, the isoalloxazine pyrimidine ring makes five hydrogen bonds with residues originating from three different monomers (A, A′, and B′). The interaction of the N-η1 atom from the invariant Arg78 residue (corresponding to the first arginine residue of the RHR sequence motif, characteristic of ThyX proteins) with the O-2 atom of the FAD molecule is of interest from a catalytic point of view. The presence of a largely conserved and positively charged residue near this part of the FAD was suggested to be functionally relevant either in modulating the redox potential of the cofactor or in stabilizing the anionic form of the reduced flavin (21Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The four remaining hydrogen bonds are made by the Ser55 hydroxyl group (monomer B′) with FAD N-1, the Glu86 amide group (monomer A′) with FAD O-2 as well as the Gln85 O-ϵ2, and the Glu86 carbonyl oxygen (both from monomer A′) with FAD N-3 (Fig. 1E). Identification of Functionally Important ThyX Residues Using a Structure-based Sequence Alignment—To identify functionally important ThyX residues, we first performed a structure-based sequence alignment of a diverse set of ThyX proteins (Fig. 2). A number of conserved ThyX residues have been characterized previously using site-directed mutagenesis approaches (7Griffin J. Roshick C. Iliffe-Lee E. McClarty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5456-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Marechal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For instance, in H. pylori ThyX, mutation of the histidine residue equivalent to PBCV-1 ThyX His53 results in no detectable activity, although the protein is folded, as it is still able to bind FAD (11Leduc D.

IRF-8 is restricted in its expression to myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages. It can function both as a transcriptional repressor and an activator, depending on the partners that it interacts with, and it plays crucial roles in myeloid differentiation, generation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (2Tsujimura H.

Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activating protein-1, IRFs, signal transducers and activators of transcription, and nuclear factor-IL-6 (NF-IL-6 or CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β) have been shown to be activated in influenza A virus infection (10Matikainen S.

IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 have been associated with IFN-α/β or IFN-induced gene expression (16Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In addition, IRF-9/p48 functions as a DNA-binding component in a IFN-α/β-activated ISGF3 complex that binds to ISREs in the promoters of IFN-α/β-inducible genes. A study by Lin et al. (17Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) suggests that IRF-3 directly controls RANTES transcription in response to viral infection of human embryonic kidney 293 and Jurkat T cell lines. However, the role of Type II interferon (IFN-γ) in the regulation of RANTES gene transcription was not as well established. An earlier investigation of the transcriptional synergism between IFN-γ and TNFα in activating the RANTES gene in fibroblasts reported cooperation between IFN-γ-activated STAT1α and TNFα-activated NF-κB (18Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). A subsequent study in the NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line showed a synergistic activation of RANTES transcription by TNFα and IFN-γ involving direct binding of IRF-1 to a site in the mouse RANTES promoter at –150 to –138, named ISRE (19Lee A.H. Hong J.H. Seo Y.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In a study of cultured gastric epithelial cells infected with Helicobacter pylori, Kudo et al. (20Kudo T. Lu H. Wu J.Y. Graham D.Y. Casola A. Yamaoka Y. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that maximal H. pylori-induced RANTES gene transcription required the presence of the ISRE, the cyclic AMP-responsive element, NF-IL-6, and two NF-κB sites. Our own recent study further mapped the IFN-γ-inducible ISRE in the mouse RANTES promoter to –147/–143, which was named IRF1-RE (21Liu J. Guan X. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since IRF-8 is another major IRF member that is induced by IFN-γ and a critical transcription factor for myeloid differentiation and activation in response to microbial infection, we questioned its role in the regulation of RANTES gene expression in macrophages. Thus, we undertook the current study to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of IRF-8 in IFN-γ-mediated induction of RANTES gene transcription in mouse macrophages. Mice—Female IRF-8–/– mice and their control littermates (originally obtained from Dr. K. Ozato (National Institutes of Health)) were housed in cages with filter tops in a laminar flow hood and fed food and acid water ad libitum at Weill Medical college of Cornell University Animal Facilities in accordance with the Guide for Laboratory Animal Care by the National Research Council (56National Research CouncilGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Publication 85-23. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1985Google Scholar). These studies were reviewed and approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Medical College. Cells—The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (hereafter referred to as RAW cells) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) with endotoxin levels of <1 ng/ml. Mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages were obtained by lavage 4 days after injection of sterile 3% thioglycollate broth (1 ml intraperitoneally). Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum and standard supplements. Macrophages were plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes (1 × 106 cells/well). After a 2-h incubation to allow for adherence of macrophages, monolayers were washed three times to remove nonadherent cells and incubated with RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum and standard supplements. The next day, IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) were added at different times. Plasmids—Murine RANTES promoter that extended from –979 to +8 was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA extracted from the spleen of wild type C57BL/6 mice as we previous described (21Liu J. Guan X. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Expression vector IRF-8 and control LK440 were previously described (22Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All plasmid DNAs for transfection were prepared with Qiagen Endo-free Maxi-Prep kits (Qiagen Inc. Valencia, CA). Reagents—All antibodies used in this study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant mouse IFN-γ was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA). LPS from Escherichia coli 0217:B8 was purchased from Sigma. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—To determine the level of mouse RANTES mRNA by semiquantitative PCR, cDNA converted from 1 μg of total RNA by gene-specific antisense primer and oligo(dT)12–18 primer was diluted in several concentrations. Diluted cDNA was mixed with a pair of primers (5 μm) derived from mouse RANTES or GAPDH cDNA sequences and PCR master mix (Invitrogen) in a 25-μl volume. PCR cycling was as follows: 4 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 30 s at 72 °C for 1 cycle followed by 30 cycles at 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The PCR primers used were as follows: forward primer (GATGGACATAGAGGACACAACT) and reverse primer (TGGGACGGCAGATCTGAGGG) for mouse RANTES; forward primer (AGAACTCAGCTCTGCCATGAAGTC) and reverse primer (CTAGGCAGGTTTGATCTCCGTTCT) for mouse MIG; forward primer (GATCTACGCAGTGCTTCTTTGCCT) and reverse primer (GACATACCCTGCTTGGTCTGGAAA) for mouse MCP2; forward primer (AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG) and reverse primer (ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA) for mouse GAPDH. Quantitative Real Time PCR—To determine the level of mRNA of mRANTES by quantitative real time PCR, we used a modified protocol (21Liu J. Guan X. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA converted from 1 μg of total RNA was diluted in several concentrations. Diluted cDNA was mixed with a pair of primers (10 μm) derived from mouse RANTES or GAPDH cDNA sequences and SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in a 15-μl volume. PCR cycling was as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C for 1 cycle followed by 40 cycles at 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Supernatants from murine peritoneal macrophage cultures were harvested at 6, 12, and 24 h after IFN-γ and LPS stimulation and stored at –70 °C. Mouse RANTES protein was detected using the DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations were calculated by regression analysis off the standard curve. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts for Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were prepared according to the methods of Schreiber et al. (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Transfection Assay—Transient transfections were performed by electroporation essentially as previously described (24Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Briefly, Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were grown to confluence (106/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with mRANTES promoter-reporter constructs. Cells were collected, washed once with RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/400 μl. 400 μl of cell suspension and 40 μl of DNA (6 μg of RANTES, 6 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase, 10 μg of pBluesriptIIKS+) were placed in 0.45-cm electroporation cuvettes (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad), and electroporation was carried out at 975 microfarads and 300 V. Transfected cells were collected and resuspended to 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum, and chloroquine was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. Cells were placed in wells (2 ml/well) of a 24-well plate and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were treated with recombinant mouse IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml). After a 7-h stimulation, cells were harvested and lysed by Triton. Lysates were used for both luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. EMSA—EMSA and supershifts were performed as described previously (25Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DNA Affinity Binding Assay—DNA affinity binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (25Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, complementary biotinylated oligonucleotides encompassing the murine RANTES IRF-8 response element (IRF-8-RE) site (–99/–67) or the mutant IRF-8-RE were synthesized and annealed. Two micrograms of biotinylated double-stranded DNA were conjugated to 100 μl of streptavidin-bound magnetic beads (Dynabeads, M280; Dynal, Lake Success, NY) in binding/washing buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Conjugated DNA was collected with a magnetic particle concentrator. DNA-conjugated beads were then blocked by 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TGEDN buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m NaCl) at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were washed once by TGEDN buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of TGEDN buffer. Ten microliters of beads conjugated to 2 μg of DNA were equilibrated with TGEDN buffer and incubated with 500 μg of RAW cell nuclear extracts and 20 μg of herring sperm DNA (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed in TGEDN buffer, and bound materials were eluted in 20 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 0.5% SDS and 1 m NaCl. Eluted materials were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-IRF-8 antibody with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW264.7 cells treated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml), LPS, or LPS plus IFN-γ for 4 h. Co-immunoprecipitation—RAW-264.7 cells were activated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 5 h. Then cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclear extract was isolated. The nuclear extract was precleared by adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose and incubating at 4 °C for 1 h on a rocker. Precleared nuclear extract (500 μg) was incubated with 2 μg of anti-IRF-8 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the presence of 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After three washings with phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated complexes were solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer, fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed using a PU.1, IRF-8, or NF-κB c-Rel antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP procedure was performed using an assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and as previously described (26Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The input and immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified by PCR using primers encompassing the IRF-8-RE in the mouse RANTES promoter (5′ primer, GTATTTGGCCAGAGAGGGAGTCAT; 3′ primer, TTTATAGGGAGCCAGGGTAGCAGA). The samples were amplified for 30 cycles and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was performed wherever applicable. S.D. is shown unless otherwise indicated (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). IRF-8-deficient Macrophages Are Impaired in RANTES Protein, and mRNA Expression Is Induced by IFN-γ and LPS—To determine the role of IRF-8 in the induction of RANTES protein and mRNA expression, mouse peritoneal macrophages derived from wild type or IRF-8–/– mice were stimulated with LPS alone, IFN-γ alone, and LPS and IFN-γ together, and cell-free culture supernatants were collected and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for RANTES protein secretion, whereas total RNA was isolated and subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Fig. 1A shows that RANTES protein secretion by IRF-8–/– macrophages stimulated by IFN-γ was almost completely abolished, whereas LPS-stimulated RANTES production was reduced by ∼50% over a 24-h period (Fig. 1B). It is noted that LPS is a much more potent inducer of RANTES secretion by macrophages than IFN-γ. Adding both IFN-γ and LPS to the cells resulted in RANTES production levels that were partially impaired in IRF-8–/– macrophages at 6 and 12 h poststimulation, whereas by 24 h the level of RANTES secretion was restored to the normal level (Fig. 1C). RANTES mRNA expression in response to IFN-γ and LPS stimulation was impaired in IRF-8–/– macrophages compared with the wild type macrophages by RT-PCR (Fig. 1D) or by real time PCR (Fig. 1E). To determine whether the dependence on IRF-8 was specific to RANTES, we examined MCP2 (a CC chemokine like RANTES) and MIG (a CXC chemokine) in the RT-PCR analysis. Fig. 1D shows that MCP2 expression, but not that of MIG, was also impaired in IRF-8–/– macrophages. These results indicate that IRF-8 is a critical transcription factor for RANTES gene expression induced primarily by IFN-γ, and to a lesser extent by LPS, in primary mouse macrophages. The discrepancy between equivalent RANTES mRNA expression induced by IFN-γ and LPS on one hand and much higher levels of RANTES protein secretion induced by LPS on the other suggests that LPS may have posttranscriptional effects on RANTES expression. IRF-8 Increases RANTES Promoter Activation—The above observations suggest that the control of RANTES expression by IFN-γ via IRF-8 is primarily at the level of mRNA synthesis. To investigate further the molecular mechanism whereby IRF-8 regulates RANTES gene transcription in macrophages, transient transfections were carried out in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 with a 979-bp mouse RANTES promoter (21Liu J. Guan X. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), together with an IRF-8 expression vector (22Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Forced IRF-8 expression in RAW264.7 cells dose-dependently induced the RANTES promoter-driven luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2A). Activation of RAW264.7 cells with IFN-γ, LPS, or both in the presence of exogenously introduced IRF-8 strongly enhanced RANTES transcription (Fig. 2B). IRF-8 Can Synergistically Activate the RANTES Promoter with IRF-1—In previously published studies, our group has demonstrated that IRF-8 often acts in synergy with IRF-1 through direct physical interactions to activate the transcription of a number of genes, such as IL-12 p40 and p35 (22Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Liu J. Guan X. Tamura T. Ozato K. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55609-55617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We and others have also identified an IRF-1 response element (IRF1-RE) in the mouse RANTES promoter located at –147 to –143 (19Lee A.H. Hong J.H. Seo Y.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Liu J. Guan X. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining if IRF-8 could act in synergy with IRF-1 through the IRF-1-RE in the RANTES promoter. Wild type RANTES promoter (–979/+8) and the IRF1-RE mutation construct (21Liu J. Guan X. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with IRF-8 and IRF-1 expression vector into the RAW264.7 cells (unstimulated). Fig. 3A shows that the RANTES promoter was synergistically activated by exogenous IRF-8 and IRF-1 in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, this synergy was dependent on the IRF1-RE, because the IRF1-RE mutant construct completely lost its ability to respond to IRF-8 and IRF-1 synergistically while retaining the ability to respond to IRF-8 alone (Fig. 3A). The IRF1-RE is not only important for response to exogenous IRF-1 but also for response to inflammatory stimuli IFN-γ and LPS (Fig. 3B). To determine if IRF-8 and IRF-1 could bind to the same site, EMSA was performed using a DNA probe spanning the IRF1-RE at –147/–143 (Fig. 3C). This assay showed that IRF-1 but not IRF-8 could bind to the IRF1-RE in response to IFN-γ but not to LPS (Fig. 3, D and E). These results demonstrate that IRF-8 can synergistically activate RANTES gene transcription with IRF-1 but not through the IRF1-RE. The NF-κB Element Mediates IRF-8 Response—The observation that the IRF1-RE mutant construct, although having lost its response to IRF-1 alone or to the combination of IRF-1 and IRF-8, could still respond to IRF-8 alone (Fig. 3A) suggested that IRF-8 could independently activate the RANTES promoter via a separate site. To localize this promoter element, designated the IRF-8-RE, we introduced several 5′ deletion constructs of the RANTES promoter from –979 down to –131 and cotransfected these deletion constructs with IRF-8 expression vector in RAW264.7 cells. The response to IRF-8 was similar among all 5′ deletion constructs (data not shown), indicating that the IRF-8-RE must be located downstream of –131. In search of the IRF-8-RE, we first examined the response of the only established promoter element down-stream of –131 of the mouse RANTES promoter (i.e. the NF-κB element at –88/–79) (see sequence in Fig. 4A) (19Lee A.H. Hong J.H. Seo Y.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to IRF-8 by transfecting into RAW264.7 cells the wild type and NF-κB mutant constructs of the RANTES promoter. The NF-κB mutant construct containing a 3-bp substitution at –81 to –79 was far less responsive to stimulation with LPS, IFN-γ, or both as well as showing reduced basal transcription (Fig. 4B). To our surprise, the mutant construct also lost its response to IRF-8 (Fig. 4C), indicating that the NF-κB element is also an IRF-8-RE. To determine if IRF-8 induces RANTES transcription through the NF-κB element by direct or indirect mechanisms, we performed DNA affinity binding assay using wild type and NF-κB mutant oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 4D). Fig. 4E shows that IRF-8 specifically bound to the NF-κB element only in response to both IFN-γ and LPS and not to either stimulus alone or to the mutant probe. IRF-8, NF-κB, and PU.1 Bind to the NF-κB Site and Promote RANTES Transcription—To further dissect the physical characteristics of the IRF-8 effect on RANTES transcription via the NF-κB element, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts isolated from RAW264.7 cells stimulated with IFN-γ, LPS, or IFN-γ plus LPS and the –99/–67 sequence containing the NF-κB site as the probe (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 5A, there were two groups of binding activities formed on the probe. Group I appeared to be inducible by IFN-γ alone slightly (lane 3) but more by LPS (lane 4) or IFN-γ plus LPS (lane 5). Group II binding activities were constitutively present and not affected significantly by the stimuli. Competitive EMSA (Fig. 5B) showed that Group I binding could be efficiently competed off by unlabeled probe itself (lane 7) but not by NF-κB mutant (lane 8). A “supershift” experiment using specific antibodies to various members of the NF-κB family (Fig. 5C) demonstrated that this complex contains predominantly NF-κB p50 (lane 11) and c-Rel (lane 13) and to a lesser extent p65 (lane 12) and not p52 (lane 14). Group II binding appeared similar to PU.1 binding to the human IL-12 p40 promoter at a GGAA motif immediately upstream of the NF-κB site that we previously studied (28Gri G. Savio D. Trinchieri G. Ma X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6431-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is a GGAA sequence at the 5′-end of the NF-κB element (–88/–85) (Fig. 4D). A PU.1-specific antibody strongly retarded/diminished these binding activities (lane 16; Fig. 5D) but not by antibodies directed toward two other members of the PU.1 family, Est1 and Est2 (lanes 17–19). Previous studies have demonstrated that IRF-8 can interact with other transcription factors, including PU.1, to regulate the transcription of target genes (29Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine the functional relationship between IRF-8 and PU.1 with respect to their role in regulating RANTES transcription, we tested the effect of the PU.1 site mutation on the RANTES promoter response to IRF-8. As shown in Fig. 5E, base substitutions at the PU.1 motif within the NF-κB element totally inhibited the promoter activity in response to IRF-8. Furthermore, we co-transfected IRF-8 and a PU.1 dominant negative mutant (30Grazia Cappiello M. Sutterwala F.S. Trinchieri G. Mosser D.M. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4498-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the RANTES promoter-reporter. The PU.1 dominant negative mutant (DNM) completely abolished the effect of IRF-8 (Fig. 5F). Together with the data in Fig. 4, these results strongly suggest that IRF-8, NF-κB, and PU.1 functionally interact with the NF-κB element to promote RANTES transcription. IRF-8 D"
https://openalex.org/W2087984134,"The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) is generally regarded as an antiapoptotic factor. Accordingly, NF-kappaB activation inhibits death ligand-induced apoptosis. In contrast, ultraviolet light B (UVB)-induced apoptosis is not inhibited but even enhanced upon NF-kappaB activation by interleukin-1 (IL-1). This study was performed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this switch of NF-kappaB. Enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis was always associated with increased release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which was dependent on NF-kappaB activation. The same was observed when UVA and cisplatin were used, which like UVB induce base modifications. In contrast, apoptosis caused by DNA strand breaks was not enhanced by IL-1, indicating that the type of DNA damage is critical for switching the effect of NF-kappaB on apoptosis. Surprisingly, activated NF-kappaB induced TNF-alpha mRNA expression in the presence of all DNA damage-inducing agents. However, in the presence of DNA strand breaks, there was no release of the TNF-alpha protein, which is so crucial for enhancing apoptosis. Together, this indicates that induction of DNA damage may have a significant impact on biological effects but it is the type of DNA damage that determines the final outcome. This may have implications for the role of NF-kappaB in carcinogenesis and for the application of NF-kappaB inhibitors in anticancer therapy."

Furthermore, polyamine homeostasis is necessary to cell survival, and its deregulation is involved in relevant processes, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Great efforts have been made to elucidate the nature of polyamine homeostasis, giving rise to relevant information concerning the behavior of the different components of polyamine metabolism, and a great amount of information has been generated. However, a complex regulation at transcriptional, translational, and metabolic levels as well as the strong relationship between polyamines and essential cell processes make it difficult to discriminate the role of polyamine regulation itself from the whole cell response when an experimental approach is given in vivo. To overcome this limitation, a bottom-up approach to model mathematically metabolic pathways could allow us to elucidate the systemic behavior from individual kinetic and molecular properties. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model of polyamine metabolism from kinetic constants and both metabolite and enzyme levels extracted from bibliographic sources. This model captures the tendencies observed in transgenic mice for the so-called key enzymes of polyamine metabolism, ornithine decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermine spermidine N-acetyl transferase. Furthermore, the model shows a relevant role of S-adenosylmethionine and acetyl-CoA availability in polyamine homeostasis, which are not usually considered in systemic experimental studies.

This model captures the tendencies observed in transgenic mice for the so-called key enzymes of polyamine metabolism, ornithine decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermine spermidine N-acetyl transferase. Furthermore, the model shows a relevant role of S-adenosylmethionine and acetyl-CoA availability in polyamine homeostasis, which are not usually considered in systemic experimental studies. During much of the last century, biology was an attempt to reduce biological phenomena to the behavior of molecules. Despite the enormous success of this approach, most biological functions arise from interactions among many components, yielding nonlinear behavior that has been fine tuned by natural selection to achieve specific functional properties (1Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. Nature. 1999; 402: C47-C52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, 2Alberghina L. Chiaradonna F. Vanoni M. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 1322-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of biological functions requires a new systemic perspective. In the last few years, systems biology and synthetic biology have emerged to fulfill this goal (3Kitano H. Foundations of Systems Biology. The MIT press, London, UK2001Crossref Google Scholar, 4Kitano H. Science. 2002; 295: 1662-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3015) Google Scholar, 5Benner S.A. Sismour A.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Systems biology approaches are hypothesis-driven and involve iterative rounds of model building, prediction, experimentation, and model refinement and development (6Kitano H. Nature. 2002; 420: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar, 7Weston A.D. Hood L. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 179-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Computer science development is allowing faster and faster numerical simulations of mathematical models. Interesting and relevant mathematical models of several well known metabolic pathways have been published very recently (8Reed M.C. Nijhout H.F. Sparks R. Ulrich C.M. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 226: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Nijhout H.F. Reed M.C. Budu P. Ulrich C.M. J. Biol.

Far from replacing knowledge acquisition from experimental evidence, mathematical modeling allows to test and define more accurately hypothesis that have to be experimentally tested later. Furthermore, modeling allows to build a comprehensive framework based on a compilation of the experimental data provided by the scientific community. With this philosophy, we propose and study a mathematical model of polyamine metabolism. We will see that polyamine metabolism exhibits some features that, on one hand, make possible the modeling task and, on the other, make modeling an excellent tool to propose novel hypotheses to be tested.Ornithine-derived polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are biogenic low molecular weight organic polycations that are present in all living organisms. They have pleiotropic effects, with a recognized major role as metabolic regulators of the rate and fidelity of macromolecular synthesis, cell proliferation/death balance, and cell differentiation, among others (11Tabor C.W.

J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) have been proposed to explain some of these biological functions. In fact, estimations of noncovalent polyamine binding to macromolecules suggest that only around 10% of total polyamines are free in mammalian cells (23Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that polyamines are involved in the regulation of the expression of certain genes by means of polyamine response elements in their promoters (25Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of polyamines must be maintained within narrow limits, since a decrease of polyamine levels interferes with cell growth, whereas an excess appears to be toxic (27Davis R.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 44: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Coffino P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4421-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In fact, a deregulation of polyamine metabolism is related to different pathologies, such as cancer (16Cohen S.S. A Guide of Polyamines. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar), psoriasis (30Pietila M. Pirinen E. Keskitalo S. Juutinen S. Pasonen-Seppanen S. Keinanen T. Alhonen L. Janne J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and neurode-generative diseases (19Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog.

Polyamine-cancer connections have been extensively studied for decades, pointing to inhibition of polyamine synthesis or activation of polyamine catabolism as a potential cancer chemopreventive strategy (31Gerner E.W. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 32Coffino P. Poznanski A. J. Cell.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Polyamine metabolism in cancer is a good example of a process showing a strong interweaving between interacting genes and metabolites, since specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor are regulators of polyamine metabolism, and polyamine levels affect the rate of cell proliferation (34Kramer D.L.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11026-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Due to the pleiotropic and important roles of polyamines, their metabolism has long been the focus of biochemical studies that have provided extensive and detailed information concerning each of the enzymes and metabolites of the pathway (22Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 38Pegg A.E. Feith D.J. Fong L.Y. Coleman C.S. O'Brien T.G. Shantz L.M. Biochem. Soc.

However, most of this information is very disperse and not integrated in a comprehensive, systemic framework. On the other hand, many therapeutic strategies based on the specific inhibition of one of the key enzymes of polyamine metabolism have failed, mostly due to the presence of compensating mechanisms in polyamine metabolism that contribute to the buffering of those effects elicited when only an enzyme is the target (15Medina M.A. Correa-Fiz F. Rodriguez-Caso C. Sanchez-Jimenez F. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Huang Y. Pledgie A. Casero Jr., R.A. Davidson N.E. Anticancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The structure of the reaction diagram of polyamine metabolism in mammals is relatively complex, consisting of a bi-cycle having two required entrances (ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine) and several alternative exits (Fig. 1). For most of the reactions, both activities and turnover rates of enzymes depend on polyamine concentrations in a nonlinear way. Therefore, the behavior of the full pathway in response to genetic and environmental perturbations cannot be easily deduced from the reaction diagram itself. Nevertheless, if the behavior of the elements of a system is known, they can be assembled in a model to acquire a global knowledge of the system. This is known as a bottom-up approach. In this case, the global behavior of polyamine metabolism taken as a biomodule (1Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. Nature. 1999; 402: C47-C52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) can be investigated with a mathematical model, which describes the reactions and interactions among its components. This will allow us to ascertain whether potential strong modulators of polyamine metabolism are expected to induce relevant effects administered either alone or in combination.In this paper, the first basic mathematical modeling of polyamine metabolism in mammals is described. It is based on available experimental metabolite concentrations and kinetic data. This work is carried out under the philosophy of a modelingtesting recursive operation, in order to obtain the minimal model able to capture the majority of tendencies observed in the literature. By means of this process, starting from the model shown in Fig. 1A (which includes the enzymes and metabolites usually determined in experimental studies concerning polyamine metabolism), we obtained a model that considers the study system shown in Fig. 1B, which includes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) 3The abbreviations used are: SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SSAT, spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase; P, putrescine; D, spermidine; S, spermine; A, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; aD, N-acetylspermidine; aS, N-acetyl-spermine; Antz, antizyme; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; SAMdc, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; SpdS, spermidine synthase; SpmS, spermine synthase; PAO, polyamine oxidase; 5′MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; DFMO, difluoromethylornithine; MGBG, methylglyoxalbis(guanylhidrazone).3The abbreviations used are: SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SSAT, spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase; P, putrescine; D, spermidine; S, spermine; A, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; aD, N-acetylspermidine; aS, N-acetyl-spermine; Antz, antizyme; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; SAMdc, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; SpdS, spermidine synthase; SpmS, spermine synthase; PAO, polyamine oxidase; 5′MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; DFMO, difluoromethylornithine; MGBG, methylglyoxalbis(guanylhidrazone). as a variable and takes into account acetyl-CoA availability. Our model does not, at this stage, include details, such as polyamine and cationic amino acid transport, compartmentalization, and detailed gene expression regulation (22Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 41Childs A.C. Mehta D.J. Gerner E.W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Despite these simplifications, this basic model reproduces and explains many experimental findings. Furthermore, this modeling contributes to and aims at understanding the emergent properties of this nonlinear complex-interconnected biomodule and its responses to genetic and environmental variations.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy System Definition and Mathematical Model Description—We built a mathematical model of mammalian polyamine metabolism (Fig. 1) from metabolite concentrations and enzymic constants (Michaelis constants, inhibitory constants, and activities) derived from relevant published studies carried out by expert groups actively involved in polyamine research. The limits of the system under study were defined by an iterative process of model refinement in order to achieve the simplest model able to capture the more relevant features of polyamine metabolism. We started with a basic model, where we only considered the bi-cyclic central core for the interconversion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, with ornithine and SAM as entries of the system (Fig. 1A). The initial versions of the model consider the enzyme activities and polyamine concentrations usually taken into account and determined in experimental studies. As a result of this iterative modeling process, we propose in this paper an extended version of this study system (Fig. 1B), where entries are through ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and methionine adenosyltransferase. Their respective substrates, ornithine and methionine, were considered parameters in our model. We also took into account the role of acetyl-CoA as a cosubstrate in polyamine acetylation reactions.The study system proposed in Fig. 1B was modeled by taking into account some assumptions. The entries of the model (ornithine, methionine, and acetyl-CoA) were considered as parameters. Putrescine and acetylspermidine were the unique molecular species able to go out of the model. This simplification was done based on studies with cultured cells showing that, indeed, putrescine and acetylspermidine are the major forms of polyamine release (42Wallace H.M. Mackarel A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These releases were modeled by simple, linear equations. Terminal catabolism of putrescine by diamine oxidase was not included in the model, since this activity is unevenly distributed in mammals and terminal catabolism appears to be restricted to selected tissues (43Seiler N. Amino Acids. 2004; 26: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 44Seiler N. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 843-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In any case, due to the nature of the “efflux” in our model, putrescine release can also be considered as a combination of putrescine “efflux” plus terminal catabolism for this diamine. Antizyme, a small regulatory protein regulated by polyamine levels (45Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with a key role in ODC degradation (28Coffino P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4421-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 46Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was included in the model. SAM availability was taken into account by introducing in the model the rate equation assumed in a methionine cycle model published recently (8Reed M.C. Nijhout H.F. Sparks R. Ulrich C.M. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 226: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For acetyl-CoA availability, we assumed a linear interconversion between acetyl-CoA and CoA, taking the acetyl-CoA + CoA pool and the recycling rate R as parameters. This assumption is based on the postulate that, under certain conditions, SSAT inductions can deplete acetyl-CoA levels. Other aspects, such as polyamine and cationic amino acid transport, compartmentalization, and detailed gene expression regulatory features (22Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 41Childs A.C. Mehta D.J. Gerner E.W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), were not included in the model at the present stage.Table 1 gives the rate equations for all of the enzymes included in the model, along with a brief description of their features. For the bisubstrate enzymes spermidine and spermine synthases (SpdS and SpmS), the inhibitory effect of the subproduct 5′-methylthioadenosine (5′MTA) was omitted. We assumed in the model that 5′MTA was virtually zero. This assumption was supported by the fact that 5′MTA is quickly removed by 5′MTA phosphorylase (47Raina A. Hyvonen T. Eloranta T. Voutilainen M. Samejima K. Yamanoha B. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 48Pajula R.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Table 2 gives the differential equations for the different metabolites and other time-dependent variables. More details on relevant features of the enzymes included in the model are given in the supplemental materials.TABLE 1Rate equations for enzymes and processes included in the modelView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Differential equations for the different metabolites and other time-dependent variables included in the modelView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Model Implementation and Initial Conditions—The model was implemented in Perl language (available on the World Wide Web at www.perl.com/). Perl is a multiplatform, free, and easy-to-learn programming language commonly used by bioinformaticians. Furthermore, the use of Perl allows the solution of complex differential equation systems with low computational cost, due to its simplicity and its capability to work without the requirement of a graphic interface. Nonetheless, other programming languages, such as Python, can also be used for implementation of the model. Whatever the programming language used, our program is a script of instructions with the following basic structure: 1) parameter definition; 2) definition of initial conditions for all of the variables; 3) beginning of an iterative loop ((a) calculation of velocities from differential equations providing the current values of variables; (b) updating of the variable values by multiplying velocities by step size; (c) calculation of the current simulation time by multiplying the number of iterations by the step size; (d) collection of variables and time in a file); 4) end of program.Simulations were carried out by the iterative Euler method, with a time increment of 0.01 min/iteration. For numerical simulations of the model, a PC with an AMD-K7 Athlon 1800 XP microprocessor with Linux as the operating system and an Apple Macintosh Powerbook G4 with MacOS X were used interchangeably.Table S1 shows the ranges of values available in literature for the parameters considered in our model as well as our initial choices for the simulations. For those parameters with no available reference in the literature, the values included in the model for simulations were chosen by initial “tuning,” an optimization process to achieve steady states within the physiological range of values for the elements included in the system. Physiological levels of polyamines are found in cultured cells in the submillimolar range, and activities are in the range of μm min−1 (23Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J.

In order to analyze the behavior of these “tuned” parameters in the acquisition of steady states, we carried out additional simulations, changing their values by a factor of 0.1 or 100.On the other hand, since polyamines are distributed among free and noncovalently bound polyamine pools in vivo, we tuned the model to respond to free polyamines, taking the free polyamine/total polyamine ratio as a constant. As previously mentioned, ∼10% of total polyamines (spermine and spermidine) are estimated to be free in living cells according to the literature (23Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In this work, [S] and [D] values (spermine and spermidine in mathematical model notation, respectively) are shown as free polyamine concentrations.Since activities and polyamine levels available in the literature are expressed with respect to the total amount of protein or number of cells, we converted these units to μm min−1 (activities) and μm (metabolites). For these conversions, we took 2 pl as a mean cellular volume, as well as the equivalence of 100 μg of protein contained in 106 cells (55Bogle R.G. Mann G.E. Pearson J.D. Morgan D.M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 284: C776-C783Crossref Google Scholar).In all of the simulations, steady state was considered to be reached when the change of any variable was lower than 10−12 within an interval of 3 h (18,000 iterations).Sensitivity Analysis—Sensitivity analysis determines the relative importance of the different parameters to induce changes in time-dependent variables. From an initial steady state, an infinitesimal change in the value of a parameter is introduced, and the global changes in the system are evaluated after acquiring a new steady state. Detailed information on how this kind of analysis was carried out can be found in the supplemental material.In Silico Simulations of Experiments Representing Gene or Environmental Changes—We focused our studies on inductions and inhibitions of the three enzymes described as rate-limiting of the overall metabolic pathway, namely, ODC, SAMdc, and SSAT (13Urdiales J.L. Medina M.A. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 13: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As detailed in the supplemental material, these three key enzymes and the regulator antizyme have turnover rates that depend on polyamine concentrations, a key feature taken into account in our model. To simulate gene manipulation leading to induction (overexpression), two different approaches were used. We tested the effects of different increases (1–1000-fold) in the values of the respective ks parameters. In other cases, inductions were simulated by direct increase of the respective values of activities in the basal conditions, taking those activities not as time-dependent variables but, on the contrary, as time-independent parameters. Down-regulations of rate-limiting enzyme activities were simulated by up to 10-fold decreases of ks values. We also simulated pharmacological interventions leading to inhibition of ODC and SAMdc by difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and methylglyoxalbis(guanylhidrazone) (MGBG), respectively (22Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). For ODC inhibition with DFMO, its activity was treated as a time-independent parameter and received a value of zero, since DFMO is described as a irreversible inhibitor of ODC (56Pegg A.E. McGovern K.A. Wiest L. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, concerning SAMdc inhibition, the competitive inhibitor MGBG (57Seppanen P. Fagerstrom R. Alhonen-Hongisto L. Elo H. Lumme P. Janne J. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was considered to produce a potent decrease (90%) of activity. To simulate ODC, SAMdc, and SSAT alterations caused by the polyamine analog DENSPM (N1,N11-diethylnorspermidine) at a 1 mm intracellular concentration (58Korhonen V.P. Niiranen K. Halmekyto M.

Glucose transporter null mutants, which are viable as insect form promastigotes but not as amastigotes, do not take up glucose and other hexoses but are still able to synthesize these glycoconjugates and β-mannan, although at reduced levels. Synthesis of these carbohydrate-containing macromolecules could be accounted for by incorporation of non-carbohydrate precursors into carbohydrates by gluconeogenesis. However, the significantly reduced level of the virulence factor β-mannan in the glucose transporter null mutants compared with wild-type parasites may contribute to the non-viability of these null mutants in the disease-causing amastigote stage of the life cycle."

Our data hence underline molecular assembly as a crucial parameter in ABCA1 function and the advantage of native PAGE as analytical tool for intractable membrane proteins. We explored the quaternary structure of ABCA1, a prototype of the A subclass of mammalian ATP binding cassette (ABC) 3The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP binding cassette; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ROI, regions of interest; DM, dodecyl maltopyranoside; PEM, peritoneal elicited macrophage; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3′-(thiotriphosphate). transporters and a key player in reverse cholesterol transport (1.Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Nature. 2005; 438: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane of peripheral cells, namely macrophages, ABCA1 controls the docking of nascent apoproteins and their lipidation, leading to the formation of high density lipoprotein particles. ABCA1 also elicits an outward flip of phosphatidylserine at the plasma membrane (2.Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Whether the flip and docking are concomitant events or follow a hierarchical order is still unknown; however, both are required for the ABCA1-induced cellular effluxes of phospholipids (3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although compelling evidence argues for a direct receptor-ligand interaction between ABCA1 and the apoA-I lipid acceptor, some unusual elements suggest that the lipid environment may contribute significantly to the interaction of the acceptor with the cell surface (4.Nofer J.R. Remaley A.T. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5.Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Chroni A. Mendez A.J. Zannis V.I. Freeman M.W. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this context, an assessment of the quaternary assembly of the transporter may help clarify the issue and, indeed, it has been recently suggested that tetrameric ABCA1 complexes are the minimal functional structure required for lipidation of apoA-I particles (6.Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M. Bouvier M. Krimbou L. Genest J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41529-41536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Understanding the rules of ABCA1 molecular assembly bears an obvious medical interest. In fact, mutations in ABCA1 sequence may lead to Tangier disease, a genetic disorder of lipid metabolism with autosomic recessive transmission, but also to familial high density lipoprotein deficiency, a nosographically distinct syndrome transmitted as a dominant trait (7.Brooks-Wilson A.

The need for oligomerization to achieve complete function may underlie such discrepancy and explain an exquisite sensitivity to mutations in the primary sequence of the transporter. However, it has to be pointed out that the assessment of quaternary structure of full-length ABC transporters has been a controversial issue (10.Rosenberg M.F. Mao Q. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C.

To rule out methodological issues, we developed an analysis of the membrane arrangement of the ABCA1 transporter based on the combined use of multiple approaches, i.e. living cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation, and native PAGE. All of them converge in indicating that ABCA1 at equilibrium is predominantly associated in homodimeric structures, in both ABCA1-expressing cellular systems and transfected cells. In addition, we took advantage of a panel of ABCA1 variants, previously characterized for their functional activity and intracellular trafficking (2.Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar,3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), to demonstrate that transitions from dimers to higher oligomeric forms occur during the ATP catalytic cycle. In conclusion, we provide here the first mechanistic data about the ABCA1 transporter function. Our results introduce the notion of molecular assembly as a parameter in the assessment of ABCA1 physiological function. Whether this is a distinctive feature of ABCA1 or concerns other transporters of the A subclass deserves further investigation. Finally, we propose the use of analytical techniques such as native PAGE as effective alternatives to structural studies with intractable membrane proteins. Plasmids, Cellular Transfections, and Assessments of ABCA1 Function—Plasmids containing ABCA1, either wild type or variants or chimeras with fluorescent proteins, were generated in pBI vector (Clontech, Erembodegem, Belgium) as described previously (3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Shifts from the original plasmids containing EGFP-encoding sequences to ECFP or EYFP sequences were obtained either by subcloning or by PCR-driven incorporation of variant sequences with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were validated by sequencing. Transient transfections were performed on 60% confluent monolayers of HeLa Tet-Off cells with a total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA mixed to EXGEN 500 (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mix was left in contact with cell monolayers for 18 h, and cells were seeded according to experimental needs 24 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency, monitored when appropriate by flow cytometry on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) 24 h after transfection, was consistently at around 40%. In the case of ECFP chimeras, transfection efficiency was monitored visually by confocal microscopy examination. Conventional confocal microscopy was performed by visualization on x, y, and z axes on an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Zeiss LSM 510 scanning module. In the case of multiple simultaneous transfections, the total amount of DNA was kept invariant (5.Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Chroni A. Mendez A.J. Zannis V.I. Freeman M.W. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar μg), and the ratio between the DNA species varied as mentioned. Cells were further analyzed for FRET or biochemical and functional assays at 60 h after transfection. Functional assays for ABCA1 expression, i.e. binding of annexin V and apoA-I, were performed at 60 h after transfection as described previously (21.Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H.

Imaging FRET Measurements—FRET was measured by the method of acceptor photobleaching or donor dequenching (23.Kenworthy A.K. Petranova N. Edidin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 24.Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 25.Karpova T.S.

This method relies on both efficient bleaching of the acceptor (EYFP) and minimal fading of donor fluorescence (ECFP) during image acquisition. FRET assessments were performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 scanning module on an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 25 milliwatt argon/2 laser beam and a polychromatic multichannel detector (META detector) to spectrally resolve emission spectra. ECFP and EYFP were illuminated respectively with the 458 (60% intensity of the acoustico-optical tunable filter) and 514 nm (6% intensity of the AOTF) laser lines. A ×63 oil immersion objective lens was used with a pinhole diameter settled to 1.00 Airy units. To maximize selectivity, four-dimensional stacks were acquired in spectral mode with wavelength series at 10-nm intervals recorded for every time series. EYFP and ECFP images were subsequently reconstituted by linear unmixing of the wavelength series according to the spectra experimentally recorded on cells transfected with either ECFP- or EYFP-bearing constructs. Regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to membrane colocalization of the two fluorochromes were selected visually on images acquired on double-transfected cells. To minimize the time required for bleaching and thus lateral drifting of the samples, 2-3 ROI of similar and regular shape were selected per bleaching step. ROI were bleached at 514 nm (100% at acoustico-optical tunable filter) by 400 reiterations as calibrated previously to efficiently bleach EYFP signal to background levels, without interference at the ECFP emission wavelength. ECFP and EYFP spectra were previously calibrated on cells expressing only ECFP or EYFP chimeras (26.Valentin G. Verheggen C. Piolot T. Neel H. Coppey-Moisan M. Bertrand E. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Bleaching time varied from 150 to 200 s. A set of five images was acquired before and after bleaching in spectral mode and reconstituted by linear unmixing to visually check both bleaching efficiency and stability of the sample. FRET efficiency was calculated according to the formula Ef = Ipost - Ipre × 100/Ipost on numerical values tabulated by the LSM software. Background levels, measured as pixel values outside cells or in the cytoplasmic region, were computed in each experimental set and never exceeded 20% of signal. Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies—A rat monoclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide (Schafer-N, Copenhagen, Denmark) corresponding to residues 215-233 in the mouse ABCA1 sequence (Swiss-Prot entry P41233) was generated by repeated immunization of LOU/c rats with 50 μg of ovalbumin-conjugated peptide. Upon fusion of rat splenocytes with the non-secreting mouse myeloma X63.Ag8.653, hybridomas were selected for reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on Nunc Maxisorp plates coated with both native and ovalbumin-conjugated peptide. Hybridoma 891.3 was selected on the basis of the specific reactivity of its supernatant against the ABCA1 protein assessed by flow cytofluorometry (not shown) and Western blotting (see Fig. 2A). Velocity Gradient Centrifugation—Mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were treated overnight in 300 μm pCPT-cAMP (Sigma, Saint Quentin, France) to induce ABCA1 over-expression as described (27.Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized at 4 °C in 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 1% SDS, 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 0.09% Nonidet P-40 (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France), 1% α-DM (Anatrace, Maumee, OH), or 1% β-DM (Sigma) and supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, protein concentration in the cleared post-nuclear supernatant was determined by the Bradford-based protein assay (Bio-Rad). One ml of supernatant normalized at a protein content of 1 mg/ml was then layered on top of an 11-ml linear, continuous 10-40% or 5-30% sucrose gradient, containing the appropriate detergents, and spun at 260,000 × g for 12 h. At equilibrium, linearity was confirmed by refractometric quantification on blank gradients, whereas for loaded gradients, 24 × 500-μl fractions were collected from the top, resolved by 5.5% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed for reactivity with ABCA1 mAb 891.3 following standard procedures (3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France), and urease (hexamer 545 kDa, trimer, 272 kDa) (Sigma) were diluted in 1 ml of the appropriate detergent buffer and floated as described above. Peak migration of each species was determined by A280 nm measurements of all fractions. Native PAGE Fractionation and Analysis—Monolayers of HeLa cells (60 h after transfection with the indicated plasmid), cAMP-induced RAW 264.7 cells, or thioglycollate peritoneal elicited macrophages (PEM) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline before solubilization in 1% α-DM in 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were then spun at 4 °C at 100 000 × g for 20 min, and protein concentrations in the cleared post-nuclear supernatant were determined. 5-20 μg of proteins were loaded on a Deriphat/PAGE system adapted from Peter and Thornber (28.Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were fractionated on 3-8% polyacrylamide gradient gels overlaid with a 3% stacking gel in 48 mm glycine, 12 mm TrisHCl, pH 8.3. Running buffer contained 12 mm TrisHCl, pH 8.3, and 96 mm glycine. 0.1% Deriphat 160 (Cognis Care Chemicals, St. Fargeau Pthierry, France) was included in the upper reservoir. After electrophoresis at 4 °C at 50 volts for 12 h, proteins were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris HCl, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol. The migration of native protein standards (Amersham Bio-sciences) was analyzed by Ponceau S staining. Membranes were subsequently probed with the 891.3 mAb or anti-GFP mAb (Roche Diagnostics) followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody and revealed by ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric evaluation of the intensity of bands was performed with the software AIDA 2.11 on scanned autoradiographic images. Membrane Vesicle Preparations and Chemical Interference with ATP Hydrolysis—cAMP-treated RAW cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were homogenized with a ball-bearing homogenizer. Collection of membranes was performed according to the procedure described previously (29.Trompier D. Baubichon-Cortay H. Chang X.B. Maitrejean M. Barron D. Riordon J.R. Di Pietro A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2164-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cell homogenate was adjusted to 1 mm EDTA and then diluted 5-fold with 10 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, and 25 mm sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was overlaid on a 35% sucrose cushion in 10 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes at the interface were collected, diluted 5-fold in 10 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, and 250 mm sucrose, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same solution, protein concentration was determined, and membranes were stored in aliquots at 6 μg/μlat -80 °C. For chemical interference assays, 50 μg of membrane vesicles were treated with 40 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, with either 2 mm AMP-PNP or 2mm ATPγS in the presence of 6 mm MgCl2 or with 2 mm ATP in the presence BeFx (2 mm BeSO4 and 10 mm NaF). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and after centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer (1% α-DM, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were then spun at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and protein concentration was determined before loading of samples (2 μg) on native PAGE. ATP and analogues were purchased from Sigma. To remove trace amounts of contaminating ATP, 5 mm AMP-PNP or ATPγS was treated with hexokinase as described previously (30.Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). BeSO4 was from Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland. FRET Analysis of ABCA1 Dimerization—To first assess the existence of ABCA1 supramolecular structures, we used FRET methodology, considering its minimal interference with native membrane architecture. We thus constructed chimeras between ABCA1 and the yellow and cyan variant of EGFP, a pair of acceptor donor fluorochromes particularly appropriate for FRET analysis. Two sets of chimeras were generated possessing the fluorescent moiety either at the N-terminal or at the C-terminal end of the transporter. They will be referred to as YABCA1 or CABCA1 for the N-terminal chimeras and ABCA1Y or ABCA1C for the C-terminal chimeras. Because they are localized in both cases on the cytosolic side of the membrane, the fluorescent graft was not expected to disturb the topological assembly of the transporter. Indeed, all the chimeras were equally expressed (data not shown and Ref. 3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); they were also validated as neutral for both trafficking and function, as assessed, respectively, by confocal microscopy or the ability to elicit binding of apoA-I or annexin V at the surface of transfected cells (data not shown and Ref. 3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). FRET was measured on cells simultaneously transfected with equimolar amounts of pairs of EYFP and ECFP chimeras in different combinations, i.e. C-terminal-tagged pairs, N-terminal-tagged pairs, or a mixture of N- and C-terminal-tagged molecules. Under microscopic visualization, ROI were selected, and transfer of energy was measured as an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the donor ECFP after acceptor photobleaching. A set of five scans was recorded before and after bleaching, and variations in fluorescence intensity were monitored. As a control, the bleaching performed in cells transfected with either ABCA1C or ABCA1Y alone never resulted in a detectable increase in emission at donor wavelength (data not shown). Background values were assessed for each experiment on both cytosolic and extracellular ROI and were considered acceptable if lower than 20% of the fluorescence intensity of the donor or acceptor fluorochrome in a given preparation. As shown in Fig. 1, significant FRET was measured in the cases of simultaneous transfections with both N-tagged pairs and C-tagged pairs and with equimolar mixtures of N and C grafts. In all three combinations, the efficiency of transfer was found to be independent of acceptor density, measured as intensity of EYFP fluorescence (Fig. 1A and not shown). However, the efficiency of transfer was found to be significantly sensitive to the acceptor:donor ratio only in the combination of C pairs (ABCA1C and ABCA1Y, Fig. 1, B-D, and Table 1 for average values of recorded FRET in the different combinations). This validated the transfer as due to the physical proximity rather than random molecular collision and indicated that the contact takes place at the C-terminal extremities of ABCA1. Consequently, this implied that the most likely orientation of the molecular cluster is a “snail-like” structure with a tail-to-tail orientation in the simplest dimeric structure.TABLE 1FRET efficiency measured according to the formula Ef = Ipost - Ipre X 100/IpostA:D ratio < 2.5A:D ratio > 2.5N-ter14.86 ± 1.419.11 ± 1.3YABCA1/CABCA1n = 11n = 17N- and C-ter17.72 ± 2.118.91 ± 2.312CYABCA1/ABCA1 YCn = 11n = 8C-ter11.74 ± 0.8524.00 ± 1.001ABCA1Y/ABCA1Cn = 29n = 21W590S11.79 ± 1.23026.54 ± 1.004W590SY/W590SCn = 12n = 30C1477R13.70 ± 0.729926.50 ± 1.462C1477RY/C1477RCn = 27n = 22ABCA1MM11.83 ± 1.04826.59 ± 1.591ABCA1MMY/ABCA1MMCn = 14n = 15 Open table in a new tab ABCA1 Dimers Exist on Naturally Expressing Cells—To further characterize these supramolecular structures, we turned our attention to the biochemical analysis of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with cAMP, a well established condition for the induction of high expression levels of ABCA1 (27.Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the fractionation by velocity sucrose gradients of cell lysates exposed to detergents of different chemical characteristics. At floating equilibrium, 24 fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting for their reactivity with the 891.3 mAb, specifically recognizing the ABCA1 transporter as shown in Fig. 2A. Upon fractionation on 10-40% sucrose gradients in the presence of the denaturing detergent SDS, most ABCA1 was recovered in fractions 4-6, which thus correspond to the flotation of monomeric forms; however, upon solubilization with non-ionic detergents (from Triton X-100 to Nonidet P-40 and DM), ABCA1 was progressively recovered in fractions corresponding to higher molecular weights (Fig. 2B). To better evaluate the size of ABCA1-containing particles, we performed a 5-30% sucrose gradient and fractionated cell lysates obtained in the presence of either the α or the β isoforms of DM (Fig. 2C). In this latter condition, ABCA1 was recovered in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass >360 kDa as evaluated by the parallel fractionation of native markers. On this basis, we concluded that, in native cells, high molecular forms of the transporter are present and are likely to correspond to dimeric associations in accordance to the previous results based on FRET analysis of transfected cells (Fig. 2, B and C). To further refine these results, we assessed ABCA1 oligomeric structures by native PAGE (Fig. 2D). In cAMP-stimulated RAW cells, ABCA1 was detected as a major band migrating at a molecular mass >440 kDa, consistent with a dimer. In transfected cells, the ABCA1-reactive band migrated at a slightly higher molecular mass, consistent with the presence of the EYFP graft (Fig. 2D, right panel). The dimeric structures in both RAW and transfected cells were confirmed by the resolution at 1% α-DM of a lower band migrating at 250 kDa, thus compatible with a monomer (Fig. 2D and not shown). Altogether, these results confirm that at equilibrium, ABCA1 is predominantly associated in dimeric forms in both cellular systems. Densitometric evaluation indicated that the dimers accounted for 80-90% of the detectable transporter, assuming equivalent reactivity of the antibody. However, in lysates of mouse PEM, a major physiological ABCA1 expression site (31.Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), increased amounts of monomers were detected (Fig. 2D). These accounted for 25-40% of the total ABCA1 signal. Since the amount of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane is higher in cAMP-stimulated RAW cells than in PEM, 4A. Zarubica and D. Trompier, unpublished results. this observation suggests that dimeric association may be influenced by either the intracellular localization of the transporter or its functional state. ABCA1 Variants and Oligomerization—In the aim of identifying the cellular dimerization compartment and the impact of reduced function on the dimerization potential of the transporter, we analyzed by native PAGE the behavior of naturally occurring ABCA1 variants. We selected two sets of variants. The first took advantage of the Q597R and ΔL693 mutations, previously shown to be massively retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (3.Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas the second set comprised mutants that, although correctly expressed and trafficked to the plasma membrane, showed reduced ability to elicit the functional phenotypes associated with ABCA1 expression in transfected cells. The analysis of lysates from cells transfected with EGFP-tagged Q597R or ΔL693 mutants either alone or in combination with wild type ungrafted ABCA1 transporter indicated that three molecular species of dimers are detectable (Fig. 3A). The expected lower form, due to homodimers of the wild type transporter, was exclusively detected by the 891.3 antibody, whereas the higher forms also reacted with the anti-GFP antibody and therefore corresponded to hetero- and homodimeric associations of the EGFP-grafted variant transporters. This indicates that both variants are able to dimerize. However, the simultaneous expression of mutant and wild type forms of ABCA1 did not modify the trafficking behavior of individual forms as shown by the confocal analysis of double-transfected cells (Fig. 3, B and C). This indicated that the dimerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulu"

The biomineralized covering of vertebrate teeth is enamel, a distinctive tissue of ectodermal origin that is collagen-free. In forming enamel, amelogenin is the abundant protein that undergoes self-assembly to contribute to a matrix that guides its own replacement by mineral. Conserved domains in amelogenin suggest their importance to biomineralization. We used gene targeting in mice to replace native amelogenin with one of two engineered amelogenins. Replacement changed enamel organization by altering protein-to-crystallite interactions and crystallite stacking while diminishing the ability of the ameloblast to interact with the matrix. These data demonstrate that ameloblasts must continuously interact with the developing matrix to provide amelogenin-specific protein to protein, protein to mineral, and protein to membrane interactions critical to biomineralization and enamel architecture while suggesting that mutations within conserved amelogenin domains could account for enamel variations preserved in the fossil record.

In mammals mesenchyme-derived bone is the dominant biomineralized tissue and is composed of substituted hydroxyapatite crystals with specific proteins distributed in an abundant collagen network (1Weiner S. Traub W. Wagner H.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 2Landis W.J. Bone (NY). 1995; 16: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 3Landis W.J. Gravit. Space Biol. Bull. 1999; 12: 15-26PubMed Google Scholar). For bone, the mineral composite is dynamic with both the protein and mineral phases being constantly remodeled by cells. A notable exception to such a biomineralization theme is found in enamel, the vertebrate covering of teeth. In teeth, ectoderm-derived ameloblasts synthesize a short-lived, diverse repertoire of proteins that self-assemble to produce a matrix that directs its own replacement by the mineral phase (4Paine M.L. White S.N. Luo W. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Snead M.L. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 273-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 5Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Mature enamel is a bioceramic composed of less than 0.5% protein that is dispersed among the longest hydroxyapatite crystals in the vertebrate body (6Robinson C. Briggs H.D. Atkinson P.J.

Tissue Int. 1984; 36: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Unlike mesenchyme-derived bone, enamel does not contain collagen, does not have the capacity of self-repair, and does not undergo remodeling. Nonetheless, enamel lasts the lifetime of the organism due its unique material properties and remarkable resistance to failure (9White S.N. Luo W. Paine M.L. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Snead M.L. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 10Fong H. White S.N. Paine M.L. Luo W. Snead M.L. Sarikaya M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These properties are due in part to the cell-directed organization of crystallites into bundles called rods. Rods are further woven together during their formation by cell migration to form a unique three-dimensional lattice architecture that resists wear and deformation (9White S.N. Luo W. Paine M.L.

Science. 2005; 307: 1450-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Amelogenin nanospheres appear to control the habit of hydroxyapatite crystallites by directing mineral growth to the ends (c′ axis) of the crystallites by providing the space for crystallites to grow within and by buffering the local environment against protons liberated during mineral deposition (5Simmer J.P.

Res. 2000; 79: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of amelogenin is highly conserved among diverse vertebrate species, suggesting that conserved modular domains impart specific functions during biomineralization (4Paine M.L. White S.N. Luo W. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Snead M.L. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 273-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Simmer J.P. Snead M.L. Robinson C. Kirkham J. Shore R. Dental Enamel.

To clarify the role that two of the conserved amelogenin domains contribute to the matrix that guides enamel biomineralization, we created knock-in mice by inserting an engineered amelogenin cDNA that lacked one of the two highly conserved domains. The resulting animals exhibited significant alteration to the organization of the enamel and to the cells that synthesize and interact with the organic matrix. Compliance with Institutional Review Boards—All DNA manipulations complied with the University of Southern California Institutional Guidelines. The use of vertebrate animals in these studies complied with the University of Southern California Institutional Guidelines. Homologous Knock-in for Engineered Amelogenin—The sequence of the mouse 180-amino acid amelogenin is shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, where the A- or B-domain is underlined for identification. In the case of the A-domain-deleted amelogenin, no other engineering was performed, and in the case of the B-domain-deleted amelogenin, three end-to-end hemagglutinin tags were used to replace the B-domain in order to aid in its subsequent identification. The targeting DNA construct (supplemental Fig. 1B) was engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) by adding either the A-domain- or B-domain-deleted amelogenin cDNA minigene after the second exon followed by the SV-40 poly-A-signal sequence with lox sites flanking either end of the Neo resistance gene. The length of the two homologous arms for the amelogenin genomic DNA, upstream or downstream to the engineered amelogenin-Neo minigene, corresponded to about 6 kbp at the 5′-end and 3.6 kbp at the 3′-end. The upper map depicts the wild type parental state, and the lower map depicts the knock-in state for the engineered amelogenin minigene. The physical positions for the internal or external DNA hybridization probes are shown. The targeting construct was confirmed to nucleotide sequence across each restriction endonuclease junction by DNA sequence determination. Stem Cell Manipulations—The mouse ES cell line 129/RW4 was grown in “knock-out” Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 30 μg/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1× nonessential amino acid, and 1000 units/ml mouse leukemia inhibiting factor (Chemicon) on inactivated mouse primary fibroblast cells. The ES cell medium was changed every day and split every 2 days. 25 μg of the targeting DNA was mixed with 1.1 × 107 ES cells in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 2The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SEM, scanning electron microscopy; TRAP, tyrosine-rich amelogenin peptide; RFP, red fluorescent protein; LAMP-3, lysosomal-membrane-associated glycoprotein 3. and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before electroporation. Electroporation was performed in a 0.4-mm cuvette at 230 V/cm and 500 microfarads with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. After electroporation, 5 × 106 cells with 10 ml of ES cell medium were plated onto 100-mm dishes on top of a layer of feeder cells. Selection was performed 24 h after electroporation by adding 300 μg/ml G418 to the ES cell medium for 7 additional days. Individual G418 resistant cell clones were physically isolated and separated by trypsin digestion. The trypsinized ES cells were cultured in 96-well plates with a feeder cell layer for 3 days. Genomic DNA was recovered from ES cells digested with EcoRI and hybridized with an external probe in Southern blot analysis to identify those cells that had undergone homologous recombination. Two positive knock-in ES cell clones with the A-domain-deleted amelogenin minigene (supplemental Fig. 1C, left panel) and five positive knock-in ES cell clones with the B-domain-deleted amelogenin minigene (supplemental Fig. 1C, right panel) were selected by PCR and confirmed by Southern hybridization. Two positive clones corresponding to the A-domain-deleted knock-in and two positive clones corresponding to the B-domain knock-in were chosen for blastocyst injection after confirming their normal karyotype. Blastocyst injections were performed at the University of California Irvine Transgenic Mouse Facility. Verification of Knock-in Animals—Genomic DNAs from knock-in mice were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization revealed a 6-kbp band corresponding to the wild type state and a 3.6-kbp band corresponding to the homologous recombination state (supplemental Fig. 1D). A colony of animals corresponding to either the ΔA or ΔB knock-in state were maintained in barrier cages and expanded using standard breeding methods until homozygous animals (e.g. ΔA/ΔA and ΔB/ΔB) were achieved. Animals were created, housed, and sacrificed according to a University of Southern California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in full compliance with federal guidelines. Sentinel animals deployed in the vivarium were used to monitor the health status of the colony. Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Amplification— Total RNA from the mandible of newborn knock-in or wild type mice was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a reverse transcription-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according the recommendation of the manufacturer and served as the template for amplification using standard reagents (Qiagen). Sets of oligodeoxynucleotide primers were synthesized and correspond to the nucleotide sequence from the first exon to the sixth exon of the amelogenin gene (NM_009666) and were used to amplify the first strand cDNA. Primers (supplemental Fig. 2A) correspond to the following nucleotide sequence: Primer 1, the first exon forward primer, 5′-ATC AAG CAT CCC TGA GCT TCA GAC; Primer 2, the sixth exon reverse primer, 5′-AAC CAT AGG AAG GAT ACG GC TGC CT; Primer 3, the sixth exon reverse primer, 5′-AGC TCA GGA AGA ATG GGG GAC A. We identified no alternatively spliced products between the knock-in-engineered amelogenin minigene with the endogenous amelogenin expressed by ameloblasts from the ΔA/ΔA and ΔB/ΔB sources. Analysis of Amelogenin Protein—Incisors and molars from 3-day postnatal knock-in or wild type mice were homogenized in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay based on bovine serum albumin as the standard. Equal amounts of total proteins (20 μg) were mixed with 2× loading buffer and size-resolved by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Size-separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) and immunoblotted with anti-amelogenin primary antibody. An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to identify the antibody-antigen complex and a record produced by exposure to radiographic film followed by development in an automated film processor (supplemental Fig. 2B). Expression Levels of Engineered Amelogenin Transcripts— Total RNA was isolated from newborn mouse mandibles using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and recovered by precipitation. Total RNA was resolved by electrophoresis using a 1% denatured agarose gel in the presence of 5% formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran Plus, Schleicher & Schuell). An amelogenin cDNA was used as the hybridization probe and was radioisotope-labeled with Random-Primer-It II kit (Stratagene). The membrane was stripped by emersion in boiling 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) for 15 s and used in a second round of hybridization with a radioisotope-labeled murine β-actin cDNA to permit the signal intensity to be normalized with respect to total RNA loaded per lane. Signal intensity was measured by laser densitometry using a Kodak Image Station 1000 (supplemental Fig. 2C). Real-time PCR Amplification Analysis of Transcript Abundance—The isolation of mouse mandibular RNA and first strand cDNA synthesis was performed as described above. The sequences of primer pairs for amplifying the amelogenin gene and ameloblastin gene are shown below. The forward primer is listed followed by the reverse primer. The primers for amplifying the amelogenin gene were 5′-AGC TTC AGA CAG AAA CTC ACT GAG C and 5′-GGA GGC AGG CAA ACA AAA TCC. The primers for amplifying the ameloblastin gene were 5′-TGG GAG CAC AGT GAA TGT CAG C and 5′-CCA GCT TGT TGA GGA AAT GCC. The primers for amplifying the murine β-actin gene were 5′-GGG AAA TCG TGC GTG ACA TC and 5′-GCG GCA GTG GCC ATC TC. The PCR amplification procedure followed the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Enamel Alteration Observed in Knock-in Amelogenin Replacement Animals—Images of freshly dissected mouse incisors and molars were prepared, and photographic records from the lateral, labial, or occlusal viewing orientations were prepared. Transmission Electron Microscopy—The incisors and molars from 3-4-day-old postnatal mice were fixed in Karnovsky fixative (6% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer) for 2 h. After being washed twice in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 15 min, the specimens were postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer for 1-2 h at 4 °C and dehydrated with ascending concentrations of ethanol. The specimens were placed in gradually increased concentration of epon in propylene oxide medium and embedded in 100% epon. The blocks were placed in a 65 °C oven for 36-48 h. The embedded teeth were sectioned with a glass knife on a MT 2-B ultramicrotome to obtain semiultrathin sections. The blocks were sectioned further, stained with paragon dye, and examined until the tissue blocks reached a site judged suited for examination using a transmission electron microscope. The specimen blocks were transferred to a Reichert-Jung ultramicrotome and sectioned with a diamond knife to cut ultrathin sections for examination. The ultrathin sections (6 nm) were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with an electron microscope at 80 kV. Scanning Electron Microscopy (Fractured Enamel)—The lower incisors from 6-week-old knock-in or wild type mice were carefully dissected from the mandible. The labial surface of the incisors was notched by sawing with a thin diamond wheel across the long axis at sites corresponding to the junction of the secretory and maturing zone of enamel. The notched site was fractured by physical force. The two pieces of the incisor were glued onto a metal stub and coated for 5 min with an intermittent pulse using goldpalladium alloy in Hummer V set with the high voltage control knob at “9” to provide a coating thickness of ∼100 Å. The enamel surface was visualized in a Cambridge 360 scanning electron microscope at the University of Southern California Center for Electron Microscopy. Scanning Electron Microscopy (Forming Enamel)—To visualize the impression of Tomes' processes extending into the forming enamel, the incisors from 3-day postnatal knock-in and wild type mice were carefully dissected from the mandible. The surrounding soft tissue from the teeth and the pulp tissue were physically removed. The teeth were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, and digested with 1% dispase for 2 h. The dispase-digested enamel organs containing the epithelial layers that contribute to the forming enamel were physically removed from the underlying forming enamel. The resulting cell-free enamel matrix was washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature with agitation, fixed with Karnovsky fixative, critical point-dried, and sputter-coated with gold. The surfaces were visualized in a Cambridge 360 scanning electron microscope at the University of Southern California Center for Electron Microscopy. Tissue Preparation for Histology and Immunohistochemistry— Teeth from 3-day-old knock-in ΔA/ΔA, ΔB/ΔB, or wild type mice were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. After dehydration and paraffin embedding following standard procedures, sections 6 μm in thickness were produced and spread onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Alternatively, sections were blocked for nonspecific absorption and treated with a primary antibody such as rabbit anti-ameloblastin antibody, rabbit anti-integrin alpha-6 antibody or monoclonal anti-CD63 antibody. The resulting antigen-antibody complex was detected using an appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody followed with streptavidin-enzyme conjugate, exposed to an appropriate chromagen, and coverslipped with GVA-mount solution, and a photographic record was produced. Protein Coating for Wells and Cell Plating Assay—The recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria, and purified proteins (22Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (0.5 ng/well) or control proteins (negative, 3% bovine serum albumin; positive, 0.1% gelatin) or Emdogain (a commercial preparation of total fetal porcine enamel proteins) (24Hammarstrom L. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 205: 246-260PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hoang A.M. Klebe R.J. Steffensen B. Ryu O.H. Simmer J.P. Cochran D.L. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were coated onto the 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate at 4 °C for overnight and allowed to air-dry at room temperature for 24 h. Cells (2 × 104 per well) were added onto the protein-coated wells in 100 μl/well of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured in 37 °C for 1.5 h. The cultured cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, pH 7.4, to remove unattached cells. The attached cells were released by trypsin and counted with the aid of a hematocytometer. We engineered the mouse amelogenin protein by deleting either of two highly conserved domains within the mouse 180-amino acid amelogenin (M180), an amino-terminal conserved domain defined by residues 1-42 and referred to here as the A-domain or a carboxyl-terminal conserved domain defined by residues 157-173 and referred to here as the B-domain (supplemental Fig. 1A). A targeting vector was constructed (supplemental Fig. 1B) for each of the two engineered amelogenin by inserting the manipulated cDNA just after the second exon in a targeting construct used for homologous recombination at the X-chromosome target in embryonic stem cells. The ES cells were characterized (supplemental Fig. 1C) and used for blastocyst injection to create knock-in animals (supplemental Fig. 1D). We used reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain amplification to detect any alternatively spliced products based on the strong alternative splicing observed for the endogenous amelogenin gene. The presence of alternatively spliced products between the engineered amelogenin and/or with the endogenous amelogenin, if expressed by the ameloblasts of the knock-in mice, would interfere in our interpretation for the phenotype of the knock-in amelogenin replacement mice. No alternatively spliced products were identified (supplemental Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis was used to characterize the amelogenin protein(s) from knock-in and wild type mice (supplemental Fig. 2B) and identified only the appropriate protein(s) expressed from each corresponding genotype. A 21-kDa band corresponding to the A-domain-deleted amelogenin protein lacking 40 amino acids from the amino terminus of amelogenin was found in the ΔA/ΔA mice (supplemental Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). A 26-kDa band corresponds to the wild type M180 amelogenin along with several minor bands corresponding to alternatively spliced are observed (supplemental Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). The 27-kDa protein is expressed from the B-domain-deleted amelogenin protein found in the ΔB/ΔB mice (supplemental Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). The ameloblast cells and the enamel matrix from the teeth of the resulting homozygous-female or hemizygous-male knock-in mice exclusively express the engineered amelogenin transcript (supplemental Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12, respectively) and the engineered protein (supplemental Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6, respectively) with no wild type or alternatively spliced amelogenin contribution to the matrix. Northern blot analysis was used to determine the mRNA expression level for each of the knock-in replacement amelogenin minigenes. The amelogenin messenger RNA expression level from the ΔA/ΔA and ΔB/ΔB mouse teeth was observed to be as robust as the messenger RNA levels observed in wild type mouse enamel (supplemental Fig. 2C). To independently confirm that there was no difference in the transcript abundance between the A-domain-deleted or B-domain-deleted engineered minigene knock-in animals compared with the wild type animal, real time reverse transcription and amplification was performed, and the threshold cycle function was used to establish transcript abundance (supplemental Table 1). We chose ameloblastin gene transcript abundance as an internal standard since ameloblastin is an enamel-specific product that is expressed during the same developmental period as is amelogenin. As an alternative to ameloblastin, we also used β-actin as an internal standard to identify variation in transcript abundance from the knock-in replacement versus the wild type animals. Based upon either the ameloblastin or β-actin internal standard, there was no statistical difference between the abundance of the ΔA or ΔB transcripts compared with the abundance of the wild type amelogenin transcript. These data indicate that each of the two replacement-engineered amelogenin minigene was expressed at levels comparable with the wild type endogenous amelogenin as shown by Northern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. 2C), by real time polymerase chain amplification (supplemental Table 1), and by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. 2B). The finding that the knock-in replacement amelogenin is expressed as robustly as the endogenous amelogenin is consistent with the fact that the engineered replacement amelogenin uses the same transcriptional regulatory elements as does the endogenous amelogenin gene. The teeth created with either of these engineered amelogenin proteins exhibited visible changes to the enamel. The enamel covering the incisor teeth is thinned in both the homozygous A-domain-deleted amelogenin (ΔA/ΔA) and in the homozygous B-domain-deleted amelogenin (ΔB/ΔB) compared with the incisors from wild type animals (supplemental Fig. 3). The incisors from ΔA/ΔA mice fractured during mastication (supplemental Fig. 3, B1), whereas the 6-week molars exhibited a shallow cusp structure (supplemental Fig. 3, B2) compared with wild type mouse molars (supplemental Fig. 3, C1 and C2). The incisors from the ΔB/ΔB animals also are fragile with incisal edge fractures occurring with mastication (supplemental Fig. 3, D1) compared with incisors from wild type animals (supplemental Fig. 3, C1 and C2). The molars from the ΔB/ΔB animals also showed accelerated wear (supplemental Fig. 3, D2). These findings indicate that the enamel from the ΔA/ΔA and ΔB/ΔB animal is more prone to fracture and more easily abraded with mastication than the wild type enamel. Using transmission electron microscopy, we examined the relationship of the enamel protein matrix to the forming mineral crystallites. In wild type enamel, amelogenin protein assembles as 15-20-nm nanospheres aligned along the developing hydroxyapatite crystallites (Fig. 1, B1) (15Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Diekwisch T.G.

Images taken near the secretory end piece of ameloblasts from 4-day postnatal ΔA/ΔA mouse incisors showed an absence of 15-20 nm nanospheres (Fig. 1, A1). Amelogenin lacking the A-domain does not assemble into amelogenin multimers having the shape of nanospheres but, rather, remains monomeric (22Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G.

In addition, we observed numerous but irregularly arranged short-length crystallites in the ΔA/ΔA mouse incisors (Fig. 1, A1) compared with those from the wild type enamel (Fig. 1, B1). The images of enamel from ΔB/ΔB mouse incisors displayed larger nanospheres with heterogeneous diameters aligned along the mis-arranged crystallites (Fig. 1, C1). Enamel architecture was surveyed using fractured cross-sections from 6-week-old mouse incisors observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize the fundamental building blocks of enamel, the enamel rods, and crystallite structures. We observed the enamel deposition of ΔA/ΔA animals (Fig. 1, A2) was reduced in thickness compared with the wild type mouse enamel (Fig. 1, B2), and the ΔA/ΔA enamel lacked an architecture of woven rods of crystallites. The enamel rod reflects the organization of the enamel matrix imposed by a single ameloblast with adjacent rows of ameloblasts weaving their matrix column past one another during development of the matrix. In the case of the enamel from ΔA/ΔA animals, the rod organization is disrupted, with the rod and interrod boundaries features missing (Fig. 1, A3). The enamel from ΔB/ΔB mouse incisors (Fig. 1, C2) was reduced in overall thickness compared with the wild type (Fig. 1, B2). The arrangement and size of enamel rods was also abnormal in the ΔB/ΔB incisor teeth (Fig. 1, C2 and C3), indicating reduced interaction between the ameloblast and its column of matrix, resulting in diminished w"

Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) stimulates differentiation of osteoblasts from pluripotent precursors. Osteoclast formation depends on the concerted action of osteoblast-derived receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). BMP-2 stimulates receptor activator of NF-κB ligand expression. However, the effect of BMP-2 on CSF-1 expression has not been studied. We investigated the role of BMP-2 in CSF-1 expression in osteogenic C2C12 cells. Incubation of C2C12 cells with BMP-2 supported osteoclastogenesis of spleen cells with a concomitant increase in expression of CSF-1 mRNA and protein. To determine the mechanism, we identified a BMP-responsive element between –627 bp and –509 bp in the CSF-1 promoter. DNase I footprint analysis revealed the presence of consensus Smad binding motif in this region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed BMP-2-stimulated binding of proteins to this motif. Mutation of core sequence as well as its 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences abolished the DNA-protein interaction resulting in inhibition of CSF-1 transcription. Supershift analysis detects the presence of Smads 1, 5, and 4 and the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein in the BMP-responsive element-protein complex. In addition, Smads 1 and 5 alone or in combination with Smad 4 increased CSF-1 transcription. Furthermore, CREB-binding protein markedly increased transcription of CSF-1. These data represent the first evidence that BMP-2 increases the osteoclastogenic CSF-1 expression by a transcriptional mechanism using the canonical Smad pathway and provide a mechanism for BMP-2-induced osteoclast differentiation.

Bone formation is a result of the orchestrated action of osteoclast and osteoblast cells. Recombinant BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, and BMP-9 have potential to stimulate the osteoinductive cascade (6.Sakou T. Bone. 1998; 22: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Endochondral bone formation, stimulated by BMP-2, involves differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes followed by cartilage formation, resorption of the cartilaginous structure by chondroclasts or osteoclasts, and finally replacement with osteoblasts to form mature bone (7.Aono A.

This suggests that BMP-2 is involved in osteoclastic bone resorption as much as it is involved in cartilage and bone formation. The role of BMP-2 in cartilage and bone formation is well studied (9.Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A.

Another critical factor for osteoclast development and differentiation is RANKL, also expressed in osteoblast and stromal cells (20.Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar). CSF-1 receptors and receptors for RANKL, namely, RANK, are present in hematopoietic osteoclast progenitors (21.Nakagawa N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Shima N. Yasuda H. Yano K. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 22.Katagiri T. Takahashi N. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Together, soluble RANKL and CSF-1 can induce osteoclast development and differentiation starting from mouse hematopoietic cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even in the absence of osteoblasts and stromal cells (23.Matsuzaki K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yamaguchi K. Yasuda H. Shima N. Morinaga T. Toyama Y. Yabe Y. Higashio K. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These data indicate that CSF-1 and RANKL are the two critical factors in osteoclast development and differentiation that are produced by the osteoblasts. C2C12 is a subclone of the C2 mouse myoblastic line (24.Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C.

Under normal conditions these cells differentiate to form myotubes and produce differentiated muscle proteins. Treatment with recombinant BMP-2 can cause inhibition of muscle protein production in these cells with subsequent formation of differentiated osteoblasts (10.Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). This property of C2C12 cells gives this cell line a unique pluripotent phenotype. We report that BMP-2-treated C2C12 cells stimulate TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast formation by inducing CSF-1 gene expression and secretion. BMPs induce intracellular signal transduction by binding to two types of transmembrane receptors, BMP receptor type I (BMPR I) and type II (BMPR II) (26.Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Three type I and three type II BMP receptors have been described (26.Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K.

Binding of BMP-2 to the BMPR II induces recruitment of BMPR I and its phosphorylation in the GS domain (29.Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). The activated BMPR I then phosphorylates downstream substrates (30.Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Smads are downstream molecules that are activated by BMP-like ligands. They exist as monomers in the absence of ligand stimulation. Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are directly phosphorylated by BMPR I and subsequently associate with common Smad (Co-Smad). Heteromeric complexes then translocate into the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes in association with other nuclear proteins (30.Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). BMPR I activates Smads 1, 5, and 8 (R-Smads), which in turn heterodimerize with Smad 4 (Co-Smad) to transduce BMP-mediated intracellular signals (30.Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Smad binding elements have been identified to contain a consensus sequence CAGACA (CAGA sequences) in the promoters of the genes that are activated by Smad signaling (32.Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). BMPR and their downstream signaling molecules are expressed in osteoclasts, isolated from rabbit long bones, and BMP-2 stimulates the bone-resorbing activity of these osteoclasts (33.Kaneko H. Arakawa T. Mano H. Kaneda T. Ogasawara A. Nakagawa M. Toyama Y. Yabe Y. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. Bone. 2000; 27: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). BMPR I mRNA was found to be expressed in granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor-supported hematopoietic blast cells (34.Kanatani M. Sugimoto T. Kaji H. Kobayashi T. Nishiyama K. Fukase M. Kumegawa M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that bone marrow macrophages and purified mature osteoclasts express BMPRIA (35.Itoh K. Udagawa N. Katagiri T. Iemura S. Ueno N. Yasuda H. Higashio K. Quinn J.M. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Takahashi N. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3656-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). BMP-2 can stimulate parathyroid hormone-induced osteoclast formation, which was inhibited by BMP-2 antagonist noggin (36.Abe E. Yamamoto M. Taguchi Y. Lecka-Czernik B. O'Brien C.A. Economides A.N. Stahl N. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). BMP-2 was found to increase RANKL expression in murine osteoclast cultures and enhance osteoclast formation by interleukin-1α (37.Koide M. Murase Y. Yamato K. Noguchi T. Okahashi N. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). BMP-2 was also reported to increase osteoclast survival and differentiation supported by RANKL but did not stimulate the survival of osteoclasts by itself (35.Itoh K. Udagawa N. Katagiri T. Iemura S. Ueno N. Yasuda H. Higashio K. Quinn J.M. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Takahashi N. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3656-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, BMP-2 did not increase the survival of osteoclasts supported by CSF-1 (35.Itoh K. Udagawa N. Katagiri T. Iemura S. Ueno N. Yasuda H. Higashio K. Quinn J.M. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Takahashi N. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3656-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This suggests that BMP-2 signaling might converge to activate CSF-1 that in turn increases osteoclast differentiation. Thus in the presence of abundant exogenous CSF-1, BMP-2 does not show any additional stimulatory effects on osteoclastogenesis. Our goal for this study was to analyze the role of BMP-2 in CSF-1 gene expression and subsequent osteoclast differentiation. In this report, we show that BMP-2 induces expression of CSF-1 mRNA and protein in the pluripotent C2C12 cells that differentiate into osteoblasts upon BMP-2 stimulation. We identified a BMP-2-responsive element (BRE) in the CSF-1 promoter. We show that upon BMP-2 stimulation CBP associates with BMP-specific Smads. We provide evidence that BRE interacts with BMP-specific Smads and the transcription cofactor CBP to regulate CSF-1 expression. In addition, we show that BMP-2-stimulated C2C12 cells can support multinucleated TRAP-positive osteoclast formation in a coculture system. Taken together, our data provide a molecular mechanism of CSF-1 expression in response to BMP-2 to support osteoclast survival and differentiation. Furthermore, this is the first report of the regulation of CSF-1 production in osteoblasts by BMP-2 during osteoclastogenesis. Also this report unravels the mechanism by which BMP-2 induces CSF-1 transcription. Materials—Recombinant BMP-2 was a gift from Anthony Celeste (Wyeth Research, Cambridge, MA).

Cell Culture—C2C12 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). C2C12 cells undergo osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of BMP-2. The cells were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. For driving osteoblastic differentiation the cells are routinely grown up to 70% confluency and treated with 300 ng/ml recombinant BMP-2 in serum-free DMEM for the indicated periods of time. RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis—RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells cultured in 10-cm tissue culture plates in serum-free DMEM containing 300 ng/ml BMP-2 for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Control cells were cultured for similar time periods in serum-free DMEM without BMP-2 in the culture medium. At the indicated time points the cells were harvested, and RNA was isolated using 5 ml of RNAzol B followed by chloroform extraction and precipitation of RNA with isopropanol (38.Ghosh-Choudhury N.

CSF-1 ELISA Assay—CSF-1 levels in C2C12 cells treated with BMP-2 for 0, 24, 36, and 48 h were assayed using the Quantikine enzyme-linked immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. CSF-1 concentrations were calculated from a standard curve (31.2–2000 pg/ml) using log-log linear regression (39.Abboud S.L. Woodruff K. Liu C. Shen V. Ghosh-Choudhury N.

The DNA fragment spanning a region, –627 to –509 bp, of CSF-1 promoter was cloned into plasmid vector. Purified DNA fragment was end-labeled using [α-32P]ATP. The DNaseI footprinting was carried out as follows: C2C12 or fetal rat calvarial nuclear proteins were allowed to bind the labeled DNA fragment at 25 °C for 15 min in the presence of the binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes/potassium hydroxide (KOH), pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC). The DNaseI treatment was then carried out for 45 s using 5 μl of 1:10,000-fold diluted DNaseI at 25 °C in the presence of 5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2 and 5 μl of 10 mm CaCl2. The DNaseI was immediately inactivated by using 100 μl of stop solution (0.375% SDS, 15 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6) followed by proteinase K digestion and phenolchloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and electrophoresis on a 7% sequencing gel. A DNaseI protection assay (footprint assay) was repeated four times. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—C2C12 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with recombinant BMP-2 for an additional 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. The oligonucleotide probe spanning the BMP-2 response element in CSF-1 promoter was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotide 5′-GGA GGG AGC AAG CCA ATC TGC AAA CCC CGG GTT AAG GGC G-3′ with its complementary strand. The core consensus Smad binding sequence is underlined. The mutant oligonucleotides were designed by (a) mutating the core binding sequence ATC TGC to gga TtC (MT), (b) mutating DNA sequences 3′ to the core binding site CGG GTT to att cGg (3′-MT), and (c) mutating 5′ sequence to the core binding site GGG AGC to ata Atg (5′-MT).

EMSA performed with unlabeled oligonucleotides, antibodies, and mutant oligonucleotides were repeated at least three to five times each with different preparations of nuclear extracts. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Sequential 5′ deletion constructs of CSF-1 promoter driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene were transfected in C2C12 cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent as described previously (40.Ghosh-Choudhury N.

To correct transfection efficiency a cytomegalo-virus promoter-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid was cotransfected in the transient transfection assays. Luciferase activities were assayed using a dual luciferase assay kit. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The BRE sequences were mutated using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotide used for mutating the core CAGA sequences was 5′-GGA GGG AGC AAG CCA gga TtC AAA CCC CGG GTT AAG GGC G-3′. Lowercase letters indicate mutated sequences. The reactions were carried out exactly as directed by the vendor's instruction manual. Coculture Assay for TRAP-positive Multinucleated Osteoclast Formation—Coculture of C2C12 and mouse spleen cells was done as described by Otsuka et al. (43.Otsuka E. Notoya M. Hagiwara H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 73: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, 104 C2C12 cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates in α-minimal essential medium. After 24 h, 106 mouse spleen cells were added per well to C2C12 cells in the presence of 10–8 m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 10–7 m dexamethasone, and 300 ng/ml recombinant human BMP-2 or bovine serum albumin (for vehicle control). Fresh medium was replenished every 2 days. After 6 days adherent cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 5 min and then treated with 1:1 mixture of ethanol and acetone for 1 min. Cultures were then dried and stained for TRAP activity using acid phosphatase kit and Fast Garnet dye (Sigma). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (with three or more nuclei) were photographed using a light microscope (Nikon, Japan). Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—C2C12 cells were stimulated with 300 ng/ml BMP-2 for 24 h or left untreated for control. Cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation buffer as described earlier (44.Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud S.L. Nishimura R. Celeste A. Mahimainathan L. Choudhury G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Supernatants of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody against CBP, and the proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, as described earlier (40.Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud S.L.

Statistical Analysis of Data—To determine the significance of the data we have used analysis of variance following Student-Newman-Keuls comparison. Significance level was considered at a p value of <0.05. BMP-2 Stimulates Osteoclast Differentiation, CSF-1 mRNA Expression, and Protein Secretion—In vitro osteoclast differentiation requires coculturing hematopoietic cells and mouse osteoblast or stromal cells. BMP-2 has been shown to induce osteoblast phenotype in the pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line C2C12 (10.Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). We tested whether C2C12 cells can support osteoclast formation in the presence of BMP-2 by coculturing C2C12 cells and mouse spleen cells in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone with or without BMP-2. C2C12 cells treated with BMP-2 supported TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast formation, whereas only huge myotube formation was detected in the absence of BMP-2 (Fig. 1A). Osteoclast formation essentially depends on production of RANKL and CSF-1 by cocultured osteoblast cells. Recently BMP-2 has been shown to induce RANKL expression in C2C12 cells (43.Otsuka E. Notoya M. Hagiwara H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 73: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study we tested the effect of BMP-2 on CSF-1 gene expression using C2C12 cells as our model system. We examined the effect of BMP-2 on CSF-1 expression. Incubation of C2C12 cells with BMP-2 increased expression of CSF-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To confirm this observation, we tested CSF-1 protein abundance in the conditioned medium of C2C12 cells using an ELISA. Incubation of C2C12 cells with BMP-2 increased secretion of CSF-1 protein in the medium in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). In complete accordance with the mRNA data, CSF-1 protein secretion was optimally increased by 24 h of BMP-2 treatment (3-fold) and remained elevated at 36 and 48 h following BMP-2 treatment. These data provide the first direct evidence that BMP-2 stimulates CSF-1 protein expression in osteoblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2086479733,"Cas is a multidomain signaling protein that resides in focal adhesions. Cas possesses a large central substrate domain containing 15 repeats of the sequence YXXP, which are phosphorylated by Src. The phosphorylation sites are essential for the roles of Cas in cell migration and in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We showed previously that Src catalyzes the multisite phosphorylation of Cas via a processive mechanism. In this study, we created mutant forms of Cas to identify the determinants for processive phosphorylation. Mutants containing single or multiple YXXP mutations were phosphorylated processively by Src, suggesting that individual sites are dispensable. The results also suggest that there is no defined order to the Cas phosphorylation events. We also studied the effects of these mutations by reintroducing Cas into Cas-deficient fibroblasts. Mutants lacking some or all YXXP sites augment the ability of Src to promote anchorage-independent growth. On the other hand, deletion of YXXP sites compromises the ability of Cas to promote tumor cell migration. Cas is a multidomain signaling protein that resides in focal adhesions.

Activated Src does not induce a complete transformed phenotype when expressed in Cas-deficient fibroblasts, indicating a role for Cas in cellular transformation by Src (4Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T.

Recent studies have revealed multiple signaling roles for Cas in normal cells (5Bouton A.H. Riggins R.B. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Chodniewicz D. Klemke R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos lacking Cas die in utero because of the defects in cardiovascular development, disorganization of myofibrils, impaired actin stress fiber association, and growth retardation (4Honda H.

Cas-deficient fibroblasts contain short, disorganized actin filaments, and actin stress fiber organization is restored after ectopic expression of Cas (4Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R.

Cas possesses an N-terminal SH3 2The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; WT, wild type. domain, a large central substrate domain containing 15 repeats of the motif YXXP, and a C-terminal Src binding region (Fig. 1A). The YXXP motifs are substrates for several tyrosine kinases and serve as binding sites for the adapter protein Crk and other SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins (5Bouton A.H. Riggins R.B. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Chodniewicz D. Klemke R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The YXXP motifs of Cas can be divided into YDXP and YQXP motifs (Fig. 1B). The YDXP motifs are important for actin cytoskeleton organization and cell migration (8Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We and others have mapped the sites of Src phosphorylation within the Cas substrate domain (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Shin N.Y. Dise R.S. Schneider-Mergener J. Ritchie M.D. Kilkenny D.M. Hanks S.K. J. Biol.

These phosphorylation sites play an important role in Cas-associated functions such as cell migration and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Multisite phosphorylation can be carried out by two basic mechanisms: (i) a processive mechanism in which the enzyme binds to the substrate and catalyzes all the phosphorylation events before dissociating from the fully phosphorylated product; or (ii) a distributive mechanism in which each phosphorylation is the result of a separate enzyme-substrate binding event. The dual phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by mitogen-activated protein kinases takes place in a two-collision, distributive manner (11Burack W.R. Sturgill T.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bhatt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent kinetic studies on the spliceosomal SR proteins show that they are phosphorylated processively by SR protein-specific Ser/Thr kinases (13Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Src phosphorylates Cas by a processive mechanism in which Src binds to the C-terminal polyproline region of Cas and catalyzes the multiple phosphorylation events (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In many systems, the biological effects of multisite phosphorylation are distinguishable from those of single-site phosphorylation. For example, multisite phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 is important in setting a threshold for the onset of DNA synthesis (15Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The biological significance of processive phosphorylation of the YXXP motifs in Cas remains unclear. Cas mutants lacking the entire substrate domain or the YDXP motifs are defective in cell migration (8Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In cells transformed by oncogenic Src, the YXXP motifs are important for invasiveness and formation of podosome structures (17Brabek J. Constancio S.S. Shin N.Y. Pozzi A. Weaver A.M. Hanks S.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7406-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Brabek J. Constancio S.S. Siesser P.F. Shin N.Y. Pozzi A. Hanks S.K. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38331-38337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Cas variants containing single or double tyrosine mutations promote cell migration at levels comparable with wild-type Cas, whereas mutants containing as few as 6 tyrosines retain some activity. Previous work from our laboratory highlighted the importance of a particular tyrosine in the substrate domain (Tyr253) in migration of Src-transformed cells (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was not clear, however, whether this single site would be sufficient for migration. In this study, we carried out mutational experiments to identify the determinants for processive phosphorylation of Cas by Src. We also studied the effects of these mutations on cell migration and anchorage-independent growth in Src-transformed cells. Results from these studies suggest that no single YXXP site is essential to subsequent phosphorylation of other sites. Mutant forms of Cas lacking multiple sites are also phosphorylated processively by Src. In addition, we show that Cas augments the ability of Src to promote anchorage-independent growth, regardless of whether Cas is phosphorylated. In contrast to nonanchored growth, Cas must be phosphorylated on at least 6 tyrosine residues by Src to promote tumor cell migration. Antibodies—Anti-Cas monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal antibody against avian pp60v-Src kinase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mutagenesis of Cas—Cas mutants were produced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A baculovirus transfer vector encoding wild-type Cas (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Mutagenic primers contained 25–45 nucleotides, and the annealing temperature was 55 °C. Multisite mutants were obtained by mutagenizing 1 tyrosine at a time in the template. Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations were verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI 373 automated DNA sequencer. The following tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine 3CasF7, CasF12, and CasF17 refer to mutants lacking 7, 12, and 17 Tyr residues, respectively. ,: for CasF7, Tyr119, Tyr196, Tyr253, Tyr291, Tyr310, Tyr366, and Tyr414; for CasF12, the 7 tyrosines of CasF7 plus Tyr132, Tyr169, Tyr183, Tyr657, and Tyr668; and for CasF17, the 12 tyrosines of CasF12 plus Tyr238, Tyr271, Tyr331, Tyr376, and Tyr391. Cas and Src Production in Sf9 Cells—N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged v-Src and Cas were expressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) as described (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in Excel 401 (JRH Biosciences) in the presence of 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Invitrogen). Approximately 500–600 ml of cells at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 plaque-forming units/cell for a period of 72 h. The cells were centrifuged and stored at –70 °C until needed. Wild-type and mutant forms of Cas were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as described previously (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All purified proteins were stored at –20 °C. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For experiments in which the total phosphorylation of Cas was monitored, Cas was incubated in the presence of 50 nm v-Src at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm MgCl2, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were started by the addition of 0.1 mm unlabeled ATP plus [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi), and aliquots were withdrawn at various time points. The reactions were stopped by mixing with Laemmli buffer and boiling and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To quantitate [γ-32P]ATP incorporation, the gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare), and the band intensity was quantitated using ImageQuant software. For pulse-chase assays in which the concentration of v-Src was varied, 2 μm Cas (wild-type or mutants) was incubated with 800 nm v-Src in kinase assay buffer in the presence of 0.1 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 3 min on ice. To analyze the pulse reaction, an aliquot was removed and stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and boiling. Additional aliquots of the reaction were removed and diluted into four separate tubes containing kinase buffer and 0.5 mm unlabeled ATP to give final enzyme concentrations of 100, 200, 400, and 600 nm. These chase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for an additional 25 min. The reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and boiling. Equal amounts of Cas from each reaction were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To determine the stoichiometry of 32P incorporation, 1 μm Cas (wild-type or mutant) was incubated with 200 nm v-Src in kinase assay buffer at 30 °C. Reactions were started by the addition of 0.1 mm unlabeled ATP plus [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi), and aliquots were withdrawn at various time points. The reactions were stopped by mixing with Laemmli buffer and boiling and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Bands were excised from the gel and dissolved in H2O2, and 32P incorporation was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Stable Expression of Cas and Src in Mammalian Cells—The BamHI/NotI fragments encoding WT Cas or mutant Cas were excised from pFastBac HTb and subcloned into the BamHI/SnaBI sites of pBABEhygro (19Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). v-Src was expressed using the vector pBABEpuro (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y.

Fibroblasts from homozygous null Cas knock-out cells were used as described previously (4Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M.

Cas knock-out cells were transfected with equal concentrations of both plasmids (1 μg/well, 6-well plate). For controls, cells were transfected with empty vectors (pBABEhygro and/or pBABEpuro) as appropriate, and all the transfectants were selected for hygromycin resistance and puromycin resistance conferred by the transfection vectors. Clones were not taken from the resultant stable cells to avoid the potential consequences of clonal variation. Western Blot Analysis of Mammalian Cells—Western blot analysis was performed on Cas-deficient cells grown for 72 h after plating. Briefly, cells were quickly aspirated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mg/liter aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4) at 4°C for 45 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay. Lysates (30 μg) were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated with anti-Cas primary antibody overnight followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detected by ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Growth Assays—Cas-deficient fibroblasts were analyzed by methods described previously (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 100% humidity. All comparisons were done in parallel to avoid any changes in culture conditions between experiments. To examine anchored growth, 20,000 cells were seeded at 1 ml/well in tissue culture-treated 12-well cluster plates (Falcon). To measure nonanchored growth, 20,000 cells were seeded in ultra low attachment 24-well cluster plates (Corning). Cell numbers were obtained by Coulter counter. To measure cell migration, 200,000 cells were plated in 6-well cluster plates on cell culture inserts with a 3- or 8-μm pore size (Transwell-Clear, Costar) and grown for 72 or 24 h, respectively. Cells were then released separately from the top of the membrane, the bottom of the membrane, and the well beneath the membrane. Migration was then quantitated as the percent of cells found in the well over the total cell number. Single-site Mutants of Cas Are Phosphorylated by Src—We first tested whether selected substrate motifs in Cas play a critical role in directing Src phosphorylation. Based on our previous synthetic peptide studies, we selected 4 tyrosine residues in the substrate domain of Cas for analysis: Tyr253, Tyr310, Tyr366, and Tyr414. Synthetic peptide substrates modeled on these four sites showed the highest values of kcat/Km for Src phosphorylation of the peptides tested (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We expressed and purified wild-type Cas as well as Cas mutants containing Tyr to Phe substitutions at these four sites. To study the effect of these single-site mutations on Cas phosphorylation by Src, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using purified v-Src and [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylation rates of WT Cas and the single-site mutants were comparable as determined by densitometry (Fig. 2). These results show that of the residues tested, no single site is crucial for in vitro phosphorylation of Cas by Src. Src Phosphorylates Multisite Mutants of Cas in a Processive Manner—We generated three multisite mutants of Cas with multiple tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions: CasF7, CasF12, and CasF17 (Fig. 1B). In CasF7, we mutated 7 tyrosine residues that were phosphorylated efficiently by Src in the context of synthetic peptides (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In CasF12, we mutated 7 tyrosines of CasF7, an additional 3 tyrosine residues in the substrate domain of Cas that were mapped by mass spectrometry (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the C terminus of Cas. In CasF17, we mutated 12 tyrosines of CasF12 plus an additional 5 tyrosines in the substrate domain of Cas. Thus, in CasF17, all the YXXP tyrosines of the substrate domain were eliminated. We carried out in vitro kinase reactions with purified Src and Cas proteins. We removed aliquots of the reactions at different time points and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. As we reported previously (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), multisite phosphorylation of wild-type Cas produces a large shift in its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3). The single discrete band is consistent with a processive mechanism because no partially phosphorylated forms are observed. Src phosphorylation of the multisite mutants CasF7 and CasF12 also produced a shift in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3). The shift was not as large as for WT Cas, presumably because of the lower number of phosphorylation sites present in these mutants. The shifted bands for CasF7 and CasF12 remained sharp. We did not observe significant phosphorylation of CasF17 in this experiment (Fig. 3A) or in experiments with [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). We analyzed the overall phosphorylation rates of WT Cas, CasF7, and CasF12 by in vitro kinase assays using [γ-32P]ATP. A characteristic of processive phosphorylation is that the production of fully phosphorylated product follows classical Michaelian kinetics. In contrast, for a nonprocessive mechanism, increasing the concentration of substrate results in decreased accumulation of fully phosphorylated product (11Burack W.R. Sturgill T.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bhatt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This characteristic of nonprocessive reactions is because of the competition between unphosphorylated substrate and partially phosphorylated substrates each time the substrate and enzyme dissociate. We carried out the reactions at five different concentrations of Cas (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 4 μm). We removed aliquots of the reaction at different time points and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To quantitate 32P incorporation, the gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). As we reported previously (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), higher concentrations of WT Cas result in increased accumulation of phosphorylated Cas, consistent with a processive mechanism (Fig. 4). To ensure that the reaction had gone to completion, we carried out stoichiometry measurements using 1 μm Cas. 32P-Labeled Cas was excised from the gel, solubilized, and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter. These experiments gave a stoichiometry of 15.1 ± 1.9 mol of phosphate/mol of protein for wild-type Cas, indicating that most of the 17 sites were phosphorylated in this experiment. We also observed an increase in the accumulation of phosphorylated CasF7 and CasF12 with increasing substrate concentrations (Fig. 5). Stoichiometry measurements for CasF7 and CasF12 were 6.1 ± 1.9 and 4.7 ± 0.9 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, respectively. The dependence of product formation on Cas concentration in these experiments suggests that the multisite mutants CasF7 and CasF12 are phosphorylated processively by Src.FIGURE 5Kinetics of mutant Cas phosphorylation at different substrate concentrations. A, CasF7 was incubated in the presence of 50 nm v-Src at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer. Reactions were started by the addition of 100 μm unlabeled ATP plus [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi). Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, incorporation of 32P into Cas was measured by exposing the dried gels to a PhosphorImager screen and quantifying the band intensity using ImageQuant software. A graph of velocity (PhosphorImager units/min) versus substrate concentration is shown. The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression analysis. C, CasF12 phosphorylation reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above in A. D, CasF12 phosphorylation was quantified by PhosphorImager as shown in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We carried out similar experiments with varying concentrations of Src. Because the enzyme and substrate remain bound during the multiple phosphorylation events in a processive mechanism, the rate of progression from an intermediate phosphorylated form to the fully phosphorylated product is independent of the enzyme concentration. In contrast, for a nonprocessive mechanism in which each phosphorylation depends on enzyme-substrate binding, the rate of progression depends on enzyme concentration. We performed pulse-chase assays in which the chase reactions contained different concentrations of Src. We first incubated Src (800 nm) and WT Cas, CasF7, or CasF12 (2 μm) with 0.1 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 3 min (pulse) and then diluted the reaction to yield final Src concentrations ranging from 100 to 600 nm. The dilutions contained an excess of unlabeled ATP (0.5 mm final) to reduce the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP to levels that were undetectable in our assay. Our results showed comparable shifts in electrophoretic mobility at different concentrations of Src for WT Cas, CasF7, and CasF12 (Fig. 6). Time courses at 100 and 600 nm Src showed similar rates of phosphorylation (Fig. 6). This lack of dependence on Src concentration was consistent with a processive mechanism. In addition, phosphorylated Cas migrated as a single band in each case. Nonprocessive phosphorylation produces diffuse bands because of the formation of partially phosphorylated products, which migrate at various molecular weights (14Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that even in the case of a mutant lacking 12 phosphorylation sites (CasF12), Src bound Cas once and completely phosphorylated the remaining sites before dissociating. Add-back Mutants of Cas Are Phosphorylated—To test whether a threshold number of tyrosines are required for Src to phosphorylate the substrate domain of Cas, we generated two “add-back” mutants. As noted above, the YXXP motifs in the substrate domain of Cas can be divided into YDXP and YQXP motifs. Our previous synthetic peptide data show that a substrate with the Tyr253 sequence has the highest value of kcat/Km for Src phosphorylation among the YDXP motifs, whereas a Tyr196 peptide has the highest kcat/Km among the YQXP motifs (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We also reported that Tyr253 plays a critical role in the migration of Src transformed cells (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reintroduced Tyr253 alone or together with Tyr196 into CasF17 to generate the CasF17-Tyr253 and CasF17-Tyr253/Tyr196 mutants. We carried out in vitro kinase assays using purified Src, Cas (WT and mutants), and [γ-32P]ATP. The results show that Src is able to phosphorylate the add-back mutants (Fig. 7). The phosphorylation levels are clearly lower than for WT Cas, and there is no shift in electrophoretic mobility for the mutants. Nonetheless, the results show that Src can gain access to individual tyrosines in the middle of the substrate region of Cas, even in the absence of surrounding sites. Cas Phosphorylation Sites Are Dispensable for Src-mediated Anchorage-independent Growth—We tested the ability of wild-type and mutant forms of Cas to promote growth of fibroblasts derived from Cas-deficient mice. We produced cell lines stably expressing wild-type Cas and the following Cas mutants in the presence or absence of v-Src: CasF7, CasF12, CasF17, and CasF17-Tyr253 (Fig. 8). For comparison, we included a single-site mutant (Cas Y253F) in our study. As we observed previously (9Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), Cas did not affect the anchored growth rates of Src-transformed or -nontransformed cells (data not shown). Anchorage-independent growth is a reliable hallmark of most tumor cells (22Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3820) Google Scholar, 23Goldberg G.S.

https://openalex.org/W1972810184,"Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in the membranes of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of severe human malaria. The synthesis of this phospholipid occurs via two routes, the CDP-choline pathway, which uses host choline as a precursor, and the plant-like serine decarboxylase-phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (SDPM) pathway, which uses host serine as a precursor. Although various components of these pathways have been identified, their cellular locations remain unknown. We have previously reported the identification and characterization of the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase, Pfpmt, of P. falciparum and shown that it plays a critical role in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine via the SDPM pathway. Here we provide the first evidence that the transmethylation step of the SDPM pathway occurs in the parasite Golgi apparatus. We show that the level of Pfpmt protein in the infected erythrocyte is regulated in a stage-specific fashion, with high levels detected during the trophozoite stage at the peak of parasite membrane biogenesis. Confocal microscopy revealed that Pfpmt is not cytoplasmic. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Pfpmt localizes to membrane structures that extend from the nuclear membrane but that it only partially co-localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP. Using transgenic parasites expressing green fluorescent protein targeted to different cellular compartments, a complete co-localization was detected with Rab6, a marker of the Golgi apparatus. Together these studies provide the first evidence that the transmethylation step of the SDPM pathway of P. falciparum occurs in the Golgi apparatus and indicate an important role for this organelle in parasite membrane biogenesis.

Malaria, the world's most important parasitic disease, is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. More than 300 million clinical cases and more than 2 million deaths are reported each year with most deaths mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum (1World Health OrganizationWorld Health Organ. Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892: i-v, 1-74PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other human pathogens that invade metabolically active host cells, P. falciparum invades mature erythrocytes that lack internal organelles and the metabolic pathways necessary for de novo lipid synthesis. During its intraerythrocytic life cycle, P. falciparum undergoes major metabolic and morphological changes and then divides asexually to produce up to 36 new daughter parasites (2Krishna S. BMJ. 1997; 315: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This rapid growth and multiplication requires active synthesis of new membranes and is fueled by lipid precursors derived from the host. Phosphatidylcholine is the major phospholipid in P. falciparum membranes, representing 50% of parasite phospholipids (for review, see Ref. 3Vial H.J. Ben Mamoun C. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2005: 327-352Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies demonstrated that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis is deleterious to parasite intraerythrocytic growth and multiplication, emphasizing the importance of the phospholipid metabolic pathways as possible targets for development of new antimalarial drugs (4Ancelin M.L.

Recent studies in P. falciparum identified two pathways of biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine; the CDP-choline and the serine decarboxylase-phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (SDPM) 2The abbreviations used are: SDPM, serine decarboxylation-phosphoethanolamine methylation; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PfEF-1α, P. falciparum elongation factor-1α; Pfpmt, P. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RBC, red blood cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: SDPM, serine decarboxylation-phosphoethanolamine methylation; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PfEF-1α, P. falciparum elongation factor-1α; Pfpmt, P. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RBC, red blood cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.pathways (for review, see Ref. 3Vial H.J. Ben Mamoun C. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2005: 327-352Google Scholar). The de novo CDP-choline (Kennedy) pathway uses host choline as a precursor. Choline is first transported into the parasite cytoplasm via host and parasite-specific transporters and is subsequently phosphorylated by a parasite-specific choline kinase into phosphocholine. The phosphocholine formed is then converted into CDP-choline by a CDP-choline cytidylyltransferase. The resulting CDP-choline is further converted into phosphatidylcholine by a parasite-encoded CDP-diacylglycerol-choline phosphotransferase. The SDPM pathway initiates from host serine and consists of five enzymes (8Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Three of these enzymes, ethanolamine kinase, CTP:phosphocholine/phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, and choline phosphotransferase are components of the Kennedy pathways. The other two enzymes, serine decarboxylase and phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase, generate phosphocholine, which then serves as a precursor for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase gene, PfPMT, encoding this activity has recently been cloned, and the corresponding enzyme consists of a 266-amino acid polypeptide that lacks transmembrane regions, contains an S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding domain, and is homologous to plant phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase enzymes (11Charron J.B. Breton G. Danyluk J. Muzac I. Ibrahim R.K. Sarhan F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unlike plant phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase orthologs, which display a bipartite structure with two S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent catalytic domains, Pfpmt is a monomeric enzyme that possesses a single catalytic domain responsible for the three-step methylation of phosphoethanolamine to form phosphocholine (8Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of this enzyme was demonstrated biochemically in vitro and genetically using yeast as a surrogate system (13Pessi G. Choi J.Y. Reynolds J.M. Voelker D.R. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12461-12466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although most genes encoding enzymes of the CDP-choline and SDPM pathways have been identified in P. falciparum, nothing is known about the cellular location of the enzymes and pathways. Here we report the characterization and cellular localization of Pfpmt. We show that the transmethylation step of the SDPM pathway occurs in the Golgi apparatus. These studies provide the first cell biological evidence that the transmethylation step of the SDPM pathway of P. falciparum occurs in the Golgi apparatus and indicate an important role for this organelle in parasite membrane biogenesis. Parasite Strains and Culture—The P. falciparum transgenic strains used in this study were derived from the 3D7 clone (The Netherlands) and are described in Table 1. Parasites were propagated in human RBCs at 2% hematocrit by the method of Trager and Jensen (14Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6040) Google Scholar) except that the serum component in the culture medium was replaced with 0.5% Albumax (Invitrogen).TABLE 1Wild-type and transgenic P. falciparum strains used in this studyStrainGenetic make-upExpressed fusion proteinFusion protein target3D7Wild-typeNoneNone3D7-Pfpmt-GFPTransgenicPfpmt-GFPGolgi3D7-GFPTransgenicGFPCytosol3D7-BiP-GFP-SDELTransgenicGFP-SDELaGreen fluorescence protein fused to the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal ER retention motif of the P. falciparum BiP protein.ER3D7-Rab6-GFPTransgenicRab6-GFPGolgia Green fluorescence protein fused to the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal ER retention motif of the P. falciparum BiP protein.

The fragment was ligated at the XhoI/AvrII sites to create a fusion to GFP cloned in the pHC1-ACP-GFP vector (15Foth B.J. Ralph S.A. Tonkin C.J. Struck N.S. Fraunholz M. Roos D.S. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Science. 2003; 299: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid contains PfPMT-GFP fusion under the regulatory control of the P. falciparum CAM1 promoter and HSP86 terminator sequences and harbors the Toxoplasma gondii DHFR-TS marker that confers resistance to pyrimethamine. To generate cassettes for the expression of GFP-tagged proteins for localization studies, we utilized the Gateway MultiSite™ system to recombine three elements (promoter, gene of interest, and reporter) from pENTR vectors in a desired order and orientation within a destination vector. The destination vector, pCHDR-3/4, and the pENTR vectors, PfHSP86 5′-pENTR-4/1 (as promoter clone bearing HSP86 5′ promoter), BiP(s)-pENTR-1/2 (as gene clone bearing the BiP signal peptide), and GFP-pENTR-2/3 and GFP-SDEL-pENTR-2/3 (as reporter clones carrying the GFP and fused GFP-SDEL, respectively), used in this study were generated by van Dooren et al. (16van Dooren G.G. Marti M. Tonkin C.J. Stimmler L.M. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum RAB6 gene was cloned into the commercially available pENTR-D/TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using a topoisomerase I-based reaction. The open reading frame of RAB6 was amplified from total cDNA using the forward primer, 5′-CACCCAAGATTCATGTATGATACCTTTGATAATAATTACC-3′ (with added CACC for directional cloning in bold and added 8 bp upstream of the start codon underlined), and reverse primer, 5′-ACATAAACATTTACTTAACATATTTTTGTCA-3′ (with the stop codon deleted). The PCR product was phenol-extracted and cloned into the pENTR-D/TOPO vector following the manufacturer's instructions to generate Rab6-pENTR-1/2 gene clone. To create the final expression vectors, LR reactions were performed in a mixture containing the pCHDR-3/4 destination vector harboring the hDHFR-positive selectable marker, which confers resistance to WR99210 (17Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and pENTR vectors (promoter clone (HSP86 promoter), gene clone (RAB6, BIP) and a reporter clone (GFP, GFP-SDEL)) in the presence of a recombination enzyme mix following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfection of P. falciparum—The 3D7 strain of P. falciparum cultured in human RBCs was used for transfection studies. About 100 μg of the respective expression plasmid DNA in 400 μl of electroporation buffer was mixed with 100 μl of packed RBCs in a 0.2-cm cuvette. Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulse II (Bio-Rad) set at 0.31 kV and 950 microfarads (18Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were cultured in Petri dishes for 48 h without drug selection, and thereafter the drug was introduced into the culture medium at 5 and 100 nm final concentrations, respectively, for WR99210 and pyrimethamine. Drug-resistant fluorescent parasites were established after 21 days. Antibody Production—Purification of recombinant Pfpmt was done as previously described (8Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The eluate of the His-tagged Pfpmt, purified by nickel affinity chromatography, was dialyzed in 50 mm NaHCO3 buffer. The dialyzed protein was incubated with Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 2 h with shaking. The slurry was washed with PBS and glycine (1 m, pH 12) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Crude anti-serum from the second bleeding of a rabbit injected with two Pfpmt peptides, NH2-(GC)LDDGWSRKIKDSKRKMQR-COOH and NH2-(GC)SSGGLEATKKILSDIELN-COOH, was added to the mixture and shaken overnight at 4 °C. The antibodies were purified by column chromatography against recombinant Pfpmt and eluted with 0.1 m glycine. The eluate was collected in 1-ml fractions and neutralized with 150 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 6.8. Immunoblots were performed with the affinity-purified recombinant Pfpmt, and the column-purified antibody to ascertain antibody specificity. Immunoblotting—To determine the specificity of the anti-Pfpmt antibodies for the endogenously expressed Pfpmt protein in P. falciparum, asynchronous cultures of 3D7 wild-type parasites and transgenic 3D7 parasites, expressing a Pfpmt-GFP fusion protein, were treated with 0.15% saponin. The released parasites were washed in PBS and sonicated, and the soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation. The fraction was mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Equal volumes of the samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blocked blots were incubated with the rabbit anti-Pfpmt antibody (1:50 dilution) or with rabbit pre-immune sera (1:50 dilution) as primary antibodies and then with conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000) as the secondary antibody. Signal generation was performed using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The same blot was stripped and re-probed with the P. falciparum elongation factor-1α antibody (19Mamoun C.B. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To monitor stage-specific expression of Pfpmt, 12 plates of synchronized cultures of 3D7 wild-type parasites were grown to early ring stage (10% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit). The cultures were then pooled, and the medium was removed by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh medium and mixed thoroughly, and equal volumes of the cell suspension were plated into 12 Petri dishes. Parasites from 4 plates were harvested shortly thereafter as ring stage parasites. For trophozoites and schizont stages, 4 plates each were collected after about 26 and 38 h, respectively. Parasites were extracted from the RBCs by treatment with 0.15% saponin and resuspended in PBS. Sample preparation and immunoblotting were conducted as described above with Pfpmt as the primary antibody. Analysis of Pfpmt Membrane Association—Asynchronous P. falciparum parasites were extracted from erythrocytes by treatment with 0.07% saponin for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 1875 × g for 15 min, the pellet was washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS. The parasites were sonicated and spun at 100,000 × g for 10 min. Part of the pellet obtained was treated with 1% Triton X-114 for 30 min on ice and then spun at 100,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the detergent-solubilized extract in the supernatant and the insoluble fraction in the pellet. The samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes followed by immunoblotting. Microscopy and Immunofluorescence Assays—Live parasitized RBCs were washed in PBS, and the nuclei of the parasites were stained by incubating with Hoechst at 20 μg/ml for 20 min. After washing, the live cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence assays were done essentially as described by Rager et al. (20Rager N. Mamoun C.B. Carter N.S. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41095-41099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but with slight modifications. Asynchronous cultures of wild-type and transgenic parasites were washed twice in PBS, smeared onto coverslips, and airdried. The smears were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then rinsed in wash buffer (0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% normal goat serum, 0.05% saponin) followed by blocking in a PBS solution containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% goat serum, and 0.1% saponin. After washing, the coverslips were incubated with either a mixture of affinity-purified rabbit anti-Pfpmt antibodies (1:25 dilution) or anti-Pfpp2C (1:100 dilution) and mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (ABGENT) at a 1:500 dilution or with a mixture of anti-Pfpmt antibody (1:25 dilution) and mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to the RBC band 3 protein (1:500 dilution) at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h. The coverslips were washed and incubated with a mixture of anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 dilution) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-mouse antibody (1:500 dilution) conjugated to Texas red dye (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained by incubating the coverslips in PBS containing 3 μg/ml Hoechst stain (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at room temperature, and after washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides with Antifade (Molecular Probes).

Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunoelectron microscopy was done as previously described by Rager et al. (20Rager N. Mamoun C.B. Carter N.S. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol.

RBCs parasitized with transgenic P. falciparum, expressing the Pfpmt-GFP fusion protein, were pelleted and fixed on ice for 1 h in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 200 mm PIPES, and 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. After rinsing in PIPES buffer, the cell pellet was embedded in 10% gelatin and fixed again for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed samples were infiltrated with 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 2.3 m sucrose in PIPES buffer overnight at 4 °C. Samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, cryo-sectioned, and collected on carbon-Form-var-coated grids at the Washington University Molecular Microbiology Imaging Facility. Grids were blocked in 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% goat serum in PIPES buffer and incubated in either mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution) alone or mixed with rat anti-BiP antibody (1:50 dilution) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Grids were rinsed and incubated with either anti-mouse secondary antibody alone, conjugated to 18-nm gold particles, or in a mixture with anti-rat secondary antibody conjugated to 12-nm gold particles (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in blocking buffer. After washing, the grids were counterstained with 0.3% uranyl acetate and 2% polyvinyl alcohol. Images were viewed on a Zeiss 902 transmission electron microscope. Pfpmt Is Not a Cytoplasmic Enzyme—Studies in eukaryotic cells have indicated that the kinases involved in the synthesis of the soluble precursors phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine from ethanolamine and choline, respectively, are localized in the cytosol (21Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar, 22Mago N. Khuller G.K. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1990; 28: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This knowledge led to the assumption that the transmethylation step of the SDPM pathway, catalyzed by Pfpmt, could also occur in the parasite cytoplasm. To localize Pfpmt in P. falciparum, the GFP was added to the C-terminal portion of the enzyme, and the fusion protein was stably expressed in P. falciparum. Analysis of the autofluorescent parasites did not reveal the typical diffusible stain of cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1A). Rather, the autofluorescence was limited to specific dots within the parasites, the number of which varied depending on the intraerythrocytic stage, with ∼3 dots detected during the ring stage, ∼5 dots during the trophozoite stage, and ∼10 dots during early schizogony (Fig. 1A). A similar pattern could be detected using antibodies against GFP (Fig. 1B). The non-cytoplasmic nature of the fluorescence pattern was further confirmed by immunocolocalization studies using antibodies directed against the parasite protein phosphatase 2C (19Mamoun C.B. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Mamoun C.B. Sullivan D.J. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol.

To further localize the fluorescence pattern of Pfpmt-GFP, immunoelectron microscopy was performed using a monoclonal antibody against GFP. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, Pfpmt-GFP associates with membranous structures extending from the nuclear membrane, reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Because the ER has been associated with the synthesis of lipids in different organisms and the initial step of glycerolipid metabolism catalyzed by the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, PfGat, also occurs in this organelle (24Santiago T.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9222-9232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we examined the possible ER localization of Pfpmt. Immunocolocalization studies were, therefore, performed using polyclonal antibodies against the ER marker BiP and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies in the 3D7-Pfpmt-GFP strain. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, whereas BiP localization was either on the nuclear membrane or on membrane structures in the immediate surrounding of the nuclear membrane (ER), Pfpmt-GFP localization only partially overlapped with BiP and concentrated in the distal part of the membrane structures extending from the nuclear membrane. Although antibodies against the Golgi marker ERD2 are available, those antibodies did not recognize the native enzyme in immunoelectron microscopy analyses (not shown) and, thus, could not allow us to determine whether the localization pattern of Pfpmt-GFP reflects a Golgi localization.FIGURE 2Transmission electron micrographs of ultrathin cryosections of intraerythrocytic ring and trophozoite stages of P. falciparum 3D7-Pfpmt-GFP transgenic parasites using anti-GFP and anti-BiP antibodies.

These antibodies were affinity-purified and used in immunoblot studies to monitor protein expression in P. falciparum.A single band of ∼30 kDa was detected in the 3D7 strain, and two bands, one corresponding to the native Pfpmt and a second corresponding to the Pfpmt-GFP fusion, could be detected in the 3D7-PfpmtGFP transgenic parasites (Fig. 3A). No bands could be detected using the preimmune serum in this strain (Fig. 3A). As a positive control, antibodies against the P. falciparum elongation factor PfEF-1α (19Mamoun C.B. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) revealed a single band in both strains. To determine the stage(s) during which Pfpmt protein is expressed, immunoblot analyses were performed on protein extracts isolated from highly synchronized cultures at the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages of the parasite intraerythrocytic development and using an equal number of parasites. As shown in Fig. 3B, Pfpmt expression was detected in all the stages, but high levels were detected during the trophozoite stage during which active synthesis of parasite lipids occurs. To determine whether Pfpmt is a soluble or membrane-associated protein, protein extracts from parasite-soluble and membrane fractions were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Pfpmt antibodies. Pfpmt associated only with the soluble fraction (Fig. 3C). As a control, the parasite purine transporter PfNT1 associated with the membrane fraction and could be solubilized using Triton X-114 (Fig. 3C), consistent with published studies (20Rager N.

Pfpmt monospecific antibodies were then used in immunofluoresence analyses to localize the native enzyme. A pattern similar to that of Pfpmt-GFP was detected at the three stages of parasite intraerythrocytic development (Fig. 4). To identify the exact cellular localization of the native enzyme, we have generated three different transgenic parasites expressing either GFP alone targeted to the cytoplasm, GFP containing a C-terminal SDEL retention signal and, thus, targeted to the ER, or GFP fused to the Golgi apparatus marker Rab6 (25de Castro F.A.

Colocalization studies using anti-Pfpmt affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody confirmed that the native Pfpmt is not cytoplasmic (Fig. 5A), showing only partial overlap with BiP (Fig. 5B), but revealed a complete colocalization with Rab6-GFP (Fig. 5C), thus demonstrating that Pfpmt resides in the Golgi apparatus of the parasite.FIGURE 5Immunofluorescence microscopy of Pfpmt in transgenic P. falciparum-infected red blood cells expressing GFP in the cytoplasm, ER, and Golgi apparatus. Erythrocytes infected with transgenic parasites expressing GFP in the cytoplasm (GFP)(panel A), the ER (GFP-SDEL)(panel B), and Golgi apparatus (Rab6-GFP)(panel C) at different stages of parasite intraerythrocytic development were fixed and prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Parasites were examined by microscopy using illumination at 546 nm to visualize Pfpmt (green) conjugated to the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody or at 488 nm to visualize GFP complexed with the Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (red).

Evidence for the role of the ER in the biosynthesis of parasite phospholipids came from the detailed localization of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase of P. falciparum, PfGat, to this organelle (24Santiago T.C. Zufferey R. Mehra R.S. Coleman R.A. Ben Mamoun C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9222-9232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the acylation of the precursor glycerol 3-phosphate at the sn-1 position. This is the first step in a series of reactions that lead to the formation of the fatty acid donors and phospholipid precursors, diacylglycerol and CDP-diacylglycerol. Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and mammalian cells have revealed two major routes for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine; (i) the de novo CDP-choline (Kennedy) pathway, which initiates from choline and (ii) the phosphatidylethanolamine transmethylation pathway that converts phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine via three consecutive methylation reactions catalyzed by one or two phospholipid methyltransferases (for review, see Refs. 27Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar and 28Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In most mammalian cells the de novo pathway is the primary route of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. In mammalian hepatocytes as well as in yeast cells, in addition to the de novo synthesis from choline, phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis can also be derived from the transmethylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. In plant cells, however, no significant methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine occurs. Instead, these cells can methylate phosphoethanolamine into monomethylphosphoethanolamine, dimethylphosphoethanolamine, and phosphocholine (11Charron J.B. Breton G. Danyluk J. Muzac I. Ibrahim R.K. Sarhan F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1800-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The phosphocholine, thus, formed is subsequently used for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis via the CDP-choline pathway. Interestingly, metabolic studies in P. falciparum and the molecular identification of the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase Pfpmt have demonstrated that this parasite uses a plant-like pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (8Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This pathway initiates from serine, which is either transported from host plasma or obtained from active degradation of host hemoglobin. Serine is first decarboxylated into ethanolamine by a parasite-specific serine decarboxylase. The gene encoding this activity has not yet been identified, and no homologs of known plant serine decarboxylases could be found in the finished genomes of Plasmodium species. The ethanolamine obtained via the serine decarboxylation reaction is rapidly phosphorylated by a parasite-specific ethanolamine kinase to yield phosphoethanolamine, which then serves as a substrate for the Pfpmt transmethylation reaction to form phosphocholine. The final two metabolic enzymes of the SDPM pathway that catalyze the formation of phosphatidylcholine from phosphocholine are also components of the CDP-choline pathway. The importance of these enzymes and pathways in parasite development and survival remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrated using various microscopic analyses that Pfpmt resides in the Golgi apparatus of the parasite. The ultimate demonstration was obtained using a transgenic parasite expressing GFP fused to Rab6 and targeted to the Golgi apparatus. These parasites along with other transgenic parasites expressing GFP in other parasite localizations will help our efforts to map the cellular locations of the parasite lipid metabolic pathways. Thus far, of the five genes of the SDPM pathway involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from host serine, only the serine decarboxylase gene remains to be identified. Genetic and biochemical studies to reveal the molecular identity of this gene and its product are under way. The localization of Pfpmt and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase of P. falciparum represents an important step toward understanding the temporal and special organization of the parasite lipid machineries and indicates that the Golgi apparatus and ER are crucial organelles in this essential process.

https://openalex.org/W2161878212,"The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF) family of six adaptor proteins (TRAF1–6) links the TNFR superfamily to the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional activators. Unlike other TRAFs, TRAF6 is also involved in Toll-like/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) signal transduction. Thus, inhibition of TRAF6 function could interrupt both CD40 (TNFR family) and IL-1 growth signals, pathways critical to myeloma proliferation. To block TRAF6-mediated IL-1 signaling, we constructed small interfering RNA (siRNA) against TRAF6. We found that siRNA targeting the TRAF6 C-terminal (siTRAF6C) receptor interaction domain specifically reduced only TRAF6 protein expression, without affecting TRAF2 or 5 levels, and substantially interfered with IL-1-induced NF-κB and c-Jun/AP-1 activation. Inhibition by siTRAF6C was concentration-dependent. SiTRAF6C also significantly reduced myeloma proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in a similar dose-dependent fashion in vitro. More importantly, marked siTRAF6C growth inhibition was detected in vivo when these cells were implanted into the bone marrow of irradiated normal mice. In contrast, introduction of siRNA derived from the TRAF6 Zn-finger domain or an irrelevant siRNA construct failed to alter cell growth or cell death. These studies suggest that TRAF6 may be a new molecular target to block cell signal transduction important for the survival and proliferation of multiple myeloma cells."

Thermal stability and protease resistance studies revealed a role for divalent metals in maintaining the stability of PALcc (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies led to the postulate that PALcc contains both a structural and a catalytic metal-binding site (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consistent with our hypothesis of multiple metal-binding sites, we demonstrate here that purified PALcc contains molar amounts of both zinc and calcium. Our observation that concentrated solutions of PAL had a lavender color led to the identification of bound iron and to the identification of an essential Fe(III)-tyrosinate charge transfer complex. Mutation of the only conserved Tyr residue (Tyr654) eliminated catalytic activity; the lavender color; and the binding of zinc, calcium, and iron to PAL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Purification of PALcc—PALcc was purified from the spent medium of stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as described (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells maintained in roller bottles were fed daily with complete serum-free medium (CSFM), and assays were carried out at pH 5.5 in 100–150 mm NaMES containing 0.05% Thesit (Roche Applied Science) and 1.0 mm CdCl2 as described (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on scans of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-stained membranes, 93 ± 2% of the protein in all preparations analyzed was PALcc. The concentration of PALcc was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using the measured extinction coefficient (1 mg/ml = 1.42; molecular mass of 38.3 kDa) (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Iron Loading of PAL-producing CHO Cells—Stably transfected CHO cells expressing PALcc were rinsed for 4 h in CSFM or in CSFM containing the iron-nitriloacetic acid complex (200 μm) (27Davis P.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), holotransferrin (iron-loaded, 10 or 100 μm), or apotransferrin (iron-free, 10 or 100 μm). Cells were then incubated for two sequential 24-h periods with fresh medium of the same composition. Spent media were centrifuged to remove non-adherent cells; after the second 24-h incubation, cells were extracted into 20 mm NaTES, 10 mm mannitol, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4) (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cell lysates and media were assayed for PAL activity as described (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell extract and medium were fractionated on 4–15% Criterion gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to Immobilon membranes, and visualized using rabbit polyclonal antibody to bovine PAM-(561–579) (JH256) (28Husten E.J. Tausk F.A. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9709-9717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of PAL protein in each sample was quantified using GeneSnap (Syngene, Frederick, MD). The specific activity of the PAL contained in the cell extract or secreted into the medium was calculated by dividing the activity measured by the amount of PAL protein present. The experiment was replicated three times.Measurement of UGL Activity—UGL activity was determined by measuring glyoxylate formed through its reaction with phenylhydrazine (29Vogels G.D. Vanderdrift C. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 33: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (100 μl/well in a 96-well plate) contained 100 mm NaTES (pH 7.8), 2.0 mm ureidoglycolate (freshly prepared and kept on ice), 3.0 mm phenylhydrazine, and enzyme. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the absorbance was measured at 360 nm using a Wallac VICTOR2 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Controls lacking enzyme were analyzed to determine nonenzymatic production of glyoxylate. A standard curve generated using 0.156–5.0 mm glyoxylate was used to quantify glyoxylate produced from ureidoglycolate by PAL; samples were assayed in duplicate (30Pineda M. Piedras P. Cardenas J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Effect of Metals, Oxidizing Agents, and Reducing Agents on the Activity of PALcc—Purified PALcc was exposed to the indicated concentrations of trivalent metal (e.g. GaCl3, Fe(NO2)3, FeCl3) or oxidizing/reducing agent (K3Fe(CN)6, K4Fe(CN)6, ascorbate, freshly dissolved dithionite) for 30 min on ice; diluted 1010-fold into 20 mm NaTES, 10 mm mannitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4); and assayed under standard assay conditions (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each modifying reagent and salt were individually assayed for the ability to support nonenzymatic conversion of substrate into product under standard reaction conditions; no significant amount of product was generated.To determine the effect of K4Fe(CN)6 treatment on the chromophore, purified PALcc (0.59 mg/ml, 15.5 μm) was treated with 10 mm K4Fe(CN)6 in 25 mm NaTES and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice. The reaction mixture was passed through a NICK™ column equilibrated with NH4HCO3 (pH 8) to remove low molecular mass products contributing to the absorption spectrum. PALcc recovered in the void volume was lyophilized and redissolved; based on A280, the protein concentration was 8 μm. The absorption spectrum was recorded from 200 to 800 nm.Modification of Tyrosine Residues in PALcc—Purified PALcc was exposed to the indicated molar excess of tetranitromethane (TNM) or N-acetylimidazole on ice for 30 min. After incubation, the reaction was diluted 1010-fold into 20 mm NaTES, 10 mm mannitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) for assessment of enzyme activity (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ability of substrate to protect PAL from modification by TNM was assessed by preincubating a concentrated sample of purified PALcc (0.65 mg/ml) with ureidoglycolate or α-hydroxyhippuric acid before exposure to TNM on ice for 1 h. After incubation with TNM, purified PALcc was diluted and assayed as described (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PALcc subjected to the same manipulations but not exposed to the modifying agent served as the control.To determine the effect of TNM treatment on the chromophore, purified PALcc (100 μl, 0.55 mg/ml or 14.4 μm) was treated with a 20-fold molar excess of TNM for 1 h at room temperature in 25 mm NaTES and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). The reaction mixture was passed through a NICK column equilibrated with NH4HCO3 (pH 8) to remove nitroformate, which has a strong 350 nm absorption peak. Fractions containing the void volume were lyophilized and dissolved in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0); based on A280, the protein concentration was 8.3 μm. The absorption spectrum was recorded from 200 to 800 nm; 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) was used as a blank. TNM-treated PALcc digested with endoproteinase Lys-C or endoproteinase Glu-C was subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis in the University of Connecticut Health Center Proteomics and Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility; in both digests, the only nitro-Tyr residue identified was Tyr582, and modification was partial.Transient Expression of Mutant PALcc—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to replace three single Tyr residues in rat pro-PALcc with Phe: Tyr582, Tyr595, and Tyr654. The 21-mers used for mutagenesis (with the mutated nucleotides underlined) were as follows: Y582F, 5′-GGCAAGAACCTGTTTTTTTTACCACACGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCGTGTGGTAAAAAAAACAGGTTCTTGCC-3′ (reverse); Y595F, 5′-GATACAGATGGAAATTTTTGGGTCACAGATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATCTGTGACCCAAAAATTTCCATCTGTATC-3′ (reverse); and Y654F, 5′-CGTGTCAGACGGTTTCTGTAACAGTCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGACTGTTACAGAAACCGTCTGACACG-3′ (reverse). The pCIS vector (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) used to test the effect of these single mutations encoded rat pro-PALcc containing an inconsequential mutation (Q551R) (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rat PALcc was engineered to lack the N-glycosylation site at Asn765 by mutating Ser767 to Ala. Each cDNA construct was sequenced in its entirety.Wild-type pCIS/pro-PALcc- (Q551R) and the three mutant proteins were transiently expressed in PEAKrapid cells (Edge Biosystems) (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Confluent 35-mm wells of cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were fed with CSFM. After an additional 24-h incubation, the medium was collected, centrifuged to remove non-adherent cells, and stored with protease inhibitors. Cells were extracted and analyzed as described above.Production and Purification of PALcc(Y654F)—CHO-DG44 cells transfected with the pCIS/PAL- (Y654F) vector were selected using α-minimal essential medium containing dialyzed fetal bovine serum (31Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.S.W. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10901-10909Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Positive subclones were selected by Western blot analysis of the spent medium. Cells from a single subclone were expanded into six 150-mm dishes and used to seed a CellMax® artificial capillary cartridge (outer surface area of 1.1 m2, 95% molecular mass cutoff of 20 kDa; catalog no. 400-003, Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) precoated inside with NuSerum (BD Biosciences). The cartridge was maintained on the outside in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, HEPES, and Fungizone for 7 days. Cells were then rinsed twice with CSFM; 50 ml of spent medium was collected and replaced daily for 8 weeks. Secreted proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 65% (NH4)2SO4; pellets were resuspended in 20 mm NaTES and 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4 (pH 7.0) and applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (HiTrap™ phenyl) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with 20 mm NaTES (pH 7.0). Fractions containing PALcc(Y654F) were identified by Western blot analysis, pooled, and concentrated using an Amicon stirred flow cell with a YM-30 membrane. The concentrated protein was loaded onto a Superdex™ 200 gel filtration column (25 × 350 mm) equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm NaTES and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). Fractions containing PALcc(Y654F) were identified by Western blotting and pooled, and the buffer was exchanged using an Amicon stirred flow cell and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Following application to a SOURCE™ 15Q ion exchange column (10 × 30 mm; Amersham Biosciences), PALcc(Y654F) was eluted with a gradient to 20 mm Tris-HCl and 1 m NaCl (pH 9.0). Fractions containing PALcc(Y654F) were pooled, concentrated using an Amicon stirred flow cell, and subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (10 × 300 mm) eluted with 20 mm NaTES and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). The purity of the fractions containing PALcc(Y654F) was evaluated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.Metal Analysis, Spectrum Determination, and Reconstitution with Iron—Metal ion analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Optima 2000 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. Standard curves were linear over the range 40–2000 nm. The absorption spectrum of PALcc (260–800 nm) was determined using a Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer with a scan rate of 1200 nm/min; a buffer blank analyzed at the same time was subtracted. We attempted to load purified PALcc with additional iron. Purified PALcc was washed repeatedly with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) using an Ultrafree concentrator (10-kDa cutoff; Millipore Corp.). An aliquot of the concentrated protein was saved for metal analysis, and the spectrum was recorded. The concentrate was diluted 14-fold with the same buffer, and ferric nitrate (1 mm stock solution) was added slowly using a syringe pump. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the sample was again washed with buffer to remove unbound metals; the final filtrate was analyzed for metal content. The sample was concentrated for metal determination, and the spectrum was again recorded. Reconstitution with ferric ammonium citrate was attempted in a similar manner.RESULTSPurified PAL Is a Ureidoglycolate Lyase—The similarities in the reactions catalyzed by PAL and UGL suggested that PAL might accept ureidoglycolate as a substrate. To assess this possibility, purified PALcc was tested for its ability to generate glyoxylate from ureidoglycolate (Fig. 2). Based on SDS-PAGE, the purity of the PALcc used for these experiments was 92 ± 2% (Fig. 2A). Production of glyoxylate was quantified using the phenylhydrazine assay for glyoxylate (30Pineda M. Piedras P. Cardenas J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and increased linearly as the concentration of PAL was increased (data not shown). As the concentration of ureidoglycolate was increased, saturation was reached (data not shown). Using an Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 2B), the Km of PALcc for ureidoglycolate is 0.65 ± 0.02 mm, and the Vmax is 0.27 ± 0.01 mmol/mg/min. The Km value reported for purified B. cepacia UGL (0.5 mm) is quite similar, but the Vmax of the bacterial enzyme is 180 mmol/mg/min, almost 700-fold higher than the Vmax of PALcc for ureidoglycolate (23McIninch J.K. Mclninch J.D. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50091-50100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consistent with the work of May and co-workers (23McIninch J.K. Mclninch J.D. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50091-50100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), PALcc can function as a UGL.FIGURE 2Analysis of purified PALcc. A, PALcc from three different purifications (2 μg of samples A–C) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The predicted mass for PALcc is 38,280 Da; its apparent mass is 38 ± 1 kDa. B, purified PALcc was assayed in the presence of variable amounts of ureidoglycolate. Production of glyoxylate was measured using phenylhydrazine; nonenzymatic production of glyoxylate was subtracted (29Vogels G.D. Vanderdrift C. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 33: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Data are plotted in the Eadie-Hofstee format. A representative experiment is shown; Km and Vmax values are the average from three determinations. C, the solid line shows the absorption spectrum of purified PALcc (300–800 nm) determined for a 70-μl sample using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer; a buffer blank analyzed at the same time was subtracted. The dotted line shows the same sample of PALcc reconstituted with Fe(III) by slow infusion of ferric nitrate, followed by three cycles of ultrafiltration. Inset, difference spectrum between native and reconstituted spectra showing that the 560 nm band was unaltered by reconstitution. D, fractions from the Superose 6 column used to purify PALcc were assessed for PAL activity, protein content (based on A280), and the absorbance at 560 nm. The correspondence of the three peaks led to the conclusion that some feature of PALcc is responsible for the absorption peak at 560 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purified PAL Contains Zinc, Calcium, and Iron—Both bifunctional PAM3 and PALcc contain almost stoichiometric amounts of zinc (26Kolhekar A.S.

The lyase activity of both proteins is inhibited by metal ion chelators such as EDTA, EGTA, and o-phenanthroline (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E.

A number of divalent metal ions restore catalytic activity to control levels after inactivation by EDTA, and site-directed mutagenesis of PALcc led to the prediction of two metal-binding sites, one structural and one catalytic (26Kolhekar A.S.

To identify other metal ions bound to PAL, several preparations of PALcc were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Table 1). Close to stoichiometric amounts of zinc were again detected in purified PALcc (1.05 ± 0.06 mol/mol of PAL) (26Kolhekar A.S. Bell J. Shiozaki E.N. Jin L. Keutmann H.T. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, stoichiometric amounts of calcium were present (0.98 ± 0.14). Although the levels of manganese, cobalt, nickel, and copper were insignificant (Table 1), significant levels of iron were found in each sample analyzed; the average iron content of PALcc was 0.14 ± 0.01 mol/mol of PALcc.TABLE 1Metals bound to PALccPALccConcCalciumManganeseIronCobaltNickelCopperZincμmmol/molmol/molmol/molmol/molmol/molmol/molmol/molSample A43.00.8200.15000.030.98Sample B77.51.0500.14000.051.10Sample C87.41.0700.14000.041.06Mean ± S.D.0.98 ± 0.140.14 ± 0.011.05 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab Purified PALcc Is Purple—When samples of PALcc were concentrated for met"

In yeast, the ethanolaminephosphate on the α1–4-linked mannose is added during the biosynthesis of the GPI lipid by Mcd4p. MCD4 is essential because Gpi10p, the mannosyltransferase adding the subsequent α1–2-linked mannose, requires substrates with an ethanolaminephosphate on the α1–4-linked mannose. The Gpi10p ortholog of Trypanosoma brucei has no such requirement. Here we show that the overexpression of this ortholog rescues mcd4Δ cells. Phenotypic analysis of the rescued mcd4Δ cells leads to the conclusion that the ethanolaminephosphate on the α1–4-linked mannose, beyond being an essential determinant for Gpi10p, is necessary for an efficient recognition of GPI lipids and GPI proteins by the GPI transamidase for the efficient transport of GPI-anchored proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi and for the physiological incorporation of ceramides into GPI anchors by lipid remodeling. Furthermore, mcd4Δ cells have a marked defect in axial bud site selection, whereas this process is normal in gpi7Δ and gpi1. This also suggests that axial bud site selection specifically depends on the presence of the ethanolaminephosphate on the α1–4-linked mannose.

Addition of this inhibitor or the depletion of Mcd4p arrest the growth of yeast cells and lead to the accumulation of the abnormal GPI lipid 4c (Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNH2-inositol-PO4-lipid), indicating a problem with the addition of Man3 (Fig. 1) (6.Sutterlin C.

Indeed, overexpression of Mcd4p can improve the growth of yeast cells in the presence of low concentrations of YW3548, whereas overexpression of Gpi10p is comparatively inefficient (9.Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11.Sutterlin C.

Although these data indicate that Mcd4p helps Gpi10p by providing an optimal substrate, they cannot rule out the possibility that MCD4 would influence the function of Gpi10p in another way, e.g. by regulating phosphatidylethanolamine levels in the ER or by channeling substrate into Gpi10p or stabilizing Gpi10p. There indeed is a genetic link between MCD4 and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis: the mcd4-P301L and mcd4 –174 alleles render cells temperature-sensitive (ts) when combined with psd1Δ, with the latter eliminating the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, by which the bulk of phosphatidylethanolamine is made. The mcd4-P301L mutation was claimed to not affect GPI biosynthesis. Temperature sensitivity of mcd4 psd1Δ mutants could be reverted by the addition of ethanolamine, or choline, or ethanolamine and sorbitol to the media (12.Storey M.K. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity of another mcd4 allele named fsr2–1 is suppressed by overexpression of PSD1, PSD2, or ECM33 (13.Toh-e A. Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 2002; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutations in MCD4 also show several other, quite specific phenotypes, which may not be related to its effect on GPI biosynthesis. Mutants in MCD4 (mitotic check point dependent 4) were found to suffer from delayed bud emergence and an inability to polarize secretion to the bud tip or septum, thus becoming dependent on a checkpoint delaying mitosis until a bud is formed (14.Mondesert G. Clarke D.J. Reed S.I. Genetics. 1997; 147: 421-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Buds of mcd4 –174 are small and misshapen and contain many aberrant membrane structures (8.Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Certain mcd4 mutants also activate one branch of the hyperosmotic response pathway and are more resistant to high concentrations of Cu2+ than wt cells (15.Toh-e A. Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 2001; 76: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). GPI lipids and GPI anchors of T. brucei do not contain any EtN-P side chains, and thus, their presence certainly will not be required by the T. brucei GPI10 ortholog (3.Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 16.Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10336-10341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To test the relationship between MCD4 and GPI10 and explore the various functions of MCD4 more closely, we tested whether it was possible to overcome the lethality of the mcd4Δ deletion by introducing T. brucei Gpi10p into mcd4Δ cells. The results show that in this way it is possible to create a cell in which all functions of Mcd4p are lost while some GPI biosynthesis is preserved.

The cells were grown on rich medium (YPD) or minimal medium (SD) (18.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose (D) as a carbon source and uracil (U), adenine (A), and amino acids (aa) as required at 30 °C. Methionine was added at 10 mg/liter (38 μm), so that the MET17 promoter was almost fully active. Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing services were provided by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). Verification of deletions was done by PCR as shown in Fig. 2C using the following primers: F1, 5′-ATGTGGAACAAAACCAGAAGGAC-3′; F2, 5′-CACACACGGTGGATCCTGTACAC-3′; R1, 5′-GCTCGATGGAAGATTGCG-3′; R2, 5′-AGCAATCATAGCAACATGACC-3′; R3, 5′-CAAGGAGGGTATTCTGGGC-3′; F4, 5′-CGCGGATCCATGCCGTGGTGGTTGATTTC-3′; and R4, 5′-CGGAATTCCGTCACTTCGTCACCTTGACCC. Construction of Yeast Vectors—The T. brucei GPI10 behind the MET17 promoter on a multicopy plasmid (p425-TbGPI10, LEU2) was a kind gift from Howard Riezman and Taroh Kinoshita (16.Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10336-10341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The promoter and open reading frame of MCD4 was amplified by PCR and inserted into YEp352 to yield pBF639 (URA3). Sequence verification showed a point mutation I387T (at DNA level, T1160C), but the plasmid was able to fully complement mcd4Δ mutants. Cell Extraction and Western Blotting—The proteins were extracted by incubating cells for 5 min in NaOH and boiling at 95 °C in reducing sample buffer (19.Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cells were broken by glass beads in TEPI buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 30 μg/ml of each, leupeptine, antipain, and pepstatin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C, and the lysate was directly solubilized in octyl-β-glucoside (50 mm) at 4 °C for 30 min. After solubilization, the extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and boiled in reducing sample buffer as above. In other experiments, the cells were broken by glass beads in TEPI buffer, the lysate was directly treated with DNase (Fluka 31136) for 45 min at room temperature, and then the lysate was solubilized with Triton X-114 (1%) at 4 °C for 30 min. After solubilization, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were separated into detergent (D) and aqueous (A) phases at 37 °C followed by mild centrifugation. The detergent and aqueous fractions were then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. For treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), the detergent phase was diluted and treated with PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus (Sigma P 5542 or Funakoshi Pharm BR-05) using 1 unit/ml at 37 °C for 2 h with occasional shaking. After a further phase separation the detergent and aqueous phases were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and processed as above. As primary antibodies we used purified mouse anti-CPY (Molecular Probes), rabbit anti-Yap3p (a kind gift from Dr. Niahm Cawley), and rabbit anti-Gas1p made in the laboratory. As secondary antibodies for blots, we used fluorescent goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor680 or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to IRDye800, and fluorescence was measured with the Odyssey Imaging system (LI-COR). Alternatively, the blots were revealed with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase and using ECL technology (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of GPIs—GPI lipids were analyzed by metabolic labeling of yeast cells with [3H]myo-inositol and labeling of yeast microsomes with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as described before (7.Imhof I. Flury I. Vionnet C. Roubaty C. Egger D. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19614-19627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Head groups of GPI lipids were analyzed with hydrofluoric acid using the protocol originally developed by Mike Ferguson (3.Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), and remodeling of lipids on GPI anchors was analyzed by liberating anchor lipids from anchor peptides using HNO2 as described (20.Guillas I. Pfefferli M. Conzelmann A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 506-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopy—To stain cells with calcofluor white, cells were kept in continuous exponential growth for >10 generations, and one A600 unit of cells was washed with water, stained in calcofluor white (1 mg/ml) for 10 –20 min at room temperature, washed again, and observed under the microscope. T. brucei Gpi10p Can Rescue Viability of mcd4Δ Cells—The multicopy vector p425-TbGPI10 harboring TbGPI10 behind the MET17 promoter was introduced into a mcd4Δ::KanMX/MCD4 heterozygous diploid strain. The transformed diploid was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. Very few complete tetrads were obtained. Fig. 2A shows a complete tetrad, in which geneticin resistance and methionine auxotrophy segregated 2:2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that spores T3 and T4 were mcd4Δ::KanMX. PCR analysis confirmed the mcd4Δ::KanMX genotype and the presence of the p425-Tb-GPI10 plasmid in T3 and T4 (Fig. 2C). The mcd4::KanMX strains grew rather slowly. The generation times at 30 °C in liquid SDaaUA medium of T1, T2, T3, and T4, were 2.48, 2.39, 5.25, and 6.03 h, respectively. The corresponding generation times in YPDUA were 1.53, 1.61, 7.38, and 6.15 h, respectively (not shown). The MET17 promoter driving TbGPI10 expression is three to five times more active in the absence of methionine (21.Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Omission of methionine from minimal medium to achieve a higher expression of TbGPI10 did not enhance the growth rate of MET17 mcd4Δ::KanMX cells (not shown). On plates the mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 cells grew at almost the same rate at 24 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C, but they were inositol-dependent at 37 °C (Fig. 2D). The growth rate of mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 cells on plates at 37 °C was also increased by 1 m sorbitol and slightly improved by ethanolamine, and the greatest effect on colony size was observed when all these ingredients were combined (Fig. 2D). Sorbitol has been reported to rescue certain mcd4 mutants (12.Storey M.K. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22.Maneesri J. Azuma M. Sakai Y. Igarashi K. Matsumoto T. Fukuda H. Kondo A. Ooshima H. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2005; 99: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the p425-TbGPI10 plasmid did not allow various temperature-sensitive mcd4 strains (ssu21, mcd4 –174, and mcd4-P301L) to grow at restrictive temperature (37 °C) (not shown), neither in the presence nor the absence of ethanolamine. This may suggest a possible dominant negative effect of these mutant alleles. The mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 Cells Accumulate an Abnormal GPI Lipid—To investigate the structure of the GPI lipids made by mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 strains, we labeled intact cells with [3H]inositol and analyzed the lipid extracts by TLC and fluorography. In wild type (wt) cells, no GPI lipids can be detected in this way, but certain mutants deficient in GPI biosynthesis or GPI addition to proteins were shown to accumulate significant amounts of labeled biosynthetic intermediates (23.Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3A, there is an abnormal lipid accumulating in T3 and T4 mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 strains, which is absent from the T1 and T2 MCD4 strains (lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 2 and 3). This lipid was named M4* because it has about the same mobility as M4/2, which is one of the several abnormal GPI lipids accumulating in GPI transamidase mutants such as gpi8 sec18 (Fig. 3A, lane 7). Although CP2 contains an EtN-P group on Man1, Man2, and Man3 (Fig. 1), gpi7Δ mutants accumulate M4/1 (Fig. 3A, lane 4), which lacks the EtN-P on Man2 while preserving the EtN-Ps on Man1 and Man3 (23.Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The head group of M4* could be released by mild deacylation followed by PI-PLC treatment, and, as shown in Fig. 3B, treatment of the liberated head group with hydrofluoric acid and acetic anhydride yielded a Man4-GlcNAc-Inositol fragment. This partial analysis of lipid M4* is compatible with the idea that M4* is a CP2 lacking EtN-P on Man1, thus being the most mature GPI lipid we theoretically can expect in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 cells (Fig. 1). When the mcd4-P301L (MKY3) or mcd4–174 (MKY13) strains were labeled with [3H]inositol at 37 °C, neither M4* nor any other late GPI intermediate were detectable as reported before (12.Storey M.K. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (not shown). Moreover, this was also true when these cells expressed TbGPI10 and independent of the presence or absence of ethanolamine in the labeling medium (not shown). This again points to a possible dominant negative effect of these mcd4 alleles. To further investigate the GPI biosynthesis pathway, we prepared microsomes and incubated them with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. As shown in Fig. 3C, the mature GPI lipid CP2 (Fig. 1) was not detectable in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 strains T3 and T4 (lanes 3 and 4). However, mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 strains showed an abnormal accumulation of lipid 4c (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4, open triangles), which also accumulates in a temperature-sensitive mcd4 mutant at 37 °C (Fig. 3C, lane 8) and which has previously been characterized as Man-Man-GlcN-(acyl→)PI (7.Imhof I. Flury I. Vionnet C. Roubaty C. Egger D. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19614-19627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 strains do not accumulate lipid 031b (Man-Man-Man-(EtN-P→)Man-GlcN-(acyl→) PI), an intermediate containing four mannoses and accumulating in Gpi13p-depleted strains (24.Flury I. Benachour A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24458-24465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and they make no M4/1 (Man-(EtN-P→)Man-Man-(EtN-P→)Man-GlcN-(acyl→)PI), typical of gpi7Δ strains (Fig. 3C, lane 7). The presence of the abnormal lipid 4c in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 indicated that TbGpi10p was rather inactive under the in vitro conditions used here. This is confirmed by the fact that the gpi10Δ/TbGPI10 strain accumulates M2* (Fig. 3C, lane 6, open circle), a lipid previously characterized as Man-(EtN-P→)Man-GlcN-(acyl→)PI (25.Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). (Interestingly, traces of a lipid migrating to the position of M4* are visible in T1 and T3, but not T2 and T4, and the same lipid is also present in gpi10Δ/TbGPI10 (Fig. 3C, lanes 1, 3, and 6, asterisk). This potential M4* correlate was only observed in microsomes from MET17, not in met17Δ strains, and the difference may be related to different expression levels of TbGpi10p.) Incorporation of [3H]inositol into proteins is a measure of GPI protein biosynthesis and was found to be markedly reduced in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 (Fig. 3D). Most affected were the mature proteins, which, after glycan elongation in the Golgi, appeared as a high molecular weight smear. Their absence suggests that mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 cells may have difficulty in transporting proteins to the Golgi (see below). Immature GPI Proteins Accumulate in the mcd4Δ/TbGPI10—To see whether GPI lipids are transferred onto GPI proteins at a normal rate, we analyzed the GPI protein Gas1p, whose ER form migrates at 105 kDa and whose mature form, produced by elongation of N- and O-glycans upon arrival in the Golgi, migrates at 125 kDa in SDS-PAGE. As long as a GPI anchor is not added to Gas1p in the ER, the protein is not packaged into COPII vesicles and not transported to the Golgi so that it accumulates as an immature 105-kDa form (26.Nuoffer C. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Doering T.L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Indeed, any significant reduction of GPI lipid biosynthesis leads to an increase of the immature 105-kDa form of Gas1p (28.Benghezal M. Lipke P.N. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A previous report shows that the ER-to-Golgi transport of Gas1p is blocked in the mcd4 –174 mutant at restrictive temperatures, whereas transport of other proteins such as CPY is unaffected (8.Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4A, in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 cells the mature 125-kDa Gas1p was less abundant than in corresponding wt cells, whereas the immature 105-kDa form was present in normal or increased amounts (see below). Moreover, the mutant cells did not accumulate the typical ER and Golgi proforms of CPY named p1 and p2, respectively, and the mature vacuolar form of CPY was present in normal amounts. The p1 proform of CPY was, however, drastically increased in the sec18 secretion mutant incubated for 1h at 37 °C (not shown). This suggested that the defect of mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 only affects GPI proteins. The mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 cells release Gas1p into the medium (Fig. 4B), and this phenomenon is only partially explained by cell lysis, because relatively less immature Gas1p is found in the medium than in the cells. Release of mature GPI proteins could be shown more clearly for Yap3p (see below). To assay the rate of transport of immature Gas1p to the Golgi, the amount of immature Gas1p was also determined after incubation of cells with cycloheximide (CHX). As shown in Fig. 5A, the relative amounts of immature Gas1p (sum of aqueous and detergent phases) is reduced 5-fold during a 20-min incubation in the presence of CHX in T1 wt cells (from 10% down to 2%), whereas in the mutant T3 only a small fraction of immature Gas1p disappears (from 49% down to 40%). Thus, immature Gas1p seems to be transported only very slowly out of the ER in the mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 mutant. As mentioned above, GPI proteins accumulate in the ER when they fail to be anchored but accumulation of GPI proteins in the ER is also observed in other instances; the transport of GPI proteins to the Golgi also fails if COPI, or sphingolipid biosynthesis, or the Emp24p complex, or yet other factors are deficient (for review see Ref. 29.Conzelmann A. Daum G. Cell Biology and Dynamics of Yeast Lipids. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, Kerala, India2005: 133-159Google Scholar). To see whether the immature Gas1p accumulating in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 is anchored or not, we partitioned Gas1p before and after PI-PLC treatment in the detergent Triton X-114 (30.Watanabe R. Funato K. Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49538-49544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fig. 5B indicates that the percentage of immature Gas1p that partitions into the aqueous phase because of the action of PI-PLC treatment is higher in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 than in wt cells (62 versus 50%). (It should be noted that it is difficult to shift the total of GPI proteins into the aqueous phase by this technique. In Fig. 5B, even for the mature, GPI-anchored form, only a fraction could be shifted, namely 37% in wt and 42% in mcd4Δ/TbGPI10). Importantly, because the percentages of Gas1p shifted by PI-PLC from detergent to aqueous phase are higher for immature than for mature Gas1p, there is no indication that immature, nonanchored Gas1p would be accumulating, neither in wt nor mcd4Δ/TbGPI10 mutant cells. There are reports showing that during Triton X-114 solubilization at 4 °C, part of GPI-anchored proteins are recovered in the detergent-insoluble pellet. The efficiency of solubilization in our experiment was evaluated by probing equivalent samples of the detergent-insoluble pellet and the detergent extract (Fig. 5C). Although Triton X-114 only solubilized 62 and 80% of Gas1p in wt and mutant cells, respectively, immature Gas1p was solubilized nearly quantitatively in both strains. Thus, the results obtained in Fig. 5 (A and B) are representative for the total of immature Gas1p. Pulse-chase analysis confirmed the severe transport block of Gas1p (Fig. 5D). To generalize the data obtained with Gas1p, we also investigated the fate of another GPI protein, Yap3p (Yps1p). Yap3p, a 570-amino acid-long protein containing 10 potential N-glycosylation sites was described as a 68-kDa GPI-anchored protein (31.Ash J. Dominguez M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20847-20854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but in other reports using the same antibodies, the immature forms of this protein ran as 80-kDa (32.Tomishige N. Noda Y. Adachi H. Shimoi H. Yoda K. Yeast. 2005; 22: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or as 80- and 100-kDa proteins (33.Barz W.P. Walter P. Mol. Biol.

The novel protein catalyzes the carbamylation of N-succinyl-l-ornithine but not l-ornithine or N-acetyl-l-ornithine, forming N-succinyl-l-citrulline. Crystal structures of this novel transcarbamylase complexed with carbamyl phosphate and N-succinyl-l-norvaline, as well as sulfate and N-succinyl-l-norvaline have been determined and refined to 2.9 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. They provide structural evidence that this protein is a novel N-succinyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase. The data provided herein suggest that B. fragilis uses N-succinyl-l-ornithine rather than N-acetyl-l-ornithine for de novo arginine biosynthesis and therefore that this pathway in Bacteroides is different from the canonical arginine biosynthetic pathway of most organisms. Comparison of the structures of the new protein with those recently reported for N-acetyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase indicates that amino acid residue 90 (B. fragilis numbering) plays an important role in conferring substrate specificity for N-succinyl-l-ornithine versus N-acetyl-l-ornithine. Movement of the 120 loop upon substrate binding occurs in N-succinyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase, while movement of the 80 loop and significant domain closure take place as in other transcarbamylases. These findings provide new information on the putative role of succinylated intermediates in arginine biosynthesis and on the evolution of transcarbamylases.

These findings provide new information on the putative role of succinylated intermediates in arginine biosynthesis and on the evolution of transcarbamylases. The canonical arginine biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and plants involves N-acetylated intermediates in the first five steps. At the fifth step, N-acetyl-l-ornithine is deacetylated either hydrolytically to form ornithine in the linear pathway or by transfer of the acetyl group to glutamate to regenerate N-acetyl-l-glutamate in the cyclic pathway. Subsequently, ornithine is converted to arginine by three enzymes: ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase), 3The abbreviations used are: OTCase, ornithine transcarbamylase; AOTCase, N-acetyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase; CP, carbamyl phosphate; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s., root mean square; SNO, N-succinyl-l-norvaline; SOTCase, N-succinyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. argininosuccinate synthase and argininosuccinate lyase (1.Cunin R.

We have recently shown that in some eubacteria (e.g. Xanthomonas), N-acetyl-l-ornithine rather than ornithine is carbamylated by a novel transcarbamylase that is essential for arginine biosynthesis (2.Shi D.

In 2002, we reported the crystal structure of a transcarbamylase-like protein from Bacteroides fragilis with phosphate bound at 2.0 Å resolution (4.Shi D. Gallegos R. DePonte 3rd, J. Morizono H. Yu X. Allewell N.M. Malamy M. Tuchman M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). At the time, we postulated that it is a novel member of the transcarbamylase family, since no activity could be detected with ornithine or other amino acids that are known transcarbamylation substrates, and the crystal structure indicated that it has a unique second substrate binding pocket. We now provide evidence that N-succinyl-l-ornithine is a substrate for this novel transcarbamylase and that this protein is essential for de novo arginine biosynthesis in B. fragilis. These data imply that B. fragilis uses N-succinylated ornithine for arginine biosynthesis and is the first organism known to do so. Production of B. fragilis Arginine Auxotrophs and Identification of the argF′bf Gene—Several arginine requiring mutants were isolated after mutagenizing B. fragilis ADB77, a thyA-derivative of TM4000 (5.Baughn A.D. Malamy M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with transposon Tn4400′ (6.Tang Y.P. Malamy M.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using the “clone out” protocol of Tang and Malamy (6.Tang Y.P. Malamy M.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we were able to determine the chromosomal sequence on both sides of the transposon insertions. Strains JDP3a.3 and JDP3a.4 contained insertions in a gene with high similarity to the argF genes encoding OTCase in eubacteria; we designated this gene as argF′bf. Expression of the argF′bf Gene and Purification of Its Protein—Cloning and expression of the gene and purification of the protein with a C-terminal His-tag were described previously (4.Shi D. Gallegos R. DePonte 3rd, J. Morizono H. Yu X. Allewell N.M. Malamy M. Tuchman M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The pARGFbf plasmid was resequenced to ensure the absence of mutations in the argF′bf gene before expression of its protein for enzyme assays. For crystallization, protein with an N-terminal His-tag was prepared. Briefly, the argF′bf gene was PCR amplified from the plasmid pARGFbf with the primers AGCCCGGGACATATGAAGAAATTTACTTGCGTACAAG and GCGGATCCTCATGGTAGATTTTCCAGCAGTC and cloned into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen). The inserted gene was sequenced and was found to have a point mutation causing a single amino acid substitution (T242L) that probably resulted as a PCR artifact. A mutation changing amino acid 90 from proline to glutamate was introduced into the gene encoding the T242L protein using the “QuikChange” mutagenesis kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the fidelity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A single primer TGGACGGTGACAAAGAGGAACATCTGCTGGAAG was used. Both genes were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen), and the proteins were purified in two steps using nickel-affinity and DEAE columns (GE Healthcare). Enzymatic Assays—The carbamylation of a potential second substrate (l-ornithine, N-acetyl-l-ornithine, or N-succinyl-l-ornithine) was assayed using a modified colorimetric method that detects the formation of a ureido group (7.Morizono H. Tuchman M. Rajagopal B.S. McCann M.T. Listrom C.D. Yuan X. Venugopal D. Barany G. Allewell N.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The method has been successfully used to detect carbamylaspartate formation by aspartate transcarbamylase (8.Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), citrulline formation by OTCase (7.Morizono H. Tuchman M. Rajagopal B.S. McCann M.T. Listrom C.D. Yuan X. Venugopal D. Barany G. Allewell N.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and N-acetyl-l-citrulline formation by N-acetyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase (AOTCase (3.Morizono H.

N-Succinyl-l-ornithine, N-succinyl-l-citrulline, and N-acetyl-l-citrulline were chemically synthesized by Chiral Quest Co. (Monmouth Junction, NJ) Their structures and purity were verified by infrared and NMR analysis. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Unless otherwise indicated, enzymatic assays were performed with the wild-type protein. Reactions were performed in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.3) containing 1 μmol of carbamyl phosphate (CP) with varying amounts of the second substrate and 0.2 μg of the protein. The assay solution was incubated at 298 K for 5 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of fresh colorimetric reagent consisting of a 2,3-butanedione monoxime and antipyrine mixture described previously (7.Morizono H. Tuchman M. Rajagopal B.S. McCann M.T. Listrom C.D. Yuan X. Venugopal D. Barany G. Allewell N.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The assay tubes were protected from light by a tinfoil cover, and incubated overnight at 298 K. Final color development was performed by uncovering the samples for 20 min in a 315 K water bath illuminated by a lamp. Details on optimizing color development are provided in Pastra-Landis et al. (8.Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Color was read at λ = 466 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Standard curves were generated using a range of l-citrulline, N-acetyl-l-citrulline, and N-succinyl-l-citrulline concentrations. Measurements were collected in triplicate. NMR of Enzyme Reaction Product—3 mg of purified wild-type enzyme was transferred into a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) using three rounds of centrifugation with a Millipore Microcon YM30 spin filter according to the manufacturer's directions. 0.44 μg of the protein was reacted with 13.17 mm CP and 5 mm N-succinyl-l-ornithine dissolved in aliquots of the same buffer at pH 8.3. After overnight incubation at 298 K, the enzyme was removed by centrifugation through a Millipore Microcon YM30 filter. Boiled enzyme was used as a negative control. 2 μg of CP, N-succinyl-l-ornithine, and chemically synthesized N-succinyl-l-citrulline standards were dissolved in the phosphate buffer used for the enzyme assay. The enzymatically and chemically synthesized N-succinyl-l-citrulline and N-succinyl-l-ornithine were subjected to three rounds of lyophilization and resuspension in D2O prior to analysis to suppress the residual proton (1H) water signals. One-dimensional 1H NMR was performed using a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a TXI probe with Z gradient, at 500.13 MHz at 298 ± 0.5 K. Chemical shifts were calibrated with sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propane sulfonate as an external reference of 0 ppm at the same temperature. NMR line assignments were based on the similarities (within 2 Hz) in the one-dimensional 1H chemical shifts between the model compounds (chemically synthesized N-succinyl-l-citrulline, N-succinyl-l-ornithine) and the enzymatically synthesized product, at identical pH, ionic strength, and temperature. LC-MS Detection of Reaction Products—0.2 μg of enzyme was incubated with 1 μmol of CP and 5 μmol of N-succinyl-l-ornithine in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) at 298 K and the reaction terminated after 5 min with the addition of 1 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid (w/v). Enzyme that had been boiled 5 min was used under identical conditions as a negative control. Samples were centrifuged 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove precipitated protein. 10 μl of the reaction solution was analyzed using an Agilent LC-MS 1100 as described previously (3.Morizono H. Cabrera-Luque J. Shi D. Gallegos R. Yamaguchi S. Yu X. Allewell N.M. Malamy M.H. Tuchman M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2974-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protonated N-succinyl-l-ornithine has an m/z of 233.2, and the m/z of N-succinyl-l-citrulline is 276.1. Crystallization and Data Collection—Extensive efforts to prepare substrate-bound crystals by soaking and co-crystallization of protein expressed from pARGFbf failed. In retrospect, this is not surprising, since structure determinations of known transcarbamylases indicate that substrate binding induces large conformational changes (2.Shi D. Morizono H. Yu X.

In addition, the C-terminal His-tag that is clearly visible in one monomer of the phosphate-bound structure contributes to favorable crystal packing but only in the absence of substrates (4.Shi D. Gallegos R. DePonte 3rd, J. Morizono H. Yu X. Allewell N.M. Malamy M. Tuchman M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To solve this problem, N-terminal His-tagged protein was prepared. The protein (T242L mutant) was concentrated to ∼25 mg/ml and supplemented with ∼10 mm N-succinyl-l-norvaline (SNO), a non-reactive structural analog of N-succinyl-l-ornithine, or ∼10 mm CP plus ∼10 mm SNO for crystallization screening using the hanging drop method. The best diffracting crystals of the CP+SNO-bound form were obtained by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution with 2 μl of the well solution containing 56% tacsimate (pH 7.0), while those of the SO4+SNO-bound protein were obtained from a well solution containing 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m BisTris (pH 5.5). Protein without a His-tag was also prepared by digestion with thrombin, but crystals of this protein were of poorer quality. Diffraction data for the CP+SNO- and SO4+SNO-bound proteins were collected from a single crystal with a rotating-anode x-ray generator (Rikagu). The crystals were cryoprotected by adding 25% ethylene glycerol to the well solution for the CP+SNO-bound form and replacing the well solution with 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 m BisTris (pH 5.5) for the SO4+SNO-bound form. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the software package HKL2000 (12.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and reduced using the program TRUNCATE in the CCP4 suite (13.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to tetragonal space group P43 with unit cell parameters: a = b = 156.42, c = 120.65 Å for CP+SNO-bound form. Data collection parameters are listed in Table 1. Reasonable values for the packing density calculation (14.Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). A Z-score of 22.7 in the space group P43 confirms the molecular replacement solution. Rigid-body refinement of this model brought the R factor down to 41.0%. Structure factors were calculated to 6.0 Å resolution and phases were extended to 2.8 Å resolution by solvent flattening and 6-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging using the program DM in the CCP4 package (13.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The calculated electron density was sufficient to allow most residues to be built, including those in the 80 loop. One complete subunit was built using the program O (17.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The model was subjected to 1000 steps of simulated annealing refinement with a starting temperature of 2500 K under strict NCS restraints using CNS version 1.1 (18.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Crosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L. Simonson M.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). This refinement lowered the R factor to 30.5%. SO4 and SNO were clearly visible (Fig. 1) and were built into the model. Further cycles of simulated annealing, individual B factor refinement, manual model adjustment, and modeling of waters and sulfate ions lowered the crystallographic R factor to 21.7% (free R factor 26.1%). The CP+SNO-bound structure was refined using similar procedures to a final crystallographic R factor of 20.4% (free R factor of 22.9%). The bound CP and SNO molecules, as well as the conformation of surrounding active site residues, are all well defined. Figs. 1 and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 were drawn using programs MOLSCRIPT (20.Kraulis P.J.

Gallegos R. DePonte 3rd, J. Morizono H. Yu X. Allewell N.M. Malamy M. Tuchman M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), no complementation by this gene of OTCase deficient mutants of E. coli could be detected. By contrast, when the B. fragilis expression vector containing the argF′bf gene was introduced into JDP3a.3 or JDP3a.4, the cells no longer required arginine for growth in the defined medium. These results confirmed that the argFbf is essential for endogenous production of arginine in B. fragilis. The fact that it could not complement an argF (OTCase)-deficient E. coli suggested that it is unlikely to encode an OTCase and that B. fragilis may possess a different pathway for arginine biosynthesis. Specificity of Transcarbamylation Activity—The substrate specificity for the formation of a ureido-containing product by the purified argF′bf protein is shown in Table 2. Both the wild-type protein and T242L mutant protein (which resulted from a cloning artifact) carbamylate N-succinyl-l-ornithine with similar efficiency but do not carbamylate l-ornithine or N-acetyl-l-ornithine. Both enzymes showed similar catalytic properties including substrate inhibition at 20 mm N-succinyl-l-ornithine, half-maximal activities for the same substrate at 3.2 and 2.9 mm, respectively, and similar catalytic velocities as shown in Table 2. By contrast, introduction of a single P90E amino acid substitution generated an enzyme capable of carbamylation of N-acetyl-l-ornithine at a rate ∼7-times greater than N-succinyl-l-ornithine, thus practically converting it from a N-succinyl-l-ornithine transcarbamylase (SOTCase) to an AOTCase.TABLE 2Substrate specificity of purified enzymesSpecific activityArgF′bfproteinl-OrnithineN-Acetyl-l-ornithineN-Succinyl-l-ornithineμmol/min/mgWild-typeNDND238.4 ± 17.2T242L mutantNDND195.5 ± 9.0T242L/P90E mutantND11.9 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab N-Succinyl-l-citrulline Is the Reaction Product—The peaks seen in the proton NMR spectra of the enzymatically generated product have chemical shifts that are identical to those of the chemically synthesized N-succinyl-l-citrulline (Fig. 2A). Similarly, in the analysis by LC-MS, the retention time and mass ion of the enzymatically synthesized product are identical to those of the chemically synthesized N-succinyl-l-citrulline (Fig. 2B). These two different methods confirm that upon incubation of the new protein with CP and N-succinyl-l-ornithine, N-succinyl-l-citrulline is formed. Structural Model of SOTCase—The structures of the B. fragilis SOTCase T242L mutant complexed with CP+SNO, and SO4+SNO have been solved at 2.9 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. The electron densities of the ligands are shown in Fig. 1. We used SNO as a non-reactive ligand since it has a structure similar to N-succinyl-l-ornithine but without the reactive δ-amino group. Norvaline and N-acetyl-l-norvaline, structural analogs of ornithine and N-acetyl-l-ornithine, respectively, have been successfully used in a similar fashion for OTCase and AOTCase structural studies (24.Shi D.

Proteins. 2006; 64: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The final structural model of the CP+SNO-bound enzyme consists of six monomers with a total of 1922 amino acids, 6 CP, 6 SNO, 2 SO4, and 177 water molecules. The two trimers in the asymmetric unit are related by a 2-fold NCS axis in the crystal. The concave surfaces of the two trimers are packed face to face, with their respective 3-fold NCS axes tilted at an angle of ∼10° relative to each other, so that the two trimers interact only through two subunits (Fig. 3A). The structures of the monomers are very similar with a RMS difference <0.17 Å. Since the recombinant protein has an N-terminal His-tag with a thrombin cleavage site, the electron density map shows three additional N-terminal residues (Gly-Ser-His) in chains X and Y and two residues (Ser-His) in chain Z, C, D, and E before the authentic initial methionine. The overall g value of 0.26 indicates good geometry. All the main-chain, side-chain, and planar group parameters assessed with PROCHECK (26.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) are comparable with those in structures at similar resolution in the PDB. Residues Glu142 and Leu275 are in energetically unfavorable conformations, as we have observed in the phosphate-bound structure (4.Shi D. Gallegos R. DePonte 3rd, J. Morizono H. Yu X. Allewell N.M. Malamy M. Tuchman M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There is one cis peptide bond between Leu275 and Pro276 in each chain that maintains the His273-Cys274-Leu275-Pro276 (HCLP) motif in a conformation characteristic of all known transcarbamylases. The substituted residue 242 is located within the 240 loop, and its side chain is on the protein surface, suggesting that it does not affect the normal structure of the protein. Since the CP+SNO and SO4+SNO-bound structures are very similar (r.m.s. difference of 0.19 Å), the subsequent results and discussion are based on the CP+SNO structure. Active Site of SOTCase—The two structural domains of the monomer (CP domain and SNO domain) are linked by two helices (Fig. 3B) as in other known transcarbamylases (2.Shi D. Morizono H. Yu X. Roth L.

https://openalex.org/W2027371933,"Voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav) 2.2 currents are potentiated by phorbol-12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA), whereas Cav 2.3 currents are increased by both PMA and acetyl-β-methylcholine (MCh). MCh-selective sites were identified in the α1 2.3 subunit, whereas the identified PMA sites responded to both PMA and MCh (Kamatchi, G. L., Franke, R., Lynch, C., III, and Sando, J. J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 4102–4109; Fang, H., Franke, R., Patanavanich, S., Lalvani, A., Powell, N. K., Sando, J. J., and Kamatchi, G. L. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 23559–23565). The hypothesis that PMA sites in the α1 2.2 subunit are homologous to the PMA-responsive sites in α1 2.3 subunit was tested with Ser/Thr → Ala mutations in the α1 2.2 subunit. WT α1 2.2 or mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes in combination with β1b and α2/δ subunits. Inward current (IBa) was recorded using Ba2+ as the charge carrier. T422A, S1757A, S2108A, or S2132A decreased the PMA response. In contrast, S425A increased the response to PMA, and thus, it was considered an inhibitory site. Replacement of each of the identified stimulatory Ser/Thr sites with Asp increased the basal current and decreased the PMA-induced enhancement, consistent with regulation by phosphorylation at these sites. Multiple mutant combinations showed (i) greater inhibition than that caused by the single Ala mutations; (ii) that enhancement observed when Thr-422 and Ser-2108 are available may be inhibited by the presence of Ser-425; and (iii) that the combination of Thr-422, Ser-2108, and either Ser-1757 or Ser-2132 can provide a greater response to PMA when Ser-425 is replaced with Ala. The homologous sites inα1 2.2 andα1 2.3 subunits seem to be functionally different. The existence of an inhibitory phosphorylation site in the I-II linker seems to be unique to the α1 2.2 subunit.

The voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav) 2The abbreviations used are: Cav, voltage-gated calcium channels; PMA, phorbol-12-myristate, 13-acetate; MCh, acetyl-β-methylcholine; PKC, protein kinase C; WT, wild type.2The abbreviations used are: Cav, voltage-gated calcium channels; PMA, phorbol-12-myristate, 13-acetate; MCh, acetyl-β-methylcholine; PKC, protein kinase C; WT, wild type. are complex proteins composed of α1, β, α2/δ, and sometimes γ subunits. These channels are divided into three families (Cav 1–3) based on the sequence homology of the α1 subunits. The α1 1.0 family encodes the L-type channels; α1 2.1. encodes P/Q-type channels; α1 2.2 encodes N-type channels; α1 2.3 encodes R-type channels; and α1 3.0 encodes T-type channels (3.Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Tsien R.W. Catterall W.A.

The α1 subunit is the largest, and it incorporates the conduction pore, the voltage sensor, and the gating apparatus. The β, α2/δ, and γ subunits are collectively called the auxiliary subunits, and they dramatically influence the surface expression of the channels and the kinetics of the current (5.Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The intracellular segments of the α1 subunit, viz., the N and C termini and the intracellular loops between domains I and II, II and III, and III and IV, possess the binding/recognition sites for second messengers such as G protein βγ subunits or intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) as well as sites that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) (6.Stea A.

Cav channels respond differently to various activators of PKC. In the oocyte expression system, phorbol-12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA) did not affect Cav 1.2c or 2.1 currents, whereas Cav 2.2 and 2.3 currents were potentiated. In contrast, acetyl-β-methylcholine (MCh) potentiated Cav 2.3 currents, decreased Cav 1.2c currents, and failed to modulate Cav 2.1 or 2.2 currents (1.Kamatchi G.L. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Involvement of various PKC isozymes was suggested in the potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents (10.Kamatchi G.L. Tiwari S.N. Chan C.K. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M.E. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since the auxiliary subunits used in our studies were the same, the source of the differential responses to PMA or MCh may be the α1 subunits. It is possible that PKC phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr) with varying selectivity to PKC isozymes exist in the α1 subunit. Since Cav 2.3 currents are potentiated by MCh or PMA and Cav 2.2 currents are increased by PMA only, we hypothesized that (i) the α1 2.3 subunit has both MCh-selective (Ser-888, Ser-892, Ser-894, and Ser-1987) and PMA-selective (Thr-365, Ser-369, Thr-879, Ser-1995, and Ser-2011) potential PKC phosphorylation sites; (ii) the α1 2.2 subunit has PMA-selective sites (Thr-422, Ser-425, Ser-926, Ser-2108, and Ser-2132) only; and (iii) the PMA-selective sites of α1 2.2 and 2.3 subunits are homologous. Our hypothesis about the MCh-selective sites was supported by the observation that Ala substitution of these sites in the α1 2.3 subunit inhibited the MCh response while leaving the response to PMA intact (1.Kamatchi G.L. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, our subsequent studies revealed that Ala substitution of PMA-selective sites inhibited both MCh-induced and PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents (2.Fang H. Franke R. Patanavanich S. Lalvani A. Powell N.K. Sando J.J. Kamatchi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23559-23565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The contribution of individual sites to PMA-stimulated current in the Cav 2.2 channels was examined in this study. These sites were mutated to Ala, the mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the response to PMA was examined. The results revealed that for the most part, these PMA-selective sites of α1 2.2 subunits responded differently from their homologous sites of the α1 2.3 subunits. Construction of Mutants—We used the splice variant 37b of the α1 2.2 subunit from the rat superior cervical ganglion in this study (11.Lin Z. Haus S. Edgerton J. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The selected Ser/Thr were mutated to Ala by primer extension employing PCR with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutations were used to extend the template, the wild type α1 2.2 subunit (37b) cDNA subcloned in the pcDNA 6 (Invitrogen). The PCR product was treated with DpnI, a restriction enzyme specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA to digest the template DNA. The digested PCR product was transformed in Escherichia coli using the protocol from the supplier, and the DNA from the selected transformants was processed for sequencing. The whole coding region of the construct was sequenced (Biomolecular Research Facility, University of Virginia) to confirm the planned mutation and the absence of unwarranted mutations contributed by the PCR reaction. Harvesting of Oocytes and cDNA Injection—Mature female Xenopus laevis frogs were obtained from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI), housed in an established frog colony, and fed regular frog brittle on alternate days. For the removal of oocytes, a frog was anesthetized in 500 ml of 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma) in water until unresponsive to a painful stimulus. The anesthetized frog was placed supine on ice, and an incision of ∼1.5 cm in length was made through both the skin and the muscle layers of one lower abdominal quadrant. A section of the ovary was exteriorized, and a lobule of oocytes (∼500) was removed. The wound was closed in two layers, and the animal was allowed to recover from anesthesia, kept in a separate tank overnight, and returned to the colony the following day. The oocytes were washed twice in calcium-free OR2 solution (in mm: 82.5 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5) and transferred to OR2 solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (type 1A; Sigma). The dish containing the oocytes in collagenase solution was agitated for a period of 2–3 h at room temperature to remove the follicular cell layer. Defolliculation was confirmed by microscopic examination. Following this, the oocytes were washed in OR2 solution and transferred to modified Barth's solution (in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. The oocytes were allowed to recover by incubation at 16 °C for 3–10 h before cDNA injection. Nuclear (germinal vesicle) injection was performed (Drummond Nanoject, Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA) using 3 ng of 1:1:1 mix (molar ratio) of Cav α1 2.2, β1B, and α2/δ cDNA subunits. The oocytes were returned to Barth's solution and incubated at 16 °C for 6–8 days before the recording of current. Current Recording—Macroscopic currents, with Ba2+ (IBa) as the charge carrier, were recorded employing a two-electrode voltage clamp technique using oocyte clamp OC-725C (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). The amplifier was linked to an interface and an IBM-PC-compatible computer equipped with pClamp software (version 8.2; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) for data acquisition and analysis. Leak currents were subtracted using the P/4 procedure. Microelectrodes with an agarose cushion were filled with 3 m CsCl; typical resistances were 0.5–2.5 megaohms. KCl-agar bridges were used as ground electrodes to minimize any junction potential attributable to changes in ionic composition of the bath solution. The oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (∼500-μl volume) superfused with the recording solution containing (in mm): 40 Ba(OH)2, 50 NaOH, 2 KOH, 5 HEPES, using methanesulfonate as the anion to adjust the pH to 7.4. Niflumic acid (0.4 mm) was included to block intrinsic Cl channels. Oocytes were held at –80 mV before being depolarized to 0 mV, the test potential for a duration of 850 ms. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship in oocytes expressing the wild type Cav 2.2 channel or the mutant was determined wherever necessary. The I-V was recorded for a duration of 450 ms using step depolarizations from –50 to 100 mV in 10-mV increments. Drug Treatment—All of the oocytes exhibiting IBa greater than 400 nA underwent control, treatment, and wash protocols. The control IBa was recorded at the 8th min after the oocyte was impaled. Following the recording of the control IBa, PMA was perfused for 60 s, and the current was recorded after another 60 s, thus exposing the oocyte to the agonist for a period of 2 min. Chemicals—PMA (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO (0.05%). The concentrated stock solution of PMA was stored frozen at –20 °C and was diluted to the final concentration in the recording solution on the day of the experiment. To block endogenous Cl– currents, niflumic acid (Sigma) was added to the recording solution, which was stirred overnight in order for it to dissolve. Data Analysis—The data are shown as means ±S.E., unless otherwise indicated. The current represented the maximum amplitude of the inward current. The current inactivation rate was fit by a single exponential function using the equation y=A∗ exp(−t/τ)+C where A is the coefficient of the exponential, t is time (in ms), τ is the time constant (in ms), and C is the fraction of residual current. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test or paired t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Selection of Potential PKC Phosphorylation Sites—The strategy employed for the selection of potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the α1 2.2 subunit was described in detail previously (1.Kamatchi G.L. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sites were chosen based on the existence of a linear and/or helical motif for PKC recognition and sequence differences between the various Cav α1 subunits. These potential PKC phosphorylation sites of the α1 2.2 subunit were chosen from the intracellular regions (a total of 13 regions) only, as they could be expected to have access to PKC. A set of six potential PKC phosphorylation sites (Thr-422 and Ser-425 of I-II linker, Thr-926 of II-III linker and Ser-1757, Ser-2108 and Ser-2132 of the C terminus) was identified in the α1 2.2 subunit (see Fig. 4). These sites, except Ser-1757, are homologous to the PMA-selective sites in the α1 2.3 subunit shown before (1.Kamatchi G.L. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2.Fang H. Franke R. Patanavanich S. Lalvani A. Powell N.K. Sando J.J. Kamatchi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23559-23565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ser-1757 appears to be a potential PKC site in exon 37b of the α1 2.2 subunit, the splice variant used in this study, and not in exon 37a, present exclusively in the α1 2.2 subunits of dorsal root ganglia neurons (12.Bell T.J. Thaler C. Castiglioni A.J. Helton T.D. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 2004; 41: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Differential Responses to PMA with Single Ser/Thr → Ala Substitutions of Potential PKC Phosphorylation Sites in the Cav α1 2.2 Subunit—PMA (100 nm) significantly increased the current through the Cav 2.2 channels expressed in the oocytes. The average increase in the Cav 2.2 currents was 33.1 ± 0.52% (mean ± S.E.; n = 321). The contribution of the selected potential PKC phosphorylation sites, Thr-422, Ser-425, Thr-926, Ser-1757, Ser-2108, and Ser-2132, to the PMA-induced increase in the Cav 2.2 current was examined from the responses of their Ala mutants. Three types of responses were observed when these Ala mutants were challenged with PMA. (i) T422A, S1757A, S2108A, or S2132A significantly decreased the response to PMA as compared with the respective Cav 2.2 WT; the response produced by these Ala mutants was between 40 and 60% if the response of WT to PMA is normalized to 100% as shown in Table 1. (ii) Mutation of Thr-926 to Ala did not alter the PMA response. (iii) S425A significantly increased the response of PMA to 135% (Fig. 1 and Table 1A).TABLE 1Effect of mutations of the potential PKC phosphorylation sites on PMA (100 nm)-induced increase in the Cav2.2 current The currents were expressed with α1 2.2 WT or the indicated mutant with β1B and α2/δ subunits in Xenopus oocytes. The parallel WT PMA responses were combined, and the average was normalized to 100%; the PMA data from the mutants were corrected accordingly. The statistical significance was obtained by comparing the mutants with the parallel WT control. The effect of Thr-926 is not shown in this table as it failed to modify the PMA-induced current (Fig. 1).a, p < 0.001, b, p < 0.01, c, p < 0.02, d, p < 0.05 compared with WT, Student's t test.***, p < 0.001, **, p < 0.01, *, p < 0.02 as compared with single Ala mutation, paired Student's t test.1 p < 0.001 as compared with S1757A/S2108A or S2108A/S2132A, Student's t test.2 p < 0.01 as compared with T422A/S1757A/S2108A or T422A/S2108A/S2132A, Student's t test.3 p < 0.02 as compared with T422A, Student's t test.4 p < 0.05 as compared with S1757A/S2108A/S2132A, Student's t test.# p < 0.01 as compared with S425A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A, Student's t test.NS, not significant as compared with single Ala substitutions, paired Student's t test.FIGURE 1Single and quintuple Ala substitution of potential PKC phosphorylation sites differentially modulate the potentiation of expressed Cav 2.2 currents by PMA (100 nm).

I-II Linker and C-terminal Residues Act Differently—Various combinations of mutations in the form of quintuple, quadruple, triple, and double mutants comprising all the selected PKC phosphorylation sites, except Thr-926, were constructed to examine the role of these sites in the PMA-induced increase in the Cav 2.2 currents. The kinetic properties of the Cav 2.2 currents appear not to have changed in the mutant constructs as revealed by the results of the quintuple mutant T422A/S425A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A. A prototype current trace with the quintuple mutant is shown in Fig. 1. The peak IBa was observed at 7.1 ± 1.8 mV for WT and 8.6 ± 1.4 mV (means ± S.E.; n = 7) for the quintuple mutant. The peak current amplitude was observed at 91.6 ± 1.4 ms for the WT and 90 ± 1.4 ms (means ± S.E., n = 8) for the quintuple mutant. Analysis of the I-V plot revealed that the IBa appeared at –30 mV and reversed at 62.4 ± 1.2 mV in the WT and at 62.4 ± 1.0 mV (means ± S.E.; n = 7) in the quintuple mutant. The inactivation properties of the currents in the oocytes expressing the quintuple mutant were compared with those of the Cav 2.2 WT. IBa through the WT (inactivating current (A1) = 981 ± 222 nA (75 ± 2.8% of total current), τ = 302 ± 31 ms and non-inactivating residual current (R) = 308 ± 58 nA (mean ± S.E.; n = 8)), and the quintuple mutant (A1 = 947 ± 187 nA (79 ± 2.8% of total current), τ = 302 ± 37 ms and r = 211 ± 25 (mean ± S.E.; n = 8)) channels showed mono-exponential inactivation. The V½ for activation for WT and the quintuple mutant were 2.5 ± 1.6 and 3.6 ± 1.7 mV (mean ± S.E.; n = 7), respectively; the V½ for inactivation were 47.7 ± 1.5 and 43.6 ± 3.0 mV for WT and the quintuple mutant, respectively. Similarly, none of the other mutants significantly modified the kinetic properties of the currents (data not shown). The quintuple mutant resulted in a significantly decreased response to PMA as compared with Cav 2.2 WT. The effect of PMA in the quintuple mutant was between 40 and 50% of that produced by the single Ala mutation of Thr-422, Ser-1757, Ser-2108, or Ser-2132 (Fig. 1 and Table 1B). However, the PMA response in the double mutation of the I-II linker residues (T422A/S425A) was nearly equivalent to that of the WT (Table 1B). This result suggests two possibilities. (i) Removal of a stimulatory site at Thr-422 may be countered by the removal of an inhibitory site at Ser-425, and (ii) the presence of the three selected C-terminal sites (in the double mutant T422A/S425A) is sufficient for the normal PMA response. Conversely, the absence of C-terminal residues in the form of triple mutation (S1757A/S2108A/S2132A) decreased the PMA response significantly as compared with the Cav 2.2 WT. The PMA response in the triple mutant S1757A/S2108A/S2132A was identical to that of the quintuple mutant and was significantly lower than that produced by the single Ala mutation of C-terminal sites (Table 1B). To investigate the role of Thr-422 versus Ser-425 in combination with the C-terminal sites, quadruple mutants were constructed by including all three C-terminal sites with either Thr-422 or Ser-425. The effect of PMA on the quadruple mutants T422A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A and S425A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A revealed differential roles of Thr-422 and Ser-425 as follows. (i) Both of the quadruple mutants showed significant loss of PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.2 currents as compared with Cav 2.2 WT, (ii) T422A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A showed a greater loss of the PMA effect than did S425A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A (Table 1C), (iii) T422A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A showed a greater loss of the PMA response than did any single Ala substitution (Table 1C), and (iv) the PMA response of S425A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A was significantly greater than that produced by the triple mutation of the C-terminal sites (S1757A/S2108A/S2132A) (Table 1C). Since T422A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A produced greater inhibition of the PMA response than did single Ala substitutions, combined triple and double mutations of these sites were constructed to narrow down the residues required for the action of PMA. The triple mutants constructed were functional, and their response to PMA was as follows. (i) All three triple mutants, T422A/S1757A/S2108A, T422A/S1757A/S2132A, and T422A/S2108A/S2132A showed significant decrease in the response to PMA, and (ii) the response to PMA in T422A/S1757A/S2132A was lower than that of the single Ala mutants and significantly less than that of the other triple mutants (Table 1D). The additional inhibition seen with the triple mutant T422A/S1757A/S2132A suggests that the remaining site Ser-2108 is unable to respond to PMA on its own or that it is selectively blocked by Ser-425. Thus, the quadruple mutant T422A/S425A/S1757A/S2132A was constructed so that the effect of Ser-2108 alone might be examined. The effect of PMA was partially blocked as compared with the WT when Ser-2108 was the only site available (T422A/S425A/S1757A/S2132A); the PMA response in this quadruple mutant was similar to the effect of PMA in the single Ala mutation of Ser-2108 (Table 1D). Thus, Ser-2108 contributes some but not all of the PMA responsiveness. Ser-425 may be considered an inhibitory site based on the following observations. (i) Ala substitution of Ser-425 increased the response to PMA (Fig. 1 and Table 1A); (ii) there was normal PMA response in the double mutant T422A/S425A (Table 1B); (iii) the PMA response was greater in the quadruple mutant S425A/S1757A/S2108A/S2132A than in the triple mutation (S1757A/S2108A/S2132A) of C-terminal sites (Table 1, B and C); and (iv) the PMA response of T422A was significantly lower than that of the double mutant T422A/S425A (Fig. 1 and Table 1, A and B). Based on the above comparisons, it appears that the response of some C-terminal sites in addition to Thr-422 may be inhibited by Ser-425. Thus, several mutants were constructed by combining Ser-425 and the C-terminal sites to identify the sites involved in the interaction with Ser-425. Three triple mutants, combining S425A and any two C-terminal site mutations (thus leaving Thr-422 and any one C-terminal site), were constructed. Among these triple mutants, S425A/S1757A/S2108A showed small basal currents (100–200 nA). Thus, this construct was considered a poor expressor. Both S425A/S1757A/S2132A and S425A/S2108A/S2132A showed decreased PMA response as compared with the WT (Table 1E). It seems that the availability of Thr-422 and any one potential C-terminal site in these triple mutants is insufficient to reproduce the increased PMA response seen in S425A (Fig. 1 and Table 1A). Two C-terminal sites in addition to Thr-422 may be required to reproduce the effect of S425A. Thus, we constructed three double mutants combining S425A and any one C-terminal site. All of these double mutants were functional and exhibited differential responses to PMA. The response of two of the double mutants was similar to that of S425A. Both S425A/S1757A and S425A/S2132A reproduced the effect of S425A as PMA-induced current in these mutants was significantly greater than that in the WT. In contrast, there was no increased PMA response in the double mutant S425A/S2108A. Thus, Ser-2108 may be another site required for the increased PMA response but insufficient, by itself, for PMA-stimulated enhancement of current. In addition, one more site, either Ser-1757 or Ser-2132, may be required for the increased current (Fig. 2 and Table 1E). On the other hand, the stimulatory effects of both Thr-422 and Ser-2108 appear to be blocked when Ser-425 is available (Table 1, B and D). However, none of the mutants constructed so far were suitable to examine the effect of Ser-425 when both Thr-422 and Ser-2108 (and Ser-1757 or Ser-2132) are present together. Thus, double mutants comprising any two C-terminal sites were constructed. These double mutants left both I-II linker residues (Thr-422 and Ser-425) and any one C-terminal site available. All three double mutants S1757A/S2108A, S1757A/S2132A, and S2108A/S2132A showed significant inhibition of the response to PMA as compared with WT (Table 1F). However, the inhibition produced by S1757A/S2132A was markedly greater as compared with that of the other two double mutants, S1757A/S2108A or S2108A/S2132A (Table 1F). Thus, it appears that the effects of both Thr-422 and Ser-2108 but not of Ser-1757 or Ser-2132 are blocked by the presence of Ser-425 (see Fig. 4). The contribution of Thr-422, Ser-1757, Ser-2108, and Ser-2132 in PMA-induced increase in the Cav 2.2 currents and the inhibitory action of Ser-425 were analyzed by mutating these residues to Asp to mimic the negative charge of a phosphorylated residue. The IBa through Asp mutants and the Cav 2.2 WT were analyzed in parallel. As compared with the WT, the IBa through T422D, S1757D, and S2108D were significantly greater. The IBa with the S2132D was also greater than the WT, although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.104) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, S425D did not cause a significant change in basal current. The PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.2 current was significantly reduced in all of these mutants, consistent with the increase in the basal IBa (Fig. 3B). Potential PKC Phosphorylation Sites in the α1 2.2 Subunit Are Functionally Different from Their Homologues in the α1 2.3 Subunit—We have observed that Cav 2.2 currents are potentiated by PMA. Others have reported similar PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.2 currents and suggested that PKC is the mediator of this action (6.Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The loss or decrease in the action of PMA with Ala substitution of potential PKC phosphorylation sites in various Cav channels further supports the contribution of PKC to the increased current (1.Kamatchi G.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similarly, in this study, Ala substitution of Thr-422, Ser-1757, Ser-2108, and Ser-2132 led to a decrease in the PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.2 current. The contribution of these sites to phosphorylation-induced modulation of the current is further supported by the observation that Asp substitution of these sites to mimic the negative charge of a phosphate group led to an increase in the basal current as well as a decrease in the effect of PMA (Fig. 3). It was suggested that Thr-422 and Ser-425 were the potential PKC phosphorylation sites in an earlier study (using rat brain α1 2.2, β1B, and α2/δ cDNA subunits) that employed patch clamp and a mammalian expression system (TSA 201 cells) (7.Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In that study, single Ala substitution of either Thr-422 or Ser-425 failed to modulate PMA-induced increase in the Cav 2.2 currents, whereas double Ala substitution of Thr-422 and Ser-425 almost totally blocked the effect of PMA. The different results seen in our study may be due to the use of the α1 2.2 subunit from the superior cervical ganglion and the different expression system employed. Consistent with our results in the Cav 2.2 channels, Ala substitution of α1 2.3 Thr-365, the homologue of α1 2.2 Thr-422, decreased both PMA-induced and MCh-induced increases in Cav 2.3 currents. In contrast, Ala substitution of α1 2.3 Thr-879, Ser-1995, and Ser-2011, the sites homologous to α1 2.2 Thr-926, Ser-2108, and Ser-2132, failed to modulate the effect of PMA or MCh on Cav 2.3 currents (2.Fang H. Franke R. Patanavanich S. Lalvani A. Powell N.K. Sando J.J. Kamatchi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23559-23565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The increase in the PMA-induced current following the replacement of Ser-425 with Ala suggests that phosphorylation at this site may be inhibitory rather than stimulatory. The inhibitory effect of Ser-425 may be specific to the α1 2.2 subunit since Ala substitution of its homologue, Ser-369, in the α1 2.3 subunit failed to modulate Cav 2.3 currents (2.Fang H. Franke R. Patanavanich S. Lalvani A. Powell N.K. Sando J.J. Kamatchi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23559-23565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The inhibitory action of this site in the α1 2.2 subunit versus the α1 2.3 subunit may be due to (i) the amino acids adjacent to Ser-425 that may permit the phosphorylation by different PKC isozymes, (ii) a requirement for phosphorylation of other sites not available in the α1 2.3 subunit, and/or (iii) an interaction with other unique regions of the α1 2.2 subunit or associated regulatory factors/subunits distinct from those in Cav 2.3 channels. Conversely, a potential inhibitory action of this site of the α1 2.3 homologue may be blocked by other parts of the α1 2.3 subunit or unique channel cofactors/regulatory subunits. The inhibitory action of Ser-425 in the α1 2.2 subunit is the first of its kind reported in the Cav channel family, and this may potentially be relevant to some of the differences between the members of Cav 2.0 family. Ser-425 May Modulate the Effects of Other Potential PKC Phosphorylation Sites—The inhibitory action of Ser-425 may have caused the additional inhibition in the triple and double mutants since it is the only common site available in these mutants. Ser-425 seems to block the effects of Thr-422 and Ser-2108 since there was greater inhibition of PMA response whenever either one (Table 1, B and D) or both (Table 1F) Thr-422 and Ser-2108 were present along with Ser-425. The evidence that both Thr-422 (Table 1C) and Ser-2108 (Table 1D) may act on their own is consistent with the above observation. Similarly, Thr-422 and Ser-2108 (along with Ser-1757 or Ser-2132) may have been responsible for the increased PMA response when Ser-425 was replaced with Ala (Table 1E). Cav 2.2 channels are critical for pain transduction. The contribution of Ser-1757 to the increased PMA response may be biologically significant. Ser-1757 is present in exon 37b, a splice variant of α1 2.2 from superior cervical ganglion. Ser-1757 is substituted by Ala in the exon 37a, the dorsal root ganglia-specific α1 2.2 subunit splice variant preferentially present in neurons that contain nociceptive markers, vanilloid receptor 1, and voltage-gated sodium (Nav 1.8) channels (12.Bell T.J. Thaler C. Castiglioni A.J. Helton T.D. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 2004; 41: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The differential localization of these two α1 2.2 subunit splice variants and the modulation of one of them by PKC phosphorylation may be relevant in the regulation of the signal transduction for pain. Thr-422, Ser-425, and Ser-2108 are homologous to Thr-365, Ser-369, and Ser-1995 of α1 2.3 subunit, and the latter set of Thr/Ser were responsible for PMA- or MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents (2.Fang H. Franke R. Patanavanich S. Lalvani A. Powell N.K. Sando J.J. Kamatchi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23559-23565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The regulation at these sites appears to be complex. The availability or phosphorylation state of one site may determine the availability or role of another, i.e. the phosphorylation events may be ordered. It is possible that in the WT, Ser-425 becomes phosphorylated and blocks the phosphorylation of Thr-422 and the C-terminal sites leading to a limited response to PMA. The observation that T422A or S2108A showed significant decrease in the response to PMA is supportive of this interpretation. The decrease in the PMA response following the Asp substitution of Ser-425 is consistent with this possibility (Fig. 3B). However, the existence of any ordered phosphorylation of the potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the α1 2.2 subunit is yet to be established. The combined action of Thr-422 or Ser-425 of the I-II linker with Ser-2108 and not Ser-1757 or Ser-2132 of the C terminus suggests specific functional interaction, either direct or indirect, between the I-II linker and the C terminus (Fig. 4). Such an action is analogous to the proposed interaction between the II-III linker and the C terminus in the α1 2.3 subunit (1.Kamatchi G.L. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

The 5′-m7GpppN structure of vaccinia virus mRNAs is formed by a virus-encoded two-subunit “capping enzyme” with RNA triphosphatase, RNA guanylyltransferase, and RNA (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase activities (1Martin S.A.

The methyltransferase domain consists of a heterodimer of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the vD1 subunit (vD1-C, spanning amino acids 540–844) and the 287-amino acid polypeptide encoded by the vaccinia D12 gene (3Cong P.

The architecture of the subunit interface in the poxvirus capping enzyme is undefined, as is the mechanism by which vD12 activates the catalytic subunit. Early studies indicated that vD12 did not affect the extent of UV-induced cross-linking of either AdoMet or GTP to the active site on the vD1-C subunit (19Higman M.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14982-14987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Niles E.G. Christen L. Higman M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9898-9903Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These findings, and subsequent studies of UV cross-linking to the 5′-guanylate of capped RNA (16Mao X. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6900-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggested an allosteric effect of vD12 at the active site. Because the vD12 protein is essential for vaccinia replication (21Carpenter M.S. DeLange A.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4042-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because there is no discernible homolog of vD12 in the known proteomes of any eukaryal organism (or of any virus besides the poxviruses), we proposed that vD12 and activated cap methylation are promising targets for antipoxviral drug discovery. To facilitate genetic and pharmacologic studies of the poxvirus capping enzymes, we have developed yeast-based systems in which cell growth depends on catalysis of cap synthesis by poxvirus proteins (17Saha N. Shuman S. Schwer B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7300-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We showed that the vaccinia cap methyltransferase domain can function in lieu of the essential yeast enzyme Abd1 and that its in vivo activity requires coexpression of the catalytic vD1-C and stimulatory vD12 subunits (17Saha N. Shuman S. Schwer B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7300-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The yeast complementation assay has been used as the primary screen to identify individual amino acids of the catalytic and regulatory subunits that are important for cap methylation in vivo (17Saha N. Shuman S. Schwer B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7300-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Schwer B. Shuman S. Virology. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a double-alanine scan covering 56 residues of the vD12 subunit identified two lethal mutations and 10 temperature-sensitive alleles. We used this mutant collection to perform a forward genetic screen for second-site suppressors, which defined a constellation of amino acids in vD1 at which mutations restored methyltransferase function in conjunction with defective vD12 proteins (23Schwer B. Shuman S. Virology. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Reference to the crystal structure of the microsporidian cap methyltransferase (14Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggested that distinct functional classes of suppressors were selected, including: (i) those that map to surface-exposed loops, which might comprise the physical subunit interface, and (ii) those in or near the substrate-binding sites, which might affect intersubunit allostery. However, none of the suppressors identified in the initial screen were able to bypass the requirement for vD12. Here, we performed a new genetic screen for vD1-(540–844) mutants that no longer require the stimulatory vD12 subunit to achieve the level of cap methylation required for yeast growth. We recovered bypass suppressor mutations at two vicinal residues, Tyr-752 and Asn-753, that map to the guanosine-binding pocket. We show that vD12 enhances the affinity of the catalytic subunit for the methyl donor and the methyl acceptor and also increases kcat. The bypass mutations stimulated both vD12-independent and vD12-dependent catalysis of cap methylation in vitro when compared with wild-type vD1-(540–844). Our results indicate that bypass suppression occurs via partial mimicry of the intersubunit allostery, and they highlight the plasticity of an RNA processing enzyme under selective pressure. The vD1-(540–844) gene fragment was PCR-amplified in vitro with Taq DNA polymerase. dATP was included as one-fourth of the concentration of the other dNTPs to enhance the frequency of deoxynucleotide misincorporation. The vD1-(540–844) PCR products from four separate amplification reactions (containing 0.05 or 0.1 mm dATP, with or without 0.1 mm MnCl2) were pooled, digested with EcoRI and XhoI endonucleases, and ligated into pYX232 (2μ TRP1). Ligation mixtures were transformed into Escherichia coli by electroporation, and a 2μ plasmid DNA library was isolated from a pool of ∼120,000 individual ampicillin-resistant bacterial transformants. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YBS40 is deleted at the chromosomal ABD1 locus encoding the yeast cap methyltransferase. Growth of YBS40 depends on the maintenance of plasmid p360A-ABD1(CEN URA3 ADE2 ABD1). abd1Δ cells were transformed with the 2μ vD1-(540–844) mutant library. Approximately 45,000 Trp+ yeast transformants were replicaplated to agar medium containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) and incubated at 25 °C to select for loss of the CEN URA3 ADE2 ABD1 plasmid. The FOA-resistant colonies were replica-plated again to agar medium containing FOA and incubated at 25 °C. Individual FOA-resistant colonies (n = 82) were tested for adenine auxotrophy to ensure loss of the CEN URA3 ADE2 ABD1 plasmid. Ade– abd1Δ isolates (n = 72) containing candidate bypass mutants (vD1-B alleles) were replica-plated on YPD agar at 19, 25, 30, and 34 °C. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the 19 yeast vD1-B strains that grew at all temperatures tested. The vD1-B plasmids were clonally amplified by transformation in E. coli. Plasmids isolated from single bacterial transformants were retested for suppression by transforming them into abd1Δ yeast followed by plasmid-shuffle at 25 °C and then gauging growth on YPD agar at 25, 30, 34 and 37 °C (see Fig. 1). The wild-type D1-(540–844) gene and mutant genes Y752S, Y752A, and N753I were PCR-amplified with primers that introduced a BglII site over the start codon and a XhoI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with BglII and XhoI and inserted into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-His10-Smt3. pET-His10Smt3-D1-(540–844) was transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3). Cultures (500 ml) derived from single transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.6. The cultures were adjusted to 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% ethanol, and incubation was continued for 20 h at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 500 μm and 100 μg/ml, respectively. After incubation on ice for 30 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were mixed for 30 min with 1 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.01% Triton X-100. The resins were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A, and poured into columns. The columns were washed with 10 ml of 20 mm imidazole in buffer A and then eluted stepwise with 1.5-ml aliquots of buffer A containing 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole. The 250 mm imidazole eluates containing the recombinant catalytic subunits were dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100) and then stored at –80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the vD1-(540–844) preparations in parallel with serial dilutions of a bovine serum albumin standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the vD1-(540–844) and bovine serum albumin polypeptides were quantified using a Fujifilm FLA-5000 digital imaging and analysis system. vD1-(540–844) concentrations were calculated by interpolation to the bovine serum albumin standard curve. pET-His10Smt3-D1-(540–844) plasmids encoding tagged wild-type and mutant catalytic subunits were transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) together with plasmid pET-D12 encoding the nontagged stimulatory subunit. The His10-Smt3-D1-(540–844) and vD12 proteins were produced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of 500-ml cultures grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The tagged vD1-C subunits and the associated vD12 subunit were purified from soluble extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography as described above. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, GTP, or GpppA as specified, [3H-CH3]AdoMet as specified, and enzyme were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Aliquots (4 μl) were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, which were developed with 0.2 m ammonium sulfate (for GTP methyl acceptor) or 0.05 m ammonium sulfate (for GpppA methyl acceptor). The AdoMet- and m7GTP- or m7GpppA-containing portions of the lanes were cut out, and the radioactivity in each was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Methyl Acceptor Titrations—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 μm [3H-CH3]AdoMet, increasing concentrations of GTP or GpppA, and wild-type or mutant vD1-C catalytic subunits or wild-type and mutant vD1-C/vD12 heterodimers. AdoMet Titrations—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 5 mm GTP, increasing concentrations of [3H-CH3]AdoMet, and wild-type or mutant vD1-C catalytic subunit or wild-type and mutant vD1-C/vD12 heterodimers. The extents of methyl transfer were plotted as a function of the variable substrate concentration. Km and kcat values were calculated from double-reciprocal plots of the data. The results are summarized in Table 2. Each datum is the average of three independent substrate titration experiments (± mean error).TABLE 2Kinetic evidence for intersubunit allostery and gain-of-function effects of bypass mutationsAdoMetGTPGpppAKmkcatKmkcatKmkcatμmmin-1μmmin-1μmmin-1D1-C20 ± 20.4 ± 0.02420 ± 830.4 ± 0.07639 ± 981.3 ± 0.1Y752A32 ± 132.3 ± 0.5309 ± 401.7 ± 0.11442 ± 216.4 ± 0.3Y752S26 ± 71.6 ± 0.3338 ± 141.4 ± 0.1582 ± 526.1 ± 0.4N753I38 ± 125.2 ± 0.7264 ± 583.2 ± 0.42472 ± 156.3 ± 0.3D1-C/D123.2 ± 11.7 ± 0.230 ± 31.4 ± 0.262 ± 92.1 ± 0.2Y752A/D122.2 ± 16.1 ± 0.514 ± 3.67.1 ± 117 ± 3.111 ± 1.6Y752S/D121.8 ± 0.54.9 ± 0.319 ± 4.35.7 ± 0.521 ± 28.3 ± 0.9N753I/D121.4 ± 0.514 ± 0.45.6 ± 0.619 ± 17.1 ± 1.517 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Selection of vD1 Mutants That Bypass the Requirement for vD12—To execute a screen for mutations that subvert the requirement for a stimulatory subunit, we PCR-amplified the vD1-(540–844) gene encoding the minimized catalytic subunit under conditions favoring nucleotide misincorporation and cloned the mutated DNA into a multicopy yeast 2μ plasmid. The 2μ vD1-(540–844) mutant library was transformed without a vD12 gene into a yeast abd1Δ strain bearing ABD1 on a URA3 plasmid. After selection for growth on medium containing FOA to eliminate ABD1, we recovered 19 strains that contained putative D12 bypass alleles of vD1-(540–844), which were named vD1-B1, vD1-B2, etc. After clonal amplification in bacteria, the 2μ vD1-B plasmids were retransformed into abd1Δ. Although the wild-type vD1-(540–844) gene was unable to sustain growth on FOA, each of the vD1-B alleles supported growth on FOA. The 19 plasmids that retested positive for bypass were then sequenced to identify the coding changes associated with the bypass phenotype (Table 1).TABLE 1Mutant alleles of vD1 (540–844) that bypass the requirement for vD12vD1-B alleleMutation(s)1, 13, 16Y752S12Y752S, K719R, T811A15, 19, 10Y752C14Y752C, 1727R17Y752H, Y668H8Y752H, M579T, 1613T, A691T, N731D, N776S2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 18N753I Open table in a new tab The bypass screen identified single missense changes in vicinal residues Tyr-752 (to Ser or Cys) and Asn-753 (to Ile) that resulted in vD12-independent growth (Table 1). The single N753I change was recovered nine times; these bypass clones represent at least three independently selected isolates, distinguished by the presence or absence of certain translationally silent mutations within the vD1-C gene. The three bypass clones containing the single Y752S change represent at least two independently selected mutations, and the three Y752C alleles comprise three independently selected bypass suppressors, as judged by the occurrence or absence of unique silent mutations. The Y752S and N753I strains grew as well as wild-type vD1-C vD12 cells at 25, 30, and 34 °C (as gauged by colony size) but failed to grow at 37 °C (Fig. 1). The Y752C strain grew at 25 and 30 °C but was barely viable at 34 °C and failed to grow at 37 °C. Another bypass suppressor containing two missense changes, Y752H and Y668H, grew at 25, 30, and 34 °C but not at 37 °C. Although each of the bypass mutations conferred a temperature-sensitive phenotype in the absence of vD12 (Fig. 1), none of the vD1-B alleles displayed a growth defect in the presence of vD12 (data not shown), suggesting that the bypass mutations in the catalytic subunit did not adversely affect the physical or functional interactions of the methyltransferase subunits in vivo. The vD1-B alleles were transferred to CEN plasmids and tested for abd1Δ complementation. Each allele in single copy sustained cell growth in the absence of vD12 (Fig. 2). Again, Y752S and N753I cells displayed the best growth when compared with wild-type vD1-C vD12 cells (Fig. 2); however, Y752S and N753I failed to grow at 34 °C (not shown). Thus, decreasing the gene copy number lowered their restrictive growth temperatures in the absence of vD12 from 37 to 34 °C. The restrictive temperatures for CEN Y752H/Y668H and Y752C strains were also lowered when compared with the strains carrying these genes on 2μ plasmids (Figs. 1 and 2). Additional insight to the basis for suppression by mutations at Tyr-752 was obtained by testing two purposefully constructed vD1-(540–844) alleles, Y752A and Y752F, which either removed the entire side chain beyond the β-carbon or eliminated only the hydroxyl while maintaining the aromatic character of the side chain. Although the single-copy Y752A allele bypassed the need for vD12 (Fig. 2), Y752F did not (data not shown; note that the Y752F allele is fully functional in yeast in the presence of vD12). The Y752A strain grew as well as Y752S at 19, 25, and 30 °C but failed to grow at 34 or 37 °C (Fig. 2). The apparent gain of function in vivo conferred by the Tyr-752 and Asn-753 mutants at 25–30 °C could reflect either enhanced stability or enhanced activity of the catalytic subunit in the absence of vD12 or both. We exploited an antibody to vD1-C (3Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16424-16429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to gauge the relative steady-state levels of the catalytic subunit in ABD1 strains expressing wild-type vD1-(540–844) and the various bypass mutants in the absence or presence of coexpressed vD12. Note that it was necessary to express the poxvirus proteins in an ABD1 strain so that the levels of wild-type vD1-C could be evaluated when the vD12 subunit was not available. Whole cell lysates derived from ABD1 strains in log phase growth at 30 °C in selective media for the plasmids bearing vD1-C and vD12 were resolved by SDS-PAGE in parallel with recombinant vD1-C protein; the polypeptides were transferred to membranes and probed by Western blotting. The antibody recognized the recombinant vD1-(540–844) polypeptide and the poxvirus proteins in extracts of yeast strains carrying vD1-C on 2μ plasmids, but no signal was detectable in the control strains carrying the vector plasmid without a vD1-C gene (Fig. 3). Probing the blot with antibody to an endogenous yeast protein, the pre-mRNA splicing factor, Prp43, verified that similar amounts of extract from the vector-containing and vD1-C strains had been loaded. The first finding of note was that the level of wild-type vD1-C in yeast (relative to the recombinant polypeptide standard and the Prp43 loading control) was similar whether or not vD12 was coexpressed, suggesting that the requirement for vD12 for complementation of abd1Δ is not attributable to gross stabilization of the catalytic subunit against proteolytic decay. Second, whereas the Y752S and N753I mutants of vD1-C accumulated to higher levels that the wild-type subunit in the absence of vD12, their relative levels were not further increased when D12 was present. At least some of the apparent increase in abundance of the N753I, Y758H/Y668H, and Y752C subunits in cells coexpressing vD12 (relative to wild-type vD1-C) correlated with increased amounts of protein applied to the lanes (as judged by the increased level of Prp43) (Fig. 3). The immunoblotting results suggest that bypass of the vD12 requirement by point mutations was not solely a matter of increasing the amount of vD1-C but rather involved, at least in part, an effect on the methyltransferase activity of the mutant subunits. An analysis of recombinant versions of the vD12-independent vD1-C subunits was informative in this regard, as described below. Biochemical Basis for Activation of vD1-C by vD12—To probe the mechanism of activation of vD1-(540–844) by vD12, we evaluated the kinetic parameters of the methylation reaction catalyzed by vD1-(540–844) alone versus the reaction of the vD1-(540–844)/vD12 heterodimer. The catalytic subunit was produced in E. coli as a His10-Smt3 fusion protein and purified from a soluble bacterial lysate by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 4). The recombinant methyltransferase heterodimer was produced by coexpressing His10-Smt3-D1-(540–844) and untagged vD12. As reported previously (6Mao X. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24472-24479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vD12 formed a heterodimer with tagged vD1-C in E. coli, which could be recovered from a soluble bacterial extract by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 4). To assay methyltransferase activity, we used GTP as the methyl acceptor and [3H-CH3]AdoMet as the methyl donor. The reaction products were separated by PEI-cellulose TLC, and the transfer of the tritiated methyl group to generate labeled m7GTP was quantified. The assays were conducted at 30 °C in light of our initial findings that the specific activity of D1-(540–844) was 2.8-fold higher at 30 °C than at 37 °C, whereas the D1-(540–844)/D12 heterodimer was equally active at 30 °C and 37 °C (data not shown). Kinetic parameters were determined by titrating GTP at a fixed concentration of AdoMet (50 μm) and titrating AdoMet at a fixed concentration of GTP (5 mm). The results are summarized in Table 2. The catalytic subunit on its own had apparent Km values of 420 μm for GTP and 20 μm for AdoMet, with a kcat of 0.4 min–1. The heterodimeric enzyme had Km values of 30 μm GTP and 3.2 μm AdoMet, with a kcat of 1.7 min–1. Thus, D12 increased the affinity for GTP by 14-fold and for AdoMet by a factor of 6 while increasing kcat by a factor of 4. If one estimates “catalytic efficiency” as kcat/(KmAdoMet × KmGTP), then the D12 subunit enhances catalytic efficiency by a factor of 370. It is worth noting that the apparent affinities of the heterodimeric methyltransferase for AdoMet and GTP determined here are in excellent agreement with the Km values of 3 μm AdoMet and 36 μm GTP reported previously by Higman et al. (5Higman M.A. Christen L.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are no prior kinetic data for the methyltransferase reaction of the catalytic domain by itself. We also assayed methyltransferase activity using the cap dinucleotide GpppA as the methyl acceptor. From GpppA titration experiments at 50 μm AdoMet, we determined apparent Km values of 639 and 62 μm GpppA for the catalytic subunit and the heterodimeric enzyme, respectively (Table 2). The 10-fold increase in affinity for the GpppA methyl acceptor elicited by the vD12 subunit was consistent with the similar increase in affinity for GTP described above. The kcat values with GpppA were 1.3 and 2.1 min–1 for vD1-C and vD1-C/vD12, respectively (Table 2). These experiments provide a coherent biochemical explanation for the allosteric stimulation of methyltransferase activity by the vD12 subunit, which is dominated by increased affinity for substrates, especially the methyl acceptor, and also entails an increased turnover number. Biochemical Basis for Bypass of the vD12 Requirement—To investigate how mutations in the catalytic subunit bypass the requirement for vD12 in vivo, we produced and purified the vD1-C mutants Y752A, Y752S and N753I as isolated catalytic subunits and as heterodimers with vD12 (Fig. 4) and determined their kinetic parameters for AdoMet-dependent methylation of GTP and GpppA (Table 2). The apparent kcat values for methylation of 5 mm GTP by the isolated Y752A, Y752S, and N753I mutants at saturating AdoMet were 2.3, 1.6, and 5.2 min–1, respectively, which represent increases of 6-, 4-, and 13-fold when compared with kcat for the isolated wild-type catalytic subunit. The kcat values for methylation of GpppA by Y752A, Y752S, and N753I were 6.4, 6.1, and 6.3 min–1, respectively, which were about 5-fold higher than the kcat of wild-type D1-(540–844). Moreover, the turnover numbers of the Y752A, Y752S, and N753I subunits in methylation of GTP or GpppA equaled or exceeded the turnover numbers of the wild-type methyltransferase heterodimer (Table 2). These results signify that bypass reflects a true gain of function in catalysis for the vD1-C subunit. This gain of activity of the mutant catalytic subunits was not attributable to increased affinity for AdoMet (where values ranged from 26 to 38 μm) and entailed, at best, a modest (less than 2-fold) increase in affinity for the methyl acceptor. Thus, the mutations that bypass the vD12 requirement in vivo mimic only partially the allosteric effects of vD12 on the vD1-C activity in vitro. Kinetic analysis of the mutant heterodimers revealed that the Y752A, Y752S, and N753I subunits remained fully responsive to the allosteric effects of vD12 on substrate affinity and turnover number, indeed even more so than the wild-type catalytic subunit. For example, the Km values for AdoMet of the mutant heterodimers (2.2 μm for Y752A, 1.8 μm for Y752S, and 1.4 μm for N753I) were lower by 15-, 14-, and 27-fold when compared with the isolated mutant catalytic subunits and were even slightly lower than the Km value of 3.2 μm AdoMet seen for th"

The reduction of oxygen to water requires the delivery of four electrons and four protons into the catalytic center of the enzyme. Electrons enter oxidase from the cytosolic domain and protons from the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This redox reaction is coupled to the pumping of four additional protons across the membrane. Both of these processes contribute to the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient. Bovine heart CcO contains 13 polypeptides; however, four redox centers involved in electron transport (ET) and in the reduction of O2 to water are located in two subunits (1.Tsukihara T. Aoyama H.

Three of these centers, heme a, heme a3, and copper ion called CuB, are in subunit I, and the dinuclear copper center CuA is located in subunit II (1.Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T.

At this catalytic center, the interaction of electrons, protons, and oxygen occurs. The reaction of CcO with oxygen, however, can take place only when two electrons have reduced the binuclear center. This part of the catalytic cycle of CcO, during which electrons are delivered to CcO prior to reaction with oxygen, is usually referred to as the reductive phase. It appears that the reductive phase consists not only of ET reactions but is accompanied also by proton pumping (10.Ruitenberg M. Kannt A. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Michel H. Nature. 2002; 417: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite the significance of these ET reactions, there is virtually no data on how electrons are delivered into the catalytic site and how this ET is affected by the presumed redox interaction between heme a3 and CuB. Under anaerobic conditions, heme a3 reduction, typically monitored by the changes in the optical spectrum, occurs in two phases (11.Malatesta F. Sarti P. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7410-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12.Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14881-14889Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been assumed that the two rates reflect the dependence of ET to heme a3 on the redox state of CuB (11.Malatesta F. Sarti P. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7410-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12.Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this picture, the fast phase represents ET to heme a3 in that population of CcO with both heme a3 and CuB oxidized (Fea33+CuB2+), whereas the slow phase represents ET to the population of CcO with CuB reduced (Fea33+CuB1+) (11.Malatesta F.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The proposal for the effect of the reduction state of CuB on ET to heme a3, however, lacks experimental support. One approach for assessing the role of the redox state of CuB on ET to heme a3 during the reductive phase is EPR spectroscopy (14.Van Gelder B.F. Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15.Hartzell C.R. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2477-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fully oxidized enzyme, the binuclear center is EPR-silent because of the exchange coupling between the iron of heme a3 (Fea33+) and CuB2+. When CuB is reduced and heme a3 is oxidized (Fea33+CuB1+), this coupling is broken and the magnetic resonance of Fea33+ is observable in EPR spectra (14.Van Gelder B.F. Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15.Hartzell C.R. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2477-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This state, which is represented by the EPR signal at g = 6 from high spin heme a3, appears transiently during the course of reduction. The transient formation of the g = 6 signal reflects the initial formation of the one-electron-reduced state (Fea33+CuB1+) followed by the decay to the EPR silent and fully reduced state (Fea32+CuB1+). Thus the kinetic behavior of the g = 6 signal provides information on the initial reduction of CuB and the subsequent reduction of heme a3. This study demonstrates that transfer of the first electron into the catalytic site is the rate-limiting step in the overall two-electron process. The rate for the transfer of the second electron to oxidized heme a3, when CuB is reduced, is enhanced relative to the rate of the first electron transfer. The data also suggest that the biphasic reduction of heme a3, interpreted previously as reflecting the effect of the redox state of CuB (11.Malatesta F. Sarti P. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7410-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12.Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), is because of the presence of different populations of purified CcO. Materials—Hepes buffer, EDTA, and riboflavin were from Sigma, hexaamineruthenium (III) chloride (Ru) and sodium hydrosulfite (dithionite, DT) were from Aldrich, peroxide-free Triton X-100 (TX) was from Roche Diagnostics, and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) was from Anatrace. Preparation of Enzyme and Electron Transport Particles—Bovine heart CcO was isolated from mitochondria by the modified method of Soulimane and Buse (16.Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) into DM-containing buffer. The enzyme concentration was determined from the optical spectrum of oxidized enzyme using an extinction coefficient E424 of 156 mm–1 cm–1 (17.Liao G.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CcO isolated by this method is in the “fast” form considered to be the native form of the enzyme (18.Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mitochondria, the starting material for CcO purification, were also used for isolation of electron transport particles. The isolated mitochondria were washed twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 250 mm sucrose. Thereafter, cytochrome c was depleted from the washed mitochondria (19.Jacobs E.E. Sanadi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 531-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lenaz G. MacLennan D. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 499-504Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To extract cytochrome c, the mitochondria were diluted to a protein concentration of ∼3.3 mg/ml with cold 10 mm K2SO4, stirred at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min. Cytochrome c was extracted by suspension of the sediment in cold solution of 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm K2SO4, and 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6. This suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 25 min. To ensure that extraction of cytochrome c was complete, this step was repeated twice using the same buffer with ferricyanide omitted and twice with 200 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm K2SO4. These mitochondria were mechanically disrupted by mixing with glass beads and buffer (200 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 30 mm K2SO4) in a Vortex mixer for ∼1 min at 4 °C. Typically, for the mixing, we used 1 volume of sedimented mitochondria, 2 volumes of buffer, and 1 volume of glass beads. The disrupted mitochondria were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction containing electron transport particles was collected. The CcO concentration in the electron transport particles was established from the difference of the optical spectrum of fully reduced minus oxidized CcO using an extinction coefficient E605–613 of 23.2 mm–1 cm–1 (17.Liao G.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The concentration of CcO in electron transport particles was ∼1.2 μm. Stopped-flow Measurements—The kinetics of reduction of CcO were measured under anaerobic conditions in an argon atmosphere using the OLIS RSM-1000 stopped-flow apparatus collecting 1000 spectra/s; the light path was 20 mm. CcO was mixed with an equal volume of Ru and DT (Ru-DT mixture). All kinetics of the reduction of CcO were collected at the presence of 5 mm DT (final concentration). The rate constants, obtained from fits to the data, are averages of at least three measurements. To remove oxygen from the stopped-flow instrument, the whole flow system was filled with a buffered solution of 5 mm DT for ∼4 h prior to measurements. The driving syringes were submerged in water that was continually purged with nitrogen. The temperature was 23 °C. Preparation of Samples—The solutions of oxidase and the mixture of Ru-DT were made anaerobic following the previously published procedure (13.Antalik M. Jancura D. Palmer G. Fabian M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14881-14889Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The anaerobic partial reduction of CcO was achieved by photoreduction using riboflavin as the photosensitizer and EDTA as the sacrificial electron donor (21.Merkel J.R. Nickerson W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 14: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22.Ahmad I. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3122-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To partially reduce CcO, a sample of 10 μm oxidized CcO in 200 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1% DM or TX, 22 mm K2SO4, 10 mm KCl containing 2 μm riboflavin, and 5 mm EDTA was made anaerobic in the stopped-flow tonometer in the dark. An optical cell was attached as the side arm to the tonometer, which permitted monitoring the progress of photoreduction by recording the absorption spectrum. The spectrum of the anaerobic oxidized CcO was collected as a reference. The sample was then exposed to several light flashes from a Sunpack 544 photoflash until the desired level of reduction was obtained. The absorption spectrum of this partially reduced form was analyzed for the level of reduction of the individual hemes. The concentrations of reduced heme a and heme a3 were determined by the deconvolution of the optical absorption difference spectra of partially reduced minus oxidized CcO using the extinction coefficients E444–427 = 112 mm–1cm–1 for heme a and E446–416 = 122 mm–1 cm–1 for heme a3 (17.Liao G.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The amount of reduced CuB is based on the estimated reduction potential in independent measurement. In this measurement, anaerobic oxidized CcO was reduced with two equivalents of ferrocytochrome c. After equilibrium was reached, the optical spectrum was analyzed for the amounts of reduced heme a, heme a3, CuA, and ferrocytochrome c. The difference between the amount of oxidized cytochrome c and reduced (a2+ + a32+ + CuA1+) was assumed to reflect the extent of reduction of CuB. Taking the standard reduction potential of ferrocytochrome c as 264 mV (23.Margalit R. Schejter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 32: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the potentials of all four metal centers were calculated. At pH 8.0, the standard potential for heme a3 was +290 mV and for CuB ∼+280 mV. Rapid Freezing and EPR Measurements—For preparation of rapid freeze samples, a System 1000 chemical/freeze-quench apparatus was employed (Update Instruments, Madison, WI). In this apparatus, anaerobic oxidized CcO (160 μm) was mixed with Ru-DT at 23 °C and the samples rapidly frozen at selected times in a bath of isopentane precooled to 125–130 K. EPR spectra of samples prepared by the rapid freeze method were recorded with a Varian E-6 or Bruker EMX spectrometer. All spectra were collected at a nominal temperature of 4.2 K as read by the temperature sensor located 3 mm below the bottom of the sample tube, which is ∼17 mm below the center of the EPR cavity used. The stability of the temperature was controlled to the second decimal point by the temperature controller unit ITC 503. The Oxford continuous flow cryostat ESR 900 was used for the transfer of helium to the sample. The conditions for EPR measurements were: frequency, 9.26 or 9.6 GHz; power, 3 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 10 G; and modulation frequency, 100 kHz. The high spin signal at g = 6 of heme a3 was quantified by double integration, with the lower integration limit taken below the low field end of the spectrum and the upper limit at a field corresponding to a g value of 4.67 (24.Aasa R. Albracht S.P.J. Falk K.-E. Lanne B. Vanngård T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This integrated intensity was compared with the signal of a standard high spin complex of metmyoglobin fluoride. The S.D. in the measurements of g = 6 EPR signals of CcO in the rapid freeze-quench samples were estimated from the reaction of oxymyoglobin (Mb-O2) with NO. 5Data obtained in collaboration with Dr. C. Rogge, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, TX. The reaction of Mb-O2 with a stoichiometric amount of NO quantitatively produces the high spin signal in the dead time of the rapid freeze-quench apparatus. From EPR measurement on four samples, the variation in both the height of the high spin signal and the integrated intensity was calculated. The variation in height was found to be ±19% with a ±22% variation in the integrated intensity. The major contribution to this deviation comes from the packing of the samples. Nevertheless, this uncertainty does not lead to a large scatter of data points as is documented by the time dependences of the g = 6 signal (see Fig. 3). Model—In the course of reduction of the oxidized catalytic site (Fea33+CuB2+) by two electrons, the transient formation of a one-electron-reduced state appears (Fea33+CuB1+) that is characterized by the high spin signal at the g = 6 originating from the iron of heme a3. The transient formation of Fea33+CuB1+ and its decay to the fully reduced state, Fea32+ CuB1+, was fitted to the model represented by the following scheme, where k1 and k2 are the observable rate constants for the entry of the first and second electron into the binuclear site, respectively. The model also assumes that the equilibration of an electron between these two redox centers is more rapid than the rate of electron entry. Based on this model, the time development of the normalized g = 6 signal was fitted to the equation, g6(t)=(k1·p/(k2−k1))·(e−k1·t−e−k2) with parameter p = 0.5 representing the fraction of the Fea33+CuB1+ state relative to the total concentration of the one-electron-reduced binuclear sites. The value of the parameter p, held constant in all fits, is justified by the similarity of the estimated reduction potentials of heme a3 and CuB. For the investigation of ET in CcO during the anaerobic reduction, the mixture of two artificial electron donors, dithionite and hexaamine ruthenium, was employed. There are three reasons that makes this system advantageous: (i) excess DT ensures the anaerobic conditions during the measurements and also maintains the concentration of reduced Ru constant; (ii) ET from Ru to CcO is substantially fast (12.Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), faster than that from DT to CcO (25.Jones G.D. Jones M.G. Wilson M.T. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Sarti P. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which allows us to identify and study the factors regulating the internal ET; and (iii) the spectral changes of both hemes and CuA can be monitored over the relevant wavelength range without optical interference from reductant. Reduction of Heme a and Heme a3 Stopped-flow Results—The transition of heme a and a3 from the oxidized to the reduced state can be assessed from the changes in the optical spectrum of CcO. In the Soret band, the reduction of both hemes can be separated by recording data at 428 and 436 nm (Fig. 1). 428 nm is an isosbestic point in the spectral transition of heme a3 from oxidized to reduced state, and the kinetics at this wavelength correspond to the reduction of heme a (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the kinetics at 436 nm represents reduction of heme a3, as this wavelength is an isosbestic point of heme a (Fig. 1B). The reduction of heme a, at the presence of either 25 or 100 μm Ru, is monophasic and fitted by a single exponential. With 3 mm Ru, the reduction of heme a is complete in the dead time of the apparatus, and only the reduction of heme a3 is observed. With Ru concentrations of 25 μm, 100 μm, and 3 mm, the reduction of heme a3 is biphasic and the relative contribution of the rapid phase, obtained from two exponentials fits, is ∼80%. The rate constants for the reduction of heme a and a3 in the rapid phase are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Apparent rate constants for reduction of heme a (ka) and a3 (ka3) from stopped flow measurements for three ruthenium concentrationsRukaka3mms−1s−10.0257 ± 0.14 ± 0.3 (87%)aRelative contributions.0.125 ± 17 ± 0.1 (83%)3NDbND, not determined, as heme a was reduced in the dead time of stopped flow apparatus.80 ± 5.0 (82%)a Relative contributions.b ND, not determined, as heme a was reduced in the dead time of stopped flow apparatus. Open table in a new tab Reduction of CuB and Heme a3 Rapid Freeze EPR Results—In Fig. 2, we show the EPR spectra of samples rapidly frozen at 6, 125, and 600 ms after reaction of oxidized CcO with 25 μm Ru. There is a monotonic decrease of the signal at g = 3, together with the copper signal at g = 2, reflecting the reduction of the low spin iron of heme a and CuA, respectively. The g = 6 signal, corresponding to the Fea33+CuB1+ state exhibits different behavior. Initially, there is an increase in the intensity of the g = 6 signal, which is subsequently followed by its decay. This transient formation of the high spin signal results from the initial accumulation of Fea33+CuB1+, the one-electron-reduced catalytic site with an electron located on CuB. The decay of this signal represents the transfer of the second electron to heme a3 and the formation of a fully reduced catalytic site (Fea32+CuB1+). We have determined the evolution of the g = 6 signal during the reduction of oxidized CcO at three Ru concentrations (Fig. 3). The experimental data for 25 and 100 μm Ru (Fig. 3A) are fitted by the equation that represents the model described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rates for both the formation of Fea33+CuB1+ and for its decay to the fully reduced state, Fea32+CuB1+, obtained from the fitting are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Apparent rate constants for the first electron entry (k1) into the catalytic site, to CuB, and the second electron transfer (k2), to heme a3, when CuB is reduced, from rapid-freeze experimentsRuk1k2mms−1s−10.0255 ± 15 ± 10.17 ± 430 ± 18385aRate constants used to generate the model kinetic trace in Fig. 3B.2200aRate constants used to generate the model kinetic trace in Fig. 3B.a Rate constants used to generate the model kinetic trace in Fig. 3B. Open table in a new tab The maximum observed yield of Fea33+CuB1+ decreases with increasing Ru concentration. When reduction is initiated with 3 mm Ru, the increase of the g = 6 signal, corresponding to the formation of the Fea33+CuB1+ state, is missing (Fig. 3B). In the first available data point, collected 6 ms after mixing, the population of Fea33+CuB1+ is at maximum with the appearance of a small amount of Fea33+CuB1+, which quantitation suggests is of the order of 2–4%. The residual g = 6 signal present at 150 ms belongs to the population of CcO, with the catalytic site modified during purification, because it is also present in the EPR spectrum of oxidized enzyme. Even though there is the uncertainty in the absolute concentration of Cu 1+BFea33+, we consistently observed the very small increase (1.5%) of the high spin signal in the reaction of CcO with 3 mm Ru compared with the signal present in the fully oxidized oxidase. This signal is significantly smaller and disappears much more rapidly than the signals in experiments with 25 or 100 μm Ru (Fig. 3). The experimental data in Fig. 3B are overlaid with the kinetic trace obtained from the model using the rate constants presented in Table 2. In the calculation of this trace, the residual g = 6 signal was taken as an offset. It was also assumed that the first electron transfer to the catalytic site to CuB occurs with the rate similar to the rate observed for heme a3 reduction in the stopped-flow measurements. With these two values inserted into the model equation, the best agreement was found with the rate constant for the second electron transfer, to be 2.2 × 103 s–1. ET to Heme a3 in Oxidized and Partially Reduced Oxidase—The apparent rate constants for reduction of heme a3, obtained from the EPR rapid freeze experiments (Table 2), show that reduced CuB could facilitate ET to the heme a3. This observation is strengthened by the kinetics of reduction of heme a3 in the stopped-flow instrument for CcO in two states, fully oxidized CcO and partially reduced CcO. Enzymes in both DM and TX detergents were used for this measurement. By deconvoluting the initial optical spectrum of partially reduced CcO (10 μm) in DM containing buffer (200 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1% DM, 22 mm K2SO4, 10 mm KCl), we have determined that 3.9 μm heme a and 3.8 μm heme a3 were reduced. Because of the dilution of CcO after mixing with the reductant in the stopped-flow apparatus, we should have detected the reduction of 3.1 μm heme a3 (6.2 μm before dilution). However, from the observed kinetics of heme a3 reduction with 3 mm Ru, we calculated that 1.2 μm heme a3 was reduced rapidly in the dead time of the apparatus. The residual 1.9 μm heme a3 was reduced with the rate constant equivalent to that for the reduction of heme a3 in fully oxidized CcO (Table 1, Fig. 1B). The rapid reduction of the population of heme a3 (1.2 μm) we ascribe to the state of the catalytic site, with the CuB reduced and heme a3 oxidized. The measurement on partially reduced enzyme in DM detergent does not, however, bring information on the extent of acceleration of ET to heme a3 when CuB is reduced. To estimate the extent of acceleration, we have used enzyme in TX detergent. As we have recently shown, TX can reversibly inhibit the internal ET to heme a3 (13.Antalik M. Jancura D. Palmer G. Fabian M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14881-14889Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This inhibition probably results from a restriction of proton diffusion to the catalytic site that accompanies the reduction of heme a3-CuB. For this experiment, the stock solution of CcO in DM buffer (202 μm CcO in 0.1% DM buffer) was diluted directly into buffer containing 0.1% TX, with the final concentration of CcO equal to 10 μm. The kinetics of heme a3 reduction for both oxidized and partially reduced CcO in TX buffer reacted with 3 mm Ru are compared in Fig. 4 together with the Soret optical spectra collected at 1 ms and the final spectrum of fully reduced CcO recorded at 1 s. With 0.1% TX in solution, the rate of internal ET to the catalytic site of oxidized CcO is decreased to such a level that the rate of heme a3 reduction in partially reduced CcO could also be monitored in the stopped-flow apparatus. The kinetics of ET to heme a3 for fully oxidized CcO were fitted by two exponentials with the rate constants of 10 ± 0.5 and 3 ± 1s–1, respectively, with the rapid phase accounting for the reduction of 4.1 μm heme a3. In the sample of partially reduced enzyme, with 4.3 μm heme a and 5.9 μm heme a3 reduced, the observed kinetics was two exponentials as well. However, the apparent rate constants were increased in the partially reduced oxidase, and from the best fit to the kinetics in Fig. 4B, the rates of 108 ± 14 and 13 ± 2s–1 were obtained; the fast phase accounted for 1.1 μm and the slow phase for 0.7 μm heme a3 reduction. The rate constant for the slow phase of heme a3 reduction in the partially reduced CcO in TX buffer corresponds to the rate for the rapid phase in oxidized CcO. The equivalence of these rates implies that this population of the partially reduced CcO has the catalytic site in the fully oxidized state. Yet, in the partially reduced CcO, there is a fraction of heme a3 reduced with ∼10-fold the enhanced rate. This fraction is attributed to the one-electron-reduced state of the catalytic site with the electron localized on CuB. In cytochrome c oxidase, electron transfer reactions are intertwined with proton translocation and reduction of oxygen to water. Understanding of this complex process relies on the dissection and characterization of individual ET steps and the possible interactions among the redox-active centers. The present study is focused on the first part of the catalytic cycle, the reductive phase, when electrons are delivered to the metal centers of oxi"
https://openalex.org/W2012648192,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling is involved in the development and regulation of multiple organ systems and cellular signaling pathways. We recently demonstrated that TGFβ regulates the response of atrial myocytes to parasympathetic stimulation. Here, TGFβ1 is shown to inhibit expression of the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2), which plays a critical role in the parasympathetic response of the heart. This effect is mimicked by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of RhoA and by the RhoA kinase inhibitor Y27632, whereas adenoviral expression of a dominant activating-RhoA reverses TGFβ inhibition of M2 expression. TGFβ1 also mediates a decrease in GTP-bound RhoA and a reciprocal increase in the expression of the RhoA GTPase-activating protein, p190RhoGAP, whereas total RhoA is unchanged. Inhibition of M2 promoter activity by TGFβ1 is mimicked by overexpression of p190RhoGAP, whereas a dominant negative mutant of p190RhoGAP reverses this effect of TGFβ1. In contrast to atrial myocytes, in mink lung epithelial cells, in which TGFβ signaling through activation of RhoA has been previously identified, TGFβ1 stimulated an increase in GTP-bound RhoA in association with a reciprocal decrease in the expression of p190RhoGAP. Both effects demonstrated a similar dose dependence on TGFβ1. Thus TGFβ regulation of M2 muscarinic receptor expression is dependent on RhoA, and TGFβ regulation of p190RhoGAP expression may be a cell type-specific mechanism for TGFβ signaling through RhoA."
