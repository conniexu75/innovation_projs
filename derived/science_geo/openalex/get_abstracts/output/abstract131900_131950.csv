https://openalex.org/W2035000881,"Steroid hormones exert profound effects on differentiation, development, and homeostasis in higher eukaryotes through interactions with nuclear receptors. We describe a novel orphan nuclear receptor, termed the pregnane X receptor (PXR), that is activated by naturally occurring steroids such as pregnenolone and progesterone, and synthetic glucocorticoids and antiglucocorticoids. PXR exists as two isoforms, PXR.1 and PXR.2, that are differentially activated by steroids. Notably, PXR.1 is efficaciously activated by pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist that induces the expression of the CYP3A family of steroid hydroxylases and modulates sterol and bile acid biosynthesis in vivo. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a novel steroid hormone signaling pathway with potential implications in the regulation of steroid hormone and sterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1804861156,"Despite extensive study, several of the major components involved in T cell receptor-mediated signaling remain unidentified. Here we report the cloning of the cDNA for a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated 36-38 kDa protein, previously characterized by its association with Grb2, phospholipase C-gamma1, and the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Deduced amino acid sequence identifies a novel integral membrane protein containing multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. We show that this protein is phosphorylated by ZAP-70/Syk protein tyrosine kinases leading to recruitment of multiple signaling molecules. Its function is demonstrated by inhibition of T cell activation following overexpression of a mutant form lacking critical tyrosine residues. Therefore, we propose to name the molecule LAT-linker for activation of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046854154,"The HIV-1 Tat protein regulates transcription elongation through binding to the viral TAR RNA stem-loop structure. We have isolated a novel 87 kDa cyclin C-related protein (cyclin T) that interacts specifically with the transactivation domain of Tat. Cyclin T is a partner for CDK9, an RNAPII transcription elongation factor. Remarkably, the interaction of Tat with cyclin T strongly enhances the affinity and specificity of the Tat:TAR RNA interaction, and confers a requirement for sequences in the loop of TAR that are not recognized by Tat alone. Moreover, overexpression of human cyclin T rescues Tat activity in nonpermissive rodent cells. We propose that Tat directs cyclin T-CDK9 to RNAPII through cooperative binding to TAR RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2043204105,"X-linked lissencephaly and “double cortex” are allelic human disorders mapping to Xq22.3-Xq23 associated with arrest of migrating cerebral cortical neurons. We identified a novel 10 kb brain-specific cDNA interrupted by a balanced translocation in an XLIS patient that encodes a novel 40 kDa predicted protein named Doublecortin. Four double cortex/X-linked lissencephaly families and three sporadic double cortex patients show independent doublecortin mutations, at least one of them a de novo mutation. Doublecortin contains a consensus Abl phosphorylation site and other sites of potential phosphorylation. Although Doublecortin does not contain a kinase domain, it is homologous to the amino terminus of a predicted kinase protein, indicating a likely role in signal transduction. Doublecortin, along with the newly characterized mDab1, may define an Abl-dependent pathway regulating neuronal migration."
https://openalex.org/W2095115211,"Previously, we found that Rb can actively repress transcription of cell cycle genes by binding and inactivating transcription factors at the promoter. Here, we demonstrate that Rb can also repress transcription of endogenous cell cycle genes containing E2F sites through recruitment of histone deacetylase, which deacetylates histones on the promoter, thereby promoting formation of nucleosomes that inhibit transcription. These two mechanisms of repression by Rb are selective-some promoters and transcription factors are blocked by this recruitment of histone deacetylase, whereas others are resistant to histone deacetylase activity and are repressed directly by inhibition of transcription factors."

Via food products resistant bacteria can easily reach humans. The current debate is above all concerning antibiotic use as growth promoters which can be gradually phased out by better animal performance.
https://openalex.org/W2130526419,"The structure of the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, determined at 2.0 angstroms resolution, shows how its catalytic activity is regulated by its two SH2 domains. In the absence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated binding partner, the N-terminal SH2 domain binds the phosphatase domain and directly blocks its active site. This interaction alters the structure of the N-SH2 domain, disrupting its phosphopeptide-binding cleft. Conversely, interaction of the N-SH2 domain with phosphopeptide disrupts its phosphatase recognition surface. Thus, the N-SH2 domain is a conformational switch; it either binds and inhibits the phosphatase, or it binds phosphoproteins and activates the enzyme. Recognition of bisphosphorylated ligands by the tandem SH2 domains is an integral element of this switch; the C-terminal SH2 domain contributes binding energy and specificity, but it does not have a direct role in activation."

https://openalex.org/W1997073575,"X-SCLH/LIS syndrome is a neuronal migration disorder with disruption of the six-layered neocortex. It consists of subcortical laminar heterotopia (SCLH, band heterotopia, or double cortex) in females and lissencephaly (LIS) in males, leading to epilepsy and cognitive impairment. We report the characterization of a novel CNS gene encoding a 40 kDa predicted protein that we named Doublecortin and the identification of mutations in four unrelated X-SCLH/LIS cases. The predicted protein shares significant homology with the N-terminal segment of a protein containing a protein kinase domain at its C-terminal part. This novel gene is highly expressed during brain development, mainly in fetal neurons including precursors. The complete disorganization observed in lissencephaly and heterotopia thus seems to reflect a failure of early events associated with neuron dispersion."
https://openalex.org/W2105263387,"We report here the inactivation of a member of the Ice/Ced-3 (caspase) family of cell death genes, casp-11, by gene targeting. Like Ice-deficient mice, casp-11 mutant mice are resistant to endotoxic shock induced by lipopolysaccharide. Production of both IL-1α and IL-1β after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, a crucial event during septic shock and an indication of ICE activation, is blocked in casp-11 mutant mice. casp-11 mutant embryonic fibroblast cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by overexpression of ICE. Furthermore, we found that pro-caspase-11 physically interacts with pro-ICE in cells, and the expression of casp-11 is essential for activation of ICE. Our data suggest that caspase-11 is a component of ICE complex and is required for the activation of ICE."
https://openalex.org/W2111465693,"Human functional-anatomic correlates of object repetition were explored in a cohort of 20 subjects using fMRI. Subjects performed an object classification task where the target objects were either novel or repeated. Objects appeared rapidly, one every 2 s, in a randomly intermixed task design similar to traditional behavioral, event-related potential (ERP), and single-unit physiological studies. Recently developed event-related fMRI methods were used to analyze the data. Clear effects of repetition were observed. Brain areas in mid-levels of the processing hierarchy, including extrastriate visual cortex extending into inferotemporal cortex and left dorsal prefrontal cortex, showed reductions in the amount of activation after repetition. By contrast, early visual areas and output motor areas were activated equally by both novel and repeated objects and did not show effects of repetition, suggesting that the observed correlates of repetition were anatomically selective. We discuss these findings in relation to previous positron emission tomography (PET) and fMRI studies of item repetition and single-unit physiological studies; we also address the broad impact that rapid event-related fMRI is likely to have on functional neuroimaging."
https://openalex.org/W2080993511,"The requirements for transcriptional activation by RNA polymerase II were examined using chromatin templates assembled in vitro and a transcription system composed of the human general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Activator-induced, energy-dependent chromatin remodeling promoted efficient preinitiation complex formation and transcription initiation, but was not sufficient for productive transcription. Polymerases that initiated transcription on remodeled chromatin templates encountered a block to transcription proximal to the promoter. Entry into productive transcription required an accessory factor present in HeLa cell nuclear extract, FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), which we have purified. FACT acts subsequent to transcription initiation to release RNA polymerase II from a nucleosome-induced block to productive transcription. The biochemical properties and polypeptide composition of FACT suggest that it is a novel protein factor that facilitates transcript elongation through nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2086485726,"To understand how homeotic genes affect morphogenesis and differentiation, their target genes must be identified. In Arabidopsis flowers, the homeotic protein heterodimer APETALA3/PISTILLATA is necessary for petal and stamen formation. Here, AP3/PI function was put under posttranslational control to analyze its immediate effect on the floral mRNA population, with indirect effects blocked by cycloheximide. Using differential display, a target gene of AP3/PI was identified (NAP: NAC-LIKE, ACTIVATED BY AP3/PI), which is homologous to genes required for meristem establishment and separation of floral organs. The expression pattern of NAP and the phenotypes caused by its misexpression suggest that it functions in the transition between growth by cell division and cell expansion in stamens and petals."
https://openalex.org/W2153406820,"A novel neurotrophic factor named Persephin that is approximately 40% identical to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) has been identified using degenerate PCR. Persephin, like GDNF and NTN, promotes the survival of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons in culture and prevents their degeneration after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment in vivo. Persephin also supports the survival of motor neurons in culture and in vivo after sciatic nerve axotomy and, like GDNF, promotes ureteric bud branching. However, in contrast to GDNF and NTN, persephin does not support any of the peripheral neurons that were examined. Fibroblasts transfected with Ret and one of the coreceptors GFRalpha-1 or GFRalpha-2 do not respond to persephin, suggesting that persephin utilizes additional, or different, receptor components than GDNF and NTN."
https://openalex.org/W2090505541,"Ephrin-A5 (AL-1/RAGS), a ligand for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, repels retinal axons in vitro and has a graded expression in the superior colliculus (SC), the major midbrain target of retinal ganglion cells. These properties implicate ephrin-A5 in the formation of topographic maps, a fundamental organizational feature of the nervous system. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice lacking ephrin-A5. The majority of ephrin-A5-/- mice develop to adulthood, are morphologically intact, and have normal anterior-posterior patterning of the midbrain. However, within the SC, retinal axons establish and maintain dense arborizations at topographically incorrect sites that correlate with locations of low expression of the related ligand ephrin-A2. In addition, retinal axons transiently overshoot the SC and extend aberrantly into the inferior colliculus (IC). This defect is consistent with the high level of ephrin-A5 expression in the IC and the finding that retinal axon growth on membranes from wild-type IC is inhibited relative to that on membranes from ephrin-A5-/- IC. These findings show that ephrin-A5 is required for the proper guidance and mapping of retinal axons in the mammalian midbrain."

https://openalex.org/W2160708064,"In Drosophila embryos, microtubules oriented along apical-basal directions support saltatory vesicle movement. Vesicle traffic includes lipid droplets whose distribution shifts twice during early embryogenesis. Using microscopy, optical tweezers, and a novel squashed-mount embryo preparation, we tracked single droplets and measured the forces these generated. Droplet stalling forces change developmentally, in a roughly quantized fashion, consistent with variation in the number of active motors. We characterized a mutation, klarsicht, that affects droplet transport. Klar+ facilitates changes in force, possibly by coordinating the activity of multiple motors. Alterations in transport affected motion in both apical and basal directions, indicating tight coupling between motors of opposite polarity. Mutations in klar also affect nuclear migration during eye development, suggesting multiple roles for klar-based transport."
https://openalex.org/W2003345155,"Exocytosis in yeast occurs at plasma membrane subdomains whose locations vary with the cell cycle, but the primary protein determinants of these sites are unknown. A functional fusion of Sec3 protein with green fluorescent protein (Sec3-GFP) localizes to the site of polarized exocytosis for each cell-cycle stage, where it colocalizes with Sec4p and Sec8p. Sec3-GFP localization is independent of secretory pathway function, of the actin and septin cytoskeletons, and of the polarity establishment proteins. We propose that Sec3p is a spatial landmark defining sites of exocytosis. Polarized secretion would result from the coupling of actin-dependent vesicle targeting with Sec3p-dependent establishment of the vesicle fusion site."
https://openalex.org/W2079004695,"To investigate the roles phosphatases play in hippocampal-dependent memory, we studied transgenic mice overexpressing a truncated form of calcineurin. These mice have normal short-term memory but defective long-term memory evident on both a spatial task and on a visual recognition task, providing genetic evidence for the role of the rodent hippocampus in spatial and nonspatial memory. The defect in long-term memory could be fully rescued by increasing the number of training trials, suggesting that the mice have the capacity for long-term memory. We next analyzed mice overexpressing calcineurin in a regulated manner and found the memory defect is reversible and not due to a developmental abnormality. Our behavioral results suggest that calcineurin has a role in the transition from short- to long-term memory, which correlates with a novel intermediate phase of LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2123099861,"To investigate the role of phosphatases in synaptic plasticity using genetic approaches, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress a truncated form of calcineurin under the control of the CaMKIIα promoter. Mice expressing this transgene show increased calcium-dependent phosphatase activity in the hippocampus. Physiological studies of these mice and parallel pharmacological experiments in wild-type mice reveal a novel, intermediate phase of LTP (I-LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This intermediate phase differs from E-LTP by requiring multiple trains for induction and in being dependent on PKA. It differs from L-LTP in not requiring new protein synthesis. These data suggest that calcineurin acts as an inhibitory constraint on I-LTP that is relieved by PKA. This inhibitory constraint acts as a gate to regulate the synaptic induction of L−LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2028794261,"We report the discovery of a short-lived chaperone that is required for the correct maturation of the eukaryotic 20S proteasome and is destroyed at a specific stage of the assembly process. The S. cerevisiae Ump1p protein is a component of proteasome precursor complexes containing unprocessed beta subunits but is not detected in the mature 20S proteasome. Upon the association of two precursor complexes, Ump1p is encased and is rapidly degraded after the proteolytic sites in the interior of the nascent proteasome are activated. Cells lacking Ump1p exhibit a lack of coordination between the processing of beta subunits and proteasome assembly, resulting in functionally impaired proteasomes. We also show that the propeptide of the Pre2p/Doa3p beta subunit is required for Ump1p's function in proteasome maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1978062289,"The molecular basis of sensory hair cell mechanotransduction is largely unknown. In order to identify genes that are essential for mechanosensory hair cell function, we characterized a group of recently isolated zebrafish motility mutants. These mutants are defective in balance and swim in circles but have no obvious morphological defects. We examined the mutants using calcium imaging of acoustic-vibrational and tactile escape responses, high resolution microscopy of sensory neuroepithelia in live larvae, and recordings of extracellular hair cell potentials (microphonics). Based on the analyses, we have identified several classes of genes. Mutations in sputnik and mariner affect hair bundle integrity. Mutant astronaut and cosmonaut hair cells have relatively normal microphonics and thus appear to affect events downstream of mechanotransduction. Mutant orbiter, mercury, and gemini larvae have normal hair cell morphology and yet do not respond to acoustic-vibrational stimuli. The microphonics of lateral line hair cells of orbiter, mercury, and gemini larvae are absent or strongly reduced. Therefore, these genes may encode components of the transduction apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1938898050,"G:U mismatches resulting from deamination of cytosine are the most common promutagenic lesions occurring in DNA. Uracil is removed in a base-excision repair pathway by uracil DNA-glycosylase (UDG), which excises uracil from both single- and double-stranded DNA. Recently, a biochemically distinct family of DNA repair enzymes has been identified, which excises both uracil and thymine, but only from mispairs with guanine. Crystal structures of the mismatch-specific uracil DNA-glycosylase (MUG) from E. coli, and of a DNA complex, reveal a remarkable structural and functional homology to UDGs despite low sequence identity. Details of the MUG structure explain its thymine DNA-glycosylase activity and the specificity for G:U/T mispairs, which derives from direct recognition of guanine on the complementary strand."

https://openalex.org/W1991987237,"Constitutively active forms of the small GTPases RhoA (RhoA.V14) and Cdc42 (Cdc42.V12) induce expression of extrachromosomal SRF reporter genes in microinjection experiments, but only Cdc42.V12 can efficiently activate a chromosomal template. Both SAPK/JNK-dependent or -independent signals can cooperate with RhoA.V14 to activate chromosomal SRF reporters, and it is SAPK/JNK activation by Cdc42.V12 that allows it to activate chromosomal templates. Cooperating signals can be bypassed by deacetylase inhibitors. Three findings show that histone H4 hyperacetylation is one target for cooperating signals, although it alone is not sufficient: (1) Cdc42.V12, but not RhoA.V14, induces H4 hyperacetylation; (2) cooperating signals use the same SAPK/JNK-dependent or -independent pathways to induce H4 hyperacetylation; (3) growth factor and stress stimuli induce substantial H4 hyperacetylation, detectable in reporter gene chromatin. These data establish a link between signal-regulated acetylation events and gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2077530579,"Bacterial pathogens synthesize numerous proteins that are either secreted or localized within bacterial cells. To address the impact of antigen compartmentalization on T cell immunity, we constructed recombinant Listeria monocytogenes that express a model CD8T cell epitope as a secreted or nonsecreted fusion protein. Both forms of the antigen, either secreted into the host cell cytoplasm or retained within bacterial cells, efficiently prime CD8 T cell responses. However, epitope-specific CD8 T cells confer protection only against bacteria secreting the antigen but not against the bacteria expressing the nonsecreted form of the same antigen. This dichotomy as a result of antigen compartmentalization suggests that bacterial antigens are presented by multiple MHC class I pathways to prime CD8 T cells, but only the endogenous pathway provides target antigens for CD8 T cell-mediated protective immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2031225710,"The interaction of translational elongation factor EF-G with the ribosome in the posttranslocational state has been mapped by directed hydroxyl radical probing. Localized hydroxyl radicals were generated from Fe(II) tethered to 18 different sites on the surface of EF-G bound to the ribosome. Cleavages in ribosomal RNA were mapped, providing proximity relationships between specific sites of EF-G and rRNA elements of the ribosome. Collectively, these data provide a set of constraints by which EF-G can be positioned unambiguously in the ribosome at low resolution. The proximities of different domains of EF-G to well-characterized elements of rRNA have additional implications for the mechanism of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042604124,"Two distinct mechanisms regulate synaptic efficacy at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ): a PKA-dependent modulation of quantal size and a retrograde regulation of presynaptic release. Postsynaptic expression of a constitutively active PKA catalytic subunit decreases quantal size, whereas overexpression of a mutant PKA regulatory subunit (inhibiting PKA activity) increases quantal size. Increased PKA activity also decreases the response to direct iontophoresis of glutamate onto postsynaptic receptors. The PKA-dependent modulation of quantal size requires the presence of the muscle-specific glutamate receptor DGluRIIA, since PKA-dependent modulation of quantal size is lost in homozygous viable DGluRIIA− mutants. Furthermore, elevated postsynaptic PKA reduces the quantal amplitude and the time constant of miniature excitatory junctional potential (mEJP) decay to values that are nearly identical to those observed in DGluRIIA− mutants. The PKA-dependent reduction in quantal size is accompanied developmentally by an increase in presynaptic quantal content, indicating the presence of a retrograde signal that regulates presynaptic release."
https://openalex.org/W2070126970,"Chromatin boundaries or insulator elements affect the interaction between enhancers and promoters. The gypsy insulator contains two proteins, Su(Hw) and Mod(mdg4). Both proteins colocalize on several hundred sites on polytene chromosomes and are distributed in a punctated pattern in the nuclear matrix. Mutations in mod(mdg4) have properties characteristic of a trxG gene. In addition, mutations in trxG genes enhance insulator effects on adjacent enhancers, whereas mutations in Pc have the opposite result. These alterations correlate with changes in the pattern of nuclear localization of insulator components. The results suggest a model in which PcG and TrxG proteins regulate insulator function by establishing higher order domains of chromatin organization required for the assembly of functional insulators at the nuclear matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2055013423,"Activity of LET-23, the C. elegans homolog of the epidermal growth factor receptor, is required in multiple tissues. RAS activation is necessary and sufficient for certain LET-23 functions. We show that an inositol trisphosphate receptor can act as a RAS-independent, tissue-specific positive effector of LET-23. Moreover, an inositol trisphosphate kinase negatively regulates this transduction pathway. Signals transduced by LET-23 control ovulation through changes in spermathecal dilation, possibly dependent upon calcium release regulated by both IP3 and IP4. Our results demonstrate that one mechanism by which receptor tyrosine kinases can evoke tissue-specific responses is through activation of distinct signal transduction cascades in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2042524484,"The semaphorins comprise a large family of conserved glycoproteins, several members of which have been shown to function in repulsive neuronal growth cone guidance. We show here that Drosophila Semaphorin I (Sema I), a transmembrane semaphorin expressed on embryonic motor and CNS axons, is required for correct guidance of motor axons and for the formation of CNS pathways. In mutant embryos lacking Sema I, motor axons stall and fail to defasciculate at specific choice points where normally they would project to their muscle targets. In addition, a specific CNS fascicle fails to form correctly in these embryos. Rescue and ectopic expression experiments show that Sema I is required in neurons to mediate axon guidance decisions. These studies further suggest that like secreted semaphorins, transmembrane semaphorins can function as repulsive guidance cues for specific axon guidance events during neurodevelopment."

Hsp70 proteins bind and release unfolded polypeptides in an ATP-dependent reaction cycle, with the ADP-form of Hsp70 exhibiting a higher affinity for substrates than the ATP-form (26Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It is proposed that Hsp40 helps stabilize Hsp70-polypeptide complexes through promoting the conversion of Hsp70-ATP to Hsp70-ADP (26Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in some instances, Hsp40 proteins can promote the release of proteins that are bound to Hsp70 (7Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9798-9804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ydj1 and a subset of Hsp40 family members also recognize aspects of non-native protein structure and bind protein folding intermediates in a manner that facilitates subsequent interactions between them and Hsp70 (28Langer T.

In the absence of Hsp40, complex formation between Hsp70 and protein folding intermediates can be inefficient, which leads to the aggregation of substrate proteins (28Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 31Cyr D.M.

Sequence analysis suggests that the regulatory and chaperone actions of Hsp40 family members are catalyzed by four different conserved sequence motifs that originate from DnaJ (3Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Hsp40 proteins contain regions termed the J-domain, G/F-rich region, zinc finger-like domain, and conserved carboxyl terminus (1Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Cyr D.M. Gething M.-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Factors. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 89-95Google Scholar). The J-domain corresponds to the amino-terminal 70 amino acid residues of DnaJ and is found in all Hsp40 proteins. The J-domain is responsible for regulation of the ATP hydrolytic cycle of Hsp70. The NMR structure of J-domain demonstrates that it contains four regions of α-helical conformation, with helices I and II lying in an anti-parallel orientation to helices III and IV (35Hill R.B. Flanagan J.M. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Qian Y.Q. Patel D. Hartl F.U. McColl D.J. J. Mol.

A. 1994; 91: 11343-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The orientation of helices I and II to III and IV is dictated by a loop in the J-domain formed by an HPD tripeptide that is found in all Hsp40 family members. Mutations in the HPD motif and faces of helices II and III abrogate the ability of Hsp40 proteins to interact with Hsp70 and regulate its ATPase activity (38Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 39Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

Functions of the G/F-rich region, the zinc finger-like region and the conserved carboxyl terminus of Hsp40 proteins are not clear. The G/F-rich region is thought to act as a flexible spacer between the J-domain and other regions in Hsp40 proteins (4Silver P.A. Way J.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the case of DnaJ, the G/F-rich region is required in conjunction with the J-domain in order for productive interactions with E. coli Hsp70 to occur (42Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 43Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, because several Hsp40 family members lack the G/F-rich region and still interact with Hsp70, this conserved motif is not required for the function of all Hsp40 proteins (13Jiang R.-F. Greener T. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Braun J.E.A. Wilbanks S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25989-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cysteine-rich repeats that resemble C4 zinc binding domains comprise the zinc finger-like domain and play a role in polypeptide binding by Hsp40 family members (44Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 45Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Fragments of DnaJ that contain the zinc finger-like region are capable of suppressing protein aggregation (45Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, family members that lack the zinc finger-like region can form complexes with cellular proteins and appear to function as molecular chaperones (1Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 2Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Biol.

These data suggest that other regions of Hsp40 are also involved in interactions with non-native proteins. The conserved region in the carboxyl terminus of DnaJ lies adjacent to the zinc finger-like region and is typically present in Hsp40 proteins that bind polypeptides (1Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 2Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Biol.

However, a role for this domain in the function of Hsp40 family members has not been determined. To further define the mechanism of action for Hsp40 proteins in cellular protein metabolism, we have carried out a structure-function analysis of Ydj1. The functional analysis of protease-resistant fragments and mutant proteins has identified subdomains in Ydj1 responsible for its regulatory and chaperone activities. The J-domain functions independent of domains responsible for chaperone functions and is sufficient for regulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity. The conserved carboxyl terminus was identified as a region in Ydj1 that plays a major role in binding unfolded polypeptides. The zinc finger-like region was found to function in protein folding, but was not observed to be essential for stable binding of denatured model substrates. These data demonstrate that Ydj1 contains independent functional units that act via a coordinated mechanism to assist Hsp70 in interactions with cellular proteins. Hsp70 Ssa1 protein, termed Hsp70 for the remainder of the text, was overexpressed in yeast strain MW141 and purified by ATP-agarose, DEAE, and hydroxyapatite chromatography by established techniques (46Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frames for Ydj1, Ydj1 H34Q (39Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and Ydj1 G315D (24Kimura Y. Yahara I. Lindquist S. Science. 1995; 268: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pET9d, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified by ion-exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography as described previously (46Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ydj1 C159T was tagged with six histidine residues at its amino terminus and purified by metal chelate chromatography (21Atencio D.P. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In experiments with Ydj1 C159T, a histidine-tagged version of Ydj1 was utilized as a control. Ydj1 H34Q and Ydj1 G315D both behaved similarly to Ydj1 on ion-exchange columns, and these proteins all ran as dimers on gel filtration columns (data not shown). Therefore, it does not appear that the mutant forms of Ydj1 we have purified are grossly misfolded. Histidine-tagged Ydj1 was capable of suppressing the temperature sensitive growth phenotype of ΔYdj1 strains and appeared to function with the same efficiency as Ydj1 (data not shown). Additionally, purified His-Ydj1 behaved identically to the nontagged version in assays for regulatory and chaperone function described below (data not shown). Ydj1 C159T behaved similarly to His-tagged Ydj1 in all purification steps and ran as a dimer on gel filtration columns. Ydj1 (0.5 mg/ml) was digested with trypsin or proteinase K (PK) 1The abbreviations used are: PK, proteinase K; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. at the concentrations indicated in digestion buffer (150 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mm DTT) for 1 h at 25 °C. Digestions were terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm. Protease-resistant fragments of Ydj1 liberated were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12.5 or 16% acrylamide gels for the trypsin and PK digestions, respectively. Digested Ydj1 (4.0 μg) was run out on SDS-PAGE gels to resolve the products of the proteolytic digestion from each other. Gels were then soaked for 20 min in transfer buffer (10 mm3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid made in 10% methanol). Fragments were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes in a Bio-Rad Mini-Wet cell blotter for 60 min with the power supply set at 50 V constant voltage. Membranes were then soaked in water for 5 min to remove the transfer buffer and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to illuminate the positions of the transferred protein fragments. Fragments were excised from the membranes, and the identity of the first six amino acid residues in them were determined with a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Microsequencing Apparatus. The molecular weights of the products liberated from Ydj1 by limited proteolysis were determined on a Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Aliquots of digested material (5 μl) were mixed with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in a water:acetonitrile (50:50) mixture acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 1-μl aliquot of this mixture was spotted onto a gold plate target. Ionization of the sample was then carried out with a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. A delayed extraction method was used in the determination of molecular weight. Measurement of ion flight times through the drift region of the mass spectrometer were carried out with a Tektronix (Beaverton, OR) TDS784A oscilloscope. The instrument was calibrated with external molecular weight standards. To analyze the function of Ydj1 (1–383), Ydj1 was digested with 2 μg/ml of trypsin for 30 min at 25 °C. The trypsin was then inactivated with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the activity of Ydj1 (1–383) was analyzed. At this trypsin concentration, Ydj1 is almost completely converted to Ydj1 (1–383) and contains less than 1% contamination with Ydj1 or other fragments (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). The levels of contaminants in this preparation were calculated to be insufficient to account for the observed activity of Ydj1 (1–383). To generate Ydj1 (102–394), Ydj1 (179–384), and Ydj1 (1–90) for functional analysis, digestions of Ydj1 with two different concentrations of PK were carried out. Then, the different Ydj1 fragments generated were separated from each other by high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography, concentrated, and immediately assayed for activity. To generate Ydj1 (102–394) virtually free of Ydj1 (179–384) and Ydj1 (1–90), 1 mg of Ydj1 (1 mg/ml) was digested with 1–2.0 μg/ml PK for 45 min at 25 °C. The concentration of PK utilized for this digestion was adjusted so that Ydj1 was efficiently converted to Ydj1 (102–394), but only minimal conversion to Ydj1 (179–384) could occur (see Fig. 1 C, lane 3). To separate Ydj1 (102–394) from Ydj1 (1–90) generated in protease digestions, reaction mixtures loaded onto a Bio-Rad Bio-Select G-250 gel filtration column. The column was then developed with a mobile phase consisting of 150 mm KCl, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 2 mm DTT that was pumped at 0.6 ml/min with a back pressure of 850 psi. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected with a Bio-Rad Biologic medium pressure chromatography system and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to identify peaks. Ydj1 (102–394) and Ydj1 (179–384) eluted at 7.8 ml, and Ydj1 (1–90) eluted at 9.0 ml. The recovery of Ydj1 fragments in this step was typically 40% of the starting material. Gel filtration typically resolved the majority of Ydj1 (1–90) from Ydj1 (102–394), but a 3% contamination of this fragment remained, and Ydj1 (179–384) was present as a 5% contaminant. The quantity of Ydj1 (179–384) and Ydj1 (1–90) present in the Ydj1 (102–394) preparations were calculated to be insufficient to account for the activity of this fragments in functional assays. To prepare Ydj1 (179–394) free of Ydj1 (102–394), Ydj1 was digested under the conditions listed above, with 7.5 μg/ml PK. Ydj1 fragments liberated in a representative digestion are exhibited in Fig. 1 C, lane 5. To separate Ydj1 (179–384) from Ydj1 (1–90) and the unidentified lower molecular weight fragments generated, these samples were loaded onto on a Bio-Rad Bio-Select G-250 column and treated as described above. Ydj1 (179–384) eluted at 8.0 ml of mobile phase, and Ydj1 (1–90) eluted at 9.0 ml. The Ydj1 (179–384) fraction was routinely 93% pure with a 4% contamination of Ydj1 (1–90) and a 3% contamination of unidentified proteolytic products. The level of Ydj1 (1–90) and other contaminating bands present in this preparation were calculated to be insufficient to account for the activity attributed to Ydj1 (179–384). To generate a preparation of Ydj1 (1–90) that was free of larger Ydj1 fragments, digestions were carried out with 2.0 μg/ml as described above. Ydj1 (1–90) was then resolved from the Ydj1 (102–394) and Ydj1 (179–384) generated by the PK digestion (Fig. 1 C, lane 3) by gel filtration as described above. The Ydj1 (1–90) peak fraction was about 95% pure and contained a 5% contamination with Ydj1 (102–394) and Ydj1 (179–384). Ydj1 (1–90) ran as a broad band on SDS-PAGE gels, but microsequence analysis indicated that the majority of protein in this band had an amino terminus that corresponded to residues 1–6 of Ydj1 (Fig. 1 D) and to the J-domain of Ydj1. Analysis of the peptides in the Ydj1 band by mass spectroscopy indicated that the major fragment of Ydj1 present in this band was 9596 Da in size and corresponded to Ydj1 (1–90). We have calculated that the levels of Ydj1 (102–394) and Ydj1 (179–384) that contaminate the Ydj1 (1–90) preparation are too low to account for the functional activity attributed to this fraction. Purified Hsp70 was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, and 50 μm ATP ([α-32P]ATP, 2.0–3.0 × 105 cpm/pmol) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were then placed on ice, and duplicate 2-μl aliquots were assayed for ADP formation by thin layer chromatography on PEI cellulose plates (46Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous ADP formation was assayed and subtracted prior to calculations for rates of ATP hydrolysis. The kinetics of Hsp70 ATPase activity were linear for at least 20 min under these experimental conditions (46Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of rhodanese aggregation were determined by light scattering as described previously (31Cyr D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine rhodanese (50 μm; Sigma) was denatured for 1 h at 25 °C in 6 m guanidinium-HCl buffered with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and fresh 10 mm DTT. Denatured rhodanese was diluted 100-fold into 300 μl of reaction buffer composed of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mmKCl, and 10 mm DTT. When present, respective chaperone proteins were added prior to rhodanese. Rates of rhodanese aggregation were determined by monitoring increases in light scattering over time with a spectrophotometer set at 320 nm at 25 °C. Refolding of firefly luciferase (Promega) by Ydj1 and Hsp70 was carried out as described previously (47Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Luciferase (13 mg/ml) was diluted 42-fold into denaturation buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 6 m guanidinum-HCl, 5 mm DTT). The denaturation reaction was allowed to proceed for 40 min at 25 °C, and then a 1-μl aliquot was removed and mixed with 125 μl of refolding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots of 1 μl were removed from the refolding buffer at indicated times and mixed with 60 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was then measured with a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer. Ydj1 (1.6 μm), the Ydj1 mutants (1.6 μm), and Hsp70 (0.8 μm) were added to reactions prior to luciferase. The level of luciferase activity observed when Ydj1 and Hsp70 were present in reaction mixture was 17-fold higher than that activity observed when these chaperone proteins were omitted, which is consistent with previous reports (47Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase (7.5 μl) in a 100 μm stock that was denatured in 6 mguanidinium-HCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mmDTT and was mixed with 292.5 μl of folding buffer (150 mmKCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT) to give a final concentration of 2.5 μm. Where indicated, 5 μm Ydj1 or its mutant forms were added to folding buffer prior to the addition of luciferase. After a 20-min incubation period at 25 °C to allow complexes between Ydj1 and luciferase to form, reactions were loaded onto a Novarose SE-1000/17 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with folding buffer and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. To determine where Ydj1 and luciferase migrated, 0.5 ml fractions were collected, and the proteins present in 400 μl aliquots of each fraction were precipitated by the addition of 1.2 ml of acetone. Pelleted material was resuspended in 10 μl of sample buffer and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The concentration of Ydj1 and luciferase present in different fractions was quantitated by densitometry. In the absence of luciferase, Ydj1 eluted at 9.0 ml of mobile phase. In the absence of Ydj1, less than 1% of the unfolded luciferase eluted, whereas almost 50% of native luciferase was recovered in a peak at 10 ml. When Ydj1 (5 μm) and native luciferase (2.5 μm) were mixed and then injected onto the column, no alteration in the migration of either protein was observed. When Ydj1 and unfolded lucif"
https://openalex.org/W1967743127,"Recent molecular studies of glutamate channels have provided increasingly detailed models of the agonist-binding site and of the channel pore. However, little information is available on the domains involved in channel gating. We examined the molecular determinants for the NR2-subunit specificity of glycine-independent desensitization of NMDA channels using NR2C/NR2A chimeric subunits expressed in HEK 293 cells. We show that glycine-independent desensitization is controlled by N-terminal domains of the NR2 subunit that flank the putative agonist-binding domain: a four amino acid (aa) segment immediately preceding the first transmembrane domain (M1) and a region containing the leucine/isoleucine/valine–binding protein–like (LIVBP-like) domain. Our results provide evidence for a functional role of the region containing the LIVBP-like domain in glutamate receptor channels. We suggest that the pre-M1 segment, presumably situated near the entrance to the pore, serves as a dynamic link between ligand binding and channel gating."

https://openalex.org/W2035501471,"We report here that neuregulin (NRG) isoforms with a conserved cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in their N terminus regulate expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at developing interneuronal synapses and report the isolation of transmembrane NRG isoforms with this CRD within the N-terminal portion. CRD-NRG mRNA and immunoreactive protein are detected early in developing presynaptic (visceral motor) neurons. The levels of expression of CRD-NRG peak prior to the formation of synapses with their postsynaptic partners, the ganglionic sympathetic neurons. Recombinant CRD-NRG mimics the effects of presynaptic input on target neurons. Functional deletion of CRD-NRG from presynaptic neurons abolishes the upregulation of nAChR expression induced by input-derived soluble material. Thus, CRD-NRG appears to be both a necessary and a sufficient signal for the control of neuronal nAChR expression during synaptogenesis."

The behavioral effects were correlated with the long survival of glomus cells in the host brain. In host tissue, glomus cells were organized into glomerulus-like structures and retained the ability to secrete dopamine. Several weeks after transplantation, dopaminergic fibers emerged from the graft, reinnervating the striatal gray matter. The special durability of grafted glomus cells in the conditions of brain parenchyma could be related to their sensitivity to hypoxia, which is known to induce cell growth, excitability, and dopamine synthesis. This work should stimulate research on the clinical applicability of carotid body autotransplants in Parkinson's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1986700543,"Analysis of the Drosophila lark gene indicates that it encodes an RNA-binding protein that functions as a regulatory element of the circadian clock output pathway controlling adult eclosion. We now demonstrate that the lark RNA-binding protein oscillates in abundance during the circadian cycle; importantly, the phasing of the lark rhythm is consistent with gene-dosage studies, which indicate that the protein behaves as a repressor molecule. The lark protein rhythm persists in constant conditions (continuous darkness and constant temperature) and is eliminated by period gene null mutations, confirming that it is under clock control and suggesting that it acts as an output mechanism that mediates the temporal regulation of adult eclosion. We also show that lark protein oscillates in abundance within a defined group of neuropeptide (CCAP) -containing neurons of the ventral nervous system (VNS), which in other insects are thought to comprise cellular elements of the clock output pathway regulating eclosion."
https://openalex.org/W2012148599,"In studying chimeras of NR2A and NR2C subunits of the NMDA receptor, we have found that glycine-independent desensitization depends on two regions of the extracellular N-terminal domain. One corresponds to a stretch of ∼190 amino acids preceding the glutamate-binding domain S1. The other localizes at the interface between the N-terminal segment and the first transmembrane domain of NR2A subunits and involves A555 and S556. Both regions support desensitization in the absence of the other with different time courses. Desensitization did not develop with time in receptors containing the entire N-terminal region of NR2C. The introduction of A555 into the corresponding position of NR2C subunits enabled the receptors to manifest time-dependent increase in desensitization. Thus, this determinant behaves as an allosteric effector for glycine-independent desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2008900802,"A technique to identify and quantitate simultaneously more than 30 compounds in individual neurons is described. The method uses nanoliter volume sampling, capillary electrophoresis separation, and wavelength-resolved native fluorescence detection. Limits of detection (LODs) range from the low attomole to the femtomole range, with 5-hydroxytryptamine (or serotonin [5-HT]) LODs being approximately 20 attomoles. Although the cellular sample matrix is chemically complex, the combination of electrophoretic migration time and fluorescence spectral information allows positive identification of aromatic monoamines, aromatic amino acids and peptides containing them, flavins, adenosine- and guanosine-nucleotide analogs, and other fluorescent compounds. Individual identified neurons from Aplysia californica and Pleurobranchaea californica are used to demonstrate the applicability and figures of merit of this technique."

At low depolarizations, or when the α1 subunit is expressed in the absence of auxiliary α2-δ or β subunits, the small conductance channels are seen alone, and their biophysical properties, including voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation, are very similar to native T-type calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2153139888,"We have isolated and characterized mutations in Drosophila neurotactin, a gene that encodes a cell adhesion protein widely expressed during neural development. Analysis of both loss and gain of gene function conditions during embryonic and postembryonic development revealed specific requirements for neurotactin during axon outgrowth, fasciculation, and guidance. Furthermore, embryos of some double mutant combinations of neurotactin and other genes encoding adhesion/signaling molecules, including neuroglian, derailed, and kekkon1, displayed phenotypic synergy. This result provides evidence for functional cooperativity in vivo between the adhesion and signaling pathways controlled by neurotactin and the other three genes."

Knowledge of the mechanism of mammalian DNA replication is important not only for understanding how this process is regulated in normal cells, but also for the design of therapies against cancers in which this vital function is perturbed. Replication of the mammalian genome has been investigated in vitro using the SV40 DNA virus as a model system, because all of the factors required for SV40 DNA replication, except for large T antigen, the initiator protein and helicase, are host cell-encoded. Recently, all of the factors required for SV40 DNA replication in vitro have been identified, and data from numerous biochemical studies suggest the following model for how these factors function (Refs. 1Bambara R.A.

By this model, a potential rate-limiting step for efficient DNA synthesis is the activity of RFC, which facilitates DNA synthesis by the highly processive pol δ. As implicated by in vitrostudies, the importance of RFC for DNA replication has been confirmed by in vivo studies that have demonstrated that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of human RFC is essential for viability and functions in DNA replication and repair (3Howell E.A.

Nevertheless, both biochemical and genetic studies have suggested a requirement for RFC in DNA repair (9Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell.

Mutations in the S. cerevisiae gene encoding the large subunit of RFC (cdc44) have been shown to render the cell sensitive to exposure to the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate and UV radiation, but not γ irradiation, suggesting a role for RFC in the base excision and nucleotide excision repair pathways (8McAlear M.A. Tuffo K.M. Holm C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 65-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, mutations in the pol30 gene encoding PCNA have been found to suppress the DNA repair defect in cdc44 mutants (8McAlear M.A. Tuffo K.M. Holm C.

In addition, in vitroreconstitution studies have demonstrated a requirement for RFC for the pol δ (or ε)-catalyzed DNA synthesis step during nucleotide excision repair (14Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which have been found to share considerable sequence identity and similarity. In addition, a significant degree of sequence identity has been found to exist between homologous subunits of not only yeast and human RFC but also between the eukaryotic RFCs and the Escherichia coliγ and δ′ subunits of the γ complex, the functional equivalent of RFC in prokaryotes (21Bunz F. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11014-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22O'Donnell M. Onrust R. Dean F.B. Chen M. Hurwitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).All five subunits of RFC have been shown to contain seven conserved regions that include the nucleotide binding motif found in all known ATPases, and the “DEAD box” motif found in RNA and DNA helicases (6Cullmann G. Fien K. Ryuji K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). One additional region, conserved only among the large subunits, has been noted to share a significant degree of similarity with prokaryotic DNA ligases and has been termed therefore the “ligase homology box” (6Cullmann G. Fien K. Ryuji K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that RFC possesses a structure-specific DNA binding activity, displaying a preference for substrates with a 5′-overhang (23Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an ATPase activity that is stimulated by DNA and further augmented in the presence of PCNA (24Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,17Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the many interesting structure-function relationships in human RFC, we have reconstituted in active form a recombinant human RFC in Sf9 cells and characterized the subunit requirements for complex assembly and activity.DISCUSSIONBiochemical characterization of mammalian DNA replication has been hampered due to lack of sufficient quantities of the replication factors necessary for such studies. Here we report the reconstitution of human replication factor C in Sf9 cells, characterization of its activities in vitro, and analysis of the subunit requirements for complex assembly and activity. Similar expression of RFC has been reported elsewhere (34Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10065-10071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The five subunits of RFC share a significant degree of homology, which is manifested as seven conserved sequence motifs. These include the P-loop and DEAD-box motifs found in other ATP/GTPases. Despite the apparent functional similarity, in vivo the function of each subunit is not redundant. This raises the question of why so many similar subunits are necessary. The studies in this report suggest that all five RFC subunits are essential to form a stable complex competent for DNA synthesis. Central to the complex is the 37-kDa subunit, which functions as a scaffold on which the other subunits can assemble (Fig. 7 D). The direct interaction of the 36- and 38-kDa subunits with the 37-kDa subunit are required for incorporation of the 40- and 140-kDa subunits, respectively, into the complex. The stability of the 140-kDa subunit in the complex depends on the presence of both the 38- and 40-kDa subunits. In the absence of the 140-kDa subunit, the 40-kDa subunit displays an absolute requirement for the 36-kDa subunit for incorporation into a subcomplex. However, a subcomplex consisting of the 140-, 40-, 38-, and 37-kDa subunits can form, albeit inefficiently, in the absence of the 36-kDa subunit, implying that other protein-protein interactions, most notably with the 140-kDa subunit, may stabilize the 40-kDa subunit in the complex.The subunit interactions required for the assembly of RFC have also been investigated by Uhlmann et al. (34Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Podust and Fanning (35Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In each report (this one and the aforementioned ones), a stable interaction between the 40-, 37-, and 36-kDa subunits was reported. Moreover, this report and that of Podust and Fanning (35Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have described the assembly of this subcomplex, which was found to involve a direct interaction between the 37- and 36-kDa subunits and the interaction of the 40-kDa subunit with the 37-kDa subunit-36-kDa subunit complex. A requirement for the 38-kDa subunit for incorporation of the 140-kDa subunit into the RFC complex has been shown here and in Uhlmann et al. (34Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unique findings regarding RFC assembly reported here are 1) a stable interaction of the 38-kDa subunit with the 37-kDa subunit that was not found to be dependent on any other subunit (Figs. 5 A and 6), 2) the requirement for the 40-kDa subunit for efficient incorporation of the 140-kDa subunit (Fig. 5 A), and 3) formation of a stable complex between the 140-, 40-, 38-, and 37-kDa subunits in the absence of the 36-kDa subunit (Figs. 5 A, 7 A, and 7 B). Discordant with the results in Figs. 5 A and 6 A are those presented in Uhlmann et al. (34Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which 1) implied that the 40-kDa subunit is dispensable for complex assembly and 2) did not address the dependence on the 36-kDa subunit for assembly of the 40-kDa subunit into the RFC complex but instead advocated a direct interaction between the 40- and 37-kDa subunits. The requirement for the 36-kDa subunit for a 37-kDa subunit-38-kDa subunit interaction described by Podust and Fanning (35Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is contradictory to the results shown in Fig. 6, which demonstrated a direct interaction between the 38- and 37-kDa subunits in the absence of any other RFC subunit. In summary, we believe the RFC complex is probably organized as two “domains,” one consisting of the 40-, 36-, and 37-kDa subunits and the other consisting of the 140- and 38-kDa subunits. These two subcomplexes are juxtaposed by the 40-kDa subunit-140-kDa subunit and 38-kDa subunit-37-kDa subunit interactions, which, if eliminated, are predicted to result in the loss of complex formation (see Fig. 7 D). This model provides an explanation for why omission of the 140- and 36-kDa subunits from the complex permits the formation of stable quaternary complexes of the 140-, 40-, 38-, and 37-kDa subunits (Fig. 5 A, lane 9; Fig. 7 A, lane 9) and 40-, 38-, 37-, and 36-kDa subunits (Fig. 5 A,lane 6; Fig. 6, lane 7), respectively.The primary role of RFC during DNA synthesis is to load PCNA, the processivity factor for pol δ, onto the DNA, thus facilitating highly efficient leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. This process entails recognition of the primer terminus by RFC, binding and disruption of the PCNA trimer, and topologically linking PCNA to the DNA. How these activities are distributed among the five subunits is unknown. in vivo experiments in yeast have shown a requirement for all five RFC subunits for viability (4Li X. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Li X. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21880-21884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cullmann G.

In vitro experiments presented in this report and elsewhere have shown biochemically a requirement for the large subunit of RFC for DNA replication, because a subcomplex lacking the large subunit was found to be incompetent for DNA synthesis. RFC has been shown to be a structure-specific DNA-binding protein, displaying a preference for DNA molecules mimicking DNA replication substrates (23Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion analyses of the 140-kDa subunit have defined the presence of at least two “domains” involved in DNA binding, one at the NH2terminus that includes the ligase homology domain (39Fotedar R.

Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and one located near the COOH terminus (40Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the specificity of these putative large subunit DNA binding domains for primer termini is inconclusive.Present in all five RFC subunits are motifs termed RFC box III and RFC box V that are similar to the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) and DEAD box consensus sequences, respectively, found in proteins that hydrolyze ATP or other nucleotide triphosphates. The RFC complex possesses ATPase activity, and stable binding of RFC to DNA has been shown to require ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. Moreover, DNA appears to be a co-factor for the ATPase of RFC, stimulating this activity approximately 20-fold. The subunit(s) responsible for this activity is unknown. In this report, evidence is presented indicating that a complex of the small subunits, although inactive for DNA replication, is an efficient ATPase. Similar to the entire RFC complex, the ATPase activity of the small subunit complex was found to be highly stimulated by DNA, but, unlike the entire RFC complex, its ATPase activity was not responsive to PCNA. This observation is consistent with the findings of McAlearet al. (8McAlear M.A. Tuffo K.M. Holm C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 65-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicated that a direct interaction between the large subunit of yeast RFC (encoded by cdc44) and PCNA (encoded by pol30) is required for RFC function. The apparent inability of PCNA to stimulate the activity of the small subunit ATPase is contradictory to the observations recently reported by Cai et al. (41Cai J. Biggs E. Uhlmann F. Phillips B. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18974-18981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the interaction between the small subunit complex and PCNA may shed some light on this issue.As noted earlier, the 140-kDa subunit has been reported to contain two distinct DNA binding domains; but which, if either, of these regions is responsible for the DNA binding properties of RFC is unclear. Experiments presented in this report suggest that a complex of the small subunits of RFC is a DNA-stimulated ATPase, implying that at least one of these subunits has DNA binding activity. In the report of Uhlmann et al. (40Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the four small subunits of RFC were tested individually for the ability to bind DNA, and none exhibited any DNA binding activity. Perhaps these subunits bind DNA cooperatively, and consequently, a complex of these subunits is required for stable DNA binding. Alternatively, a complex of the small subunits is necessary to form a functional ATPase that is competent to stably bind DNA. Indeed, although each subunit of RFC has the primary features of an ATPase, reconstitution experiments have revealed that a minimum of three subunits (the 40-, 37-, and 36-kDa subunits) are required for DNA-dependent ATPase activity in vitro. 2V. Ellison and B. Stillman, submitted for publication. How the DNA binding, ATP binding, and ATPase activities of RFC are distributed among the subunits remains to be determined.In contrast to RFC, much more is known about the prokaryotic equivalent of RFC, the γ complex of E. coli. It consists of five subunits (γδδ′χϕ) and like RFC possesses a DNA-dependent ATPase activity that is required for loading the β clamp, the E. coli equivalent of PCNA, onto DNA (42Baker T.A. Wickner S.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 447-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although all five subunits of the γ complex are necessary for optimal activity in vitro, the minimum complex active for DNA synthesis consists of γ, δ, and δ′ (43Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ and δ′ subunits are homologous to the small subunits of RFC and contain nucleotide binding motifs (6Cullmann G. Fien K. Ryuji K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22O'Donnell M. Onrust R. Dean F.B. Chen M. Hurwitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the γ subunit has been demonstrated to be the sole functional ATPase in the complex, and it is optimally active only when present in a complex with the δ and δ′ subunits (43Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Xiao H. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13378-13383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the γδδ′ complex was found to be stimulated by a complex of the χ and ϕ subunits, as well as by the β clamp, which has been shown to interact with the δ subunit (45Xiao H. Crombie R. Dong Z. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11773-11778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Given the similarity among all five RFC subunits and, consequently, the greater complexity of functional analyses, it will be interesting to see if a similar distribution of the functions of the complex among the five subunits is achieved in RFC. Further characterization of the conserved regions shared among the subunits will undoubtedly yield interesting insights into how multisubunit protein complexes coordinate multiple activities. Knowledge of the mechanism of mammalian DNA replication is important not only for understanding how this process is regulated in normal cells, but also for the design of therapies against cancers in which this vital function is perturbed. Replication of the mammalian genome has been investigated in vitro using the SV40 DNA virus as a model system, because all of the factors required for SV40 DNA replication, except for large T antigen, the initiator protein and helicase, are host cell-encoded. Recently, all of the factors required for SV40 DNA replication in vitro have been identified, and data from numerous biochemical studies suggest the following model for how these factors function (Refs. 1Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar and 2DePamphilis M.L. Cold Spring Harbor Monogr.

By this model, a potential rate-limiting step for efficient DNA synthesis is the activity of RFC, which facilitates DNA synthesis by the highly processive pol δ. As implicated by in vitrostudies, the importance of RFC for DNA replication has been confirmed by in vivo studies that have demonstrated that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of human RFC is essential for viability and functions in DNA replication and repair (3Howell E.A.

In contrast to the function of RFC in DNA replication, its role in DNA repair is less clear. Nevertheless, both biochemical and genetic studies have suggested a requirement for RFC in DNA repair (9Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2048236220,"Abstract Intricate interplay may exist between pre-mRNA splicing and the cell division cycle, and fission yeast Dsk1 appears to play a role in such a connection. Previous genetic analyses have implicated Dsk1 in the regulation of chromosome segregation at the metaphase/anaphase transition. Yet, its protein sequence suggests that Dsk1 may function as a kinase specific for SR proteins, a family of pre-mRNA splicing factors containing arginine-serine repeats. Using an in vitro system with purified components, we showed that Dsk1 phosphorylated human and yeast SR proteins with high specificity. The Dsk1-phosphorylated SF2/ASF protein was recognized strongly by a monoclonal antibody (mAb104) known to bind the in vivo phosphoepitope shared by SR proteins, indicating that the phosphorylation sites resided in the RS domain. Moreover, the fission yeast U2AF65 homolog, Prp2/Mis11 protein, was phosphorylated more efficiently by Dsk1 than by a human SR protein-specific kinase, SRPK1. Thus, these in vitroresults suggest that Dsk1 is a fission yeast SR protein-specific kinase, and Prp2/Mis11 is likely an in vivo target for Dsk1. Together with previous genetic data, the studies support the notion that Dsk1 may play a role in coordinating pre-mRNA splicing and the cell division cycle."
