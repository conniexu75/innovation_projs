https://openalex.org/W1545521314,"Human alveolar macrophages have the capacity to degrade elastin. As an approach to define proteinases responsible for this activity, we recently cloned a murine macrophage elastase cDNA and demonstrated that it is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase gene family (Shapiro, S. D., Griffin, G. L., Gilbert, D. J., Jenkins, N. A., Copeland, N. G., Welgus, H. G., Senior, R. M., and Ley, T. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4664-4671). We now report that there is a human orthologue of murine macrophage metalloelastase that we call human macrophage metalloelastase (HME). The full-length HME cDNA spans 1.8 kilobases and contains an open reading frame of 1410 base pairs; the predicted molecular mass of the HME proenzyme is 54 kDa. HME mRNA and protein were detected in human alveolar macrophages. Similar to murine macrophage metalloelastase, HME readily undergoes NH2- and COOH-terminal processing to a mature 22-kDa form. Both recombinant HME expressed in Escherichia coli and native HME derived from human alveolar macrophage-conditioned media degraded insoluble elastin. HME is a unique human metalloproteinase that possesses elastolytic activity and is expressed in alveolar macrophages; it is therefore a candidate molecule for the causation of diseases characterized by damage to the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1649931880,"Botulinum neurotoxins are metalloproteins with one zinc atom bound to the zinc binding motif of zinc endopeptidases. Here we show that botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, D, and E are zinc endoproteases specific for components of the synaptic vesicle docking and fusion complex. Serotypes A and E cleave SNAP-25, a 25-kDa protein of the synaptic terminal, while serotype D is specific for VAMP/synaptobrevin, a membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. Both rat brain VAMP isoforms are cleaved at a single Lys-Leu peptide bond. The proteolytic activity of these neurotoxins is inhibited by EDTA and captopril."
https://openalex.org/W1894612901,"The accuracy by which organisms duplicate their DNA is of considerable interest. At least three mechanisms operate, serially, to secure high fidelity: base selection, exonucleolytic proofreading, and postreplicative mismatch correction. To obtain insights into the efficiency and specificity of these steps in the bacterium Escherichia coli, we have performed DNA sequence analysis of mutations occurring in the bacterial lacI gene in a series of strains genetically disabled in one or more of these error avoidance pathways. The base selection efficiency was estimated from mutagenesis occurring in a mutDmutL strain, which is deficient in both proofreading (mutD5) and mismatch repair (mutL). The proofreading efficiency was derived comparing the mutD5 mutL strain to the mismatch repair-deficient mutL strain. The efficiency of mismatch repair was derived comparing the mutL strain to the wild-type strain. The results show that base selection discriminates against errors by 200,000-2,000,000-fold, proofreading by 40-200-fold, and mismatch repair by 20-400-fold, each depending on the type of error. Base selection and proofreading act more strongly against transversions than transitions, whereas mismatch repair does the opposite. The data are based on 866 sequenced lacI mutations in a target that allows the scoring of at least 127 different mutations in 76 distinct DNA sequence contexts in vivo. They may therefore have general significance."
https://openalex.org/W1660693249,"Cyclooxygenase (Cox) exists in two forms in human endothelial cells (HUVEC). We have raised antibodies that recognize the sequence of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the human Cox-2 (C)-NASSSRSGLD-DINPTVLLK. Cyclooxygenase activity of HUVEC challenged with interleukin 1 alpha or a phorbol ester increased in parallel with the mass of a protein doublet analyzed by Western blot using antibodies directed against the Cox-2 peptide; a monoclonal antibody directed against Cox-1 showed a small change in protein mass. A 35S-labeled protein doublet with a molecular mass of approximately 70,000 daltons was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Cox-2 antiserum in L-[35S] methionine-labeled cells stimulated with interleukin 1 alpha. This protein was not recovered by pretreating the antiserum with the Cox-2 peptide before immunoprecipitation. A minor variation in 35S-immunoprecipitated protein was obtained with the polyclonal anti-Cox-1 antibody. Both immunoprecipitated Cox-1 and Cox-2 possessed cyclooxygenase activity that was inhibited by flurbiprofen. Endoglycosidase H treatment of immunoprecipitated Cox-2 proteins caused a decline in the apparent molecular size similar to that observed with immunoprecipitated Cox-1 or sheep cyclooxygenase but did not suppress the doublet. These results show by direct protein measurement that HUVEC synthesize the novel Cox-2 under appropriate stimulation, with little changes of Cox-1."
https://openalex.org/W1568595238,"Brain proline-directed protein kinase (BPDK), which contains a catalytic subunit homologous to and displaying site-specific phosphorylation similar to p34cdc2 kinase (Lew, J., Winkfein, R. J., Paudel, H. K., and Wang, J. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25922-25926), has been examined for possible involvement in tau phosphorylation. Immunoblot analyses using peptide antibodies specific for BPDK have revealed the presence of the kinase in bovine brain microtubules purified extensively by repeated polymerization and depolymerization cycles. When the microtubule proteins are separated into the tubulin and microtubule-associated protein fractions, BPDK is found exclusively in the latter fraction. BPDK phosphorylates both tau and MAP2, the former protein being phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of 3.8 mol of phosphate/mol of tau. Analysis of the phosphopeptides isolated from the tryptic digest of the phosphorylated bovine tau has revealed seven phosphorylation sites. Based on the sequence alignment between bovine and human tau proteins, these sites correspond to Ser-195, Ser-202, Thr-205, Thr-231, Ser-235, Ser-396, and Ser-404 of human tau. Mass spectrometric analysis of the tau protein isolated from Alzheimer's paired helical filaments (PHFs) has determined three abnormal phosphorylation sites and two phosphopeptides containing a total of five abnormal phosphates (Hasegawa, M., Morishima-Kawashima, M., Takio, K., Suzuki, M., Titani, K., and Ihara, Y. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17047-17054). Two of the sites in tau phosphorylated by BPDK, Thr-231 and Ser-235, are among the abnormal phosphorylation sites, and the other sites phosphorylated by BPDK are within phosphopeptides from PHF-tau. These results suggest that BPDK may be one of the kinases responsible for the abnormal phosphorylation-associated PHF-tau."
https://openalex.org/W1588431496,"The alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric Gs protein that couples the beta-adrenergic receptor to adenylyl cyclase undergoes post-translational palmitoylation. We examined the dynamics of this modification of alpha s by metabolic labeling of COS and S49 lymphoma cells under different conditions. The endogenous alpha s proteins were immunoprecipitated with a peptide-specific antibody, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by fluorography and densitometry. A pulse-chase study of COS cells incubated with [3H]palmitate or [35S]methionine showed that for alpha s the palmitate turnover (t1/2 approximately 50 min) was significantly faster than the protein degradation. Treatment of cells with 10 microM isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, in the presence of [3H]palmitate led to a rapid 4-10-fold increase in the palmitoylation of alpha s. This increase in palmitoylation was concentration-dependent (EC50 approximately 0.9 microM) and blocked by the antagonist propranolol. The mutant alpha s proteins in the unc and H21a S49 cell lines did not show an increase in [3H]palmitate incorporation with isoproterenol treatment. Cholera toxin treatment of COS cells increased the [3H]palmitate incorporation into the alpha s subunits. These data indicate that palmitoylation of the alpha s subunit is dynamic and regulated by activation of the alpha s subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1504372166,"The 50-kDa dystrophin-associated glycoprotein (50-DAG) is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which links the muscle cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. 50-DAG is specifically deficient in skeletal muscle of patients with severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy and in skeletal and cardiac muscles of BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters. The lack of 50-DAG leads to a disruption and dysfunction of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in these diseases. The cDNA encoding 50-DAG has now been cloned from rabbit skeletal muscle. The 50-DAG deduced amino acid sequence predicts a novel protein having 387 amino acids, a 17-amino acid signal sequence, one transmembrane domain, and two potential sites of N-linked glycosylation. Affinity-purified antibodies against rabbit 50-DAG fusion proteins or synthetic peptides specifically recognized a 50-kDa protein in skeletal muscle sarcolemma and the 50-kDa component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. In contrast to dystroglycan, which is expressed in a wide variety of muscle and non-muscle tissues, 50-DAG is expressed only in skeletal and cardiac muscles and in selected smooth muscles. Finally, 50-DAG mRNA is present in mdx and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) muscle, indicating that the down-regulation of this protein in DMD and the mdx mouse is likely a post-translational event."
https://openalex.org/W1567653349,"The type I adenylyl cyclase is directly stimulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in vitro, and the enzyme is also stimulated by increases in intracellular Ca2+ in vivo. Ca2+ stimulation of the enzyme in vivo may be due to direct interactions of the enzyme with Ca2+ and calmodulin or to an indirect mechanism involving stimulation of the enzyme by Ca(2+)-activated protein kinases. In this study, we have made several point mutations within the calmodulin binding domain to determine if the Ca2+ sensitivity of the enzyme can be modified by mutagenesis. The catalytic activities of the mutant enzymes were comparable to wild type type I adenylyl cyclase. Substitution of Cys-507 with Ser-507 did not have significant effects on the calmodulin or Ca2+ sensitivity of the enzyme. However, replacement of Lys-504 with Asp caused a 4-fold decrease in sensitivity to Ca2+. Ca2+ and calmodulin stimulation were abolished by substitution of Phe-503 with Arg-503. Stimulation of type I adenylyl cyclase activity in vivo by intracellular Ca2+ was also greatly diminished with the Arg-503 mutant indicating that Ca2+ stimulation of the enzyme in vivo is due primarily to direct interactions with calmodulin and Ca2+. These data demonstrate that the Ca2+ sensitivity of this enzyme can be modulated by point mutagenesis within the putative calmodulin binding domain and indicate that the enzyme can be directly regulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1598216245,"Our aim was to measure calpain protease activity during increases in cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i) after addition of extracellular ATP. The calpain protease substrate t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin was synthesized. Nonfluorescent t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-7-amino-4- chloromethyl-coumarin diffuses into the cell where it is conjugated to glutathione forming t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin glutathione conjugate (Boc-Leu-Met-MAC-SG). The nonfluorescent, membrane impermeant Boc-Leu-Met-MAC-SG accumulates in the cell. Intracellular proteolytic hydrolysis of Boc-Leu-Met-MAC-SG releases and unquenches the fluorescence of MAC-SG. Intracellular fluorescence of MAC-SG was quantitated in single, cultured rat hepatocytes using digitized video fluorescent microscopy. Enhancement of intracellular fluorescence generation by increases in Ca2+i and inhibition by a calpain inhibitor indicated the probe was a calpain substrate. After addition of ATP, calpain protease activity increased to 156 +/- 13% of basal concurrent with a 3-fold rise of Ca2+i for 2-4 min. Thereafter, Ca2+i decreased to values of 1.5-fold above basal and protease activity returned to normal. Incubation of cells in Ca(2+)-free buffer abolished the rise in Ca2+i and calpain protease activity. Calpain protease activity increases concomitantly with increases of Ca2+i supporting the hypothesis that calpain proteases participate in Ca(2+)-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1533533640,"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two isoforms of glycogen synthase, of which glycogen synthase-2 (GS-2) appears to be the most important determinant of glycogen accumulation (Farkas, I., Hardy, T. A., Goebl, M. G., and Roach, P. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15602-15607). Partial proteolysis of purified yeast glycogen synthase activated the enzyme, mimicking the effects of dephosphorylation. The cleavage was localized to the COOH terminus of the molecule and trypsin treatment released 32P from enzyme labeled in vivo with 32P or in vitro by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Similarly, when cells were labeled with 32P, no radioactivity was incorporated into a mutant form of GS-2 truncated at residue 643 while the wild type enzyme was phosphorylated at both Ser and Thr residues. The 9 Ser and Thr residues COOH-terminal to position 643 were mutated individually to Ala, and the GS-2 mutants were expressed from a low copy plasmid in yeast that lacked functional chromosomal copies of the two glycogen synthase genes. Mutations at Ser-650, Ser-654, and Thr-667 resulted in significant activation of yeast glycogen synthase and elevation in the level of accumulated glycogen as compared with wild type. Likewise, expression of the truncated GS-2 resulted in hyperactive enzyme and the overaccumulation of glycogen. None of the other Ser or Thr mutations substantially affected glycogen synthase activity and glycogen storage. We conclude that Ser-650, Ser-654, and Thr-667 are regulatory phosphorylation sites in vivo. However, in vitro, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase modified Ser residue(s) COOH-terminal to position 659, and so the identity of the physiological GS-2 kinases is unclear. Yeast strains bearing glc7 and gac1 mutations are defective in genes encoding type 1 protein phosphatase components and are impaired in their ability to accumulate glycogen. Expression of the truncated GS-2 in these strains restored glycogen accumulation, as did the presence of GS-2 mutated at Ser-650, Ser-654, or Thr-667. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that type 1 phosphatase regulates GS-2 by controlling its phosphorylation state."
https://openalex.org/W1537517521,"We reported previously that lysosomes derived from human diploid fibroblasts import and degrade polypeptides and that these processes are stimulated by ATP and by the heat shock cognate protein of 73 kDa (hsc73). We now report several new aspects of this in vitro proteolytic pathway. (a) Among four polypeptides tested, this pathway appears to be selective for those containing KFERQ-like peptide motifs. (b) Substrate proteins specifically bind to a protein-containing site on lysosomal membranes. (c) Lysosomes derived from serum-deprived cells are twice as active as those from serum-supplemented cells. (d) A portion of intracellular hsc73 is associated with lysosomes, and the amount of lysosomal hsc73 increases in response to serum withdrawal. Additional characterization of this proteolytic pathway not reported previously shows that intact lysosomes are required, the import process is saturable with an apparent Km of 5 microM for RNase S-peptide, and reducing agents activate this lysosomal import and degradation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1606220682,"The subcellular organization and function of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive Ca2+ stores has been investigated in permeabilized hepatocytes using fluorescent probe techniques that monitor InsP3 action at the level of the Ca2+ storage organelles. Chlortetracycline fluorescence was used to follow alterations in luminal Ca2+, and InsP3-activated Mn2+ quench of compartmentalized fura-2 was used as a measure of the distribution and permeability of the InsP3-sensitive channels. Fluorescence imaging of single permeabilized hepatocytes attached to coverslips demonstrated that InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores are distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but are not present within the nuclear matrix. When hepatocytes were permeabilized in suspension, InsP3 activation of channel opening and Ca2+ release occurred in a quantal manner, such that the incremental magnitude of the response was determined by the dose of InsP3. Under these conditions dose-dependent steps of InsP3-induced Mn2+ entry into the stores occurred in the absence of changes in cytosolic or luminal Ca2+, providing evidence for a series of separate compartments with different sensitivities to InsP3. Electron microscopy studies revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum was extensively vesicularized when hepatocytes were permeabilized in suspension, whereas essentially normal endoplasmic reticulum structure was retained in cells attached to coverslips. In these attached cells the Ca2+ release and channel opening responses to InsP3 occurred in a nonquantal manner at the single cell level. Submaximal doses of InsP3 gave the same magnitude of response as a maximal InsP3 dose, although the rates of Ca2+ release and Mn2+ permeation through the InsP3-activated channels increased in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, in each cell the entire Ca2+ store was accessible for mobilization by all effective InsP3 concentrations. We conclude that the quantal release properties of the InsP3 receptor are not expressed in attached permeabilized liver cells because there is extensive luminal continuity within the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. This continuity appears to be disrupted when hepatocytes are permeabilized in suspension."
https://openalex.org/W1514648175,"Activation of certain isoforms of protein kinase C (cPKCs) requires Ca2+ and is associated with a conserved C2 domain that is not present in Ca(2+)-independent isoforms (nPKCs). The site(s) of Ca2+ binding and the role of the C2 domain have not been previously identified. We have analyzed phosphatidylserine-dependent Ca2+ binding to fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli that carry various modifications in the regulatory region of cPKC beta 1 or nPKC epsilon. Ca2+ is bound mainly to the C1 domain of PKC beta 1, but the C2 domain confers specificity for Ca2+ binding when compared with Mg2+ and Mn2+. We propose that in cPKCs there is selective binding of Ca2+ to a pocket formed by the C1 and C2 domains. This induces a change in conformation that activates the enzyme. In nPKCs, the cation binding pocket is less specific for Ca2+ because it lacks the C2 domain. Therefore, divalent cations like Mg2+ can bind to it, thereby abrogating the requirement of Ca2+ for enzyme activation."
https://openalex.org/W1565070829,"The periplasmic maltose-binding protein-dependent, maltose transport system of Escherichia coli is a well studied member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transport ATPases. In addition to the water-soluble maltose-binding protein, the system comprises three membrane proteins, MalF, MalG, and MalK, which form a heterotetrameric complex (FGK2) in the cytoplasmic membrane. The purified complex exhibits transport-associated ATPase activity. To characterize the requirements for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by the FGK2 complex, we used plasmids to express different combinations of the individual subunits as well as mutant forms of the MalK subunit. Prior to measuring nucleotide binding, we examined membrane preparations for the presence of each subunit from strains that contained all possible permutations of the three structural genes, malF, malG, and malK. We found that when all three genes were present or when malF and malK were present together, the corresponding antigens were detected easily on Western immunoblots and were soluble in the non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100. In contrast, all other permutations resulted in decreased amounts of antigen or antigen that was Triton X-100-insoluble. We relied on photocross-linking with 8-azido-[32P]ATP and ATP hydrolysis as indicators of the ability of the transport complex to interact with purine nucleotides. 8-Azido-[32P]ATP was photocross-linked to the MalK subunit. Photolabeling of MalK was inhibited by ATP, ADP, and GTP and not by other nucleotides. Photolabeling of MalK required the presence of MalF but not MalG. Mutations in malK that affect amino acid residues thought to be directly involved in nucleotide binding did indeed abolish labeling and resulted in loss of transport activity without affecting protein stability. In general, ATP hydrolysis correlated with the photocross-linking. A notable exception is the MalK941 mutant protein which retained the ability to be labeled by 8-azido-[32P]ATP but was unable to catalyze detectable levels of ATP hydrolysis. Some, but not all, of the malK mutations were dominant to wild type. To study the mechanism of dominance we devised a means of measuring the ability of different wild-type and mutant MalK proteins to interact with the MalF and MalG subunits. This assay relies on the fact that, when a bifunctional MalK-LacZ hybrid protein is associated with the MalF and MalG subunits, it is membrane-bound. Excess MalK competed with the MalK-LacZ hybrid protein for sites in the membrane and resulted in the hybrid fractionating as a soluble protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1581352323,"We have previously identified the functional regions involved in the regulation of human transferrin (Tf) gene expression in the liver and in Sertoli cells of the testis. Here, we show that a different cellular distribution of transcription factors, interacting with the same proximal promoter regions (PRI and PRII), modulates cell type-specific transcription. In the liver, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) and the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) act at the PRI site, while CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) act at the PRII site. In the testis, distinct combinations of Sertoli proteins SP-A and SP-D and COUP-TF bind to the PRI site, while SP-alpha and SP-beta bind to the PRII site. Cotransfection experiments in Hep3B cells revealed that mostly HNF-4, C/EBP-alpha, C/EBP-delta, and, to a lesser extent, COUP-TF stimulated transcription driven by the -125/+39 region. In Sertoli cells, HNF-4 and COUP-TF appeared to repress, while the C/EBP factors were able to stimulate transcription driven by the -100/+39 region. However, the specific activating combination remains to be defined among the Sertoli proteins. In the non-Tf-expressing HeLa cells, the Tf promoter could be activated by C/EBP-delta. Our data revealed functional antagonism between HNF-4 and COUP-TF, binding to PRI, as well as cross-coupling interactions between HNF-4 and C/EBP, binding to adjacent sites. Thus, cell type-specific DNA-protein interactions, together with protein-protein interactions, may explain the transcriptional regulation of the Tf gene in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1529038214,"In order to deduce the biological fate of adducts formed by the reaction of styrene oxide, a suspected carcinogen, with DNA, four oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized which contained either R- or S-styrene oxide lesions on the N6 position of neighboring adenines within the human N-ras codon 61. When these adducted oligodeoxynucleotides were ligated into the single-stranded vector M13mp7L2 and the modified DNA used to transform repair-deficient Escherichia coli, the resultant plaque-forming abilities were found to vary as much as 300-fold, depending on the stereochemical configuration of the styrene oxide lesion and the sequence context in the vicinity of the damage. The frequency of mutations caused by the various styrene oxide adducts were similarly dependent on both their chirality and local sequence context. Oligodeoxynucleotide templates bearing these same four adducts were also constructed in order to evaluate their replication in vitro by the Klenow fragment. Three of the four styryl-modified templates yielded significant levels of fully extended primer upon polymerization. In contrast, the template containing R-styrene oxide at the second position of N-ras 61 was a very poor substrate for replication, a result which correlates well with the observed lethality of this lesion in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1479783860,"Although bacterial and mammalian glycogen synthases differ in the primary structure and specificity for glucosyl donor, lysyl residues identified at their substrate-binding sites by affinity labeling are present in a conserved tetrapeptide sequence, Lys-X-Gly-Gly, where X is a residue not conserved (Tagaya, M., Nakano, K., and Fukui, T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6670-6676; Furukawa, K., Tagaya, M., Inouye, M., Preiss, J., and Fukui, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2086-2090). To elucidate the functional role of this conserved sequence, Lys-15, Gly-17, and Gly-18 in Escherichia coli glycogen synthase have been replaced by other amino acid residues via site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetic analyses of the Lys-15 mutant enzymes showed that the epsilon-amino group of Lys-15 is mainly involved in binding of the phosphate moiety adjacent to the glycosidic linkage in the substrate ADP-glucose, presumably through an ionic interaction. The mutant enzyme in which Ala was substituted for Gly-17 had a catalytic rate constant 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the wild-type enzyme with a slightly increased Michaelis constant for ADP-glucose, whereas the Gly-18-->Ala mutant showed a rate constant only 3.2-fold smaller. In addition, mutations of Gly-17 and Gly-18 resulted in marked changes in the reactivity of Lys-15 with affinity labeling reagents. These results suggest that the 2 glycyl residues in the conserved Lys-X-Gly-Gly sequence, in particular the one closer to the ADP-glucose-binding lysyl residue, participate in catalysis by assisting conformational change(s) of the active site or stabilizing the transition state."

https://openalex.org/W1875984647,"The requirements for iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) activation of apodinitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii strain UW97, which lacks dinitrogenase reductase activity as assayed by substrate reduction, have been examined. Activation of apodinitrogenase from strain UW97 by FeMo-co requires the addition of both dinitrogenase reductase and MgATP. When the same apodinitrogenase is pretreated with dinitrogenase reductase and MgATP and then partially purified, however, it does not require these components for activation by FeMo-co. This suggests that dinitrogenase reductase and MgATP are involved in processing apodinitrogenase to a FeMo-co activatable form. This processing step coincides with a change in the subunit composition of apodinitrogenase from alpha 2 beta 2 to a form with an additional subunit (gamma) attached. The apodinitrogenase with the associated gamma subunit is apparently the form of the protein that is competent for activation by FeMo-co."
https://openalex.org/W1497875229,"Mas6p is an integral membrane protein of the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane, which is essential for mitochondrial protein import (1). To determine whether Mas6p is directly involved in recognizing precursors or translocating them across the inner membrane, we asked if Mas6p was in close proximity to precursor proteins being imported into mitochondria. We report here that Mas6p can be chemically cross-linked to an imported protein arrested in transit through the mitochondrial inner membrane. Antiserum to Mas6p specifically immunoprecipitates one of several different mitochondrial proteins that are cross-linked to blocked precursors. Our results strongly suggest that Mas6p physically interacts with precursors during their translocation into the matrix. In addition, at least two other mitochondrial proteins that are each cross-linked to arrested precursors can be coimmunoprecipitated along with Mas6p under non-denaturing conditions. These observations provide evidence for a complex of proteins including Mas6p, each of which interacts with mitochondrial precursors during import."

https://openalex.org/W1540568932,"Activation of the neutrophil respiratory burst oxidase involves phosphorylation-dependent translocation of the cytosolic proteins p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane, a process in intact cells that is inhibited by staurosporine. We now report that in a cell-free oxidase system, staurosporine and protein kinase C pseudosubstrate PKC(19-36) both inhibited p47phox phosphorylation but had no effect on superoxide generation. In contrast, p47phox phosphorylation, translocation, and superoxide generation were inhibited by a peptide, p47phox(323-332) (AYRRNSVRFL), based on a putative serine phosphorylation domain. This effect was specific for the 323-332 peptide, as it was not observed with two peptides based on other p47phox phosphorylation domains. All three peptides served as substrates for phosphorylation, but the extent of peptide phosphorylation did not correlate with inhibition of oxidase function. p47phox(325-330), which represents the serine phosphorylation motif of p47phox(323-332), did not inhibit translocation or superoxide production despite its ability to block phosphorylation of p47phox. These data indicate the presence of functionally important sites within the p47phox(323-332) peptide. Although serine 328 is in a consensus phosphorylation motif, the lack of correlation in the cell-free system between p47phox phosphorylation and either protein translocation or superoxide formation suggests that a phosphorylation-independent function resides in the 323-332 segment of p47phox."
https://openalex.org/W1503726340,"The human thyrotropin beta (hTSH beta) gene is inducible by various agents including thyrotropin-releasing hormone, phorbol esters, or the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. In this study, we have characterized the functional properties of the TGGGTCA motif at -1/+6 of the hTSH beta gene that is similar to the consensus phorbol ester response element (TRE) or the consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE). We suggest that both protein kinases C and A as well as TRH share a common mediator which recognizes the TGGGTCA element in activating the hTSH beta promoter. Following stimulation by phorbol esters, forskolin, or TRH, the TGGGTCA-specific factor acts together with the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 (or GHF-1) bound to upstream sequences at -128 to -61 to mediate the induction of the hTSH beta promoter. The induction requires that both factors bind to their own binding sites, but Pit-1 neither increases the binding of the TGGGTCA-specific factor to its target sequences nor associates with this factor to form a heterodimer. The TGGGTCA-specific factor is present in three cell lines tested and is composed of protein(s) immunologically related to c-Jun and c-Fos but not to the CRE-binding protein, CREB. By using the hTSH beta reporter plasmids in which the TGGGTCA element is converted to consensus TRE or CRE motifs, we found that, within the context of the hTSH beta promoter, the TGGGTCA element is a more potent TRE or CRE than the consensus TRE or CRE sequences. Based upon the results of this study, we propose a model in which the TGGGTCA-specific AP-1-like factor functionally cooperates with the tissue-specific factor Pit-1 to activate the hTSH beta gene."
https://openalex.org/W1484246962,"Abstract The rrnB P1 promoter of Escherichia coli (starting sequence C-4-A-3-C-2-C-1-A+1-C+2-U+3-G+4) forms a binary complex with RNA polymerase that is highly unstable and requires the presence of transcription substrates ATP and CTP for stabilizing the enzyme-DNA association (Gourse, R. L. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 9789-9809). We show that in the absence of UTP and GTP the stabilization is accomplished by short RNA oligomers synthesized in an unusual -3--> mode whereby the primer initiated at the +1 presumably slips back by three nucleotides into the -3 and is then extended yielding stable ternary complexes. By contrast, short oligomers initiated in the conventional +1--> mode without slippage do not exert the stabilization effect and are readily aborted from the promoter complex. The stable -3-->ternary complexes carry sigma factor but otherwise resemble elongation complexes in their high salt stability and in the fact that they are formed with a mutant RNA polymerase deficient in promoter binding. A model is proposed explaining the stability of the -3-->ternary complexes by RNA slipping into a putative tight RNA binding site in RNA polymerase which is normally occupied by RNA during elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1666933792,"The mitochondrial presequence initiates protein translocation across the inner membrane of mitochondria in a delta psi-dependent step. We have investigated the role of matrix ATP in this process. When matrix ATP was reduced to interfere with the function of mitochondrial heat shock protein 70, presequence translocation across the inner membrane was strongly inhibited. This was accompanied by the accumulation of an import intermediate that was unprocessed and accessible to protease added to the intact mitochondria. Both delta psi and matrix ATP were required for further translocation of this intermediate into the matrix. When ATP levels are insufficient to support protein import, it appears that the presequence becomes translocated across the inner membrane, but delta psi does not maintain it in the matrix. Presequence translocation across the inner membrane is thus a reversible reaction, and a step dependent on matrix ATP is required to make it unidirectional. Based on these observations, a model on the role of delta psi, mthsp70, and matrix ATP in presequence translocation across the inner membrane is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1543188542,"We have examined the biological role and catalytic function of two juxtaposed tyrosyl residues in the bacteriophage phi X174 gene A protein, Tyr-343 and Tyr-347, which have been implicated in the catalysis of sequence-specific DNA strand transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis changing either tyrosine to phenylalanine abolishes phage viability. The biochemical basis of this inviability was studied using purified A* protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 341 amino acids of the A protein, as well as purified A* protein with a Y343F or Y347F mutation. All three proteins can cleave the phi X174 replication origin and perform strand transfer between oligodeoxynucleotides bearing the recognition sequence of the A protein; however, both Tyr-343 and Tyr-347 appear to be required for coordinated DNA strand transfer by a single A* protein molecule. The chirality of a phosphorothioate group at the site of strand transfer in the DNA was found to be retained following the strand-transfer reaction, which argues against transfer of Tyr-343-linked DNA to Tyr-347 on the same protein molecule or vice versa. These results support the current model of gene A protein function in which the two tyrosines of a single protein molecule alternate in catalyzing DNA strand transfer at the viral replication origin."
https://openalex.org/W1541581440,"The major photoproduct formed in DNA, following absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light, is the cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD). Formation of CPDs in DNA packaged into chromatin prior to UV irradiation results in a striking preference for these photoproducts to be oriented away from the histone surface in nucleosomes (Gale, J. M., Nissen, K. A., and Smerdon, M. J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 6644-6648). In this report, we show that formation of nucleosomes onto UV-irradiated DNA results in a similar distribution of these photoproducts, indicating that preexisting CPDs in the DNA molecule can influence its rotational setting on the histone surface during nucleosome formation. This bias is less pronounced in the central three helical turns encompassing the dyad axis of nucleosomes, where the helix is overwound (10.7 bases/turn) relative to the outer portion of core DNA (10.0 bases/turn). Such a change in the rotational setting of DNA on the surface of newly formed nucleosomes could expose normally inaccessible DNA sequences to factors which control DNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1494972817,"Recent studies on the tissue distribution and developmental regulation of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in mice show that very high ADA levels exist in the murine alimentary tract (tongue, esophagus, forestomach, proximal small intestine) and at the fetal-maternal interface. To understand the role of ADA in these tissues, we measured the levels of three other enzymes involved in purine catabolism, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), guanine deaminase (GDA), and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), to see how their levels correlated with ADA activity. Our results show that the highest level of PNP, GDA, and XDH is present in the proximal small intestine. Levels of these purine catabolic enzymes are much lower in the tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and fetal-maternal interface in marked contrast to ADA distribution. We also determined mRNA levels encoding PNP, XDH, and ADA in a variety of tissues. Tissue-specific differences in PNP, XDH, and ADA activity correlated with RNA abundance, indicating that the regulation of gene expression is at the level of mRNA production. Thus, ADA is part of a purine catabolic pathway leading to the production of uric acid that is present at the highest known level in the proximal small intestine. ADA may have additional roles in other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1516241298,"Expression of the mouse heat stable antigen (HSA or mouse CD24) shows tissue-specific as well as developmental regulation. During the maturation of several hematopoietic lineages, HSA expression is generally high in immature precursor cells and low or absent in terminally differentiated cells. We present evidence suggesting that this regulation of the HSA gene (Cd24a) occurs at the transcriptional level. In addition, sequence and methylation analysis of the Cd24a promoter revealed characteristics of both housekeeping and tissue-specific promoters, including a methylation-free, HpaII tiny fragment (HTF) island, multiple putative SP1 and AP-2 consensus binding sites, and a TATA box. Functional analysis of a 0.6-kilobase DNA fragment containing these elements fused to the CAT reporter gene in transient transfection experiments showed activity in both HSA expressing and non-expressing cell lines with a strength similar to that of the herpes-simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter. Large fragments from the flanking region of the Cd24a promoter did not influence the ubiquitous nature of this promoter. Finally, we mapped the Cd24a, Cd24b, and Cd24c genes to mouse chromosomes 10, 8, and 14 respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1511567109,"Activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by the rod G-protein transducin is a key event in visual signal transduction in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Interaction between the GTP-bound form of the alpha-subunit of transducin (alpha t*) and the PDE inhibitory gamma-subunit (P gamma) is a major component of PDE activation. The central polycationic region of P gamma, P gamma-24-45, has been implicated as one of the sites involved in alpha t*.P gamma interaction. Here we determine the site on alpha t* that interacts with P gamma-24-45 using a photo-cross-linking approach. The synthetic peptides Cys(ACM)Tyr-P gamma-24-45-Cys (where ACM indicates acetamidomethyl group) and Cys-P gamma-24-45 were labeled with 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone at the COOH and NH2 termini, respectively, and then cross-linked to alpha t. When the photoprobe was attached to the COOH terminus of the peptide, a specific high yield cross-linked product (80%) was formed between the peptide and alpha t GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)). A lower yield of cross-linking (35%) was seen between the peptide and alpha t GDP. The site of cross-linking between Cys(ACM)Tyr-P gamma-24-45-Cys and alpha t GTP gamma S was localized to within alpha t-306-310 using a variety of chemical and proteolytic cleavages of the cross-linked product, analysis of the fragments with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W1482500230,"Incubation with 1 nM triiodothyronine (T3) decreased cycloheximide-induced c-fos mRNA levels and the mRNA response to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 100 nM) or to forskolin (15 microM). T3 also reduced the abundance of nuclear proteins that bind to an AP-1 binding site and the levels of c-Fos protein, as determined by Western blot. In transient transfection assays with a c-fos promoter reporter construct T3 decreased basal promoter activity by more than 50-60% and strongly inhibited the TPA and forskolin-induced activity. T3 further suppressed basal promoter activity and led to a drastic decrease of the response to both stimulatory agents after co-transfection of the promoter with an expression vector for the receptor. A truncated receptor that lacks the DNA binding domain abolished the inhibitory effect of the endogenous and transfected T3 receptor. Retinoic acid (RA) had an effect similar to T3 reducing basal CAT activity and the response to TPA and forskolin by 40-50% in cells co-transfected with the c-fos promoter and an expression vector for the RA receptor. The inhibitory effect of the nuclear receptors on c-Fos is reciprocal, since overexpression of c-Fos repressed induction of the activity of the growth hormone promoter by T3 and RA. Co-transfection with an antisense c-fos vector relieved this inhibition and restored the response to both ligands. These results show the antagonism between the nuclear receptors and the membrane signal transduction pathways that converge on the c-fos oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1894785586,"Immediately after clathrin-coated pits pinch off from the cell membrane to form clathrin-coated vesicles, clathrin dissociates from the vesicles. In vitro studies suggest that this dissociation is carried out by the uncoating ATPase, a constitutive member of the 70-kDa heat shock family. Aside from the requirement for ATP, nothing is known about the regulation of the uncoating process. We now show that clathrin baskets prepared from highly purified clathrin and AP2, the assembly protein associated with plasma membrane coated vesicles, cannot be uncoated by the bovine brain uncoating ATPase alone. A 100-kDa protein cofactor, which was isolated from coated vesicles, is essential for uncoating by the uncoating ATPase. This cofactor restores normal uncoating when present at a molar ratio of about 1 to 10 to clathrin and uncoating ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1530844389,"Vacuolar-type proton pumps are complex heterooligomers. When dissociated into subcomplexes and subunits, the partial reactions of ATP hydrolysis and transmembranous proton flow can be assigned to isolated domains. Data suggest that the molecular site of ATP hydrolysis resides within the 70-kDa subunit but that ATPase activity likely requires at least three additional subunits of 58, 40, and 33 kDa (Xie, X.-S., and Stone, D. K. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9859-9867). We have now cloned and sequenced the 70-kDa subunit from bovine brain and have expressed the protein in insect Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells with a recombinant baculovirus. When purified, the protein has no significant ATPase activity but can be photoaffinity labeled with [alpha 32P]ATP and UV irradiation with an apparent Kd of 35 microM. When reconstituted with biochemically prepared 58-, 40-, and 33-kDa polypeptides, the recombinant 70-kDa subunit restores Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis to a specific activity of 0.6 mumol P(i).mg protein-1.min-1, thus demonstrating that ATP hydrolysis in vacuolar-type proton pumps is dependent upon both the 70-kDa subunit as well as multi-subunit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W114547277,"Rab5 is a small molecular weight GTP-binding protein that functions in endocytic vesicle traffic. Like other Ras-related proteins, Rab5 is prenylated on C-terminal cysteine residues, although it lacks the typical C-terminal CAAX motif (where A is any aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid) to direct this post-translational modification. We have investigated structural requirements for the in vitro geranylgeranylation of Rab5. Rab5N133I, a point mutant that has impaired ability to bind GTP or GDP, undergoes modification to a limited extent and at a severely reduced rate when compared to cognate Rab5. A second point mutant, Rab5Q79L, can be processed to approximately the same extent as wild-type albeit at a reduced rate. Since the latter mutation results in defective GTPase activity, these combined observations indicate that guanine nucleotide binding plays an important role in the geranylgeranylation reaction and suggest that the GDP-bound form of Rab5 is the preferred conformation for interaction with Rab prenyltransferase. This idea is supported by the finding that non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs inhibit Rab5 prenylation, while in vitro processing of both H-ras and the gamma 2 subunit of regulatory G proteins is unaffected at concentrations of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) up to 400 microM. Moreover, a truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal cysteines, Rab5(1-211), serves as an inhibitor of Rab5wt geranylgeranylation when liganded with GDP but not GTP gamma S. Thus, the recognition of Rab5 as a substrate by Rab prenyltransferase involves structural elements exclusive of the C terminus and dependent upon the GDP-binding conformation of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1543245481,"In the renal cortical collecting duct (CCD), mineralocorticoid hormones, like aldosterone, augment the abundance of Na/K-ATPase molecules. It has been postulated that this response involves an isoform switch of the Na/K-ATPase catalytic subunit, alpha, as the molecular basis for the differential regulation of mineralo-corticoid-induced and constitutively expressed Na/K-ATPase pools. In opposition to this attractive hypothesis, three lines of independent evidence are presented which demonstrate that the CCD exclusively expresses the alpha 1 form despite mineralocorticoid-mediated changes in functional Na/K pump density. First, aldosterone increased [3H]ouabain binding in CCD 2.5-fold without changing the ouabain dissociation constant. Second, an electrophysiological assay for pump activity revealed that aldosterone increased maximum Na/K pump current in parallel with the change in ouabain binding without altering the apparent sodium affinity. Third, Western blot analysis with alpha isoform-specific, antipeptide antibodies demonstrated that aldosterone exclusively increased the total chemical pool of the alpha 1 form of the pump without inducing other alpha subunit isoforms. In summary, aldosterone increases the abundance of Na/K-ATPase molecules in the CCD which are pharmacologically, physiologically, and chemically indistinguishable from those that are normally expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1489625468,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is a large glycoprotein that circulates in plasma as a major constituent of numerous lipoproteins. ApoB exists in two forms: apoB48 and apoB100. ApoB48 is identical in sequence to the N-terminal region of apoB100 and is generated by sequence-specific mRNA editing of the apoB100 transcript. Here, we describe the development of a line of mice expressing a human apoB transgene driven by promoter/enhancer sequences from the transthyretin gene. In these mice, immunodetectable human apoB100 is synthesized by the liver, kidney, and brain. Human apoB100 is found in low concentration (approximately 0.1 mg/dl) in the plasma of the transgenic mice and circulates in the low density lipoprotein fraction. The hepatic human apoB100 transcripts undergo mRNA editing at only slightly lower efficiency than the endogenous mouse apoB100 message. Therefore, there is no absolute species specificity to the apoB100 mRNA editing process."
https://openalex.org/W33121880,"5,6-Dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) limits RNA polymerase II transcription to a gene's 5'-end. Transcription of the uninduced Drosophila hsp70 gene is likewise restricted to the 5'-end, where the polymerase resides in a paused state. Furthermore, paused elongation complexes formed on the uninduced hsp70 gene and in DRB-inhibited reactions can both be restarted by Sarkosyl or high salt. These similarities prompted us to explore whether these complexes were generated by a block at the same polymerase modification step. In vivo UV cross-linking and KMnO4 hyperreactive site mapping show that while the naturally paused polymerase is restricted to the first approximately 42 base pairs of hsp70, DRB treatment of heat-induced cells allows the polymerase to transcribe past this site. Therefore, the DRB-sensitive step is probably not rate-limiting for hsp70 transcription under uninduced conditions. DRB treatment did, however, lead to the reduction of KMnO4 hyper-reactivity on hsp70 and hsp26 in a region correlating with open polymerase and/or early elongation complexes, suggesting a site for the DRB-sensitive polymerase modification step. Finally, we used the techniques of polymerase-DNA cross-linking and KMnO4 hyper-reactive site mapping to analyze the natural polymerase termination process at the 3'-end of the hsp26 gene. The data obtained are consistent with polymerases terminating at multiple sites downstream of the polyadenylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1556272018,"Ion channels are generally classified as voltage- or ligand-gated channels based upon their ability to respond to a change in the transmembrane voltage or to a specific ligand interaction. The voltage sensor of voltage-gated ion channels is thought to be contained within the fourth putative transmembrane segment, S4, and is characterized by basic residues typically spaced apart. Thus far, a full understanding of all charges contributing to the voltage sensor of voltage-gated potassium channels has been lacking since several neutralization mutants in S4 could not be functionally expressed. By construction of multimeric cDNAs encoding a mammalian RCK1 (Kv1.1) potassium channel, we now report functional expression of all charge neutralizations in the S4 segment, providing a more comprehensive insight into the functioning of the voltage sensor."
https://openalex.org/W1598770932,"The present study examines the activity, levels of expression and regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase subunits during cAMP-mediated inhibition of Reh cell proliferation. Human Reh cells express mRNAs for the RI alpha and C alpha subunits of cAK at high levels and are practically devoid of cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II. Treatment with isoproterenol, forskolin, or a cAMP analog increased RI alpha mRNA in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (maximal, 4-fold, at 4-8 h). Messenger RNA for C alpha was also stimulated by cAMP, although with slower kinetics (maximal, 2-fold, at 16-24 h). Nuclear run-on assays showed a 2-fold increase in RI alpha gene transcription, whereas that of C alpha was unchanged. In spite of the stimulatory effects of cAMP on mRNAs for both RI alpha and C alpha, phosphotransferase activity and specific [3H]cAMP binding decreased rapidly after treatment with either cAMP or forskolin. Interestingly, the decrease in R and C activity preceded the increase in RI alpha and C alpha mRNA levels, raising the question whether increased mRNA levels may be secondary to the decrease in RI alpha or C alpha protein. The finding that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide gave changes in RI alpha and C alpha mRNA similar to cAMP and that co-treatment with cycloheximide and cAMP resulted in additive effects tend to support this notion."
https://openalex.org/W1621235576,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent stimulator of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) secretion from myocardial cells. In heart tissue there are two ET receptor subtypes (ETA-R and ETB-R), which can be pharmacologically distinguished by the ET isopeptides ET-1 and ET-3. However, the identification of the ET-R subtype responsible for the rapid enhancement of ANF release, which occurs within minutes of exposing cardiac myocytes to ET, has not been investigated. In the present study ET-1 was about 100-fold more potent than ET-3 at stimulating membrane phosphoinositide hydrolysis, protein kinase C activation, and ANF release from purified primary atrial myocytes. These responses were completely abolished by BQ123, an ETA-R antagonist. Radioligand binding analyses showed that competitor peptides displaced 125I-ET-1 binding to atrial myocyte ET-Rs with a rank order of potency of ET-1 >> BQ123 > ET-3, a characteristic ETA-R pharmacological profile. While neither ET-1 or ET-3 altered forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels, suggesting the absence of the ETB-R, basal cAMP levels were also unaffected by the ETs. Northern analysis using ET-R subtype-specific probes demonstrated that the ETA-R transcript was present in the cultures at levels at least 50-fold greater than the ETB-R transcript. These findings demonstrate that the stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol/protein kinase C pathway, which is required for maximal ET-stimulated ANF release from primary atrial myocytes, is associated with the activation of only the ETA-R, thus defining a specific function for an endogenous ET-R in myocardial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555091981,"The human D1A dopamine receptor gene is transcribed from a TATA-less promoter, and its main activator is between nucleotides -1342 and -1102 relative to the first ATG (Minowa, M.

In the present study, additional serial deletion mutants fused with a reporter gene and used in transient transfections of the D1A-expressing cell line NS20Y further localized this activator to two regions: -1154 to -1137, which increases promoter activity 4-fold, and -1197 to -1154, which confers an additional 2-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Cell specificity of the D1A gene expression is contributed by both the -1197/-1154 region and the core promoter located downstream to -1102. DNase I footprinting and gel shift assays suggested that DNA-protein interactions occur primarily between -1197 and -1116. Competitive cotransfections using different portions of this segment, D1A-Act-1 (-1197 to -1152) and D1A-Act-2 (-1154 to -1116), confirmed the in vivo functional significance of these sequences in activating the D1A promoter. D1A-Act-1 has no consensus sequences for known transcription factors but binds to several proteins as a complex. Although D1A-Act-2 has AP2 consensus sequences and binds to recombinant AP2, the nuclear factors in NS20Y cells interacting with this region are distinct from AP2 itself. Despite the inability of Sp1 to directly bind to its consensus sequences in D1A-Act-2, Sp1 or another protein antigenically related to Sp1, as well as a novel nuclear factor, is included in the complex that binds to this activator."
https://openalex.org/W1565684791,"Two physically distinct hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases (HSTs) that demonstrate substrate specificity with respect to the orientation of the ring A 3-hydroxyl group have been isolated from the guinea pig adrenal gland. Nondenaturing liquid-phase isoelectric focusing permitted the separation of the activities, and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography was used to purify the two proteins to homogeneity. The 3 beta-HST had an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa and utilized pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone as substrates. The 3 alpha-HST was slightly smaller at 32 kDa and utilized allopregnanolone and androsterone as substrates. The proteins were further distinguished by isoelectric point, immunoreactivity, and tryptic peptide mapping. Peptides isolated from both guinea pig HSTs demonstrated significant amino acid sequence homology (approximately 65% identity) to rat liver HST; however, available sequence data from the two proteins did not yield differences that might account for their stereospecific substrate selectivity. This paper represents the first definitive report demonstrating the existence of discrete HSTs that exhibit substrate specificity based on the stereochemistry of the 3-hydroxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1902495324,"Modulation of alpha 2-adrenergic and opioid neurotransmission may contribute to ethanol intoxication, tolerance, and physical dependence. We showed previously that ethanol increased the expression of functional delta-opioid receptors in NG108-15 cells (Charness, M. E., Querimit, L. A., and Diamond, I. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3164-3169). Here we report that long-term (2 days) treatment of NG108-15 cells with ethanol increased the binding of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AR) antagonist [3H]rauwolscine and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate by 2.8- and 1.4-fold, respectively. Increased receptor expression was associated with a proportionate increase in the potency of oxymetazoline and carbachol in inhibiting cAMP accumulation. Ethanol did not change the expression of G alpha i2 and reduced levels of G alpha s. Pertussis toxin pretreatment did not prevent the ethanol-induced increase in alpha 2AR, mAChR, and delta-opioid receptor expression. Ethanol caused a large (3.6-fold), dose-dependent increase in the abundance of alpha 2BAR mRNA (rat cDNA probe RNG, 4.1-kb transcript). Ethanol-induced increases in alpha 2BAR and alpha 2CAR (rat probe RG10, 2.5-kb transcript) mRNAs were first detected after 6 h of exposure to 100 mM ethanol, became maximal after 24 h, and persisted for up to 5 days. In contrast, ethanol caused only a small (1.3-fold) increase in the abundance of hm4 mAChR mRNA and did not change levels of G alpha i2 and G alpha s mRNAs. Our data indicate that clinically attainable concentrations of ethanol regulate alpha 2AR gene expression within the time frame of a single session of drinking."

Only one product, NADH, gives inhibition. The other product of the reaction, glycine betaine, does not inhibit the enzyme even at concentrations as high as 10 mM. In dead-end inhibition experiments, AMP and choline were used as dead-end analogs of NAD+ and betaine aldehyde, respectively. The families of double-reciprocal plots in the range 0.010-0.500 mM NAD+ and 0.025-0.300 mM betaine aldehyde are linear and intersect at the left of the 1/v axis. NADH is a mixed inhibitor against NAD+ and betaine aldehyde. AMP is competitive with respect to NAD+ and mixed with betaine aldehyde. Choline is competitive against betaine aldehyde and uncompetitive with respect to NAD+. Our results are consistent with an Iso Ordered Bi Bi steady state mechanism in which NAD+ is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme and NADH is the last product to dissociate from it.

https://openalex.org/W1570819304,"The unfolding of nucleosomes along transcriptionally active DNA sequences uncovers previously shielded cysteinyl-thiol groups of histone H3 molecules located at the center of the nucleosome core. This change in conformation and SH reactivity of nucleosomes along transcribed DNA sequences makes it possible to separate active from inactive nucleosomes by mercury affinity chromatography. The binding of thiol-reactive nucleosomes to an organomercurial-agarose column has been shown previously to reflect, with accuracy, both the timing and extent of transcription of the associated DNA sequences (Chen, T. A., and Allfrey, V. G. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 5252-5256). Here, we extend this experimental approach to the analysis of higher order chromatin structures. Large chromatin fragments released by treating isolated nuclei with restriction endonucleases are fractionated on mercurated agarose magnetic beads that capture nucleosomes with accessible histone H3 thiols, but do not react with the hidden H3 thiols of the compactly beaded nucleosomes of inactive genes. The SH-reactive domains of c-myc and other genes are rapidly separated from the non-SH-reactive restriction fragments by the magnetic bead technique. The new method also overcomes a major limitation of mercurated agarose column chromatography, which is not suitable for studies of higher order chromatin structure because large chromatin fragments occlude the mercury column; occlusion is not a problem in magnetic separations using suspended mercurated agarose beads. Here, we describe the synthesis of mercurated agarose magnetic beads with high capacity for SH groups and test their application to the recovery of chromatin restriction fragments of c-myc and the growth arrest gene gas1."
https://openalex.org/W1508327640,"The developmental decisions of bacteriophage 434 depend on the ability of 434 repressor and Cro to bind OR1 and OR3 with different relative affinities; repressor binds OR1 tighter than OR3, whereas Cro slightly prefers OR3 over OR1. Studies with operator mutants show that repressor's lower relative affinity for OR3 results from a deviation in the sequence of OR3 from consensus; an A-->G change at position 4 in one half-site (OR1: A-C-A-A-A-C-T-T-T-C-T-T-G-T; OR3: A-C-A-G-T-T-T-T-T-C-T-T-G-T). Similar experiments show that Cro binds operators containing either A.T or G.C bases pairs at position 4 equally well, but cannot bind operators containing C.G or T.A base pairs at this position. A Gln33-->Ala mutation in 434 repressor diminishes, but does not eliminate, its ability to distinguish between purines at position 4. This shows that a glutamine at amino acid 33 is not the sole determinant of repressor's position 4 specificity. Changing Gln33-->Leu, the amino acid at the homologous position in Cro, does not confer position 4 base specificity on repressor. Similarly, a Cro protein bearing Gln at this position does not exhibit repressor's position 4 base preferences. The residual specificities of these mutant proteins indicates that in each protein, more than 1 amino acid is responsible for recognizing bases at position 4. These were identified by analyzing the binding specificities of multiply mutated repressors, in vitro. The types of substitutions made were guided by sequence homologies between 434 repressor and Cro. At least three mutations are needed to eliminate repressor's position 4 base specificity; Gln33-->Ala, Glu32-->Gln, and Thr27-->Lys, although no set of amino acid substitutions in repressor was able to confer Cro-like position 4 specificity to repressor. These results indicate that at least the amino acids at these positions are involved in recognition of the position 4 base. Other evidence suggests that Cro and repressor use identical amino acids present at homologous positions in the DNA recognition helix in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W1595429598,"Two signals are known that regulate the entry of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) into the transcytotic pathway: binding of the ligand, dimeric IgA, and phosphorylation of Ser664 in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Mutation of Ser664 to an alanine residue generates a receptor that is transcytosed slowly and exhibits increased recycling at the basolateral plasma membrane. In contrast, if Ser664 is mutated to an aspartate (which bears a constant negative charge-like a phosphate group) the receptor is transcytosed at a rate that is greater than the wild-type pIgR. We have constructed fusions of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) with the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic domain of the wild-type or mutant pIgRs described above (PLAP/WT, PLAP/Ala, and PLAP/Asp) in order to study transcytotic signals present in the cytoplasmic domain of the pIgR independently of those present in the lumenal domain. Transcytosis of the fusion proteins was measured by cell surface immunoprecipitation of a single cohort of basolaterally biotinylated fusion proteins as it arrived at the apical plasma membrane. Significantly more of the PLAP/WT fusion (27%) than the PLAP/Ala fusion protein (5%) was transcytosed during a 2-h chase period. In addition, it was found that approximately 10% of a pseudoligand, monovalent 125I-labeled Fabs (derived from affinity-purified anti-PLAP antibodies), was transcyosed by the PLAP/WT fusion, 7% by the PLAP/Ala fusion, and 22% by the PLAP/Asp fusion over a 4-h period. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic domain of the pIgR contains information necessary to direct proteins into the transcytotic pathway, albeit inefficiently, and that phosphorylation of Ser664 is at least a partially autonomous signal for transcytosis."

D., and Greenberg, M. E. (1993) Science 260, 181-186; Rasmussen, C. D., and Means, A. R. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 73-82). It has been previously accepted that regulation of CaM-dependent enzyme activity occurs via calcium/calmodulin-dependent activation. We have found that histone H1 is a potent inhibitor of the CaM-dependent activation of mouse calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and of the CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin. Inhibition is mediated only by free histone H1; addition of DNA abolishes the inhibitory effect. The effect is not due to a simple interaction of basic (histone) and acidic (CaM) proteins since myelin basic protein and histone H2B, CaMKII substrates more basic than histone H1, did not affect autophosphorylation of CaMKII, and myelin basic protein had no effect on calcineurin activity. The effect is specific to CaM since addition of parvalbumin, a related Ca(2+)-binding protein, did not reverse the effect of histone H1, whereas addition of CaM recovered enzyme activity. These results indicate that free histone H1 levels may specifically affect the ability of CaM to activate its target enzymes and suggests a novel level of control of CaM-dependent enzymes in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1924642554,"In eukaryotes C1-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthase is a trifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of reduced forms of folate to supply activated one-carbon units required for a variety of metabolic pathways. The enzymatic activities include 10-formyl-THF synthetase (EC 6.3.4.3), 5,10-methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9), and 5,10-methylene-THF dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5). In bacteria separate, monofunctional or bifunctional polypeptides catalyze the same reactions. We have purified C1-THF synthase from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and found its physical and enzymatic properties similar to those of other eukaryotic C1-THF synthase enzymes. Unexpectedly, the S. pombe enzyme bound strongly (Keq = 100 pM) to single-stranded DNA, but not to double-stranded DNA or to RNA. The binding was sequence-independent, apparently not cooperative, and not detectably inhibited by C1-THF synthase substrates or cofactors. Trifunctional cytoplasmic enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and monofunctional (synthetase) enzyme from Clostridium acidiurici also bound tightly to single-stranded DNA, while bifunctional (dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase) enzyme from Escherichia coli did not, suggesting that single-stranded DNA binding is a conserved function of the synthetase domain of C1-THF synthase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1661351466,"Abstract Experiments designed to identify Na pump structural features which tag the molecule for asymmetric cell-surface localization are inherently complex because either subunit, or both, may contain targeting information and because the cells which recognize those targeting signals and maintain asymmetric plasma membrane domains also express their own Na pumps, the subunits of which can assemble into hybrid pump molecules with pump subunits expressed from transfected cDNA clones. Cotransfecting cDNA for both subunits only complicates matters further by resulting in expression of four distinct dimeric molecular species. To eliminate the potential for cross-assembly in these and other experiments we have constructed cDNA encoding a single-subunit Na pump (called alpha-beta) in which the alpha and beta subunits are joined by a linker of 17 amino acids. By all criteria tested alpha-beta functioned as a normal heterodimeric Na pump. It was expressed in a variety of mammalian cell lines as a single, high molecular weight polypeptide located primarily on the surface membrane, with the beta subunit exposed to the extracellular medium. Binding of the conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody 24 to the beta subunit indicated that the fusion protein was folded as a properly assembled sodium pump. Expression of alpha-beta in ouabain-resistant mouse L cells resulted in high affinity ouabain binding and ouabain-sensitive, sodium-dependent rubidium transport. The enzyme was properly targeted to the basolateral plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells. The functional integrity of the fusion protein renders it suitable for site-directed mutagenesis studies of targeting and enzymology where control of subunit assembly is desired. These results also support topological models in which the carboxyl terminus of the alpha subunit is cytoplasmic."
