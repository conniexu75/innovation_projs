The measured gas flow exceeds predictions of the Knudsen diffusion model by more than an order of magnitude. The measured water flow exceeds values calculated from continuum hydrodynamics models by more than three orders of magnitude and is comparable to flow rates extrapolated from molecular dynamics simulations. The gas and water permeabilities of these nanotube-based membranes are several orders of magnitude higher than those of commercial polycarbonate membranes, despite having pore sizes an order of magnitude smaller. These membranes enable fundamental studies of mass transport in confined environments, as well as more energy-efficient nanoscale filtration."

These oligonucleotide-modified nanoparticles have affinity constants for complementary nucleic acids that are higher than their unmodified oligonucleotide counterparts, are less susceptible to degradation by nuclease activity, exhibit greater than 99% cellular uptake, can introduce oligonucleotides at a higher effective concentration than conventional transfection agents, and are nontoxic to the cells under the conditions studied. By chemically tailoring the density of DNA bound to the surface of gold nanoparticles, we demonstrated a tunable gene knockdown."

Arabidopsis plants detect a variety of PAMPs including conserved domains of bacterial flagellin and of bacterial EF-Tu. Here, we show that flagellin and EF-Tu activate a common set of signaling events and defense responses but without clear synergistic effects. Treatment with either PAMP results in increased binding sites for both PAMPs. We used this finding in a targeted reverse-genetic approach to identify a receptor kinase essential for EF-Tu perception, which we called EFR. Nicotiana benthamiana, a plant unable to perceive EF-Tu, acquires EF-Tu binding sites and responsiveness upon transient expression of EFR. Arabidopsis efr mutants show enhanced susceptibility to the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, as revealed by a higher efficiency of T-DNA transformation. These results demonstrate that EFR is the EF-Tu receptor and that plant defense responses induced by PAMPs such as EF-Tu reduce transformation by Agrobacterium."

Here, we report that B cells containing the Y-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) locus are intrinsically biased toward nucleolar antigens because of increased expression of TLR7, a single-stranded RNA-binding innate immune receptor. The TLR7 gene is duplicated in Yaa mice because of a 4-Megabase expansion of the pseudoautosomal region. These results reveal high divergence in mouse Y chromosomes and represent a good example of gene copy number qualitatively altering a polygenic disease manifestation."
https://openalex.org/W2109805561,"The NMDA receptor is a key player in excitatory transmission and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. Its activation requires the binding of both glutamate and a co-agonist like D-serine to its glycine site. As D-serine is released exclusively by astrocytes, we studied the physiological impact of the glial environment on NMDA receptor-dependent activity and plasticity. To this end, we took advantage of the changing astrocytic ensheathing of neurons occurring in the supraoptic nucleus during lactation. We provide direct evidence that in this hypothalamic structure the endogenous co-agonist of NMDA receptors is D-serine and not glycine. Consequently, the degree of astrocytic coverage of neurons governs the level of glycine site occupancy on the NMDA receptor, thereby affecting their availability for activation and thus the activity dependence of long-term synaptic changes. Such a contribution of astrocytes to synaptic metaplasticity fuels the emerging concept that astrocytes are dynamic partners of brain signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1989684700,"Many human inherited neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by loss of balance due to cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) degeneration. Although the disease-causing mutations have been identified for a number of these disorders, the normal functions of the proteins involved remain, in many cases, unknown. To gain insight into the function of proteins involved in PC degeneration, we developed an interaction network for 54 proteins involved in 23 inherited ataxias and expanded the network by incorporating literature-curated and evolutionarily conserved interactions. We identified 770 mostly novel protein–protein interactions using a stringent yeast two-hybrid screen; of 75 pairs tested, 83% of the interactions were verified in mammalian cells. Many ataxia-causing proteins share interacting partners, a subset of which have been found to modify neurodegeneration in animal models. This interactome thus provides a tool for understanding pathogenic mechanisms common for this class of neurodegenerative disorders and for identifying candidate genes for inherited ataxias."
https://openalex.org/W2014179038,"Over the past years, a large number of histone posttranslational modifications have been described, some of which function to attain a repressed chromatin structure, while others facilitate activation by allowing access of regulators to DNA. Histone H2B monoubiquitination is a mark associated with transcriptional activity. Using a highly reconstituted chromatin-transcription system incorporating the inducible RARbeta2 promoter, we find that the establishment of H2B monoubiquitination by RNF20/40 and UbcH6 is dependent on the transcription elongation regulator complex PAF, the histone chaperone FACT, and transcription. H2B monoubiquitination facilitates FACT function, thereby stimulating transcript elongation and the generation of longer transcripts. These in vitro analyses and corroborating in vivo experiments demonstrate that elongation by RNA polymerase II through the nucleosomal barrier is minimally dependent upon (1) FACT and (2) the recruitment of PAF and the H2B monoubiquitination machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2031779883,"Activity deprivation in neurons induces a slow compensatory scaling up of synaptic strength, reflecting a homeostatic mechanism for stabilizing neuronal activity. Prior studies have focused on the loss of action potential (AP) driven neurotransmission in synaptic homeostasis. Here, we show that the miniature synaptic transmission that persists during AP blockade profoundly shapes the time course and mechanism of homeostatic scaling. A brief blockade of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) mediated miniature synaptic events (“minis”) rapidly scales up synaptic strength, over an order of magnitude faster than with AP blockade alone. The rapid scaling induced by NMDAR mini blockade is mediated by increased synaptic expression of surface GluR1 and the transient incorporation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors at synapses; both of these changes are implemented locally within dendrites and require dendritic protein synthesis. These results indicate that NMDAR signaling during miniature synaptic transmission serves to stabilize synaptic function through active suppression of dendritic protein synthesis.

These results indicate that NMDAR signaling during miniature synaptic transmission serves to stabilize synaptic function through active suppression of dendritic protein synthesis. Homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity have received special attention as mechanisms that promote long-term stability of neuronal function. Early studies demonstrated that muscle denervation produces a marked compensatory upregulation of postsynaptic receptors at the neuromuscular junction (e.g., Axelsson and Thesleff, 1959Axelsson J. Thesleff S. A study of supersensitivity in denervated mammalian skeletal muscle.J. Physiol. 1959; 147: 178-193PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated that similar homeostatic mechanisms operate at central synapses, where long-term activity blockade induces a compensatory increase in neurotransmitter release (e.g., Murthy et al., 2001Murthy V.N. Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. Zhu Y. Inactivity produces increases in neurotransmitter release and synapse size.Neuron. 2001; 32: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) or a “scaling up” of postsynaptic-receptor currents (e.g., Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, O'Brien et al., 1998O'Brien R.J. Kamboj S.

Activity-dependent modulation of synaptic AMPA receptor accumulation.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Typically, the development of this synaptic scaling is measured as a change in quantal or miniature synaptic transmission, the action potential (AP) independent fusion of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals. This alternative form of synaptic transmission, first described at the frog neuromuscular junction over half a century ago (Fatt and Katz, 1952Fatt P. Katz B. Spontaneous subthreshold activity at motor nerve endings.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar), is now known to be a ubiquitous feature of all synapses throughout the central nervous system. However, the function of miniature neurotransmission has not been widely studied, perhaps owing to the low frequency, small amplitude, and stochastic nature of these events. Recent studies, however, have suggested that miniature synaptic events (or “minis”) may have a significant impact on neuronal function. For example, minis can be enhanced sufficiently to influence firing behavior in large CA3 pyramidal cells (Sharma and Vijayaraghavan, 2003Sharma G. Vijayaraghavan S. Modulation of presynaptic store calcium induces release of glutamate and postsynaptic firing.Neuron. 2003; 38: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and individual minis can influence firing rates in electrically compact neurons (Carter and Regehr, 2002Carter A.G. Regehr W.G. Quantal events shape cerebellar interneuron firing.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, minis can influence structural remodeling at synapses (e.g., McKinney et al., 1999McKinney R.A. Capogna M. Durr R. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Miniature synaptic events maintain dendritic spines via AMPA receptor activation.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), regulate the activity of postsynaptic signaling pathways (e.g., Murphy et al., 1994Murphy T.M. Blatter L.A. Bhat R.V. Fiore R.S. Wier W.G. Baraban J.M. Differential regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and p42 MAP kinase activity by synaptic transmission.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1320-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tonically suppress protein synthesis in dendrites of hippocampal neurons (Sutton et al., 2004Sutton M.A. Wall N.R. Aakalu G.N. Schuman E.M. Regulation of dendritic protein synthesis by miniature synaptic events.Science. 2004; 304: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study has shown that spontaneous and spike-driven neurotransmission may utilize distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (Sara et al., 2005Sara Y. Virmani T. Deák F. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. An isolated pool of synaptic vesicles recycles at rest and drives spontaneous neurotransmission.Neuron. 2005; 45: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This finding suggests a separate regulatory pathway for miniature synaptic transmission, although it is not known what specific role (or roles) spontaneous neurotransmission might play. Here, we identify a specific role for miniature synaptic transmission in stabilizing synaptic function in hippocampal neurons. We show that blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) scales the amplitude of AMPA miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) an order of magnitude faster than with AP blockade alone. The rapid scaling induced by NMDAR mini blockade requires the local, protein-synthesis-dependent insertion of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) with a unique subunit composition. Our results thus indicate that a mode of NMDAR signaling during miniature synaptic transmission acts to stabilize synaptic function by suppressing local protein synthesis in dendrites. We first reexamined the homeostatic regulation of synaptic function imposed by a chronic blockade of APs in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figures 1A and 1B). We found that, similar to previous reports (e.g., Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), mEPSCs exhibited a time-dependent increase in amplitude, but no change in frequency, during chronic AP blockade with TTX (2 μM). A curious feature of this synaptic scaling is its slow time course: An enhancement of mEPSC amplitude is not evident until >12 hr of AP blockade. Recently, we have shown that, during AP blockade, the glutamatergic minis that persist inhibit ongoing protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites (Sutton et al., 2004Sutton M.A. Wall N.R. Aakalu G.N. Schuman E.M. Regulation of dendritic protein synthesis by miniature synaptic events.Science. 2004; 304: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that minis may exert a stabilizing influence on synaptic function via the tonic inhibition of dendritic protein synthesis that they provide. Both AMPARs and NMDARs contribute to the translational inhibition conferred by minis (Sutton et al., 2004Sutton M.A. Wall N.R. Aakalu G.N. Schuman E.M. Regulation of dendritic protein synthesis by miniature synaptic events.Science. 2004; 304: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), though mEPSCs recorded under typical voltage-clamp conditions are dominated by the AMPAR component. Using specific antagonists, we thus focused on the contribution of NMDAR minis to the development of synaptic scaling. We measured the magnitude of scaling by examining the AMPAR mEPSCs since these currents can be readily measured in cultured neurons treated with NMDAR antagonists. We first examined whether NMDARs are activated during miniature synaptic transmission by treating neurons with TTX (2 μM, 2.5 hr) with or without the irreversible NMDAR open-channel blocker MK-801 (10 μM) over the last 2 hr. We then recorded mEPSCs in the presence of 0 external Mg2+ to favor detection of the NMDAR component in mixed AMPAR/NMDAR mEPSCs. We found that MK-801 treatment during AP blockade significantly reduced the late component of mixed mEPSCs recorded under these conditions (Figure 1D). These results indicate that, consistent with previous reports (Murphy et al., 1994Murphy T.M. Blatter L.A. Bhat R.V. Fiore R.S. Wier W.G. Baraban J.M.

We next examined whether NMDAR minis affect the development of synaptic scaling by applying NMDAR antagonists during AP blockade. Surprisingly, blocking NMDAR minis (50 μM APV) during the last 1 or 3 hr of AP blockade produced a rapid and time-dependent increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs without altering their frequency (Figures 1E–1G; see also Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). We found a similar increase in mEPSC amplitude (but not frequency) with MK-801 (10 μM for 3 hr, added 5 min following TTX; mean ± SEM mEPSC amplitude/frequency, 3.1 hr TTX alone = 14.7 ± 2.0 pA/1.3 ± 0.3 Hz, TTX + MK-801 = 20.8 ± 1.5 pA/1.6 ± 0.4 Hz, p < 0.05; n = 9 cells/group), confirming that the accelerated scaling is specifically due to NMDAR blockade. A blockade of AMPARs with CNQX (40 μM, 3 hr) in the presence of TTX also produced a significant enhancement of mEPSC amplitude, but not frequency, when CNQX was washed out of the bath (Figure S3). Moreover, APV delivered in the absence of TTX also produced a selective increase in mEPSC amplitude 3 hr posttreatment (Figure S4), indicating that AP blockade is not absolutely required for the rapid scaling of mEPSCs. Together, these results suggest that ongoing miniature synaptic transmission acts to stabilize synaptic efficacy during the early stages of activity blockade. We next examined whether the rapid enhancement of mEPSC amplitude induced by NMDAR mini blockade requires new protein synthesis. Application of the protein-synthesis inhibitors anisomycin (40 μM; Figures 1E–1G) or cycloheximide (100 μM; Figure S2) completely prevented the accelerated development of scaling by NMDAR mini blockade. These results suggest that the NMDAR-mediated stabilization of synaptic function is functionally related to the tonic suppression of protein synthesis conferred by minis (Sutton et al., 2004Sutton M.A. Wall N.R. Aakalu G.N. Schuman E.M. Regulation of dendritic protein synthesis by miniature synaptic events.Science. 2004; 304: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Since blocking NMDAR minis produces a protein-synthesis-dependent enhancement of mEPSC amplitude, we next explored whether enhanced synthesis of AMPAR subunits accompanies such blockade. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled GluR1 from hippocampal neurons revealed that either complete or selective NMDAR mini blockade enhanced GluR1 synthesis relative to either blockade of APs alone or untreated controls (Figure S5). Moreover, surface biotinylation assays revealed that NMDAR mini blockade produced a time- and protein-synthesis-dependent increase in the surface expression of GluR1 in hippocampal neurons (Figure S5). Interestingly, this was not accompanied by an increase in surface expression of the GluR2 subunit, which is normally present with GluR1 in heteromeric AMPARs in excitatory hippocampal neurons (e.g., Wenthold et al., 1996Wenthold R.J. Petralia R.S. Blahos II, J. Niedzielski A.S. Evidence for multiple AMPA receptor complexes in hippocampal CA1/CA2 neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of two other surface proteins—the transferrin receptor and the NR1 subunit of NMDARs—was not affected by NMDAR mini blockade. The differential regulation of GluR1 and GluR2 AMPAR subunits by NMDAR mini blockade in our biochemical studies prompted us to ask whether GluR1 expression was upregulated at synapses. We used live labeling with antibodies specific for extracellular epitopes of either GluR1 or GluR2 followed by fixation and immunocytochemical staining for synaptic markers. High-resolution confocal imaging of hippocampal neurons exposed to AP blockade, AP + NMDAR mini blockade, or vehicle alone was followed by three-dimensional analysis of overlapping GluR and synaptic particles (Figures 2A and 2B). Under these conditions, the density and volume of presynaptic bassoon (costained with GluR1) and synaptophysin (costained with GluR2) particles did not differ between treatment groups (Figure 2C). In contrast, blockade of NMDAR minis induced a significant and protein-synthesis-dependent increase in the total volume of GluR1, but not GluR2, present at synaptic sites (Figure 2D). The increased synaptic expression of GluR1 was due to two distinct changes in surface GluR1 expression: (1) an ∼25% increase in the average volume of synaptic GluR1 particles (Figure 2E) and (2) an ∼20% increase in the proportion of synapses containing GluR1 (Figure 2F), with the latter effect presumably reflecting the incorporation of GluR1 clusters at synaptic sites that were occupied by AMPARs composed of GluR2 and GluR3 subunits. Does NMDAR mini blockade increase GluR1 surface expression in a spatially specific fashion? To investigate this possibility, we used a dual micropipette perfusion system to locally disrupt miniature synaptic transmission in isolated regions of dendrites. Dishes of cultured neurons were continuously perfused with saline containing TTX. A delivery micropipette was loaded with the same solution plus APV (or other agents, as indicated) and a fluorescent dye to visualize the perfused area. A nearby suction micropipette was used to draw a stream of perfusate from the delivery pipette across isolated regions of selected dendrites and to remove the treatment perfusate from the bath. Following a 90–105 min period of local perfusion, neurons were live labeled with a surface GluR1 antibody, fixed, and processed for immunostaining. As shown in Figures 3A–3E, local blockade of NMDAR minis induced a significant increase in GluR1 surface expression in the perfused region, indicating the local surface addition of GluR1. When we examined surface GluR1 expression at equidistant locations (relative to the soma) in untreated dendrites from those same cells, there was no change (mean ± SEM relative surface GluR1 expression = 1.02 ± 0.06, n = 8). Furthermore, in parallel experiments, in which the vehicle alone was locally delivered, no increase in surface GluR1 expression was observed (Figure 3E). We also found that a brief pretreatment with anisomycin (30 min prior to local APV perfusion) blocked the localized increase in surface GluR1 expression induced by NMDAR mini blockade. Local NMDAR mini blockade induces a local increase in GluR1 surface expression that requires new protein synthesis. To investigate the possibility that this translation requirement is also local, we locally disrupted protein synthesis during global NMDAR mini blockade. Dendrites were locally perfused with either of two protein-synthesis inhibitors, anisomycin (40 μM) or emetine (25 μM), during bath application of TTX + APV. Post hoc imaging of surface GluR1 expression revealed a significant reduction in the perfused region relative to all other dendritic segments (Figures 3F and 3G), demonstrating a requirement for local dendritic protein synthesis. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the control of local protein synthesis by ongoing miniature synaptic transmission regulates the surface population of GluR1 subunits. The regulation of cell-surface GluR1, but not GluR2, subunits at synapses suggested the possibility that NMDAR mini blockade recruits AMPARs with a novel composition (i.e., GluR2-lacking receptors) to synapses. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the effects of NMDAR mini blockade could be reversed by 1-napthylacetylspermine (Naspm), a specific antagonist of GluR2-lacking AMPARs (e.g., Blaschke et al., 1993Blaschke M. Keller B.U. Rivosecchi R. Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Konnerth A. A single amino acid determines the subunit-specific spider toxin block of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate/kainite receptor channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 6528-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To verify the specificity of Naspm, we first tested its effects on hippocampal neurons expressing GFP-tagged GluR1 or GluR2 subunits. In addition to enhancing the expression of heteromeric AMPARs, overexpression of individual AMPAR subunits promotes the formation of homomeric receptor complexes (e.g., Shi et al., 2001Shi S. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Subunit-specific rules governing AMPA receptor trafficking to synapses in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of either GluR1 or GluR2 for 18–22 hr induced a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude in infected neurons relative to noninfected controls (Figures 4A and 4B). Consistent with its established specificity, however, Naspm (10 μM) reversed only those changes in mEPSC amplitude induced by overexpression of GluR1, not GluR2. We next examined whether the increase in mEPSC amplitude induced by NMDAR mini blockade results from the incorporation of GluR2-lacking AMPARs at synaptic sites. If this is the case, these mEPSCs should be uniquely sensitive to Naspm. Indeed, we observed that application of Naspm rapidly reversed the time-dependent enhancement of mEPSC amplitude induced by NMDAR mini blockade with little effect on mEPSC amplitude in control neurons or those treated with TTX alone (Figures 4C and 4D). Moreover, blocking protein synthesis with anisomycin prevented both the increase in mEPSC amplitude after 3 hr NMDAR mini blockade as well as the sensitivity of these neurons to Naspm. Together, these results demonstrate that NMDAR mini blockade induces a protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic insertion of AMPARs that lack the GluR2 subunit. Chronic AP blockade alone (24 hr) induces synaptic scaling of a magnitude roughly equivalent to a brief (3 hr) NMDAR mini blockade, so we next examined whether the mechanisms underlying the two forms of synaptic scaling are similar. Whereas application of Naspm reversed the enhancement of mEPSC amplitude after mini blockade to near control levels, it had no effect on mEPSC amplitudes after 24 hr blockade of APs alone (Figure 4E), suggesting that the synaptic incorporation of GluR2-lacking AMPARs is a mechanism unique to scaling induced by mini blockade. We next examined the persistence of the synaptic expression of GluR2-lacking AMPARs during NMDAR mini blockade. We first found that the enhancement of mEPSC amplitude was maintained at similar levels after different periods of NMDAR mini blockade ranging from 3 to 24 hr (Figures 4E and 4F). However, over this 24 hr period, we documented a progressive loss in the sensitivity of mEPSC amplitude to Naspm. This time-dependent sensitivity to Naspm indicates that the synaptic incorporation of GluR2-lacking AMPARs is a transient modification that is slowly reversed by a replacement of these receptors with GluR2-containing AMPARs. We have also investigated whether the rapid synaptic scaling induced by NMDAR mini blockade can be observed in acute hippocampal slices, where the intrinsic hippocampal circuitry is largely preserved. We exposed slices to AP blockade or NMDAR mini blockade and then examined the qualities of mEPSCs. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed that 3 hr NMDAR mini blockade scaled up the amplitude (but not frequency) of mEPSCs, whereas AP blockade alone for the same duration did not (Figures 5A–5C). Furthermore, the scaling of mEPSC amplitude induced by mini blockade was prevented by anisomycin (Figures 5A–5C) and reversed by Naspm (Figures 5D and 5E). Thus, NMDAR mini blockade also rapidly scales synaptic strength in CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices via a protein-synthesis-dependent incorporation of GluR2-lacking AMPARs at synaptic sites. It is well established that AMPARs lacking the GluR2 subunit exhibit significant permeability to Ca2+ (Hollmann et al., 1991Hollmann M. Hartley M. Heinemann S. Ca2+ permeability of KA-AMPA-gated glutamate receptor channels depends on subunit composition.Science. 1991; 252: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, Verdoorn et al., 1991Verdoorn T.A. Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Structural determinants of ion flow through recombinant glutamate receptor channels.Science. 1991; 252: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike other Ca2+-permeant channels such as the NMDAR or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, GluR2-lacking AMPARs exhibit a significant permeability to Co2+ (Pruss et al., 1991Pruss R.M. Akeson R.L. Racke M.M. Wilburn J.L. Agonist-activated cobalt uptake identifies divalent cation-permeable kainate receptors on neurons and glia.Neuron. 1991; 7: 509-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this unique property to investigate whether the synaptic incorporation of these AMPARs is also regulated locally within dendritic segments. To this end, we adapted a technique to image activity at GluR2-lacking AMPARs that exploits the ability of Co2+ to stoichiometrically quench the fluorescent dye calcein (Dravid and Murray, 2003Dravid S.M. Murray T.F. Fluorescent detection of Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate receptor activation in murine neocortical neurons.Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 351: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using quenching of intracellular calcein fluorescence as a readout, we examined the ability of miniature neurotransmission to drive Co2+ influx through synaptic GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Following a brief period of dye loading, a baseline image was acquired, followed immediately by addition of an excess of extracellular CoCl2 (500 μM) to the bath. Calcein fluorescence was essentially unchanged 5 min after Co2+ addition in untreated control neurons and those neurons treated with TTX alone (Figures 6A and 6B). In contrast, neurons that experienced a 3 hr NMDAR mini blockade demonstrated robust quenching of calcein fluorescence, an effect that was blocked by pretreatment with anisomycin. Further experiments (Figure 6B) confirmed that the source of Co2+ influx in these neurons was through AMPARs: The Co2+-induced quenching of calcein fluorescence in neurons treated with TTX + APV was prevented by brief pretreatment with either the general AMPAR antagonist CNQX or Naspm. Taken together, these results provide additional evidence that NMDAR mini blockade leads to the protein-synthesis-dependent incorporation of GluR2-lacking AMPARs at synapses. We next extended this imaging approach to ask whether the membrane insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs requires local processing within dendrites. We first examined whether local NMDAR mini blockade leads to a local surface addition of GluR2-lacking AMPARs by examining the relative rates of Co2+-induced quenching of calcein fluorescence in perfused versus neighboring segments of the same dendrite. As in our previous experiments, we locally restricted the perfusion of APV to isolated dendritic segments, then loaded neurons with calcein-AM. Following acquisition of a baseline image, Co2+ was added extracellularly, and neurons were repeatedly imaged. We found that Co2+-induced quenching of intracellular calcein fluorescence was initially evident in the perfused dendritic segment (Figures 7A–7D). Moreover, the onset of Co2+-induced quenching exhibited a clear relationship with distance from the treated area—areas adjacent to the perfused region quenched next, followed by more distant regions. These results strongly suggest that the perfused area was the source of Co2+ influx in these dendrites, indicating that restricted NMDAR mini blockade leads to the local addition of GluR2-lacking receptors at synaptic sites. We next examined whether the synaptic addition of GluR2-lacking AMPARs induced by NMDAR mini blockade requires local protein synthesis in dendrites using local perfusion of anisomycin on a background of whole-dish mini blockade. These experiments revealed the opposite pattern of results: Co2+-induced quenching of calcein fluorescence in the anisomycin-treated dendritic segment was significantly delayed relative to all other untreated regions (Figures 7E–7H). Thus, untreated proximal and distal dendritic segments, but not the perfused segment, were the apparent source of Co2+ influx in these dendrites. These results suggest that local protein synthesis in dendrites is required for the synaptic addition of GluR2-lacking AMPARs induced by NMDAR mini blockade. We have shown that the miniature synaptic transmission that persists during AP blockade acts to stabilize synaptic function, which represents the first specific functional role identified for this form of synaptic transmission. When this influence is removed by NMDAR mini blockade, we observe a rapid protein-synthesis-dependent scaling of mEPSC amplitude. The accelerated form of synaptic scaling induced by NMDAR mini blockade is first mediated by an increase in synaptic expression of surface GluR1 subunits and the incorporation of GluR2-lacking AMPARs at synaptic sites; both of these changes are implemented locally and require local dendritic protein synthesis. Although the synaptic scaling induced by NMDAR mini blockade persists over a 24 hr period, the synaptic underpinnings change—synaptic GluR2-lacking AMPARs are slowly replaced by GluR2-containing receptors via a mechanism that remains to be defined. Taken together, our results suggest that synapses are subject to dynamic regulation by ongoing local translational activity in dendrites, indicating a degree of temporal and spatial homeostatic control previously unappreciated. The rapid scaling induced by NMDAR mini blockade is observed in both cultured neurons and acute hippocampal slices, suggesting a similar stabilizing role for miniature synaptic transmission in vivo. Thus, during synaptic development and during plasticity, the presence or absence of minis may serve as a critical signal for whether a synapse will be strengthened, maintained, or perhaps eventually lost. Importantly, this functional role for miniature events need not be confined to the maintenance of baseline synaptic strength but could also be used to stabilize recently induced synaptic plasticity. It is well established, for example, that the induction of long-lasting changes in evoked synaptic transmission is often met with corresponding changes in the frequency/amplitude of miniature synaptic transmission. Consistent with a role for this plasticity of miniature synaptic transmission in stabilizing synaptic efficacy, a recent study has demonstrated that the frequency and amplitude of preexisting spontaneous EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons is inversely correlated with the efficiency with which long-term synaptic depression can be induced (Zhang et al., 2005Zhang J.

https://openalex.org/W2033421187,"Planning for future needs, not just current ones, is one of the most formidable human cognitive achievements. Whether this skill is a uniquely human adaptation is a controversial issue. In a study we conducted, bonobos and orangutans selected, transported, and saved appropriate tools above baseline levels to use them 1 hour later (experiment 1). Experiment 2 extended these results to a 14-hour delay between collecting and using the tools. Experiment 3 showed that seeing the apparatus during tool selection was not necessary to succeed. These findings suggest that the precursor skills for planning for the future evolved in great apes before 14 million years ago, when all extant great ape species shared a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2083415193,"Mutations in the CYLD gene cause tumors of hair-follicle keratinocytes. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinase that removes lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains from TRAF2 and inhibits p65/p50 NF-kappaB activation. Here we show that mice lacking Cyld are highly susceptible to chemically induced skin tumors. Cyld-/- tumors and keratinocytes treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) or UV light are hyperproliferative and have elevated cyclin D1 levels. The cyclin D1 elevation is caused not by increased p65/p50 action but rather by increased nuclear activity of Bcl-3-associated NF-kappaB p50 and p52. In Cyld+/+ keratinocytes, TPA or UV light triggers the translocation of Cyld from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region, where Cyld binds and deubiquitinates Bcl-3, thereby preventing nuclear accumulation of Bcl-3 and p50/Bcl-3- or p52/Bcl-3-dependent proliferation. These data indicate that, depending on the external signals, Cyld can negatively regulate different NF-kappaB pathways; inactivation of TRAF2 controls survival and inflammation, while inhibition of Bcl-3 controls proliferation and tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2086597588,"The endemic species richness on Madagascar, relative to landmass area, is unparalleled in the world. Many organisms on the island have restricted geographical ranges. A comprehensive hypothesis explaining the evolution of this microendemism has yet to be developed. Using an analysis of watersheds in the context of Quaternary climatic shifts, we provide a new mechanistic model to explain the process of explosive speciation on the island. River catchments with sources at relatively low elevations were zones of isolation and hence led to the speciation of locally endemic taxa, whereas those at higher elevations were zones of retreat and dispersion and hence contain proportionately lower levels of microendemism. These results provide a framework for biogeographic and phylogeographic studies, as well as a basis for prioritizing conservation actions of the remaining natural forest habitats on the island."

https://openalex.org/W2093557429,"Mitochondrial translocation of pro-apoptotic Bax prior to apoptosis is well established after treatment with many cell death stimulants or under apoptosis-inducing conditions. The mechanism of mitochondrial translocation of Bax is, however, still unknown. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism of Bax activation and mitochondrial translocation to initiate apoptosis of human hepatoma HepG2 and porcine kidney LLC-PK1 cells exposed to various cell death agonists. Phosphorylation of Bax by JNK and p38 kinase activated after treatment with staurosporine, H2O2, etoposide, and UV light was demonstrated by the shift in the pI value of Bax on two-dimensional gels and confirmed by metabolic labeling with inorganic [32P]phosphate in HepG2 cells. Specific inhibitors of JNK and p38 kinase significantly inhibited Bax phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation and apoptosis of HepG2 cells. A specific small interfering RNA to MAPKK4 (the upstream protein kinase of JNK and p38 kinase) markedly decreased the levels of MAPKK4 and MAPKK3/6, blocked the activation of JNK or p38 kinase, and inhibited Bax phosphorylation. However, the negative control small interfering RNA did not cause these changes. Confocal microscopy of various Bax mutants showed differential rates of mitochondrial translocation of Bax before and after staurosporine treatment. Among the Bax mutants, T167D did not translocate to mitochondria after staurosporine exposure, suggesting that Thr167 is a potential phosphorylation site. In conclusion, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that Bax is phosphorylated by stress-activated JNK and/or p38 kinase and that phosphorylation of Bax leads to mitochondrial translocation prior to apoptosis.

Anti-Bax antibody B9 or 2D2 was used to immunoprecipitate Bax. CHAPS-solubilized proteins (1 mg/sample) were initially incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose (50% suspension) to remove nonspecific binding proteins by following a previously published method (21Guo B.

Cells pretreated with STS or H2O2 (0.3 mm) were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in isotonic STE buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture) on ice for 10 min, and homogenized, and cell debris and nuclear fractions were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fraction was then subjected to centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 20 min to prepare the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. The mitochondrial pellets were washed once with STE buffer to minimize contamination of the cytosolic proteins. After centrifugation of the washed pellets, the mitochondrial pellets were dissolved in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 1.0% CHAPS. Cytosolic and solubilized mitochondrial proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and then incubated with specific antibody to each target protein. The antigen detected by the primary antibody was visualized with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for enhanced chemiluminescence detection (31Suh S. Hood B.L.

Metabolic Labeling and Autoradiography—Intact HepG2 cells grown in culture dishes (150-mm diameter) were metabolically labeled overnight with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (1 mCi/culture dish; specific activity of >9000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (catalog no. 11971, Invitrogen) with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HepG2 cells were then treated with STS (2 μm) for an additional 8 h before cell harvest and quick freezing in dry ice. Frozen cells were extracted with hypotonic buffer with 1% CHAPS. CHAPS-solubilized proteins (1 mg of protein each) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bax mAb B9 or 2D2 for further two-dimensional gel analyses, transfer to Immobilon PVDF membranes, and autoradiography. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Confocal Microscopic Analysis—Based on the structural prediction of phosphorylation sites in Bax, we prepared various Bax mutants using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's direction. In addition, some Bax mutants were prepared on a contract basis (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). The correct nucleotide sequence of each Bax mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown) prior to further analysis. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused wild-type Bax (5Wolter K.G.

Thompson (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with each mutant cDNA. Confocal microscopy of transfected MEF cells with various Bax mutants was performed before and after treatment with STS for 2 or 4 h by the method as described (5Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Most of the experimental data shown were repeated more than three times, unless indicated otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Mitochondrial Translocation of Bax and Apoptosis upon Exposure to STS—We treated human hepatoma HepG2 or porcine kidney LLC-PK1 cells with STS as a cell death stimulant to study the mechanism for translocation of Bax to mitochondria and apoptosis. Consistent with the previous reports (4Hsu Y.-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 5Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T.

The morphology of STS-treated HepG2 and LLC-PK1 cells showed cell shrinkage, rounding, and partial detachment, with the lobulated appearance of apoptotic cells and condensed DNA stained with DAPI dye (data not shown). STS significantly increased the rates of cell death determined at 24 h in both cells (Fig. 1A). Translocation of Bax to mitochondria (detected by anti-Bax mAb 2D2) and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytoplasm started to take place at 8 h after STS exposure, whereas cytosolic Bax detected by mAb 2D2 began to decline (Fig. 1, B and C). Increased translocation of Bax to mitochondria and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c were evident in HepG2 cells at 16 h, whereas the levels of actin and Hsp60 (used as loading controls for the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively) were comparable in all samples analyzed. We also observed similar patterns of mitochondrial translocation of Bax and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytoplasm after HepG2 and LLC-PK1 cells were treated with H2O2 for different times (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Increased translocation of activated Bax to mitochondria after exposure to H2O2. HepG2 (A) and LLC-PK1 (B) cells (grown in culture dishes 150 mm in diameter) were exposed to 0.3 and 0.1 mm H2O2, respectively, for the indicated times before cell harvest. Equal amounts of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins (20 μg/well) isolated from HepG2 and LLC-PK1 cells were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then subjected to immunoblot (IB) analysis for various target proteins.

Although STS is a potent broad-spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases, including protein kinase C (41Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), it activated cell death-related JNK and p38 kinase in a time-dependent manner. The activities of both JNK and p38 kinase, determined by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies to phosphorylated (activated) forms of both kinases, were increased at 4 and 8 h after STS treatment, whereas the levels of non-phosphorylated (inactive) JNK and p38 kinase were comparable in all samples (Fig. 3A). We used SP600125 (1,9-pyrazoloanthrone), a specific inhibitor of JNK, and SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole), a selective inhibitor of p38 kinase, to effectively inhibit the activation of JNK and p38 kinase, respectively. When these inhibitors were used at 5 or 10 μm, we observed only partial inhibition of the respective kinase in HepG2 cells. However, nearly complete inhibition of each kinase was observed in the presence of the respective inhibitor at 20 μm or above. Therefore, in subsequent studies, we used inhibitors at 20 μm. This concentration is similar to or less than that used by other investigators (40Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J.

They are potential sources of cosmic rays and can be used to elucidate the physics of relativistic jets. We report the detection of variable gamma-ray emission above 100 gigaelectron volts from the microquasar LS I 61 + 303. Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections occur at a similar orbital phase, which suggests that the emission is periodic. The strongest gamma-ray emission is not observed when the two stars are closest to one another, implying a strong orbital modulation of the emission or absorption processes."
https://openalex.org/W2009946186,"Putty-nosed monkeys rely on two basic calling sounds to construct a message of utmost urgency. Syntax, the patterning of sound that forms phrases and sentences, is often taken as a defining property of human language. Now research on putty-nosed monkeys has identified a possible evolutionary stepping stone towards syntax. The monkeys combine two calls in sequence in response to an external event, such as the presence of a predator. This suggests that calls gain meaning if combined into higher-order sequences. If this sounds familiar, you may be thinking of a Nature paper in the 27 April issue on patterns resembling Noam Chomsky's ‘generative grammar’ in birdsong. But that's another story that, like the mysteries of syntax, will run and run. Syntax sets human language apart from other natural communication systems, although its evolutionary origins are obscure1. Here we show that free-ranging putty-nosed monkeys combine two vocalizations into different call sequences that are linked to specific external events, such as the presence of a predator and the imminent movement of the group. Our findings indicate that non-human primates can combine calls into higher-order sequences that have a particular meaning."
https://openalex.org/W2072546195,"Over the past two years, the search for low-mass extrasolar planets has led to the detection of seven so-called ‘hot Neptunes’ or ‘super-Earths’ around Sun-like stars. These planets have masses 5–20 times larger than the Earth and are mainly found on close-in orbits with periods of 2–15 days. Here we report a system of three Neptune-mass planets with periods of 8.67, 31.6 and 197 days, orbiting the nearby star HD 69830. This star was already known to show an infrared excess possibly caused by an asteroid belt within 1 au (the Sun–Earth distance). Simulations show that the system is in a dynamically stable configuration. Theoretical calculations favour a mainly rocky composition for both inner planets, while the outer planet probably has a significant gaseous envelope surrounding its rocky/icy core; the outer planet orbits within the habitable zone of this star. As the techniques used to search for extrasolar planets have been refined, more and more have been discovered (over 170), and they get smaller. In recent years seven ‘hot Neptunes’ or ‘super-Earths’ have been detected. These have masses 5–20 times larger than the Earth and are in close-in orbits (periods of 2–15 days) around Sun-like stars. Now the first multiple system of three Neptune-mass planets has been found, with periods of 8.67, 31.6 and (in the ‘habitable’ zone) 197 days. They are orbiting the nearby star HD 69830.

In polydiacetylenes, the substituents fulfill another important role: During topochemical polymerization, they control the spacing between the diyne monomers to produce an ordered polymer. By using a co-crystal scaffolding, we have prepared poly(diiododiacetylene), or PIDA, a nearly unadorned carbon chain substituted with only single-atom iodine side groups. The monomer, diiodobutadiyne, forms co-crystals with bis(nitrile) oxalamides, aligned by hydrogen bonds between oxalamide groups and weak Lewis acid-base interactions between nitriles and iodoalkynes. In co-crystals with one oxalamide host, the diyne undergoes spontaneous topochemical polymerization to form PIDA. The structure of the dark blue crystals, which look copper-colored under reflected light, has been confirmed by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy."

To map the transcriptional network controlling the damage response, we measured genomewide binding locations for 30 damage-related transcription factors (TFs) after exposure of yeast to methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS). The resulting 5272 TF-target interactions revealed extensive changes in the pattern of promoter binding and identified damage-specific binding motifs. As systematic functional validation, we identified interactions for which the target changed expression in wild-type cells in response to MMS but was nonresponsive in cells lacking the TF. Validated interactions were assembled into causal pathway models that provide global hypotheses of how signaling, transcription, and phenotype are integrated after damage."
https://openalex.org/W2144275024,"The factors that influence Earth's temperature variability on the interannual scale are fairly well understood, but the same cannot be said of the controls on temperature variability at timescales of decades to millennia. Except for a few modes of climatic variability, these are usually described as random processes. Peter Huybers and William Curry add order to the proceedings by showing that temperature variability is linked across all timescales. There is a simple power-law relationship between surface temperature and the annual and Milankovitch period (23,000 and 41,000-year) cycles with intermediate timescales, driven by variation in solar radiation. This finding provides a framework by which to understand Earth's temperature variability, and to improve climate predictions at interannual and longer timescales. Reconstructions and observations of Earth's surface temperature are used to examine variability at scales from annual to Milankovitch (23 and 41 kyr) cycles and find that temperature variability is linked at all timescales in response to deterministic solar forcing. Climate variability exists at all timescales—and climatic processes are intimately coupled, so that understanding variability at any one timescale requires some understanding of the whole. Records of the Earth's surface temperature illustrate this interdependence, having a continuum of variability following a power-law scaling1,2,3,4,5,6,7. But although specific modes of interannual variability are relatively well understood8,9, the general controls on continuum variability are uncertain and usually described as purely stochastic processes10,11,12,13. Here we show that power-law relationships of surface temperature variability scale with annual and Milankovitch-period (23,000- and 41,000-year) cycles. The annual cycle corresponds to scaling at monthly to decadal periods, while millennial and longer periods are tied to the Milankovitch cycles. Thus the annual, Milankovitch and continuum temperature variability together represent the response to deterministic insolation forcing. The identification of a deterministic control on the continuum provides insight into the mechanisms governing interannual and longer-period climate variability."

The observation that the mitochondrial ATPase subunit c protein accumulates in this disease suggests that autophagy, a pathway that regulates mitochondrial turnover, may be disrupted. To test this hypothesis, we examined the autophagic pathway in Cln3Δex7/8 knock-in mice and CbCln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells, accurate genetic models of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. In homozygous knock-in mice, we found that the autophagy marker LC3-II was increased, and mammalian target of rapamycin was down-regulated. Moreover, isolated autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes from homozygous knock-in mice were less mature in their ultrastructural morphology than the wild-type organelles, and subunit c accumulated in autophagic vacuoles. Intriguingly, we also observed subunit c accumulation in autophagic vacuoles in normal aging mice. Upon further investigation of the autophagic pathway in homozygous knock-in cerebellar cells, we found that LC3-positive vesicles were altered and overlap of endocytic and lysosomal dyes was reduced when autophagy was stimulated, compared with wildtype cells. Surprisingly, however, stimulation of autophagy did not significantly impact cell survival, but inhibition of autophagy led to cell death. Together these observations suggest that autophagy is disrupted in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, likely at the level of autophagic vacuolar maturation, and that activation of autophagy may be a prosurvival feedback response in the disease process.

The pathway is initiated at times of stress or nutritional deprivation to generate metabolites for cellular survival, but autophagy is also responsible for normal housekeeping. Although the regulatory control of autophagy remains to be fully elucidated, the general process from engulfment to degradation has been delineated (2.Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Initiation of the pathway involves de novo formation of an isolation membrane that expands to engulf cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles, and encloses to form a double membrane autophagic vacuole. This formed autophagic vacuole is then increasingly acidified, and proteases are delivered through fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes. The inner membrane is degraded to form a single membrane autolysosome, where constituents are finally completely degraded for recycling of metabolites to the cell. Autophagy is emerging as a major pathway involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease (7.Anglade P. Vyas S. Javoy-Agid F. Herrero M.T. Michel P.P. Marquez J.

A major founder mutation (a 1.02-kb genomic deletion) in the CLN3 gene accounts for the majority of JNCL disease alleles (17.International Batten Disease ConsortiumCell. 1995; 82: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). This mutation eliminates exons 7 and 8 and the surrounding intronic DNA, giving rise to multiple stably produced mutant CLN3 mRNA species encoding multiple mutant protein isoforms, which are presumably nonfunctional (17.International Batten Disease ConsortiumCell. 1995; 82: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 18.Cotman S.L.

The full-length CLN3-encoded protein, battenin (also called CLN3 and CLN3P), is a novel multipass transmembrane protein that localizes to the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane, where it has been implicated in pH and amino acid homeostasis (19.Pearce D.A.

BMC Neurosci. 2004; 5: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that faithfully replicate the common JNCL mutation in the murine Cln3 gene. As in JNCL, central nervous system neurons and noncentral nervous system cells in homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 mice exhibit progressive accumulation of subunit c that begins embryonically (18.Cotman S.L. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Lee R.L. Johnson K.A. Donahue L.R. Teed A.M. Antonellis K. Bronson R.T. Lerner T.J. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol.

In the studies described herein, we test the hypothesis that autophagy is involved in the JNCL disease process and the hallmark subunit c accumulation characteristic of NCL. These results provide strong evidence supporting disruption of autophagy in JNCL and a direct role for the CLN3-encoded protein, battenin, in normal autophagy. Reagents—Antibodies used in these studies were as follows: anti-LC3 antibodies (AP1802a; Abgent, Inc., and a generous gift from Dr. Noboru Mizushima), anti-mCln3p (23.Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Koike M. Ohsawa Y. Taka H. Mineki R. Murayama K. Uchiyama Y. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and anti-subunit c (24.Kominami E. Ezaki J. Muno D. Ishido K. Ueno T. Wolfe L.S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) antibodies (generous gifts from Dr. Junji Ezaki and Dr. Eiki Kominami), anti-Lamp 1 (1D4B; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-GRP94 (C-19) and anti-cathepsin D (C-20) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Grp75 (SPA-825; StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), anti-phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Ser2448), anti-mTOR, anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr389), and anti-p70 S6 kinase antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies). Other reagents were as follows: dextran-BODIPY® FL, dextran-Alexa 488, and Lysotracker® Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Inc.), GFP-LC3 expression plasmid (pCAG-EGFP-LC3; generous gift from Dr. Noboru Mizushima), rapamycin (LC Laboratories), and 3-methyladenine (Sigma). Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin brain sections from 10-month Cln3Δex7/8 homozygotes and heterozygote and wildtype littermates were processed and stained as previously described (18.Cotman S.L. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Lee R.L. Johnson K.A. Donahue L.R. Teed A.M. Antonellis K. Bronson R.T. Lerner T.J. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular Subfractionation and Analysis of Autophagic Vacuoles—Autophagic vacuoles were isolated from freshly dissected mouse livers by centrifugation in discontinuous density gradients, following an isolation protocol modified from Marzella et al. (25.Marzella L. Ahlberg J. Glaumann H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as previously described (13.Yu W.H. Cuervo A.M. Kumar A. Peterhoff C.M. Schmidt S.D. Lee J.H. Mohan P.S. Mercken M. Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Jiang Y. Duff K. Uchiyama Y. Naslund J. Mathews P.M. Cataldo A.M. Nixon R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Livers from four individual littermates were pooled by genotype for the fractionation procedure for each preparation. Genotyping was as previously described (22.Fossale E. Wolf P. Espinola J.A. Lubicz-Nawrocka T. Teed A.M. Gao H. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Cotman S.L. BMC Neurosci. 2004; 5: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The total volume of the starting homogenate and the protein concentrations in the homogenate and each fraction were tracked for subsequent determination of the total protein in the fractions and normalization of densitometric data. For ultrastructural analyses, an aliquot of the purified fractions was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose for maintenance of osmolarity. Fractions were subsequently processed for transmission electron microscopy, as previously described (18.Cotman S.L. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Lee R.L. Johnson K.A. Donahue L.R. Teed A.M. Antonellis K. Bronson R.T. Lerner T.J. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblot analyses, 10 μg of each fraction were run on standard Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE, except for immunoblots detecting subunit c and LC3, which were run on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. For battenin immunoblot analyses, 10 μg of each fraction were run on the 10% Bistris NuPAGE gel system (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All blots were processed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation (Amersham Biosciences), followed by chemiluminescence development (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). X-ray film detected the chemiluminescent signal over increasing exposure times ranging from 10 s to 10 min. For densitometric analyses, immunoblots were scanned using a GS-800 calibrated densitometer and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The intensity of bands was quantified with the volume rectangle tool, using local background determination. Multiple exposure times were scanned, and values were plotted to determine linearity. Densitometric values used for further analysis were taken from within the linear range. Notably, subunit c migrates in monomeric and SDS-resistant multimeric forms on SDS-PAGE, in a concentration-dependent manner (26.Chen R. Fearnley I.M. Palmer D.N. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21883-21887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); therefore, the signal from both forms was used for determination of “total subunit c” in the fractions. Total subunit c is defined as the densitometric measure of multimeric and monomeric subunit c, determined from immunoblots, normalized to the total protein content in the fraction. EM Morphometric Analyses—Four to five images from random fields were digitally captured at a magnification of ×6800 on a JEOL 1200EX-80kV electron microscope. Field size at this magnification was ∼46 mm2. Digital images were scored for the number of vesicles of the following subtypes: double membrane, multivesicular, multilamellar, and multidense body. Double membrane structures were defined as those vesicles with a discernable double outer membrane. Multivesicular structures were defined as vesicles of heterogeneous contents, with two or more vesicles inside of a double outer membrane. Multilamellar structures were defined as heterogeneous vesicles containing stacks of membrane contained within a single or double outer membrane. Multidense bodies were defined as those vesicles containing heterogeneous contents, including electron-dense spots contained within a single membrane. For each category, an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test was performed to determine whether the means per frame for wildtype versus homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 were significantly different. Lymphoblastoid and Cerebellar Cell Culture—Control and JNCL patient (homozygous 1.02-kb deletion) lymphoblastoid cell lines were previously collected (17.International Batten Disease ConsortiumCell. 1995; 82: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and were grown for these studies as previously described (27.Anderson M.A. Gusella J.F. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 856-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). CbCln3Δex7/8 cerebellar precursor cell lines have also been previously described (22.Fossale E. Wolf P. Espinola J.A. Lubicz-Nawrocka T. Teed A.M. Gao H. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Cotman S.L. BMC Neurosci. 2004; 5: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CbCln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells were transiently transfected with the pCAG-EGFP-LC3 expression plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For drug studies, cells were plated on coverslips in 12-well plates or 60-mm dishes at the appropriate seeding density and allowed to attach to the dish overnight. The following day, medium was exchanged for fresh medium with Me2SO only, 20 nm to 1 μm rapamycin/Me2SO, or 0.5-10 mm 3-methyladenine (3-MA). The fluid phase endocytosis, Lysotracker, and cell survival assays were as previously described (22.Fossale E. Wolf P. Espinola J.A. Lubicz-Nawrocka T. Teed A.M. Gao H. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Cotman S.L. BMC Neurosci. 2004; 5: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fluid phase endocytic dye was the lysine-fixable version of dextran-BODIPY FL or dextran-Alexa 488, and incubation times were from 20 to 50 min. Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 scanning laser confocal microscope or a Leica SP5 AOBS scanning laser confocal microscope, and images were manipulated using Adobe Photoshop CS (version 8.0). Image capture and manipulation were always performed with identical parameters for wild-type and homozygous CbCln3Δex7/8 cells. For quantitative analysis of colocalization in endocytosis-Lysotracker co-labeling studies, the Leica Advanced Fluorescence Application Suite software colocalization analysis tool was used (version 1.3.1). Co-localization rate, defined as co-localization area/area of the signal, was determined for 10 randomly captured images for each sample (×40 magnification). Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. For cell survival assays following drug treatments, the following statistical analyses were performed; significance of cell loss at the different drug doses, compared with the no drug treatment control, for each cell line was determined using a paired, two-tailed Student's t test. Significance of genotypic differences in cell survival at the individual doses was determined using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Subunit c Inclusion Assay—Wild-type and homozygous CbCln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well into 12-well plates containing coverslips and allowed to attach overnight. This seeding density maintained subconfluent cultures for the duration of the experiment. The following day, medium was exchanged for fresh medium containing only Me2SO or 25 nm rapamycin/Me2SO. After 48 h, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and processed for subunit c immunostaining as previously described (22.Fossale E. Wolf P. Espinola J.A. Lubicz-Nawrocka T. Teed A.M. Gao H. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Cotman S.L. BMC Neurosci. 2004; 5: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Subunit c immunopositive puncta were scored in 20 random frames with a ×60 objective. Significance was determined using an unpaired, onetailed Student's t test. Activation of Autophagy in Homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 Mice—To first test the hypothesis that autophagy is involved in the pathophysiology of JNCL, we examined the state of autophagy in Cln3Δex7/8 knock-in mice. LC3 is a microtubule-associated protein that is lipidated upon activation of autophagy (LC3-I, unlipidated; LC3-II, lipidated). LC3-II tightly associates with the preautophagosomal and autophagosomal membrane and thus is considered a marker of autophagy (28.Mizushima N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). We first probed brain sections with an LC3 antibody that detects both forms of LC3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Whereas only occasional LC3 immunopositive puncta were observed in brain sections from control mice (wild-type or heterozygous Cln3Δex7/8 littermates), strong LC3 immunopositive puncta were observed in homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 brain, in regions known to exhibit significant mitochondrial ATPase subunit c accumulations, including the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, CA2/3 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, and periventricular cells (18.Cotman S.L. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Lee R.L. Johnson K.A. Donahue L.R. Teed A.M. Antonellis K. Bronson R.T. Lerner T.J. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To more specifically determine the proportion of LC3 that was in the LC3-II form, which migrates faster than LC3-I on SDS-PAGE and is the form associated with the autophagosomal structures, we performed immunoblot analyses and densitometry of LC3-I and LC3-II in wild-type (Cln3+/+) and homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 whole brain extracts. Elevated LC3-II/LC3-I ratios in homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 knock-in brain, relative to wild-type brain, were observed at each age examined. These observations are consistent with an increased activation of autophagy in homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 mice. Battenin Is Highly Enriched in Purified Autophagic Vacuoles—To more closely examine the autophagic pathway, we performed a previously established fractionation procedure (13.Yu W.H. Cuervo A.M. Kumar A. Peterhoff C.M. Schmidt S.D. Lee J.H. Mohan P.S. Mercken M. Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Jiang Y. Duff K. Uchiyama Y. Naslund J. Mathews P.M. Cataldo A.M. Nixon R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) to isolate high purity autophagic vacuoles (AV) from wildtype and Cln3Δex7/8 knock-in liver for subsequent immunoblotting and structural studies. This procedure allows the isolation of autophagic vacuoles of two different densities, a light fraction (AV15) particularly enriched in autophagosomes and a heavy fraction (AV20) predominantly consisting of autophagolysosomes. Given the hypothesized role of autophagy in JNCL and the observed changes in autophagosomal-like structures in homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 mice (18.Cotman S.L. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Lee R.L. Johnson K.A. Donahue L.R. Teed A.M. Antonellis K. Bronson R.T. Lerner T.J. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the two AV fractions separately. To first determine whether the CLN3-encoded protein, battenin, was present in the different AV fractions, which might suggest a direct role for battenin in the autophagic pathway, we probed immunoblots of wild-type (Cln3+/+) and homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 fractions using a previously characterized anti-battenin antibody (23.Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Koike M. Ohsawa Y. Taka H. Mineki R. Murayama K. Uchiyama Y. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On wild-type immunoblots, we observed a faint ∼60-65-kDa smear (asterisk in Fig. 2) in the homogenate and tubulovesicular fraction (E; mostly consists of ER), which was remarkably enriched in the AV15, AV20, and lysosomal fractions, and this band was missing on homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 blots, as expected. Consistent with stable mutant mRNAs and low abundance mutant battenin species in homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 mouse tissues (18.Cotman S.L. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Lee R.L. Johnson K.A. Donahue L.R. Teed A.M. Antonellis K. Bronson R.T. Lerner T.J. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a novel faint smear at ∼25-30 kDa fractionating with AVs and lysosomes was detected on homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 blots (arrows in Fig. 2). Additional unidentified immunopositive bands fractionating mostly with the cytosol and a previously described cross-reactive band at ∼50 kDa, fractionating with mitochondria (23.Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Koike M. Ohsawa Y. Taka H. Mineki R. Murayama K. Uchiyama Y. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were not different on wildtype and homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 blots. Ultrastructural Abnormalities of Purified Autophagic Vacuoles from Homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 Mice—During the fractionation of AVs from wild-type and homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 liver, we noted an intriguing trend of reduced protein content in the AV15, AV20, and lysosomal fractions from homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 liver, compared with the wild-type fractions, which worsened with age (data not shown). These observations suggested abnormalities in the AV and lysosomal organelles from homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 liver. Therefore, we sought to examine further the ultrastructural morphology of the purified AV and lysosomal fractions. Comparison of the AV15, AV20, and lysosomal fractions from wildtype (Cln3+/+) mice revealed an apparent progressive maturation and degradation of contents with increasing sedimentation, where the engulfed components were no longer evident in the vesicles recovered in the lysosomal fraction (Fig. 3), consistent with previous observations (12.Yu W.H. Kumar A. Peterhoff C. Shapiro Kulnane L. Uchiyama Y. Lamb B.T. Cuervo A.M. Nixon R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2531-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13.Yu W.H. Cuervo A.M. Kumar A. Peterhoff C.M. Schmidt S.D. Lee J.H. Mohan P.S. Mercken M. Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Jiang Y. Duff K. Uchiyama Y. Naslund J. Mathews P.M. Cataldo A.M. Nixon R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In contrast, this trend was not observed in the fractions from homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 liver. Instead, vesicles in both AV fractions and in the lysosomal fraction from homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 liver were full of multilamellar membranes, consistent in appearance with the “fingerprint-like” storage material observed in JNCL. Moreover, AVs with dense cores were seen in the AV fractions from wild-type (Cln3+/+) mice, but these structures were not often observed in the homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 AV fractions (Fig. 3). Subunit c Accumulates in Autophagic Vacuoles in Homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 and Aged Wild-type Mouse Liver—The hallmark storage of mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c in JNCL is thought to occur at the level of the lysosome (15.Palmer D.N. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hall N.A. Lake B.D. Wolfe L.S. Haltia M. Martinus R.D. Jolly R.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, given that the subunit c protein is predicted to traffic to the lysosome via the autophagic pathway (29.Kominami A.E. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we sought to more precisely pinpoint the organelle in which subunit c predominantly accumulates. Utilizing the purified AV and lysosomal fractions from wild-type and homozygous Cln3Δex7/8 knock-in liver, we performed a semiquantitative analysis of subunit c distribution by immunoblotting and densitometry"
https://openalex.org/W2010325522,"After anaphase, the high mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity is downregulated to promote exit from mitosis. To this end, in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the Cdk counteracting phosphatase Cdc14 is activated. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus by its inhibitor Net1. During anaphase, Cdk- and Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 is thought to release active Cdc14. How Net1 is phosphorylated specifically in anaphase, when mitotic kinase activity starts to decline, has remained unexplained. Here, we show that PP2ACdc55 phosphatase keeps Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase. The sister chromatid-separating protease separase, activated at anaphase onset, interacts with and downregulates PP2ACdc55, thereby facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2ACdc55 downregulation also promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the “mitotic exit network” that sustains Cdc14 as Cdk activity declines. These findings allow us to present a new quantitative model for mitotic exit in budding yeast.

These findings allow us to present a new quantitative model for mitotic exit in budding yeast. Entry into mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle is promoted by the increasing activity of mitotic kinases, including Cdk and Polo. Cells in metaphase reach a peak in kinase activity. Provided that all chromosomes are correctly aligned on the mitotic spindle, this will lead to activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase. The APC ubiquitylates securin, an inhibitor of the protease separase, thereby targeting securin for destruction by the proteasome. Free separase in turn cleaves the cohesive link between sister chromatids to trigger anaphase. At the same time, the APC starts to ubiquitylate cyclins and later also Polo to downregulate mitotic kinases (Morgan, 1999Morgan D.O. Regulation of the APC and the exit from mitosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, Zachariae and Nasmyth, 1999Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Whose end is destruction: cell division and the anaphase-promoting complex.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Activation of the APC at anaphase onset occurs through an activatory subunit, called Cdc20. In budding yeast, this form of the APC (APCCdc20) initiates cyclin destruction but is not by itself sufficient to complete mitotic exit. A second essential step during mitotic exit is activation of the Cdk counteracting phosphatase Cdc14. Cdc14 contributes to Cdk downregulation by dephosphorylating both a second APC activatory subunit, Cdh1, that sustains APC activity at low Cdk levels, as well as the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (Visintin et al., 1998Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. The phosphatase Cdc14 triggers mitotic exit by reversal of Cdk-dependent phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Cdc14 also directly counteracts Cdk activity by reversing phosphorylation of Cdk substrates. Cdc14 phosphatase is sequestered and kept inactive in the nucleolus for most of the cell cycle by binding to the nucleolar protein Net1 (also called Cfi1) (Shou et al., 1999Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W.S. Jang J. Shevchenko A. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J.

Hwang E.S. Amon A. Cfi1 prevents premature exit from mitosis by anchoring Cdc14 phosphatase in the nucleolus.Nature. 1999; 398: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Release from the nucleolus and activation of Cdc14 in anaphase occurs after phosphorylation of Net1, depending on both Cdk and Polo. Phosphorylated Net1 shows reduced affinity for and in vitro no longer inhibits Cdc14 (Azzam et al., 2004Azzam R. Chen S.L. Shou W. Mah A.S. Alexandru G. Nasmyth K. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J.

Closing mitosis: The functions of the Cdc14 phosphatase and its regulation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 203-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). At anaphase onset Cdc14 is initially activated independently of MEN, in a reaction that has been called Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR; Stegmeier et al., 2002Stegmeier F. Visintin R. Amon A. Separase, polo kinase, the kinetochore protein Slk19, and Spo12 function in a network that controls Cdc14 localization during early anaphase.Cell. 2002; 108: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A number of proteins, including Cdk, Polo, Slk19, Spo12, and separase have been implicated in this early release, and it requires Net1 phosphorylation at Cdk consensus sites (Azzam et al., 2004Azzam R. Chen S.L. Shou W. Mah A.S. Alexandru G. Nasmyth K. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Phosphorylation by cyclin B-Cdk underlies release of mitotic exit activator Cdc14 from the nucleolus.Science. 2004; 305: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is not known how and which of these FEAR components conveys an anaphase-specific Cdc14 release signal. A good candidate is separase, which is released from its inhibitor securin at this time. Ectopic expression of separase in metaphase is indeed sufficient to trigger Cdc14 activation, in a reaction independent of its proteolytic activity (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003Sullivan M. Uhlmann F. A non-proteolytic function of separase links the onset of anaphase to mitotic exit.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The physiological trigger for Cdc14 activation has remained unknown. FEAR is thought to be nonessential, and likewise, an essential signal that activates MEN in anaphase has so far not been identified. Type 2A phosphatases (PP2A) are a group of abundant protein phosphatases involved in several essential aspects of cell growth and proliferation (Stark, 1996Stark M.J. Yeast protein serine/threonine phosphatases: multiple roles and diverse regulation.Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These phosphatases consist of a scaffold protein (Tpd3 in budding yeast) that associates with a catalytic subunit (one of the closely related Pph21 or Pph22) and one of three regulatory subunits (Rts1, Rts3, or Cdc55). The latter is thought to provide substrate specificity. We refer to PP2ACdc55 as a complex consisting of Tpd3, either Pph21 or Pph22, and Cdc55. Previous studies have shown that Cdc55 regulates inhibitory Cdk tyrosine phosphorylation and is required for stable mitotic arrest in response to spindle damage. Recently, a role of Cdc55 in mitotic exit has been described (Minshull et al., 1996Minshull J. Straight A. Rudner A.D. Dernburg A.F. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Protein phosphatase 2A regulates MPF activity and sister chromatid cohesion in budding yeast.Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Wang and Ng, 2006Wang Y. Ng T.-Y.

The role of Cdc55 in the spindle checkpoint is through regulation of mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 17: 658-666Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we show that in metaphase, PP2ACdc55 prevents premature Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 activation. At anaphase onset, PP2ACdc55 activity is downregulated in a separase-dependent manner, triggering a first wave of Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 release. Utilizing a new conditional allele of separase we show that separase is the essential trigger for Cdc14 activation in anaphase. We present a quantitative model of how PP2ACdc55 downregulation, together with Cdc14 activation and cyclin proteolysis, promotes mitotic exit. Conditional mutants in budding yeast separase have been described that block chromosome segregation by largely reducing, but not eliminating, cohesin cleavage. Such mutants introduce a delay to the nucleolar release of Cdc14 (McGrew et al., 1992McGrew J.T. Goetsch L. Byers B. Baum P. Requirement for ESP1 in the nuclear division of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Stegmeier et al., 2002Stegmeier F. Visintin R.

Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Sister-chromatid separation at anaphase onset is promoted by cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1.Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). This suggested that separase contributes to but is not essential for mitotic exit. We were prompted to revisit the possibility that separase plays a more decisive role in mitotic exit by three considerations: (1) The separase alleles so far studied likely present a hypomorphic and not the true null phenotype. (2) An undegradable version of the separase inhibitor securin, carrying a mutated destruction box motif (securinmdb), not only prevents chromosome segregation but also blocks mitotic exit (Cohen-Fix and Koshland, 1999Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Pds1p of budding yeast has dual roles: inhibition of anaphase initiation and regulation of mitotic exit.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). (3) Ectopic separase expression in metaphase is sufficient for Cdc14 activation and triggers mitotic exit if cyclin levels are reduced (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003Sullivan M. Uhlmann F. A non-proteolytic function of separase links the onset of anaphase to mitotic exit.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We first asked by which mechanism securinmdb blocks mitotic exit. Securin could inhibit Cdc14 activation or prevent mitotic exit in a different way. Cells were arrested in metaphase by depletion of the APC activator Cdc20 under control of the methionine-repressible MET3 promoter, and securinmdb was induced from the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. Then cells were released into synchronous anaphase by reinduction of Cdc20. Endogenous securin was rapidly degraded, and in control cells without securinmdb Cdc14 was released from the nucleolus at the same time (Figure 1A). The presence of securinmdb prevented both Cdc14 release and mitotic exit, suggesting that securin blocks mitotic progression by inhibiting Cdc14 activation. We next wanted to know whether securin blocks Cdc14 release through inhibiting separase. If this was the case, inactivation of separase should also lead to a mitotic block. We generated a new conditional allele of separase (esp1-2td) by fusing a degron cassette to the thermosensitive esp1-2 allele, expressed from the native ESP1 promoter. Then we compared cell-cycle progression in an allelic series of wild-type, esp1-1, esp1-2, and esp1-2td cells, released from an α factor block in G1 (Figure 1B). As reported, Cdc14 nucleolar release and mitotic exit are delayed in esp1-1 mutant cells, when compared to wild-type (Stegmeier et al., 2002Stegmeier F. Visintin R. Amon A. Separase, polo kinase, the kinetochore protein Slk19, and Spo12 function in a network that controls Cdc14 localization during early anaphase.Cell. 2002; 108: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cdc14 release was further reduced and delayed in the esp1-2 mutant and almost entirely blocked in the esp1-2td strain. After defective anaphase, esp1-1 mutant cells undergo delayed cytokinesis to produce aneuploid daughter cells. Cytokinesis was further delayed by the esp1-2 mutation, and esp1-2td cells failed to undergo cytokinesis and remained arrested in mitosis. As a control that the arrest was not due to a failure of APCCdc20 activation, we analyzed securin that was degraded in all strains with similar timing (Figure 1B). The mitotic arrest after securinmdb expression or separase inactivation could be overcome by ectopic Cdc14 activation using net1-1 or the dominant-active Cdc14 allele CDC14-TAB6 (Figure S1; Shou and Deshaies, 2002Shou W. Deshaies R.J. Multiple telophase arrest bypassed (tab) mutants alleviate the essential requirement for Cdc15 in exit from mitosis in S. cerevisiae.BMC Genet. 2002; 3: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests that separase inactivation in budding yeast leads to a cell-cycle block in mitosis, caused by the failure to activate Cdc14. Cdc14 activation in early anaphase depends on Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation (Azzam et al., 2004Azzam R. Chen S.L. Shou W. Mah A.S. Alexandru G. Nasmyth K. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Phosphorylation by cyclin B-Cdk underlies release of mitotic exit activator Cdc14 from the nucleolus.Science. 2004; 305: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We tested whether this phosphorylation is controlled by separase, using an antibody that recognizes a Cdk-dependent, anaphase-specific Net1 phospho-epitope. Cells were arrested in metaphase by depletion of Cdc20, and separase expression was induced from the GAL1 promoter (Figure 2A). The Net1 phospho-epitope became detectable coincidentally with Cdc14 release. To analyze whether Net1 phosphorylation was responsible for separase-induced Cdc14 release, we repeated the experiment using the net1-6Cdk mutant that lacks six Cdk phosphorylation sites required for early Cdc14 release (Azzam et al., 2004Azzam R. Chen S.L. Shou W. Mah A.S. Alexandru G. Nasmyth K. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Phosphorylation by cyclin B-Cdk underlies release of mitotic exit activator Cdc14 from the nucleolus.Science. 2004; 305: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After separase induction, Cdc14 nucleolar release was strongly reduced by the net1-6Cdk mutation (Figure 2B). This suggests that separase induces Cdc14 activation by promoting Net1 phosphorylation. It was important to know whether Net1 phosphorylation during normal anaphase also depends on separase. Therefore, wild-type and esp1-2 mutant cells were synchronized in metaphase by Cdc20 depletion and released into synchronous anaphase by Cdc20 readdition (Figure 2C). In wild-type cells, phospho-Net1 appeared concomitant with Cdc14 release. The phospho-epitope was not detectable after release of esp1-2 cells. This indicates that separase activation at anaphase onset promotes Cdc14 release by facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. We next confirmed that Cdk itself, and not another kinase that might recognize the Cdk consensus sites on Net1, was responsible for separase-induced Cdc14 activation. Cells carrying the ATP analog (1NM-PP1)-sensitive Cdk allele cdc28-as1 (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. et al.A chemical switch for inhibitor-sensitive alleles of any protein kinase.Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) were arrested in metaphase by nocodazole treatment, then 1NM-PP1 was added and separase expression induced (Figure 3A). Cells containing wild-type Cdc28 released Cdc14 from the nucleolus as expected, but inhibition of Cdc28-as1 by 1NM-PP1 efficiently blocked Cdc14 release. This demonstrates that separase-induced Cdc14 release depends on Cdk activity. Polo has also been implicated in Cdc14 activation at anaphase onset. We therefore repeated the experiment but inactivated Polo using the tight temperature-sensitive cdc5-4 allele (Park et al., 2003Park C.J. Song S. Lee P.R. Shou W. Deshaies R.J. Lee K.S. Loss of CDC5 function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to defects in Swe1p regulation and Bfa1p/Bub2p-independent cytokinesis.Genetics. 2003; 163: 21-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 3B). Cdc14 release occurred with the same kinetics in cdc5-4 and wild-type cells. This suggests that mainly Cdk, but not Polo, is responsible for separase-induced Net1 phosphorylation. These results are consistent with an essential role for Polo later in mitotic exit as part of MEN. After release from a metaphase block, cdc5-4 cells only transiently released Cdc14, reminiscent of MEN mutants, and were unable to complete mitotic exit (Figure S2). To explicitly test the role of Cdk-mediated Net1 phosphorylation during mitotic exit, we analyzed whether cells can exit from mitosis without Cdk activity. Cells were synchronized in metaphase by Cdc20 depletion, then Cdc28-as1 was inhibited with 1NM-PP1, and Cdc20 reinduced (Figure 3C). Control cells containing wild-type Cdc28 underwent anaphase, activated Cdc14, and completed mitotic exit. In contrast, cdc28-as1 cells kept Cdc14 sequestered in the nucleolus and did not exit. This was in spite of the fact that Clb2 was degraded and chromosome segregation occurred in both cultures, indicating that APCCdc20 was active. Binucleate formation was less efficient in cdc28-as1 cells, most likely due to spindle malfunction. APCCdh1 remained inactive, as levels of its substrate Polo remained high. This suggests that Cdk downregulation is not sufficient for mitotic exit if Cdk has not first fulfilled its role in the activation of Cdc14. The above results suggest that separase induces Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation in anaphase. This presents a paradox, as at this time overall Cdk activity starts to decline. One possible explanation could be a separase-dependent specificity change of Cdk. Cyclin Clb2-associated Cdk activity promotes Net1 phosphorylation during anaphase (Azzam et al., 2004Azzam R. Chen S.L. Shou W. Mah A.S. Alexandru G. Nasmyth K. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Phosphorylation by cyclin B-Cdk underlies release of mitotic exit activator Cdc14 from the nucleolus.Science. 2004; 305: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), therefore we measured its in vitro activity against Net1 after purification from synchronous cells. The substrate was a recombinant fragment of Net1, spanning amino acids 1–600, that in vivo is sufficient for cell cycle-regulated Cdc14 inhibition (Azzam et al., 2004Azzam R. Chen S.L. Shou W. Mah A.S. Alexandru G. Nasmyth K. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Phosphorylation by cyclin B-Cdk underlies release of mitotic exit activator Cdc14 from the nucleolus.Science. 2004; 305: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Traverso et al., 2001Traverso E.E. Baskerville C. Liu Y.-X. Shou W. James P. Deshaies R.J. Charbonneau H. Characterization of the Net1 cell cycle-dependent regulator of the Cdc14 phosphatase from budding yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21924-21931Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As control substrate we used histone H1, against which Cdk activity is expected to decline during anaphase. Clb2-associated Cdk activity against both Net1 (1–600) and H1 started to decline as soon as cells entered anaphase and Cdc14 was released (Figure S3). While this in vitro assay may not fully recapitulate possible regulation of Cdk specificity in vivo, it did not reveal evidence for increased Net1 phosphorylation in anaphase. Instead, we considered whether a phosphatase might limit Net1 phosphorylation in metaphase, as has been suggested based on theoretical considerations (Chen et al., 2004Chen K.C. Calzone L. Csikasz-Nagy A. Cross F.R. Novak B. Tyson J.J. Integrative analysis of cell cycle control in budding yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3841-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Defects in mitotic progression have been reported due to mutations in the budding yeast type 2A phosphatase (Evans and Stark, 1997Evans D.R.H. Stark M.J.R. Mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae type 2A phosphatase catalytic subunit reveal roles in cell wall integrity, actin cytoskeleton organization and mitosis.Genetics. 1997; 145: 227-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Minshull et al., 1996Minshull J. Straight A. Rudner A.D. Dernburg A.F. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Protein phosphatase 2A regulates MPF activity and sister chromatid cohesion in budding yeast.Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), therefore we analyzed its possible influence on Net1 phosphorylation. We individually deleted each of the three PP2A regulatory subunits, Rts1, Rts3, and Cdc55, and analyzed cell-cycle progression after synchronous release from G1 (Figure S4). rts3Δ cells behaved identical to the wild-type control, while both rts1Δ and cdc55Δ cells showed a noticeable delay in progression through mitosis. Release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus coincided with anaphase in rts1Δ cells but was delayed by 10 min in cdc55Δ cells. To further analyze the roles of Rts1 and Cdc55, we synchronized cells at the metaphase to anaphase transition. cdc55Δ cells cannot be stably arrested in metaphase by nocodazole treatment (Minshull et al., 1996Minshull J. Straight A. Rudner A.D. Dernburg A.F. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Protein phosphatase 2A regulates MPF activity and sister chromatid cohesion in budding yeast.Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but Cdc20 depletion allowed a robust block. After release into anaphase by Cdc20 readdition, the kinetics of Cdc14 nucleolar release was indistinguishable between rts1Δ and wild-type cells (Figure S4). In contrast, Cdc14 was prematurely released from the nucleolus of cdc55Δ cells arrested in metaphase (Figure 4A). Furthermore, resequestration of Cdc14 after release into anaphase occurred with a delay of at least 20 min. Premature Cdc14 release in cdc55Δ cells was accompanied by the appearance of the Cdk-specific Net1 phospho-epitope. As a consequence of hyperphosphorylation, the interaction between Net1 and Cdc14 was weakened, and less Cdc14 coprecipitated with Net1 from cdc55Δ metaphase cells compared to wild-type (Figure 4B). These findings suggest that PP2ACdc55 prevents Cdc14 release in metaphase by counteracting Net1 phosphorylation. These results are consistent with premature nucleolar release of Cdc14 in nocodazole-treated cdc55Δ cells, as recently described (Wang and Ng, 2006Wang Y. Ng T.-Y. Phosphatase 2A negatively regulates mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Yellman and Burke, 2006Yellman C.M. Burke D.J. The role of Cdc55 in the spindle checkpoint is through regulation of mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 17: 658-666Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). If PP2ACdc55 counteracts Net1 phosphorylation in metaphase, why was Cdc14 release delayed in cdc55Δ cells released after synchronization in G1? cdc55Δ cells enter mitosis with compromised Cdk activity because of inhibitory Cdc28-Y19 phosphorylation (Minshull et al., 1996Minshull J. Straight A. Rudner A.D. Dernburg A.F. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Protein phosphatase 2A regulates MPF activity and sister chromatid cohesion in budding yeast.Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To correct for this difference we introduced the CDC28Y19F allele that is refractory to inhibition. Compared to both cdc55Δ and CDC28Y19F single mutants, the cdc55Δ CDC28Y19F strain showed significantly advanced Cdc14 release from the nucleolus. Cdc14 was released in many cells that judged by their short mitotic spindle were still in metaphase (Figure 4C), confirming that Cdc55 counteracts Cdc14 release. PP2A regulatory subunits are not always acting as substrate-specific activators. To analyze whether indeed PP2A phosphatase activity opposes Net1 phosphorylation, we used a strain carrying a deletion of PPH21 and a temperature-sensitive pph22-172 allele to inactivate the two PP2A catalytic subunits. Pph3 phosphatase can partly compensate for PP2A function in budding yeast and was therefore also deleted from this strain (Evans and Stark, 1997Evans D.R.H. Stark M.J.R. Mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae type 2A phosphatase catalytic subunit reveal roles in cell wall integrity, actin cytoskeleton organization and mitosis.Genetics. 1997; 145: 227-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 4D). Net1 phosphorylation was detectable in pph3Δpph21Δpph22-172 cells, arrested in metaphase by nocodazole treatment, already at permissive conditions. Phosphorylation increased after shift to the restrictive temperature, and Cdc14 was released from the nucleolus. Sic1 started to accumulate, confirming that Cdc14 was activated. This suggests that PP2A phosphatase activity is required to keep Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase. If PP2ACdc55 counteracts Net1 phosphorylation in metaphase, does its activity change during anaphase to allow Net1 phosphorylation? We first visualized Cdc55 localization at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Cdc55 shows abundant nuclear localization throughout the cell cycle (Gentry and Hallberg, 2002Gentry M.S. Hallberg R.L. Localization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein phosphatase 2A subunits throughout mitotic cell cycle.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3477-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and data not shown). To detect nucleolar localization, we immunostained spread chromosomes from which nucleoplasmic protein has been washed away (Figure 5A). Colocalization with Net1 revealed nucleolar enrichment of Cdc55 in metaphase. Cdc55 was still enriched in the nucleolus in cells released into synchronous anaphase. Thus, while Cdc55 is at the right place to keep Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase, no localization change is obvious during anaphase. We then measured the in vitro phosphatase activity of PP2ACdc55 after immunopurification from synchronous cultures. As substrates, we prepared in vitro 32P-phosphorylated histone H1 and Net1 (1–600). Cdc55 immunoprecipitates from cultures undergoing synchronous metaphase to anaphase transition were incubated with these substrates, and release of acid soluble 32P-phosphate was quantified by scintillation counting (Figure 5B). After the reaction, the yield of Cdc55 in the immunoprecipitates was quantified by Western blotting. In metaphase, significant Cdc55-associated phosphatase activity could be measured using both substrates. During anaphase, protein levels of Cdc55 remained unchanged but Cdc55 phosphatase-specific activity decreased to less than half of the value in metaphase. This suggests that PP2ACdc55 activity is downregulated at anaphase onset. To determine whether the decrease of Cdc55-associated phosphatase activity in anaphase depends on separase, we repeated the phosphatase assay using an esp1-2 mutant strain. Cdc55 levels are reduced in esp1 mutant strains (Figure S5). Phosphatase activity could nevertheless be readily measured after Cdc55 immunopurification from metaphase-arrested cells (Figure 5C). Strikingly, the phosphatase specific activity remained constant after release into anaphase. This suggests that separase is required to downregulate PP2ACdc55 activity at anaphase onset. To address how separase regulates PP2ACdc55, we asked whether separase and Cdc55 physically interact. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that separase forms a complex with Cdc55 (Figure 5D). An interaction could be detected in metaphase cells that became stronger during anaphase when securin w"

The sensing and repair of lesions is critical for Bacillus subtilis cells entering the developmental process of sporulation as damaged DNA may prevent the cells from completing spore morphogenesis. We report the identification of the protein DisA (DNA integrity scanning protein, annotated YacK), which is required to delay the initiation of sporulation in response to chromosomal damage. DisA is a nonspecific DNA binding protein that forms a single focus, which moves rapidly within the bacterial cell, pausing at sites of DNA damage. We propose that the DisA focus scans along the chromosomes searching for lesions. Upon encountering a lesion, DisA delays entry into sporulation until the damage is repaired.

The Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis can undergo a complex developmental process that culminates in the formation of a dormant cell type called the spore. Upon entry into sporulation, B. subtilis replicates its chromosome and remodels the daughter chromosomes into an elongated axial filament structure. Subsequently, an asymmetrically positioned (polar) septum is formed that divides the developing cell (sporangium) into progeny of unequal size, referred to as the forespore (the small compartment) and the mother cell. The forespore ultimately becomes the spore, whereas the mother cell nurtures the developing spore until it is discarded by lysis once morphogenesis is complete (Piggot and Losick, 2001Piggot P.J.

The differentiation of vegetative cells into spores is initiated by integrating a wide range of environmental and physiological signals. These signals are channeled into a multicomponent phosphorelay that is responsible for the phosphorylation of a key transcriptional regulatory protein, Spo0A. Spo0A, a member of the response regulator family of two-component regulatory systems, obtains its phosphate from at least three histidine protein kinases that transfer phosphate to the relay protein Spo0F, then to Spo0B, and finally to Spo0A. This regulatory hierarchy provides multiple targets for controlling a gradual initiation of sporulation (Sonenshein, 2000Sonenshein A.L. Control of sporulation initiation in Bacillus subtilis.Curr.

Conditions or mutations that result in disruption of DNA replication, defects in chromosome partitioning, or damaged DNA can delay sporulation at the level of Spo0A activation (Ireton and Grossman, 1992Ireton K.

The best-studied example is the coupling between the initiation of sporulation and DNA replication that was found to be mediated by the sda gene. sda is activated upon a block in DNA replication and encodes a small protein that binds to and inhibits the activity of KinA, a histidine kinase that lies at the top of the phosphorelay involved in the activation of Spo0A. Thus, Sda is part of a checkpoint that ensures faithful replication of the chromosomes before entry into the developmental program of sporulation (Burkholder et al., 2001Burkholder W.F. Kurtser I.

Cell. 2004; 13: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidence exists for an analogous checkpoint to monitor and maintain genomic integrity. In the presence of DNA damaging agents, B. subtilis fails to initiate sporulation (Ireton and Grossman, 1994Ireton K. Grossman A.D. DNA-related conditions controlling the initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 193-198PubMed Google Scholar); thus sporulating cells must somehow sense and repair DNA damage in order to accomplish faithful generation of the two cell types. However, the mechanism underlying this DNA-damage checkpoint is not well understood. Here we describe the identification of DisA (for DNA integrity scanning protein, annotated YacK), which is involved in monitoring genomic integrity at the onset of sporulation. In the absence of DisA, cells enter sporulation even in the presence of chromosomal lesions, resulting in fewer viable spores compared with wild-type cells. We provide evidence that DisA molecules are organized into focal assemblies that move dynamically within bacterial cells, scanning the DNA for the presence of lesions. When damage is encountered, DisA pauses at the lesion site and induces a cellular response that culminates in a temporary block in sporulation. We propose that DisA prevents cells from entering spore morphogenesis under conditions in which they cannot successfully form mature spores and, hence, may perish trying. DisA was discovered in a search for proteins that interact with RacA, which is produced at the onset of sporulation and is involved in axial filament formation and asymmetric division (Ben-Yehuda et al., 2003Ben-Yehuda S. Rudner D.Z. Losick R. RacA, a bacterial protein that anchors chromosomes to the cell poles.Science. 2003; 299: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). However, we observed that axial filament formation and polar division were unperturbed in a strain (YA5) harboring a disA null mutation, indicating that disA is not involved in executing these processes. These observations prompted us to consider other roles for DisA. disA is the last gene in an operon that contains six genes involved in protein degradation, competence, and DNA repair (Kruger et al., 1996Kruger E. Msadek T. Hecker M. Alternate promoters direct stress-induced transcription of the Bacillus subtilis clpC operon.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We found that deletion of the disA gene has no detectable effect on cell division, sporulation, competence, or response of vegetative cells to DNA damage (data not shown). Next, we examined whether DisA is involved in responding to DNA damage during sporulation. Wild-type and DisA mutant cells were treated with different concentrations of nalidixic acid (nalidixic acid targets DNA gyrase and therefore causes DNA damage) at the onset of sporulation, and spore formation was assayed by heat resistance. In untreated cultures, the resulting number of heat-resistant, colony-forming units (spores) was similar to that of the wild-type. In contrast, in the presence of nalidixic acid, the number of spores produced by the mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild-type (Figure 1A). Similar results were observed when the cells were exposed to the DNA-damaging agent Mitomycin C (MMC) (Figure S1A). To visualize the developmental progression of the nalidixic acid-treated cells, we monitored sporulation by fluorescence microscopy. In comparison to untreated cells, treated cells of both the wild-type and the DisA mutant were delayed in their entry into sporulation, as judged by reduced numbers of asymmetric septa 2.5 hr after treatment (Figures 1B and 1C). However, by 3.5 hr after treatment, a significant percentage (15%) of the mutant cells had entered sporulation, whereas less than 2% of the wild-type cells had undergone asymmetric division (Figures 1B and 1C). This phenotype was observed over a range of concentrations of nalidixic acid or when the cells were exposed to MMC (Figures 1C and S1, respectively). Thus, although DisA mutant cells are less efficient in producing mature spores, they are able to enter sporulation earlier than wild-type cells in the presence of DNA damage. We also examined the expression of early sporulation genes (spoIIE and racA), which are synthesized prior to asymmetric division under the control of the transcription factor Spo0A (York et al., 1992York K. Kenney T.J. Satola S. Moran Jr., C.P. Poth H. Youngman P. Spo0A controls the sigma A-dependent activation of Bacillus subtilis sporulation-specific transcription unit spoIIE.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2648-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Ben-Yehuda et al., 2003Ben-Yehuda S. Rudner D.Z. Losick R. RacA, a bacterial protein that anchors chromosomes to the cell poles.Science. 2003; 299: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Wild-type and DisA mutant cells harboring spoIIE-lacZ or PracA-lacZ reporter fusions were induced to sporulate in the presence or absence of nalidixic acid, and β-galactosidase activity was monitored (Figures 2A–2D). In the absence of nalidixic acid, Spo0A activity was indistinguishable between the wild-type and the mutant cells (Figures 2A and 2B). The addition of nalidixic acid greatly reduced Spo0A activity in both the wild-type and the mutant cells. Importantly, in agreement with our cytological analysis, in DisA mutant cells β-galactosidase activity was observed earlier and reached higher levels in comparison to the wild-type cells (Figures 2C and 2D). Similar results were obtained when the production of SpoIIE-GFP and RacA-GFP fusions was examined by fluorescence microscopy (Figure S2 and data not shown). Thus, we concluded that DisA is required, at least in part, to inhibit Spo0A activity when DNA is damaged. The Spo0A transcription factor is activated by phosphorylation and obtains its phosphate by a phosphorelay consisting of histidine kinases (KinA, B, and C) and the phosphotransfer proteins Spo0F and Spo0B (see Introduction). To investigate whether DisA acts by modulating the phosphorylation state of Spo0A, we introduced an allele of spo0A (rvtA11) that bypasses the requirement for the normal phosphorylation pathway (Sharrock et al., 1984Sharrock R.A. Rubenstein S. Chan M. Leighton T. Intergenic suppression of spo0 phenotypes by the Bacillus subtilis mutation rvtA.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 194: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, LeDeaux and Grossman, 1995LeDeaux J.R. Grossman A.D. Isolation and characterization of kinC, a gene that encodes a sensor kinase homologous to the sporulation sensor kinases KinA and KinB in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) into wild-type and DisA mutant backgrounds. Spo0A activity was monitored by the use of spoIIE-lacZ or PracA-lacZ reporters in the presence or absence of nalidixic acid. As shown in Figure 2, cells harboring the altered form of Spo0A were much less sensitive to the presence of nalidixic acid and produced β-galactosidase at levels that were almost comparable to those seen in untreated cells (Figures 2E and 2F). Moreover, under these conditions, no significant difference was observed between the wild-type and the DisA mutant cells. These results indicate that DisA delays sporulation by affecting the phosphorylation state of Spo0A. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the idea that DisA participates in a DNA-damage checkpoint that is active prior to asymmetric division and delays Spo0A activation. The absence of this checkpoint in the presence of DNA damage leads to premature entry into sporulation and consequently to impaired sporulation. In keeping with this model, overproduction of DisA was found to reduce polar division and to decrease sporulation efficiency (Figure 1A and data not shown). To investigate the subcellular localization of the checkpoint protein, we constructed a strain (MB3) harboring a disA-gfp gene fusion in place of the wild-type gene. Growth and sporulation of MB3 were indistinguishable from that of the wild-type. Importantly, the DisA-GFP protein was fully functional because sporulating MB3 cells were as sensitive to nalidixic acid as were wild-type cells (Figure 1A). DisA-GFP was seen as a single discrete globular focus that colocalized with the bulk of the DNA in cells that were induced to sporulate. This localization pattern was apparent both before and after the formation of the polar septum (Figure 3A). To examine whether these DisA-GFP foci reflect the proper localization of the endogenous protein, we carried out immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to DisA on cells producing unmodified wild-type DisA. The immunostaining pattern closely resembled that observed with DisA-GFP (Figure 3B). We observed little or no immunostaining in the DisA mutant control (data not shown). Thus, DisA localizes as a discrete focus at the onset of sporulation. The number of cells exhibiting a DisA-GFP focus increased dramatically after suspension in sporulation medium (Figures 3A and 3C). More specifically, 5% of the cells displayed a DisA-GFP focus at time 0. As early as 1 hr after suspension, 33% of the cells exhibited a focus, and 46% had a focus at hr 2. The increase in the number of cells harboring a DisA-GFP focus correlated with a total increase in fluorescence intensity as well as with an elevation in wild-type DisA protein levels (Figures 3C and 3D, respectively) and therefore reflected induced production of DisA. This observation prompted us to investigate whether DisA synthesis is dependent on Spo0A, the master transcriptional regulator for entry into sporulation. Our experiments indicate that induction of disA expression upon initiation of sporulation was not dependent on this regulator (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in the absence of sigma H, an additional transcription factor that is required to initiate sporulation (Piggot and Losick, 2001Piggot P.J. Losick R. Sporulation genes and intercompartmental regulation.in: Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and its closest relatives: from genes to cells. ASM Press, Washington2001: 483-517Google Scholar). In addition, we observed an increase in the number of cells expressing DisA-GFP at a high cell density in a rich medium (data not shown). Thus, it seems likely that disA is induced by non-sporulation-specific regulatory proteins at the end of the exponential growth phase and, as shown above, acts upstream of Spo0A and modulates its activity. Interestingly, another gene in the disA operon, clpC, encodes a protease subunit that degrades an antisporulation transcription factor early in development (Pan et al., 2001Pan Q. Garsin D.A. Losick R. Self-reinforcing activation of a cell-specific transcription factor by proteolysis of an anti-sigma factor in B. subtilis.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that the entire operon is involved in early sporulation events. To study the movement of DisA-GFP foci, we analyzed the fusion protein by time-lapse microscopy. Sporulating MB3 cells were applied to an agarose pad on a glass slide and photographed at 200–400 msec intervals. We observed that the foci are remarkably dynamic, rapidly traversing the entire cell in a few seconds (Figures 4A and 4B; Movies S1, S2, and S5). Single-particle tracking analysis revealed that the average focus speed was 0.22 μm/sec at room temperature (Figure S3). Importantly, this unusual movement was abolished when the cells were fixed with formaldehyde (Movie S6). Moreover, when the cells were treated with the ATPase inhibitor sodium azide, the DisA-GFP foci were immediately stalled, implying that DisA mobility is energy dependent (Movies S7A and S7B). A closer investigation of the time-lapse microscopy movies revealed that when two daughter cells were separated by a yet incomplete septum (as indicated by the membrane staining), the focus was able to cross from one compartment to the other, both during medial and polar divisions (Figures 4C and 4D; Movies S3 and S4). This observation led us to infer that when the septum is sealed upon completion of division, the DisA-GFP focus becomes trapped in one of the two compartments. Consequently, DisA becomes distributed unequally upon division between the two daughter cells. Consistent with this notion, only one particle is usually observed per sporangium after polar division, and it is chiefly found in the larger mother cell compartment. We reasoned that if the role of DisA is to monitor for DNA damage, DisA movement might be affected by DNA lesions. To test this possibility, we visualized DisA-GFP movement in the presence of nalidixic acid. Indeed, we found that the majority of the DisA-GFP foci were no longer moving and were stationary at various positions within the cells (Movie S8). Similar results were obtained when the cells were treated with MMC (see below). These data suggest that the movement of the DisA focus ceases in the presence of DNA lesions. These DNA-damaging agents produce multiple lesions that may result indirectly in stalled DisA-GFP foci. To obtain stronger evidence for a direct connection between chromosomal integrity and DisA-GFP foci movement, we constructed a DisA-GFP-producing strain in which we could induce a site-specific double strand break. This was achieved by generating DisA-GFP strains that produced the yeast homothallic switching endonuclease (HO) (Haber, 1998Haber J.E. Mating-type gene switching in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 561-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) under an inducible promoter, with and without the HO recognition sequence (YA41 and YA57, respectively). The recognition sequence was inserted close to the origin of replication that is located in the vicinity of the cell pole at the onset of sporulation (Webb et al., 1997Webb C.D. Teleman A. Gordon S. Straight A. Belmont A. Lin D.C. Grossman A.D. Wright A. Losick R. Bipolar localization of the replication origin regions of chromosomes in vegetative and sporulating cells of B. subtilis.Cell. 1997; 88: 667-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The inducer was added upon suspension in sporulation medium, and the localization pattern of DisA-GFP was examined 1.5 hr after induction. In the absence of the recognition site (YA57), DisA-GFP foci were highly mobile and moved in a similar manner to the foci in untreated cells (data not shown). In contrast, in the presence of the HO recognition site (YA41), the movement of DisA-GFP was abolished in the majority of cells (86%) upon induction of the endonuclease (Figure 5A; Movie S9). However, unlike the random positions of stalled DisA-GFP foci observed in MB3 cells treated with DNA-damaging agents, in YA41 cells the stalled DisA-GFP foci appeared to be localized at a particular site on the chromosome close to the cell pole, presumably at the HO-induced break site. In support of this idea, when the HO cut-site was inserted at a distinct chromosomal location near the terminus region, the foci position was altered and they were stalled mostly at the mid-cell position in between the two chromosomal copies where the terminus is generally located (Webb et al., 1997Webb C.D. Teleman A. Gordon S. Straight A. Belmont A. Lin D.C. Grossman A.D. Wright A. Losick R. Bipolar localization of the replication origin regions of chromosomes in vegetative and sporulating cells of B. subtilis.Cell. 1997; 88: 667-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) (Figure 5B). To independently examine whether the DisA focus is recruited to the site of DNA damage, we carried out fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize the DNA break site concomitantly with immunofluorescence microscopy to localize the DisA focus (see Experimental Procedures). Sporulating cells producing the HO endonuclease (YA41) were fixed and hybridized with a fluorescent probe corresponding to a 15kb region adjacent to the HO cut-site. The chromosomal region appeared as a distinct fluorescent focus with one or two foci per cell (examples are shown in Figures 5C–5F). These cells were then subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to localize the DisA focus. In 66.7% of the cells bearing a DisA focus, the focus clearly colocalized with the DNA break site (examples are shown in Figures 5C and 5D). By comparison, only 12.1% of the DisA foci colocalized with the HO cleavage site in a control strain that did not produce the HO endonuclease (examples are shown in Figures 5E and 5F). In a complementary approach, we used Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine whether DisA resides in close proximity to the DNA break site. Extracts were prepared from sporulating cells (either producing or not producing the HO endonuclease) that had been treated with formaldehyde, which cross links proteins to DNA. DisA-DNA complexes were then immunoprecipated using anti-DisA antibodies, and the DNA from the immunoprecipitation was recovered and used as a template for quantitative PCR reactions. Consistent with the idea that DisA scans along the chromosome, in the absence of the HO endonuclease (and therefore in the absence of DNA lesions) (YA36), we obtained efficient precipitation of all chromosomal locations examined (Figure 5G and data not shown). As a control, very little signal was detected when the ChIP procedure was carried out with sporulating cells from a DisA mutant (YA52) (Figure 5G and data not shown). When the ChIP procedure was performed with cells producing the HO endonuclease (YA51), preferential binding by DisA was clearly observed at the lesion site (an enrichment factor of 7.46 in YA51 in comparison with an enrichment factor of 0.47 in YA36; Figure 5G), consistent with our cytological experiments. In summary, the evidence indicates that DisA interacts with DNA and rapidly scans along the chromosomes during sporulation and that its rapid motion is abrogated by the presence of DNA lesions. In support of our proposal, sequence analysis of DisA predicts a putative Helix-hairpin-Helix (HhH) DNA binding domain at its C terminus (Doherty et al., 1996Doherty A.J. Serpell L.C. Ponting C.P. The helix-hairpin-helix DNA-binding motif: a structural basis for non-sequence-specific recognition of DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Moreover, gel retardation experiments using purified recombinant DisA showed that DisA binds DNA with a moderate affinity (approximate Kd: 10−8 M) and with no apparent sequence specificity (Figure S4). Our data suggest that DisA tracks along the DNA. To determine whether DisA-GFP movement requires DNA, cells were needed that lack DNA but still harbor DisA-GFP foci. Such cells are formed in response to MMC treatment, which perturbs DNA segregation and leads to a high frequency of anucleate cells and elongated cells, where the DNA occupies only a portion of the cell. We examined DisA-GFP foci in sporulating cells treated with MMC and found that the foci were readily detected both on the DNA and in DNA-free parts of the cells (Figure 6A). Although DisA-GFP foci that colocalized with DNA were stalled, DisA-GFP foci located in parts lacking DNA were capable of moving rapidly (Figures 6A, 6C, and 6D; Movie S10). Another system that allows us to examine DNA-free cells is mutant sporangia that form bipolar septa due to a mutation in the sporulation gene spoIIAC (Piggot and Losick, 2001Piggot P.J. Losick R. Sporulation genes and intercompartmental regulation.in: Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and its closest relatives: from genes to cells. ASM Press, Washington2001: 483-517Google Scholar). In such a “disporic” mutant, each forespore compartment receives a chromosome, whereas the mother cell remains anucleate. We observed that the DNA-free mother cell frequently contained DisA-GFP foci in sporulating spoIIAC mutant cells. Moreover, the majority of these foci were highly dynamic within the empty compartment (Figure 6B; Movie S11). Single-particle tracking analysis indicates that foci movement within the DNA-free compartment is in general more rapid than foci movement in the presence of DNA (Figure 6E). Importantly, the rapid movement of the foci observed in the absence of the DNA in these two DNA-free systems was energy dependent as it was abolished by treating the cells with sodium azide (Figure S5 and data not shown). The simplest interpretation of our experiments is that DNA is not required for DisA focus movement, but the presence of DNA (and even more so damaged DNA) attenuates focus motion, probably due to DisA DNA scanning activity.

We previously reported that Nemo-like kinase (NLK) negatively regulates Wnt signaling via phosphorylation of TCF/LEF. To further evaluate the physiological roles of NLK, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify NLK-interacting proteins. From this screen, we isolated a novel RING finger protein that we term NARF (NLK associated RING finger protein). Here, we show that NARF induces the ubiquitylation of TCF/LEF in vitro and in vivo, and functions as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase that specifically cooperates with the E2 conjugating enzyme E2-25K. We found that NLK augmented NARF binding and ubiquitylation of TCF/LEF, and this required NLK kinase activity. The ubiquitylated TCF/LEF was subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Furthermore, NARF inhibited formation of the secondary axis induced by the ectopic expression of β-catenin in Xenopus embryos. Collectively, our findings raise the possibility that NARF functions as a novel ubiquitin-ligase to suppress the Wnt-β-catenin signaling. β-Catenin is a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway, and interacts with cofactor T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to generate a transcription activator complex that activates Wnt-induced genes.

The Wnt family of signaling proteins constitutes a large group of highly conserved secreted glycoproteins (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4180) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins are pleiotropic factors that play crucial roles in multiple embryonic developmental processes and also play a role in tumorigenesis (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4180) Google Scholar, 2Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins initiate signal transduction via their extracellular surface receptor complex, which is composed of Frizzled proteins (Fz) and lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP-5/6). In the absence of Wnt stimulation, cytoplasmic β-catenin is maintained at low levels by the continuous process of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation involving a scaffold complex of axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, (APC) and active glycogen synthasekinase-3β (GSK-3β). In the canonical pathway of β-catenin signal transduction, Wnt signaling relieves this process of proteasome-mediated degradation, and β-catenin consequently accumulates in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin then translocates into the nucleus and forms a transcriptional unit with the HMG box class T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) 3The abbreviations used are: TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; NARF, Nemo-like kinase-associated RING finger protein; NLK, Nemo-like kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; LS-MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Ub, ubiquitin. 3The abbreviations used are: TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; NARF, Nemo-like kinase-associated RING finger protein; NLK, Nemo-like kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; LS-MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Ub, ubiquitin. to activate expression of its target genes.Nemo-like kinase (NLK) was originally isolated as a murine orthologue of the Drosophila Nemo by RT-PCR from embryonic mouse brain mRNA using degenerate primers designed for the conserved kinase domains I, VI, VII, and IX of the extracellular-signal regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) family (3Brott B.K. Pinsky B.A. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the NLK kinase domain shows 39–47% identity to both ERK/MAPK and cyclin-directed kinase 2. The ERK/MAPK family kinases contain a characteristic conserved phosphorylation motif, Thr-X-Tyr, in their kinase domain VIII that is required for activation. However, the corresponding sequence in NLK is Thr-Gln-Glu, which is quite similar to the sequence Thr-His-Glu found in some cyclin-directed kinases. The threonine residue in this motif is suggested to be a major site for autophosphorylation of NLK. Thus, NLK may not be a target for an ERK/MAPK activator such as MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) (3Brott B.K. Pinsky B.A. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).In our current studies, we demonstrate that NLK is involved in the suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. NLK inactivates a transcriptional unit composed of β-catenin/TCF/LEF via phosphorylation of TCF/LEF, resulting in the inhibition of binding to its target gene sequences (4Ishitani T.

Our recent data indicate that, in addition to TCF/LEF, NLK associates with and modulates the activities of other transcriptional factors including Sox11 (11Hyodo-Miura J. Urushiyama S. Nagai S.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggests that NLK may contribute to various signaling pathways via its ability to interact with a diverse collection of transcription factors.Alteration in protein function by covalent post-translational modification, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, neddylation, glycosylation, and ribosylation, is commonly observed in the cell (13Ben-Neriah Y. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 14Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 15Fang S. Weissman A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1546-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation and phosphorylation are two major types of protein modification and are observed in all eukaryotes. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved 76-amino acid globular protein that can be ligated to proteins and functions to mark them for destruction by the 26 S proteasome (16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In general, ubiquitylation proceeds via a sequential multienzyme reaction directed by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (also known as Ubc), and E3 ubiquitin-ligase. E1 initiates the first step in the ubiquitylation by forming a thiol-ester bond directly with the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction. Subsequently, the activated ubiquitin on E1 is transferred to the cysteine within the active site of an E2 by transesterification. In the last step, E3 associates with ubiquitin-charged E2 and the target protein, and facilitates the formation of an isopeptide linkage between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and the ϵ-amino group of an internal lysine residue on the target proteins, or on the extended polyubiquitin chains attached to the protein (17Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar).Distinctive types of E3 ligases specifically recognize proteins targeted for ubiquitylation. The number of E3 ubiquitin-ligase candidates has vastly expanded to over 100, and these are classified into four major groups based on several motifs: the HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain, the RING (really interesting new gene) finger domain, the U-box, and the PHD (plant homeo-domain) or LAP (leukemia-associate protein) finger domains (15Fang S. Weissman A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1546-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RING finger domain in E3 ubiquitin-ligases consists of the conserved sequence motif: C-X2-C-X(9–39)-C-X(1–3)-H-X(2–3)-C/H-X2-C-X(4–48)-C-X2-C, and functions to coordinate two zinc ions in a unique “cross-brace” arrangement (18Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-R87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The family of RING finger proteins can be divided into the single subunit type E3 and the multisubunit type E3. Single subunit type E3 proteins contain the RING finger domain and the substrate recognition site on the same polypeptide. Examples of this type are Mdm2, which ubiquitylates p53 (19Fang S.

Biochemical analyses showed that NARF associates with the carboxyl terminus of NLK and provides E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity that specifically cooperates with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (Hip-2/UbcH1). We found that NARF targets TCF/LEF proteins for ubiquitylation, and that NLK kinase activity augments this ubiquitylation. NARF-ubiquitylated TCF/LEF is subsequently degraded by the proteasome, resulting in the down-regulation of TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activity. In addition to these observations, we found that microinjection of NARF mRNA inhibited secondary axis formation induced by the expression of β-catenin in Xenopus embryos. These results reveal a new mechanism for regulating Wnt-β-catenin signaling involving the ubiquitylation and degradation of TCF/LEF proteins by NARF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The RING finger domain mutants of Xenopus NARF at C17A/C53A (xNARF-CA), human NARF at C18A/C54A (hNARF-CA), and a catalytically inactive mutant of Xenopus NLK at K89R (xNLK-KN) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For generating GST fusion proteins, Xenopus NARF wild-type (xNARF-WT) or RING finger domain mutant (xNARF-CA) cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). To produce amino-terminal FLAG-tagged or T7-tagged recombinant proteins, cDNAs xNARF-WT, xNARF-CA, human NARF (hNARF-WT), hNARF-CA, xNLK-WT, xNLK-KN, and mouse Wnt1 were subcloned into pCS2 (36Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). These pCS2-derived plasmids were used to express recombinant proteins in mammalian cells and as templates for in vitro transcription to produce RNA for microinjection into Xenopus embryos. Amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged or T7-tagged each of xNARF-WT, E2-25K, human TCF4, and human LEF1 were prepared using a mammalian expression vector. FLAG-NLK-ΔN and FLAG-NLK-ΔC were made by deletion of amino acids 1–201 and 202–447 of Xenopus NLK, respectively.Antibodies and Chemicals—The monoclonal antibodies against T7 (Novagen), FLAG (M2, Sigma), HA (16B12, Babco), GST (26H1, Cell Signaling), ubiquitin (P4G7, Covance), TCF4 (6H5-3, Upstate), and β-actin (AC-15, Sigma) were used for immunoprecipitation and/or Western blotting analysis. Anti-NARF rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 234–245 of human NARF, and then affinity purified using antigen-conjugated affinity Sepharose. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and cDNA Cloning—The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as previously described (12Yamada M. Ohkawara B. Ichimura N. Hyodo-Miura J. Urushiyama S. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A Xenopus laevis oocyte MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech) was screened using pGBDU-xNLK-C, which encodes amino acids 202–447 of Xenopus NLK as bait. 3 × 106 clones from a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library were screened.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293 cells (5 × 105 cells) in 60-mm diameter plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The total amount of plasmids was adjusted to 2.5 μg using the empty expression vector. After 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies. To detect the ubiquitylation of TCF/LEF, 293 cells were incubated with 10 μm MG132 for 4 h before harvest and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Lysates were treated with 1% SDS at 95 °C for 10 min, and diluted 10-fold before use in immunoprecipitation. For Western blotting analysis, whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were probed with the appropriate antibody, and proteins of interest were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG using Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Science).In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—Bacterially expressed GST-NARF-WT and GST-NARF-CA were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro ubiquitylation assays, reactions were performed in 30-μl reaction volumes with the following components as indicated: 0.1 μg of GST-NARF, 0.1 μg of rabbit E1 (Boston Biochem), 0.1 μg of E2-25K (Boston Biochem), 5 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm creatine phosphate, 15 units of creatine phosphokinase, and 3 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochem). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h and terminated by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled to dissociate proteins. The ubiquitylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting analysis with either anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4G7, Covance) or anti-GST antibody (26H1, Cell Signaling). To detect the ubiquitylation of TCF/LEF in vitro, 35S-labeled TCF/LEF was prepared with a TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and used as a substrate for the in vitro ubiquitylation assay. The ubiquitylated [35S]TCF/LEF was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Pulse-Chase Assay—293 cells (5 × 105 cells) were transfected with the expression plasmids encoding T7-TCF4, FLAG-NARF, and FLAG-NLK. After 24 h post-transfection, cells were pre-starved for methionine and cysteine for 1 h and labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi/ml Pro-mix L-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mixture (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed twice and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing l-methionine and l-cysteine for the indicated chase periods. At each indicated time point, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and [35S]T7-tagged TCF4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody (Novagen). Precipitated immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and 35S-labeled TCF4 was visualized by autoradiography.RNA Interference—We designed small interference RNAs (siRNAs) against human NARF (sense 5′-GAGAGAGAGCAUGUCCUGA-3′) mRNA along with its corresponding anti-sense RNA oligonucleotides with two thymidine residues (dTdT) at the 3′ end of the sequence (Dharmacon). The control siRNA (siControl, Dharmacon) is targeted against luciferase. These siRNAs were transfected into 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h post-transfection, cells were used for the experiment.Semiquantitative Multiplex RT-PCR—Semiquantitative multiplex RT-PCR was performed by the procedure described previously, with some modifications (49Ohnishi J. Ohnishi E. Jin M. Hirano W. Nakane D. Matsui H. Kimura A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Shibuya H. Nagashima K. Takahashi T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 747-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Multiplex PCR was carried out with specific primer sets for human DKK-1 (sense, 5′-AGGCGTGCAAATCTGTCTCG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGCATTTGGATAGCTGGTTTAGTG-3′) and Quantum RNA classic II 18 S internal standards (Ambion). Aliquots of the PCR products were electrophoresed, visualized with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and analyzed by computerized densitometric scanning of the images using Light Capture (ATTO).Reporter Assay—293 cells (2 × 105 cells) in 35-mm diameter plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids by the calcium phosphate precipitate method. The total amount of plasmids for each transfection was equalized among transfections using empty vector. Cells were harvested after 24 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity.Secondary Axis Formation—Mature oocytes were collected from X. laevis ovaries and in vitro fertilization was performed as previously described (50Suzuki A. Kaneko E. Maeda J. Ueno N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The jelly layer covering the embryos was removed using 3% cysteine. Capped mRNAs for the indicated proteins were prepared using mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion). Synthesized mRNAs were microinjected into two ventral blastomeres at the 4-cell stage and the ectopic axis formations were counted at tadpole stage.Protein Identification by LC-MS/MS Analysis—The NARF-associated complexes were digested with Axhromobacter protease I, and the resulting peptides were analyzed using a nanoscale LC-MS/MS system as described previously (37Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of NARF as an NLK-associating Protein—To identify protein partners that regulate the signaling of NLK, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out using the carboxyl terminus encoding amino acids 202–447 of Xenopus NLK as bait (11Hyodo-Miura J. Urushiyama S. Nagai S. Nishita M. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One of the positive clones was found to encode a novel Xenopus sequence containing a characteristic RING finger domain. We termed this protein NARF (accession number DQ011285). Sequence analysis of the full-length NARF cDNA revealed that NARF contains a RING finger domain in the amino terminus and is a Xenopus orthologue of a previously uncharacterized human RING finger protein RNF138 (NM 016271), sharing 47% identity (Fig. 1A).The interaction between NARF and NLK observed in the yeast system was next examined in mammalian cells. T7-tagged NARF (T7-NARF) and FLAG-tagged full-length NLK (FLAG-NLK-WT) were co-expressed in 293 cells, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, T7-NARF was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-NLK-WT and FLAG-NLK-ΔN (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7), but not with FLAG-NLK-ΔC (Fig. 1B, lane 6). These results suggest that NARF specifically associates with the carboxyl-terminal region of NLK in mammalian cells.To prove the existence of the endogenous NLK and NARF complex, extracts isolated from CaCO-2, SW480, and C2C12 cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-NLK and NARF antibodies. Endogenous NARF was co-immunoprecipitated in these samples (Fig. 1C and data not shown). We conclude that NLK and NARF can form a complex in cells.NARF Exhibits Auto-ubiquitylating Activity Associated with E2-25K—Recent data indicate that numerous RING finger proteins can function as E3 ubiquitin-ligases. To determine whether NARF may interact with a partner protein(s) in the ubiquitylation system, we attempted to identify protein(s) that physiologically interact with NARF in mammalian cells. FLAG-tagged NARF (FLAG-NARF) was expressed in 293 cells, and NARF and associated proteins were recovered from cell extracts by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitated proteins were eluted with a FLAG peptide and digested with Lys-C endopeptidase. The cleaved fragments were directly analyzed and sequenced by nanoflow LC-MS/MS. A data base search of the peptide sequences obtained identified one of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, E2-25K, as a NARF-interacting protein (Table 1). The interaction between NARF and E2-25K was confirmed with transiently expressed HA-tagged E2-25K (HA-E2-25K) and FLAG-NARF in 293 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 3). To define whether NARF mediates ubiquitylation as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase, we performed an in vitro auto-ubiquitylation assay for NARF using E2-25K as an E2 conjugating enzyme. We generated a GST fusion with wild-type NARF (GST-NARF-WT), and incubated this with purified E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2-25K, and ubiquitin. Western blotting analysis showed that NARF was poly-ubiquitylated, as indicated by the appearance of a broad ladder detected with either anti-ubiquitin (Ub) antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8) or anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 21–24). GST-NARF-WT ubiquitylation levels increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8 and 21–24), and required the presence of E2-25K (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4 and 17–20). It is noteworthy that no GST-NARF-WT ubiquitylation was observed when the two conserved cysteine residues at 17 and 53 within the RING finger domain were replaced with alanine (GST-NARF-CA, Fig. 2B, lanes 13–16 and 29–32). To clarify whether E2-25K is an authentic E2-conjugating enzyme for NARF in the ubiquitylation process, we assayed GST-NARF-WT auto-ubiquitylation using a panel of E2-conjugating enzymes (E2-25K, E2-14K, UbcH3, UbcH5a, UbcH5b, UbcH5c, UbcH6, UbcH7, and UbcH10). Fig. 2C showed that auto-ubiquitylation of GST-NARF-WT occurred most robustly in the presence of E2-25K among the examined E2 enzymes, although other E2 enzymes also mediated weak ubiquitylation. These data show that the auto-ubiquitylating activity of NARF is coordinated with E2-25K, and that the RING finger domain of NARF is indispensable for this reaction.TABLE 1Identification of human E2-25K by LC-MSMSSequence determinedPeptideChargeResiduesm/zANIAVQRIK527.822-10IWHPNISSVTGAICLDILK713.1328-46IPETYPFNPPK651.8262-72IENLCAMGFDRNAVIVALSSK770.13115-135 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2NARF exhibits E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity in cooperation with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, E2-25K.

Here we demonstrate that the caveolar protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a Cdc42-binding protein in β-cells. Cav-1 associated with Cdc42-VAMP2-bound granules present near the plasma membrane under basal conditions. However, stimulation with glucose induced the dissociation of Cav-1 from Cdc42-VAMP2 complexes, coordinate with the timing of Cdc42 activation. Analyses of the Cav-1 scaffolding domain revealed a motif conserved in guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which suggested a novel role for Cav-1 as a Cdc42 GDI in β-cells. The novel role was further supported by: 1) in vitro binding analyses that demonstrated a direct interaction between Cav-1 and Cdc42; 2) GST-Cdc42 interaction assays showing preferential Cav-1 binding to GDP-Cdc42 over that of GTP-Cdc42; 3) Cav-1 depletion studies resulting in an inappropriate 40% induction of activated Cdc42 in the absence of stimuli and also a 40% increase in basal insulin release from both MIN6 cells and islets. Expression of wild-type Cav-1 in Cav-1-depleted cells restored basal level secretion to normal, whereas expression of a scaffolding domain mutant of Cav-1 failed to normalize secretion. Taken together, these data suggest that Cav-1 functions as a Cdc42 GDI in β-cells, maintaining Cdc42 in an inactive state and regulating basal secretion in the absence of stimuli.

Through its interaction with the Cdc42-VAMP2-bound insulin granule complex, Cav-1 may contribute to the specific targeting of granules to “active sites” of exocytosis organized by caveolae. Regulated insulin granule exocytosis is elicited by the fusion of a primed and readily releasable pool of plasma membranelocalized granules and through the mobilization and trafficking of intracellularly localized insulin granules (1Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Renstrom E. Gromada J. Barg S. Gopel S. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 72-77PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rhodes C.J. LeRoith T. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000Google Scholar). Granule fusion is initiated through the entry of glucose into the pancreatic β-cells via the GLUT2 glucose transporter, leading to elevation of the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio, which in turn closes the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels (3Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

Pflugers Arch. 1985; 404: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which culminates in fusion of insulin secretory granules from the multiple intracellular pools (6Prentki M.

Although this provides a mechanism for fusion of granules/vesicles with the plasma membrane, the upstream events required for targeting the granules/vesicles specifically to “active fusion sites” on the plasma membrane where their cognate t-SNAREs reside remains unclear. In addition, the mechanism that restricts fusion of granules near the plasma membrane in the absence of stimulus is not known. The small Rho family GTPase Cdc42 has been demonstrated to co-localize with VAMP2-bound insulin secretory granules in pancreatic β-cells (13Kowluru A. Metz S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Kowluru A. Seavey S.E. Li G. Sorenson R.L. Weinhaus A.J. Nesher R. Rabaglia M.E. Vadakekalam J. Metz S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 540-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and may function in targeting insulin-secretory granules to Syntaxin 1A fusion sites at the plasma membrane. Cdc42 is found bound directly to the NH2 terminus of VAMP2 under basal conditions. Stimulation by glucose triggers the activation of Cdc42, and activated Cdc42 bound to VAMP2 localizes insulin granules at the plasma membrane. Cdc42 binds indirectly to Syntaxin 1A (15Daniel S. Noda M. Cerione R.A. Sharp G.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9663-9671Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the interaction is bridged by VAMP2 to form a heteromeric complex (16Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The interactions among Cdc42 and the SNARE proteins are functionally important for SNARE-mediated insulin exocytosis (16Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as is the cycling of Cdc42 between its GDP- and GTP-bound conformations. However, although it is clear that glucose activates Cdc42 at a step proximal to or at KATP channel closure (17Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the precise regulatory proteins involved in this Cdc42 cycling pathway are unknown. Putative regulatory proteins to investigate would probably fall into three categories: 1) guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze nucleotide exchange and mediate activation; 2) GTPase-activating proteins, which stimulate GTP hydrolysis leading to inactivation; and 3) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which prevent interaction with the plasma membrane, exchange factors, and downstream effector proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 18Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar and 19Ridley A.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cdc42 has been reported to localize to caveolar domains at the plasma membrane (20Gingras D. Gauthier F. Lamy S. Desrosiers R.R. Beliveau R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, Syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 have been found “clustered” in highly active fusion centers by caveolae in neurosecretory PC12 cells (21Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Caveolae are microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (23Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar) located in the plasma membrane as well as in membranous vesicles residing close to the plasma membrane (24Palade G.E. Bruns R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 633-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These plasmalemmal organelles have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular functions, including vesicle transport and cell signaling (25Okamoto C.T. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 1998; 29: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolar clustering of SNARE proteins into “fusion centers” has been suggested to increase the efficiency of neurotransmitter secretion (21Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recently, studies have shown electron micrographs of islet β-cell membranes revealing caveolar structures that contain the protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1), suggesting that caveolae may also function in insulin exocytosis (26Lammert E. Gu G. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Brekken R. Murtaugh L.C. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Melton D.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1070-1074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Veluthakal R. Chvyrkova I. Tannous M. McDonald P. Amin R. Hadden T. Thurmond D.C. Quon M.J. Kowluru A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2576-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, there is also a significant proportion of Syntaxin 1A proteins outside of these caveolar domains (21Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggesting that the preferential targeting of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to caveolar-clustered “fusion centers” probably requires additional cues. Cav-1 appears to have potential as one of the “additional cues” to preferentially direct granules to Syntaxin 1A fusion sites within the caveolar clusters. A key protein of caveolae and plasmalemmal organelles, Cav-1 is a transmembrane protein present on caveolae that forms a hairpin-like structure with both the NH2 and COOH termini facing the cytoplasm (28Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Cav-1 directly binds cholesterol (29Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and forms homo- and heterooligomers (28Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 30Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 31Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Cav-1 contains an oligomerization domain, juxtaposed to a scaffolding domain, and it is the latter of these domains that participates in signal transduction events (32Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21605-21617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33Schlegel A. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Mehta P. Zhang X.L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Importantly, Cav-1 has been reported to associate with Cdc42 in other cell types, although the function of this interaction has not been evaluated. In this report, we present evidence to support a novel role for Cav-1 as a Cdc42 GDI and suggest that the Cav-1-Cdc42 association may provide a link between caveolar clustering of SNARE proteins in the plasma membrane and efficient targeting of VAMP2-bound insulin granules to plasma membrane Syntaxin 1A-based fusion centers clustered by caveolae. In support of a functional role for Cav-1 as a Cdc42 GDI, we show that 1) Cav-1 interacted preferentially with GDP-bound Cdc42 and that the interaction was direct; 2) Cav-1 bound to Cdc42 via a conserved GDI motif located within the Cav-1 scaffolding domain; 3) Cav-1 was required to maintain low levels of secretion and inactivation of Cdc42 in the absence of stimuli. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism whereby Cav-1 binds Cdc42-GDP under basal conditions and glucose stimulates the dissociation of the complex via GTP-loading of Cdc42 to facilitate regulated granule targeting to active fusion sites, ensuring that the appropriate interactions occur in an efficient spatial and temporal manner.

The pGEX-Cdc42 construct was a gift from Dr. Lawrence Quilliam (Indiana University School of Medicine).

The pSilencer-control construct was generated in an identical manner, using the following 19-nt sequence, which fails to match any known mammalian protein using BLAST (NCBI): GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG, as described (35Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C.

At 80–90% confluence, cells were electroporated with 40 μg of DNA as described previously (36Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

The interaction of GST-Cav-1 (FL) and GST-Cav-1-(1–101) with Cdc42 was performed as follows. Briefly, 10 μg of GST-Cav-1 (FL) and GST-Cav-1-(1–101) linked to Sepharose beads was incubated with 20 μm recombinant Cdc42 protein in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 2 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane for immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MIN6 cell lysates (3 mg) cleared in a lysis buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 60 mm n-octyl glucoside, a nonionic detergent for solubilizing membrane-bound proteins, were combined with 3 μg of rabbit anti-Cdc42, mouse anti-Cav-1, or mouse anti-VAMP2 antibody for 2 h at 4°C, followed by a second incubation with protein G Plus-agarose for 2 h. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Primary antibodies were used at 1:250–1000 dilutions, and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted at 1:5000 for visualization by ECL. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions were isolated as previously described (42Kowluru A. Seavey S.E. Rhodes C.J. Metz S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 cells at 70–80% confluence were washed with cold PBS and harvested into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (4 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm). Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle, and homogenates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5500 × g for 15 min, and the subsequent supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the secretory granule fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Highly purified plasma membrane fractions were obtained using a protocol by Hubbard et al. (43Hubbard A.L. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the postnuclear pellet from the initial 900 × g centrifugation was mixed with 1 ml of Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 2 volumes of Buffer B (2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was overlaid with Buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface containing the plasma membrane. The interface was collected and diluted to 2 ml with homogenization buffer for centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. Fractions were assayed for soluble protein content as described (44Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—MIN6 cells at 40% confluence plated onto glass coverslips were incubated in MKRBB for 2 h, followed by stimulation with 20 mm glucose, and then fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibody (1:100) for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with Texas Red secondary antibody (1:100) for 1 h. Cells were washed again in PBS and overlaid with Vectashield mounting medium, and coverslips were mounted onto slides for confocal fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. Images presented within a figure were captured using identical settings unless otherwise specified. Cdc42 Activation Assay and Immunoblotting—A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, corresponding to the p21-binding domain of p21-activated kinase (Pak1) was used to specifically detect and interact with the GTP form of Cdc42 in MIN6 cell plasma membrane fractions using the EZ-Detect Cdc42 activation kit from Pierce. Briefly, plasma membrane fractions were prepared from cells incubated in MRKBB buffer for 2 h at 37°C and stimulated with glucose for 3 min. Freshly made fractions (100 μg) were combined with 20 μg of PAK1 p21-binding domain-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the agarose beads and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to PVDF membrane. Membranes were immunoblotted with mouse anti-Cdc42 or rabbit anti-GST antibodies, and proteins were visualized by ECL. Adenoviral Transduction of Isolated Mouse Islets—Pancreatic mouse islets were isolated as previously described (35Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol.

We explored the effects of ouabain on glucose metabolism in human skeletal muscle cells (HSMC) and clarified the mechanisms of ouabain signal transduction. In HSMC, ouabain increased glycogen synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner reaching the maximum at 100 nm. The effect of ouabain was additive to the effect of insulin and was independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 but was abolished in the presence of a MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) or a Src inhibitor (PP2). Ouabain increased Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of α1- and α2-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase and promoted interaction of α1- and α2-subunits with Src, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation with Src. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and GSK3α/β, as well as p90rsk activity, was increased in response to ouabain in HSMC, and these responses were prevented in the presence of PD98059 and PP2. Incubation of HSMC with 100 nm ouabain increased phosphorylation of theα-subunits of the Na-pump at a MAPK-specific Thr-Pro motif. Ouabain treatment decreased the surface abundance of α2-subunit, whereas abundance of the α1-subunit was unchanged. Marinobufagenin, an endogenous vertebrate bufadienolide cardiotonic steroid, increased glycogen synthesis in HSMC at 10 nm concentration, similarly to 100 nm ouabain. In conclusion, ouabain and marinobufagenin stimulate glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. This effect is mediated by activation of a Src-, ERK1/2-, p90rsk-, and GSK3-dependent signaling pathway.

Ouabain is one of the cardiac glycosides (obtained from the seeds of Strophanthus gratus), which specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase, a plasma membrane cation pump, which is essential for maintenance of intracellular and extracellular sodium and potassium concentrations, cell volume, osmotic balance, and electrochemical gradients (1.Lingrel J. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Ewart H.S. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the cardiac glycosides of plant origin, the endogenous CTS were recently described as a new class of steroid hormones, endogenously produced in mammalian adrenal glands and central nervous system (3.Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2440-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Endogenous ouabain (EO) has been isolated as a stereoisomer of ouabain and identified as a constituent of human blood, bovine adrenal glands, and hypothalamus (3.Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2440-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 4.Kawamura A. Guo J. Itagaki Y. Bell C. Wang Y. Haupert Jr., G.T. Magil S. Gallagher R.T. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl.

Schaeffer J. Levinson P.D. Hamilton B.P. Kowarski A.A. Blaustein M.P. Nature. 1982; 300: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Bovine adrenal cortical cells in tissue culture release EO in response to norepinephrine, corticotropin, and angiotensin II (6.Bauer N. Muller-Ehmsen J. Kramer U. Hambarchian N. Zobel C.

Hypertension. 1997; 29: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later, another mammalian endogenous CTS, a bufadienolide marinobufagenin (MBG), was found in human urine and plasma (8.Bagrov A.Y. Fedorova O.V. Dmitrieva R.I. Howald W.N. Hunter A.P. Kuznetsova E.A. Shpen V.M. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9.Komiyama Y. Dong X.H. Nishimura N. Masaki H. Yoshika M. Masuda M. Takahashi H. Clin. Biochem. 2005; 38: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The plasma levels of MBG become elevated in several volume-expanded hypertensive states (10.Fridman A.I. Matveev S.A. Agalakova N.I. Fedorova O.V. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. J. Hypertens. 2002; 20: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11.Gonick H.C. Ding Y. Vaziri N.D. Bagrov A.Y. Fedorova O.V. Clin. Exp.

Hypertens. 1998; 20: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Importantly, exercise and stress cause an acute rise in the circulating levels of EO (12.Fedorova O.V. Anderson D.E. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R352-R358PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence from genetically engineered mice with modified cardiac glycoside binding affinity of the α1- and α2-subunits isoforms of the Na+,K+-ATPase indicate that the cardiac glycoside-binding site, which mediates the pharmacological effects of digitalis, is also the receptor for endogenous CTS (13.Dostanic-Larson I. Van Huysse J.W. Lorenz J.N. Lingrel J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15845-15850Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Digitalis drugs appear to promote cardiac hypertrophy (14.Cutilletta A.F. Rudnik M. Arcilla R.A. Straube R. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: H600-H604PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Pierdomenico S.D. Bucci A.

Similarly to other hypertrophic stimuli, ouabain regulates transcription of several hypertrophic marker genes in cardiac myocytes (16.Huang L. Li H. Xie Z. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17.Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that in addition to a role in ion transport function, Na+,K+-ATPase can sense low concentrations of ouabain and play an important role as a signal transducer (18.Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Binding of Src to Na+,K+-ATPase forms a functional signaling complex (19.Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.-Y. Xie Z.-J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, interaction of ouabain with the Na-pump causes activation of a Src, Ras/Raf, p42/44 MAPK signaling pathway, increases [Ca2+]i, generates reactive oxygen species in mitochondria, and activates protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (18.Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In renal cells Na+,K+-ATPase forms a cell signaling microdomain with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, which in the presence of ouabain, generates slow Ca2+ oscillations (20.Miyakawa-Naito A. Uhlen P. Lal M. Aizman O. Mikoshiba K. Brismar H. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50355-50361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, ouabain stimulates insulin-induced glycogen synthesis and decreases the production of CO2 in rat diaphragm (21.Clausen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 120: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms of ouabain signaling in skeletal muscle are unknown. Because skeletal muscle contains one of the largest pools of Na+,K+-ATPase in the body (22.Clausen T. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1996; 156: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the signal transduction effects mediated by ouabain in skeletal muscle may have a profound metabolic impact. However, the rodent α1-subunit isoform is resistant to ouabain (23.Sweadner K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 185-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentrations of ouabain used in experiments with rat muscles (21.Clausen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 120: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were much higher than concentrations of endogenous CTS observed under physiological conditions. Human α1- and α2-subunits exhibit relatively high affinity to ouabain (24.Crambert G. Schaer D. Roy S. Geering K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nanomolar concentrations of MBG bind to the human Na+,K+-ATPase, and in human vascular sarcolemma, which expresses α1-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase, MBG exhibits greater Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitory activity as compared with that of ouabain (25.Fedorova O.V. Dorofeeva N.A. Lopatin D.A. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, a study of the effect of ouabain and MBG on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle cells of human origin was of interest. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ouabain and MBG on glycogen synthesis in human skeletal muscles cells (HSMC) and to identify the mechanisms of CTS signal transduction. Antibodies and Reagents—Ouabain was obtained from Sigma. Marinobufagenin was purified from Bufo marinus toad venom, as described previously (26.Bagrov A.Y. Roukoyatkina N.I. Fedorova O.V. Pinaev A.G. Ukhanova M.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 234: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Insulin (Actrapid) was from Novo Nordisk (Denmark). MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone), c-Src inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-[4-chlorophenyl]-7-[t-butyl] pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine), and PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) were from Calbiochem.

Pressley (Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to p90rsk was a kind gift from Dr. D. Alessi (University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G was obtained from Bio-Rad. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and horseradish peroxidase-linked protein A were from Amersham Biosciences. Protein-L-agarose and protein G-Sepharose were from Sigma. Reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Streptavidin-agarose beads and EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin were from Pierce. Cross-tide (Gly-Arg-Pro-Arg-Thr-Ser-Ser-Phe-Ala-Glu-Gly) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Calbiochem) was used as a solvent for protein kinases inhibitors. All other reagents were of analytical grade (Sigma). Cell Culture—Human skeletal muscle satellite cells were isolated from muscle biopsies and cultured, as previously described (27.Al-Khalili L. Yu M. Chibalin A.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on passages 3 and 4. To initiate differentiation into myotubes, Ham's F-10 medium with 20% FBS was removed from cells, and DMEM containing 1% PeSt (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen)) and 4% FBS were added for 48 h. The medium was changed to DMEM containing 1% PeSt and 2% FBS. Fusion and multinucleation of the cells was observed at day 3 after initiation of the differentiation protocol. Glucose uptake in HSMC was measured, as previously described (28.Al-Khalili L. Chibalin A.V. Kannisto K. Zhang B.B. Permert J. Holman G.D. Ehrenborg E. Ding V.D. Zierath J.R. Krook A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Glucose Incorporation into Glycogen—Myoblasts were seeded 1500 cells/well in 6-well plates and differentiated at 70–80% confluence. Differentiated myotubes (5–7 days) were serum-starved (DMEM + 0% FBS) overnight prior to the experiment to reduce the basal level of insulin- and cytokine-dependent kinase activity. Cells were preincubated with 1) 22 μm PD98059, 20 μm PP2, 10 μm LY294002, or Me2SO for 20 min, then incubated with 100 nm ouabain for 10 min, and finally stimulated with 120 nm insulin for 20 min at 37 °C in 950 μl of serum-free DMEM; 2) cells were incubated with ouabain or marinobufagenin for 30 min; or 3) cells were preincubated with 22 μm PD98059, 20 μm PP2, 10 μm LY294002, or Me2SO for 20 min, and then ouabain, marinobufagenin, insulin or Me2SO were added. Thereafter, 50 μl of the isotope solution (d-[U-14C] glucose with 1 μCi/ml; final specific activity, 0.18 μCi/μmol in DMEM) was added, and the plates were incubated for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by placing the plates on ice. The medium was aspirated, and the wells were washed with ice-cold PBS three or four times. The plates were frozen directly after at –80 °C, or myotubes were solubilized with 1 ml 0.03% SDS for 1 h at room temperature. Aliquots (0.85 ml) of the suspension was transferred to 10-ml tubes, and 100 μl (2 mg) of carrier glycogen was added. The remained suspension was used for protein concentration determination. The samples were boiled for 30 min. A 3-ml solution of 98% ethanol was added to precipitate glycogen. Tubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with slight agitation and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. Pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol, samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, and ethanol was aspirated off. The pellet was solubilized in 200 μl of distilled H2O and transferred to 4-ml scintillation vials. Samples and aliquots of the media were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (1214 Rackbeta; Wallac, Turku, Finland). Measurement of Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ Uptake—The initial rate of ouabain- or marinobufagenin-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake through Na+,K+-ATPase of HSMC was measured as previously described (29.Al-Khalili L. Kotova O. Tsuchida H. Ehren I. Feraille E. Krook A. Chibalin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25211-25218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Uptake that was inhibited by 100 μm ouabain was taken as the maximal rate of active uptake. Western Blot Analysis—HSMC were lysed in 500 μl of homogenization buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4,5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm microcystin) on the rotation wheel at 4 °C during 1 h. Then samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was measured, using BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce). The samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 10% resolving gel). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with 7.5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C on a shaking platform. The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody or protein A conjugate with horseradish peroxidase. The proteins were visualized by ECL and quantified by densitometry. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates (500 μl) were incubated with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. After brief centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and immunoprecipitated with 1) antibodies to c-Src overnight at 4 °C and 2) antibodies to p-Tyr overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. HSM myotubes lysates (300 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with anti-phospho-Thr-Pro mouse IgM. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein-L-agarose beads. For immunoprecipitations, the beads were washed three times in homogenization buffer and twice in ice-cold PBS. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Myotubes (6 day) were preincubated in PBS in the absence or presence of 100 nm ouabain for 1 h and thereafter exposed to EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in PBS at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle shaking. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described (27.Al-Khalili L. Yu M. Chibalin A.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After streptavidin precipitation, the samples were analyzed by SDS/PAGE with subsequent Western blot with appropriate antibodies. p90rsk Activity Assay—Cultured myotubes treated with 100 nm ouabain for 2 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors PD98059 and PP2 were analyzed. Myotube lysates (100 μg of protein/sample) were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with anti-p90rsk antibody, previously equilibrated with protein G-Sepharose in homogenization buffer. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in homogenization buffer, containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% Brij-35, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 17 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 16.7 mm Mg(Ac)2, 50 μm cross-tide, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated on ice by the addition of sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 6 m urea, pH 6.8). Reaction products were resolved on a 40% acrylamide gel, and 32Pi incorporation into peptide substrate was analyzed by exposing gels to a phosphorimaging device (Fuji BAS-1800II). Statistics—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t test. Significance was established at p < 0.05. Effect of Ouabain on Glycogen Synthesis and Cell Signaling—HSMC were incubated with different concentrations of ouabain (10 nm, 100 nm, and 1 μm) to assess the effect of ouabain on glycogen synthesis. [U-14C]Glucose incorporation into glycogen was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner, with a significant increase (p < 0.05) from basal in the presence of 100 nm of ouabain, with no further change in the presence of increasing concentrations of ouabain (Fig. 1A). Muscle cells were exposed to ouabain for a 30-min incubation time to allow for measurable [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen. Ouabain (100 nm) caused a 16% statistically insignificant inhibition of total ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake (Fig. 1B) in human myotubes (inhibition of 86Rb+ uptake achieved at 100 μm of ouabain was considered as 100% of ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake). To identify the mechanisms of ouabain signal transduction toward glycogen synthesis in human skeletal muscle cells, we assess phosphorylation of an array of protein kinases previously implicated in ouabain-induced signal transduction (18.Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and regulation of glycogen synthesis (30.Nielsen J.N. Wojtaszewski J.F. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2004; 63: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Src, ERK1/2, p90rsk, and GSK3α/β increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to ouabain, reaching the maximum at 100 nm after a 30-min incubation, whereas phosphorylation of the stress-activated MAPKs, c-JNK and p38 was unchanged. Ouabain (100 nm) stimulates Src, ERK1/2, p90rsk, and GSK3 phosphorylation already after 15 min of incubation (data not shown). Notably, phosphorylation of Akt/PKB was unaffected by ouabain. PKCα/β phosphorylation was slightly decreased in the presence of 100 nm or higher concentration of ouabain (Fig. 1C). Because ouabain inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase may lead to local changes in ATP concentrations and an increase in [Ca2+]i, we assessed also phosphorylation of AMPK and CaMKII in response to ouabain. AMPK and CaMKII phosphorylation was unchanged in response to ouabain. Thus, in HSMC ouabain, in concentrations that are unable to significantly decrease Na-pump activity, stimulates glycogen synthesis, activates c-Src, ERK1/2-p90rsk, and leads to phosphorylation of GSK3α/β. Based on the results, ouabain at a concentration of 100 nm was used for stimulation of human muscle cells studying subsequent experiments. Ouabain Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase and Enhances Src Interaction with Na+,K+-ATPase α-Subunits—To further investigate whether Src interacts with Na+,K+-ATPase to form a signaling complex, whether Src activation by ouabain promotes phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase, and whether the phosphorylation by Src or ERK1/2 is important for the complex formation, we incubated HSMC with 100 nm ouabain in the absence and presence of 120 nm insulin and inhibitors of Src (PP2) and MEK1/2 (PD98059). We assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of Na-pump α-subunits by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and performed subsequent Western blot analysis with antibodies against α1- and α2-subunits. As expected, insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of α1- and α2-subunits (Fig. 2, A and B). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of the α1- and α2-subunits was dramatically increased by ouabain, additively to the effect of insulin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits was completely blocked by the inhibition of Src (PP2) and was unaffected by inhibition of MEK1/2 (PD98059) (Fig. 2, A and B). To assess interaction of Src with Na+,K+-ATPase, we immunoprecipitated Src from cell lysates and analyzed co-precipitated Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits by Western blot. The amount of immunoprecipitated Src was unaffected by conditions during cell stimulation (data not shown). α1- and α2-subunits were co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src at the basal, unstimulated condition. Insulin increased the amount of α-subunits co-immunoprecipitated with Src (Fig. 2, C and D). Co-immunoprecipitation of the α1- and α2-subunits of the Na-pump with Src was markedly increased after stimulation with ouabain, in the absence or presence of insulin. This effect of ouabain was diminished by PP2 and was unaffected by PD98059. Taken together, these findings suggest that ouabain stimulates Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and facilitates complex formation of Na+,K+-ATPase with Src. The Na+,K+-ATPase-Src interaction partially depends on tyrosine phosphorylation of the pump α-subunits. Ouabain-stimulated Signal Transduction toward Glycogen Synthesis—Stimulation of HSMC with ouabain leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of GSK3 (Ser21 of GSK3α and Ser9 of GSK3β) (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 promotes the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase (31.Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, ouabain stimulates glycogen synthesis in HSMC without stimulation of Akt, a known kinase for GSK3 in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1, A and D). The PI 3-kinase-Akt/PKB signaling pathway is the major pathway regulating glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. To test the involvement of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, we studied the effect of ouabain on glycogen synthesis in the presence or absence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. As expected, LY294002 decreased basal and completely blocked insulin-stimulated [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen (Fig. 3A). Incubation with ouabain stimulated glycogen synthesis additively to insulin. Importantly, LY294002 inhibited only the insulin-stimulated component of this additive effect (Fig. 3A). Basal and insulin-stimulated Akt/PKB (Ser473) phosphorylation was unaffected by ouabain (Fig. 3B). Incubation of HSMC with 100 nm ouabain did not affect glucose uptake under basal (7.03 ± 0.83 versus 6.79 ± 1.0 pmol × mg of protein–1 × min–1) or insulin-stimulated (13.61 ± 1.08 versus 13.04 ± 0.96 pmol × mg of protein–1 × min–1) conditions. These findings suggest that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is not involved in ouabain-induced stimulation of glycogen synthesis in HSMC. GSK3 can also be phosphorylated by a downstream kinase of classical MAPK cascade, p90rsk (MAPKAP-K1) (30.Nielsen J.N. Wojtaszewski J.F. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2004; 63: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which is phosphorylated by ERK1/2. In HSMC, insulin increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation and p90rsk activity. The effect of insulin was abolished by the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and was unaffected by the Src inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Additional stimulation with ouabain leads to an increase in basal and insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and p90rsk activity (Fig. 4, A and B). The effect of ouabain on MAPK activation was additive to the effect of insulin. Preincubation of insulin- and/or ouabain stimulated myotubes with PD98059 abolished all stimulatory effects, whereas incubation with PP2 restored ERK1/2 phosphorylation and p90rsk activity to levels achieved without ouabain. These results indicate that in HSMC, p90rsk can be activated by insulin or, independently and additively to insulin, by ouabain via c-Src stimulation. As expected, insulin stimulates GSK3 phosphorylation and increases [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen. PD98059 and PP2 had no effect on GSK3 phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig. 4, C and D). Ouabain (100 nm) profoundly stimulated GSK3 phosphorylation and increased [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, and this effect was additive to the effect of insulin. The effect of ouabain on GSK3 phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis was abolished by PD98059 and PP2 (Fig. 4D). Our findings provide evidence to suggest that in human differentiated myotubes, glycogen synthesis can be activated by insulin via PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway or independently to insulin action by ouabain via PI 3-kinase-independent, Src-activated MAPK signaling cascade. Effect of Marinobufagenin on HSMC—To evaluate the physiological significance of ouabain-induced stimulation of glycogen synthesis in HSMC, it was of interest to compare the effect of ouabain with an effect of an endogenous CTS. Human myotubes were incubated with an endogenous bufadienolide, MBG. MBG (1 nm) insignificantly (17% above control) increased glycogen synthesis, whereas 10 nm MBG stimulated [U-14C]glucose inc"

Factors regulating the synthesis of d-serine have implications for the NMDA receptor transmission, but little is known on the signals and events affecting serine racemase levels. We found that serine racemase interacts with the Golgin subfamily A member 3 (Golga3) protein in yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction was confirmed in vitro with the recombinant proteins in co-transfected HEK293 cells and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation studies from brain homogenates. Golga3 and serine racemase co-localized at the cytosol, perinuclear Golgi region, and neuronal and glial cell processes in primary cultures. Golga3 significantly increased serine racemase steady-state levels in co-transfected HEK293 cells and primary astrocyte cultures. This observation led us to investigate mechanisms regulating serine racemase levels. We found that serine racemase is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasomal system in a Golga3-modulated manner. Golga3 decreased the ubiquitylation of serine racemase both in vitro and in vivo and significantly increased the protein half-life in pulse-chase experiments. Our results suggest that the ubiquitin system is a main regulator of serine racemase and d-serine levels.

Parsons A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 597-664PubMed Google Scholar). NMDA receptor activity is tightly regulated, as its overactivation contributes to pathologic conditions such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases (2.Choi D.W. Rothman S.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of NMDA receptors is the requirement of simultaneous binding of two agonists for channel opening, i.e. the NMDA channel only operates when both a glutamate site and a coagonist site are occupied (1.Danysz W. Parsons A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 597-664PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that binding of glycine to the co-agonist site is an obligatory requirement for NMDA receptor/channel operation (3.Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 4.Kleckner N.W. Dingledine R. Science. 1988; 241: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that brain d-serine is an endogenous ligand of the glycine site of NMDA receptors (5.Wolosker H. Panizzutti R. De Miranda J. Neurochem.

Regulation of NMDA receptor activity by the co-agonist d-serine plays critical roles. Removal of endogenous d-serine decreases NMDA receptor responses (8.Mothet J.P. Parent A.T. Wolosker H. Brady Jr., R.O. Linden D.J. Ferris C.D. Rogawski M.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and blocks NMDA-dependent migration of immature granule cells in the cerebellum (9.Kim P.M. Aizawa H. Kim P.S. Huang A.S. Wickramasinghe S.R. Kashani A.H. Barrow R.K. Huganir R.L. Ghosh A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). d-Serine is the dominant endogenous co-agonist for NMDA neurotoxicity, as removal of d-serine abolishes NMDA receptor-elicited cell death in hippocampal slices (6.Shleper M. Kartvelishvily E. Wolosker H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9413-9417Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the vertebrate retina, endogenous d-serine mediates the light-dependent increase in neuronal activity by activating NMDA receptors (10.Stevens E.R. Esguerra M. Kim P.M. Newman E.A. Snyder S.H. Zahs K.R. Miller R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6789-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endogenous d-serine is required for the long term potentiation of the synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, which is thought to be involved in the memory formation (11.Yang Y. Ge W. Chen Y. Zhang Z. Shen W. Wu C. Poo M. Duan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15194-15199Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Brain d-serine is synthesized by the serine racemase enzyme, which converts l- into d-serine (12.Wolosker H. Sheth K.N. Takahashi M. Mothet J.P. Brady Jr., R.O. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The enzyme occurs in glia (13.Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and more recently was demonstrated in neurons (15.Kartvelishvily E. Shleper M. Balan L. Dumin E. Wolosker H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14151-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For its activity, serine racemase requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, ATP, and magnesium as cofactors (16.De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition to converting l- to d-serine, serine racemase catalyzes the α,β-elimination of water from l-serine to form pyruvate and ammonia (16.De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This activity was also observed toward d-serine, which seems to limit the achievable d-serine concentration and may play a role in d-serine metabolism as well (17.Foltyn V.N. Bendikov I. De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Dumin E. Shleper M. Li P. Toney M.D. Kartvelishvily E. Wolosker H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1754-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Despite the important roles proposed for the endogenous d-serine, little is known about the regulation of its synthesis by serine racemase. Factors altering serine racemase levels will have an impact on NMDA receptor activity, since the d-serine binding site of the receptor is not saturated under normal conditions (1.Danysz W. Parsons A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 597-664PubMed Google Scholar) and serine racemase is key for d-serine homeostasis (5.Wolosker H. Panizzutti R. De Miranda J. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13.Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to look for proteins that bind and regulate serine racemase using the yeast two-hybrid technique. We discovered that Golga3, also known as GCP170 (18.Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or golgin-160 (19.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K. J. Exp.

We found that serine racemase is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that Golga3 greatly increases serine racemase levels by decreasing its ubiquitylation and degradation rate. Our data disclose new mechanisms modulating d-serine production, with implications for the regulation of NMDA receptors. Materials—l-Serine and d-serine were purchased from Bachem.

Worley, Johns Hopkins University). Positive interactors were identified by their ability to grow on selective plates (Trp−, Leu−, His−) and activate the transcription of the reporter gene, β-galactosidase. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For transfection, cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at 70-90% confluence. On the next day cells were transfected with mouse full-length serine racemase in pRK5 containing HA in the N terminus (13.Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The beads were washed 5 times with the same buffer supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl, and bound material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Then 0.1% Triton X-100 was added, and the cell extract was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with Myc affinity matrix (Covance), and the immunoprecipitates were washed 6 times with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl. The blots were probed with monoclonal anti-HA (1:2000) of polyclonal anti-Myc (1:2000).

The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation (40,000 × g) for 40 min). Ten microgram of purified antibodies to serine racemase and glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (23.Wolosker H. Kline D. Bian Y.

After washing 7 times with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl, the immunoprecipitates were revealed with anti-GCP170 (Golga3) polyclonal antibody generated by Misumi et al.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min to give P1 (crude nuclear pellet) and S1 (supernatant). S1 was centrifuged at 9200 × g for 15 min to give P2 (crude synaptosomal/mitochondrial pellet) and S2. P3 (microsomal pellet) and S3 (cytosolic fraction) were obtained by centrifuging S2 at 120,000 × g for 1 h. P3 washed (washed microsomal pellet) was obtained by washing the P3 membranes in 50 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.3 m NaCl to remove loosely bound proteins. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, and probed with antibodies anti-Golga3 (1:1000-1:2000), anti-SR serum (1:5000), and anti GM130 (1:2500). Enzyme Markers—Lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined by monitoring the conversion of pyruvate to lactate coupled to oxidation of NADH (26.Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 75-78Google Scholar). Fumarase activity was determined by monitoring the conversion of malate into fumarate by a photometric assay (26.Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 75-78Google Scholar). Primary Cell Cultures—Animals were killed by quick decapitation with the approval of the Committee for the Supervision of Animal Experiments (Technion-Israel Institute of Technology). Neuronal cultures from cerebral cortex were prepared from E16-E18 Sprague-Dawley embryos as previously described (27.Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Nearly pure glial cultures were prepared from post-natal day 3 rat pups using Basal Medium Eagle containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were vigorously washed with Hanks'-buffered saline solution 4-5 times every 2 days to dislodge neuronal cells and microglia. Glial cultures were used 10-14 days after plating. Assay of d-Serine Synthesis—HEK293-transfected cells were incubated in 6-well plates with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. d-Serine was measured in the culture medium by high performance liquid chromatography as previously described (16.De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry Assays—Primary neural culture cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cells were blocked and permeabilized with 8% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl). Primary antibody incubation was carried out for 12-16 h at 4 °C with the polyclonal antibody to serine racemase (Ab2, 0.3 μg/ml) previously characterized (15.Kartvelishvily E. Shleper M. Balan L. Dumin E. Wolosker H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14151-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-GM130 (1:200, BD Biosciences), and serum anti-GCP170 (Golga3) (1:150). Immunolabeling was detected by using Cy2- and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). For double-labeling with polyclonal antibodies (serine racemase and Golga3), serine racemase was first labeled using Cy3-conjugated anti-Fab fragment anti-rabbit IgG that blocks all the primary antibody sites. Then rabbit anti-GCP170 (Golga3) was added followed by Cy-2-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Co-localization was analyzed by confocal laser microscopy. Lentivirus Production—N-terminal HA-tagged Golga3 (455-888 fragment) was subcloned into pTK208 lentiviral vector (a gift from Dr. T. Kafri, Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) containing cytomegalovirus promoter. The virus was produced by calcium-mediated co-transfection of the lentiviral vector (5 μg), packing vector pCMV-dR8.74 (3 μg), and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein envelope pMD2G (2 μg) (a gift from Prof. D. Trono, University of Geneva) in HEK293 cells grown in 10-mm culture dishes (29.Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Control virus consisted of GFP under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. Viral stocks were produced by concentrating the viral particles present in the culture medium by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet was washed once by centrifugation with fresh culture medium and suspended in a small volume of basal medium Eagle culture medium. The viruses were stored at -70 °C until use. Virus titer was determined by infecting HEK293 cells and monitoring the immunofluorescence for GFP or immunocytochemistry for HA-Golga3 (455-880) with anti-HA antibody. To infect primary astrocyte cultures, viral stocks were added to cultured cells grown in 24-well plates, and the medium was replaced after 48 h. The experiments were carried out 5 days after infection under conditions that virtually all cells had been infected. In Vitro Ubiquitylation—Mouse full-length serine racemase was translated in vitro by the use of Wheat germ extract in vitro translation system (Promega) and [H3]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro ubiquitylation, 1 μl of the translated protein was incubated with 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2,1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 0.6 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), 2 mm ATPγS (Sigma), and 4 mg/ml transfected HEK293 extract for 60 min at 37 °C. Controls were carried out by omitting ATPγS and removing endogenous ATP with 20 mm deoxyglucose and 240 units/ml of hexoquinase (Sigma). The ubiquitin-protein conjugates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging analysis. For producing HEK293 cell extracts, the cells were transfected with Golga3-Myc in pCDNA 3.1 using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed by 2 freeze/thaw cycles in liquid N2 in medium containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, deoxyribonuclease I (10 units/ml), 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μm MG132, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and chymostatin. The suspension was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 40 min and frozen in aliquots at -70 °C. In Vivo Ubiquitylation—HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-ubiquitin, HA-serine racemase (HA-SR) and either GFP-pRK5 or Golga3-Myc in pcDNA3.1. Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were incubated with 30 μm MG132 for 5 h. Stringent immunoprecipitation conditions were carried out as previously described (30.Hershko A. Eytan E. Ciechanover A. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13964-13970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in medium containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics), and the samples were immediately boiled for 5 min. Then the samples were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min and diluted 10-fold into buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. After additional centrifugation to remove any insoluble material, immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-HA affinity-matrix and washed 6 times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Then the ubiquitin-serine racemase conjugates were revealed with polyclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma). Pulse-chase Experiments—HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-SR and either Golga3-Myc or GFP at a SR/Golga3 cDNA ratios of 1:5 to 1:9. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine/cysteine (Sigma) for 1 h. Then the cells were pulsed with methionine/cysteine-free medium containing 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 70 min and subsequently chased in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At the specified times, the cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 30 μm MG132, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitation of HA-serine racemase was carried out with anti-HA affinity matrix (Covance), and the immunoprecipitates were washed six times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The samples were resolved on SDS, 10% PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. The amount of immunoprecipitated HA-serine racemase was checked by Western blot of the membrane followed by densitometry of the chemiluminescent signal. SR Interacts with Golga3—We identified Golga3 protein as a novel interactor of serine racemase in yeast two-hybrid screenings (Fig. 1A). Two independent clones of Golga3 were identified in screenings of different libraries and encompass the amino acid regions 455-880 and 180-665 (Fig. 1B). Golga3 associates with the cytosolic surface of the Golgi apparatus, where it may be involved in vesicular trafficking (31.Ohta E. Misumi Y. Sohda M. Fujiwara T. Yano A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51957-51967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32.Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28944-28951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence indicates that the interacting region of Golga3 (amino acids 455-665) is predicted to adopt a coiled-coil conformation (Fig. 1B, shaded boxes). The interaction of Golga3 fragments with serine racemase in yeast was specific, as Golga3-transformed cells did not grow on selective plates when co-transformed with empty vector pPC97 (Fig. 1A). Also, mouse serine racemase did not activate the reporter gene when co-transformed with empty pPC86 vector (Fig. 1A). As a positive control, we observed that co-transformation of fos and jun strongly activated β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 1A). We further mapped the interacting region of serine racemase using yeast two-hybrid (Fig. 1C). As control, we used glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (Grip) fragment, previously shown to interact with the C terminus of serine racemase (9.Kim P.M. Aizawa H. Kim P.S. Huang A.S. Wickramasinghe S.R. Kashani A.H. Barrow R.K. Huganir R.L. Ghosh A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Contrasting to glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1, we found that Golga3 binds to the first 66 amino acids of the N-terminal region of serine racemase (Fig. 1C). To confirm the interaction, we carried out GST binding assays. Full-length Golga3 construct containing a C-terminal Myc tag (20.Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was transfected into HEK293 cells, and the cell extract was incubated with beads containing GST-serine racemase (GST-SR) or GST alone. Golga3-Myc bound to GST-SR but not to GST alone (Fig. 1D). The interaction of Golga3 with serine racemase was also confirmed in intact cells by co-transfecting HA-serine racemase (HA-SR) with Golga3-Myc (full-length and 455-880 fragment) or Myc-LacZ control cDNA in HEK293 cells. The Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc, and the blot was probed with anti-HA. Serine racemase robustly co-immunoprecipitated with Golga3 constructs but not with LacZ (Fig. 1E). To verify that the proteins interact in vivo, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain extracts. Beads coupled with purified antibody to serine racemase specifically co-immunoprecipitated Golga3 (Fig. 1F, upper panel). To ensure specific binding, the immunoprecipitates were washed with high salt buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl. Furthermore, beads coupled with an antibody against the unrelated protein glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase did not co-immunoprecipitate Golga3 (Fig. 1F, upper panel). This suggests that Golga3 and serine racemase specifically interact in vivo. Subcellular Distribution of SR and Golga3—In case the interaction is physiologically relevant, serine racemase and Golga3 should display overlapping localizations. We first examined the subcellular localizations of endogenous Golga3 and serine racemase in brain extracts. In the brain we detected enrichment of Golga3 in high speed membrane fraction (P3) (Fig. 2A). A significant fraction of Golga3 remained bound to the membrane even after washing with buffer containing high salt (P3 washed), indicating a strong interaction with membranes (Fig. 2A). It is note-worthy that significant levels of Golga3 were also found in the cytosolic fraction of brain (Fig. 2A). Some bands of smaller molecular weight are also seen in the cytosolic fraction. This may be related to the previously described partial cleavage of Golga3 that releases it from the Golgi membrane (20.Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33.Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Serine racemase was also observed in both soluble and membrane fractions of the brain (Fig. 2B). Although most serine racemase is cytosolic, a portion of serine racemase protein is present in the microsomal fraction (P3) of brain (Fig. 2B). Association of serine racemase to the membrane fraction is strong, since washing the membranes with high salt solution did not remove the membrane-bound enzyme (Fig. 2B, compare P3 with washed P3). We found that the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130 is highly enriched in P3 and washed P3 fraction, whereas only trace levels were found in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2C). This indicates that Golgi membrane fragments are enriched in P3 fraction and that our cytosolic fraction is mo"
https://openalex.org/W1973111659,"Oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors is commonly observed, but the functional significance of oligomerization for this diverse family of receptors remains poorly understood. We used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to examine oligomerization of Ste2p, a G protein-coupled receptor that serves as the receptor for the α-mating pheromone in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, under conditions where the functional effects of oligomerization could be examined. Consistent with previous results from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (Overton, M. C., and Blumer, K. J. (2000) Curr. Biol. 10, 341–344), we detected efficient energy transfer between Renilla luciferase and a modified green fluorescent protein individually fused to truncated α-factor receptors lacking the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. In addition, the low background of the BRET system allowed detection of significant, but less efficient, energy transfer between full-length receptors. The reduced efficiency of energy transfer between full-length receptors does not appear to result from different levels of receptor expression. Instead, attachment of fluorescent reporter proteins to the full-length receptors appears to significantly increase the distance between reporters. Mutations that were previously reported to block dimerization of truncated α-factor receptors reduce but do not completely eliminate BRET transfer between receptors. Dominant negative effects of mutant alleles of α-factor receptors appear to be mediated by receptor oligomerization since these effects are abrogated by introduction of additional mutations that reduce oligomerization. We find that heterodimers of normal and dominant negative receptors are defective in their ability to signal. Thus, signal transduction by oligomeric receptors appears to be a cooperative process requiring an interaction between functional monomers.

All GPCRs are transmembrane proteins consisting of an extracellular N-terminal domain, seven transmembrane α-helical segments, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. A large body of evidence indicates that GPCRs form homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric complexes in cells (2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Although the implications of oligomerization for receptor function remain poorly understood, in some cases oligomerization is capable of affecting biogenesis and membrane targeting of receptors (6Margeta-Mitrovic M.

In addition, cooperation between different monomers appears to be responsible for mediating or modulating the signaling function of some GPCRs (8Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y.

Because detection of nonradiative energy transfer between fluorescent or bioluminescent probes provides an assay for oligomerization that can be readily performed with proteins in cells or in membrane fractions, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) have been used to monitor homo- and hetero-oligomerization of GPCRs (1Overton M.C.

The MATa and MATα haploid cell types of S. cerevisiae secrete the peptide mating pheromones a-factor and α-factor, respectively. Upon binding α-factor, the α-factor receptor expressed on the surface of MATa cells causes exchange of GTP for GDP on a cytoplasmic heterotrimeric G protein. Release of the Gβγ subunits, encoded by the STE4 and STE18 genes, from the GTP-bound Gα subunit, encoded by the GPA1 gene, leads to activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. This results in cell cycle arrest, transcriptional activation of many genes, and other physiological responses that prepare cells for mating.In a number of situations in different cell types, expression of one type of receptor or a mutant form of a receptor can affect signaling by a different type of receptor allele co-expressed in the same cell type (21Lavoie C.

Martin N.P. Akal-Strader A. Becker J.M. Naider F. Dumont M.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6898-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both receptor oligomerization and competition for access to a substoichiometric amount of G protein have been proposed as explanations for these dominant effects (1Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr.

Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 799-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), to date there has been no direct demonstration of co-oligomerization of normal and dominant negative alleles or of normal and constitutive alleles in cells. Thus, the role of oligomerization in explaining the dominant effects of STE2 alleles has not been established. In fact, the question of whether the association of GPCRs into oligomers has a direct role in signaling function remains unresolved in most GPCR systems. A major barrier to determining the functional role of oligomerization in the yeast system is that it has only previously been possible to detect FRET transfer between truncated receptors lacking C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (1Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), whereas removal of the tails diminishes or eliminates dominant negative effects of mutant receptors (28Dosil M.

Removal of the tail from normal receptors does not interfere with signaling and, in fact, enhances sensitivity to pheromone (29Konopka J.B. Jenness D.D. Hartwell L.H.

Full-length receptors exhibit a decrease in energy transfer efficiency compared with C-terminal-truncated receptors that can be explained by increased distance between C termini of full-length receptors. The ability to detect oligomerization of full-length receptors made it possible to demonstrate co-oligomerization of dominant negative and normal receptor alleles. Dominant negative behavior of mutant receptors appears to stem from an inability to signal on the part of normal receptors that co-oligomerize with defective receptors. In agreement with a growing literature from other systems (31Chinault S.L. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol.

Strain A232 (25Leavitt L.M. Macaluso C.R. Kim K.S. Martin N.P. Dumont M.E. Mol. Gen.

To reduce intracellular proteolysis of fusion proteins, the S. cerevisiae strain A3102 (MATa pep4-3 his4-580 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 ste2-Δ) carrying a deletion of the proteinase A gene, PEP4, was used for most energy transfer assays with full-length Ste2p receptors. To create A3102, A3087 (MATa pep4-3 his4-580 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112) (34Gelperin D.M. White M.A. Wilkinson M.L. Kon Y. Kung L.A. Wise K.J. Lopez-Hoyo N. Jiang L. Piccirillo S. Yu H. Gerstein M.

Macaluso C.R. Kim K.S. Martin N.P. Dumont M.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 917-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As an initial step toward creating the fusions, plasmid pMD1003 was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide ON504 (sequences of oligonucleotides are available upon request) to introduce an XhoI site 3′ to the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the C-terminal of the STE2 gene in pMD240. C-terminal-truncated alleles of Ste2p were derived from plasmid pMD626 described previously (37Martin N.P. Leavitt L.M. Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 682-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) containing residues 1–304 of the receptor. Plasmid pMD803 was created via KpnI and SacI digest of pMD626 and insertion into pMD240 to create a c-Myc-tagged truncated Ste2p receptor. An NheI-SacI fragment of pMD626 containing the C-terminal region of the truncated receptor was also ligated into NheI- and SphI-digested pMD240 to create pMD985. An XhoI site was also introduced into pMD985 immediately 3′ to a c-Myc epitope tag by site-directed mutagenesis using ON512, creating plasmid pMD1055. All plasmids constructed from pMD985 contain a Cys-252 → Ser mutation that does not affect receptor function (38Bajaj A. Celic A. Ding F.X. Naider F. Becker J.M. Dumont M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13564-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).GFP2 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides ON591 and ON592 and using plasmid pGFP2:Rluc(h)™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a template. Rluc was amplified from the same template using oligonucleotides ON616 and ON617. In each case, the primers added SalI sites flanking the protein reading frame. The PCR products were cloned into pCR®-Blunt II® TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) to generate pMD1120 and pMD1121 containing GFP2 and Rluc, respectively. The BRET proteins were excised from these plasmids using SalI and inserted into the compatible XhoI site that had been introduced into full-length Ste2p in pMD1003, creating plasmid pMD1132 (containing GFP2) and pMD1133 (containing Rluc). Fusions to truncated Ste2p were created similarly by inserting into XhoI-cut pMD1055, creating plasmids pMD1134 (containing GFP2) and pMD1135 (containing Rluc). All Rluc constructs were also subcloned into vectors containing auxotrophic LEU2 markers to allow co-expression in strains. SacI-SphI fragments containing STE2-Rluc fusions were ligated into the multicopy LEU2 vector pMD107 (YEplac181) (39Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) to generate pMD1137 (Ste2p-Rluc) and pMD1139 (truncated Ste2p-Rluc). Epitope tags were removed from Rluc and GFP2 constructs by digesting with NotI and re-ligating to generate pMD1167 (Ste2p-GFP2), pMD1168 (Ste2p-Rluc), pMD1154 (truncated Ste2p-GFP2), and pMD1155 (truncated Ste2p-Rluc).To allow expression of BRET fusions at lower levels, they were also transferred to CEN (centromere-containing) plasmids (see Table 1). Plasmid pMD149 (25Leavitt L.M. Macaluso C.R. Kim K.S. Martin N.P. Dumont M.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 917-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was digested with SacI and SphI so that the STE2 that was originally present could be replaced by a SacI-SphI fragment from pMD1154 to generate pMD1198 containing truncated Ste2p-GFP2. A SacI-SphI-cut insert from pMD1167 was then ligated into pMD1198 to generate pMD1242, containing Ste2p-GFP2. An EcoRI-SphI-cut insert from pMD1155 was ligated into pMD836, YCplac111 (39Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar), to generate pMD1199 containing truncated Ste2p-Rluc. Also, an EcoRI-SphI-cut insert from pMD1168 was ligated into pMD836 to generate pMD1232, containing Ste2p-Rluc.An internal XhoI site for fusion of BRET reporters internally into the STE2 ORF was introduced by PCR amplification of the C-terminal region of a wild type STE2 from pMD240 with ON786 that introduces an XhoI site immediately 3′ to an NsiI site in the STE2 gene and ON787. The PCR product was digested with BsrGI and NsiI and subcloned into similarly cleaved pMD149 to generate pMD1203. Plasmid pMD1203 was then digested with SacI and SphI and subcloned into both pMD107 and pMD240 to produce pMD1206 (LEU2) and pMD1207 (URA3), respectively. GFP2 and Rluc were inserted into the introduced XhoI sites in these plasmids as described above, except that they were amplified using 3′ primers ON802 and ON803, respectively, which removed their endogenous termination codons. Rluc was inserted into XhoI-cut pMD1206 to produce pMD1212, whereas GFP2 was inserted into XhoI-cut pMD1207 to produce pMD1211.In some constructs the C-terminal tail (residues 305–431) of Ste2p was replaced by an unrelated C-terminal tag containing His6 and ZZ domains derived from a vector used for the yeast MORF expression library (34Gelperin D.M. White M.A. Wilkinson M.L. Kon Y. Kung L.A. Wise K.J. Lopez-Hoyo N. Jiang L. Piccirillo S. Yu H. Gerstein M. Dumont M.E. Phizicky E.M. Snyder M. Grayhack E.J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To create constructs in which the BRET reporters were internally fused between the STE2 gene and this exogenous tail, the tag region extending from the His6 tag to exactly 400 bp 3′ of the stop codon derived from BG1805 (provided by Elizabeth Grayhack) was amplified using primers ON823 and ON824, adding flanking XhoI and SacI sites. The XhoI- and SacI-digested PCR product was ligated into XhoI-SacI-cut pMD1203 to generate pMD1260. The STE2-containing SacI-SphI fragment of this plasmid was ligated into similarly cut pMD107 to create the LEU2 plasmid pMD1264. GFP2 and Rluc were introduced into pMD1260 and pMD1264 via XhoI/SalI fusions to generate pMD1265 and pMD1266, respectively. Plasmid pMD1265 was digested with SacI and SphI and subcloned into SacI-SphI-cut pMD240 to create pMD1308 (URA3).To insert the MORF C-terminal tag region in place of the C-terminal tail of Ste2p in STE2-Rluc and STE2-GFP2 fusions, PCR was performed on vector BG1805 using primers ON825 and ON826 to introduce NotI sites flanking the His6 to ZZ domain region of the MORF library tag region. The PCR product was digested with NotI and ligated into the NotI-cut pMD1154 and pMD1155 to produce pMD1261 (GFP2) and pMD1262 (Rluc), respectively.A fusion of Pma1p to Rluc was generated by PCR amplifying exactly 900 bp upstream of PMA1 through the entire ORF from genomic yeast DNA derived from strain A230 using primers ON788 containing an SphI site and ON789 containing a NotI site. The PCR product was digested with SphI and NotI and subcloned into pMD1155 replacing the STE2 ORF with PMA1 to create pMD1209.A fusion of GFP2 and Rluc that could be expressed in yeast was created by PCR amplification of the insert from the pGFP2: Rluc(h)™ positive control construct (PerkinElmer) using primers ON618 and ON619 that flank GFP2-Rluc with AttB sites for Gateway® λ recombinational cloning (Invitrogen). The two-step reaction for cloning into destination vector BG1805 for expression under GAL control was conducted as described by Gelperin et al. (34Gelperin D.M. White M.A. Wilkinson M.L. Kon Y.

https://openalex.org/W1992380920,"A large number of faint galaxies, born less than a billion years after the big bang, have recently been discovered. The fluctuations in the distribution of these galaxies contributed to a scatter in the ionization fraction of cosmic hydrogen on scales of tens of Mpc, as observed along the lines of sight to the earliest known quasars. Theoretical simulations predict that the formation of dwarf galaxies should have been suppressed after cosmic hydrogen was reionized, leading to a drop in the cosmic star formation rate. Here we present evidence for this suppression. We show that the post-reionization galaxies which produced most of the ionizing radiation at a redshift z~5.5, must have had a mass in excess of ~10^{10.6+/-0.4} solar masses or else the aforementioned scatter would have been smaller than observed. This limiting mass is two orders of magnitude larger than the galaxy mass that is thought to have dominated the reionization of cosmic hydrogen (~10^8 solar masses). We predict that future surveys with space-based infrared telescopes will detect a population of smaller galaxies that reionized the Universe at an earlier time, prior to the epoch of dwarf galaxy suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1968265149,"OCA-B was originally identified as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator that is essential for antigen-driven immune responses. The later identification of a membrane bound, myristoylated form of OCA-B suggested additional, unique functions in B cell signaling pathways. This study has shown that OCA-B also functions in the pre-B1-to-pre-B2 cell transition and, most surprisingly, that it directly interacts with SYK, a tyrosine kinase critical for pre-BCR and BCR signaling. This unprecedented type of interaction—a transcriptional coactivator with a signaling kinase—occurs in the cytoplasm and directly regulates SYK stability. This study indicates that OCA-B is required for pre-BCR and BCR signaling at multiple stages of B cell development through its nontranscriptional regulation of SYK. Combined with the deregulation of OCA-B target genes, this may help explain the multitude of defects observed in B cell development and immune responses of Oca-b−/− mice."

Results allow the comparative analysis of PRT and pyrimidine NP families and expose related structural motifs involved in nucleotide/nucleoside recognition by these enzyme families. Nucleotide compounds are central to the production of genetic material, the amino acids histidine and tryptophan, and cofactors such as NAD. Their metabolism is largely based on the reversible transfer of a phosphoribosyl group to aromatic bases. Although forward and reverse ribosylation processes share a close resemblance (Fig. 1), they are carried out by different enzymes and in the context of distinct metabolic pathways. Synthesis reactions are performed by phosphoribosyltransferases (PRT). 3The abbreviations used are: PRT, phosphoribosyltransferases; NP, nucleoside phosphorylases; AnPRT, anthranilate PRT; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate; PyNP, pyrimidine NP; AA, anthranilate; ssAnPRT, S. solfataricus AnPRT; mtAnPRT, M. tuberculosis AnPRT; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. 3The abbreviations used are: PRT, phosphoribosyltransferases; NP, nucleoside phosphorylases; AnPRT, anthranilate PRT; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate; PyNP, pyrimidine NP; AA, anthranilate; ssAnPRT, S. solfataricus AnPRT; mtAnPRT, M. tuberculosis AnPRT; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering.These use PRPP as universal phosphoribosyl donor. These reactions, which are dependent on metal ions, involve the displacement of the 1-pyrophosphate group of PRPP and formation of a N-1′-glycosidic bond to a nitrogenated base specific for each PRT. Conversely, the release of aromatic bases from nucleotides involves first the production of a nucleoside intermediate by nucleotidases or phosphatases, followed by the cleavage of the glycosidic bond by either nucleoside phosphorylases (NP) or nucleoside hydrolases. NP enzymes are key to nucleotide salvage both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes. They catalyze the reversible phosphorolysis of the glycosidic bond of nucleosides to yield free bases and ribose-1-phosphate.Despite the chemical resemblance of the compounds intervening in synthesis and degradation reactions by PRTs and NPs (Fig. 1), respectively, the enzymes involved in these catalyses lack structural similarity.

NPs are also classified in two groups with distinct folds as follows: (i) NP-I, which act primarily on purine nucleosides but also accept the pyrimidine uridine, and (ii) NP-II, which degrade thymidine and/or uridine depending on the organism of origin (8Pugmire M.J. Ealick S.E. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) (throughout this text NP-II enzymes will be termed pyrimidine NP (PyNP) irrespective of their substrate specificity). One single evolutionary link has been encountered among these five protein families, exemplified by AnPRT and PyNP, enzymes that share little or no sequence homology but display significant architectural similarities. AnPRT synthesizes an intermediate in the biosynthesis pathway of the essential amino acid tryptophan. It ribosylates the aromatic base anthranilate (AA) by using PRPP to convert it into a nucleotide-like product, 5′-phosphoribosyl-anthranilate, which constitutes the basic skeleton of tryptophan (Fig. 1A). Atomic structures of AnPRTs from Sulfolobus solfataricus (5Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Pectobacterium carotovorum (6Kim C. Xuong N.H. Edwards S. Yee, M. C. Madhusudan Spraggon G. Mills S.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (7Lee C.E. Goodfellow C. Javid-Majd F. Baker E.N. Shaun Lott J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 784-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Thermus thermophilus (PDB entry 1V8G), and Nostoceae (PDB entry 1VQU) have become available recently, with the structure from M. tuberculosis (mtAnPRT) being complexed to its PRPP substrate and magnesium ions (7Lee C.E. Goodfellow C. Javid-Majd F. Baker E.N. Shaun Lott J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 784-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the sequence similarity between AnPRT and PyNP is restricted to their N termini and a few confined motifs (5Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), their architectural correspondence is significant. Both enzymes share a common fold comprising a small N-terminal, α-helical domain made up of six helices and a large α/β-domain formed by a central β-sheet and a cluster of eight α-helices (Fig. 2A). They also exhibit a similar quaternary structure consisting of head-to-head dimers with equivalent interfaces. A topological comparison of their architectures shows that a particular feature of AnPRT is the presence of a short loop within the substrate binding cleft, which carries a DE sequence motif absolutely conserved within this family (5Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This motif, which is not present in PyNPs, has been proposed to confer on AnPRT the ability of binding and activating the PRPP substrate central to PRT catalysis (5Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Substrate coordination by ssAnPRT. A, overview (only one protomer of the homodimer is shown).

Recently, AnPRT has also emerged as a candidate for biomedical applications. Studies on M. tuberculosis showed that strains with disrupted AnPRT presented attenuated virulence but lead to protection in mouse models equal to vaccination with virulent strains (10Smith D.A. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Bancroft G.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Parish T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6702-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To better understand the mode of action of AnPRT and to investigate further the general catalytic strategies across PRT and NP nucleotide/nucleoside-processing enzymes, we have now characterized the active site of S. solfataricus AnPRT (ssAnPRT) by studying its complexation of natural substrates using x-ray crystallography, small angle x-ray scattering, and steady-state enzyme kinetics of mutated variants. Our results indicate that, despite architectural and functional differences in these protein families, their tactics for substrate recognition are related.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystal Structure Elucidation—ssAnPRT was overexpressed, purified, and crystallized as reported (12Ivens A. Mayans O. Szadkowski H. Wilmanns M. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Substrate complexation was in the crystalline state using soaking at 4 °C, where crystals of the apoenzyme were immersed in cryo-solutions containing mother liquor supplemented with 22% (v/v) glycerol (as cryo-protectant) and ligands. AA and PRPP substrates were purchased from Sigma. Specific soaking conditions and x-ray data statistics are given in Table 1. For x-ray data collection, crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K. The APRV interface (13Kroemer M. Dreyer M.K. Wendt K.U. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1679-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to XDS (14Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A model for anthranilate was obtained from the Cambridge Structural Data base, whereas PRPP was initially derived from PDB entry 1FSG. Manual rebuilding of protein and substrate models was in O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar). For cross-validation, diffraction data were divided into a working and a test set in XSCALE (14Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). NCS restraints across domains were applied to all models. Water molecules were built using ARP/wARP (17Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) and validated visually in electron density maps. Coordinates for ssAnPRT in complex with AA, PRPP/Mg2+, and AA/PRPP/Mg2+ have been deposited in the PDB with accession codes 2GVQ, 1ZXY, and 1ZYK, respectively.TABLE 1X-ray data collection and structure refinement statisticsSubstrateAAPRPP/Mg2+AA + PRPP/Mg2+Soaking conditionsSubstrate concentration10 mm10 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl210 mm AA, 10 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2Time1 min2 min10 minTemperature20 °C4 °C4 °CX-ray sourceXS06A (SLS)X11 (EMBL/DESY)ID14-2 (ESRF)DetectorMarCCD-165MarCCD-165ADSC quantum CCDWavelength0.951 Å0.815 Å0.933 ÅSymmetryP2P2P2Unit cell (Å)a = 91.81, b = 65.62, c = 115.61a = 92.69, b = 65.81, c = 116.72a = 92.56, b = 66.10, c = 117.07β = 107.39°β = 107.8°β = 107.76°Resolution (outer shell)20 to 2.43 (2.5 to 2.43) Å20 to 2.56 (2.67 to 2.56) Å20 to 2.40 (2.50 to 2.40) ÅUnique reflections48,850 (3874)41,256 (3550)51,457 (5266)Rsym (I) (%)6.5 (43.0)7.0 (32.0)6.2 (24.6)Multiplicity3.84 (3.41)3.6 (2.2)3.76 (3.03)Completeness (%)97.9 (96.2)94.6 (69.3)96.9 (87.1)<I/σ (I)>10.99 (3.1)10.43 (3.22)15.33 (5.45)Content a.u.4AnPRT:7AA4AnPRT:4PRPP:8Mg2+4AnPRT:7AA:4PRPP:8Mg2+No. of non-hydrogen atoms10,82610,75211,239Protein residuesaOne ssAnPRT protomer comprises 345 amino acids.136613761375Water molecules25392505Rwork/Rfree (%)19.9/24.220.3/26.020.6/26.9No. R-free reflections584503624r.m.s.d.bond (Å)0.0070.0070.007r.m.s.d.angle (°)1.331.391.33Protein residues favored (%)bCalculated by using PROCHECK (39).93.290.690.2Protein residues disallowedbCalculated by using PROCHECK (39).000Disordered protein residuescIndividual polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit of this crystal form are indicated as A, B, C, and D.A81-A83, A344-A345A345, B345A345, B345B81-B83, B344-B345C345, D345C344-C345C80-C83D345a One ssAnPRT protomer comprises 345 amino acids.b Calculated by using PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Small Angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS data were collected on the EMBL camera X33 (DORIS III, DESY) with a linear gas detector (18Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Samples were in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, at substrate-binding conditions as for crystal soaking (Table 1). Data were recorded at multiple protein concentrations (1.8-15.0 mg/ml) at a temperature of 4.0 ± 0.2 °C in the range of momentum transfer 0.15 < s < 3.2 nm-1 (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 0.15 nm is the x-ray wavelength). The data, collected in 15 successive 1-min frames, showed no significant variation as a function of time, indicating the absence of both radiation damage and catalysis on the substrates. Data were processed using the program PRIMUS (19Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0), radius of gyration Rg, maximum dimension Dmax, and the distance distribution function p(r) were evaluated with the program GNOM (20Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the solutes were derived by comparison of I(0) with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (molecular mass = 66 kDa).Multiple models of ssAnPRT in open and closed conformations were constructed by systematic rigid-body rotation of the C-terminal α/β-domain relative to its fixed N-terminal counterpart. The interdomain hinge region in ssAnPRT was taken as loops α4-bβ, α8′-α8, and α9-β4 (definition as in Ref. 5Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The rotation axis was calculated from noncrystallographic differences in apo crystal models (1O17) using DYNDOM (21Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). With hinge and rotation axis so defined, the α/β-domain was swung in 5° increments from extremely open to maximally closed conformations. The scattering patterns of 225 generated symmetric and asymmetric dimers, all keeping the dimerization interface as in apo-ssAnPRT, were compared with the experimental data using CRYSOL (22Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2715) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants K106Q, R164A, R170A, and D223N were produced by overlap extension PCR using the plasmid pQE40_sstrpD (12Ivens A. Mayans O. Szadkowski H. Wilmanns M. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as template. Mutants H107A and E224Q were produced with the QuikChange method (Stratagene), again using pQE40_sstrpD as the template. Double mutants R164A/H154A and P178A/H107A were generated by overlap extension PCR, using the templates pQE40_sstrpD-R164A and pQE40_sstrpD-H107A. The details of the PCRs, including the DNA sequences of the oligonucleotides used, are provided as Supplemental Material. Using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, the mutated genes were cloned into pQE40. Gene expression from pQE40 results in the addition of an N-terminal His6 tag to the produced protein. To confirm the introduced base substitutions and to exclude further inadvertent point mutations, all mutated genes were entirely sequenced.Heterologous Expression and Purification of ssAnPRT Mutants—ssAnPRT variants were heterologously expressed at 37 °C in Escherichia coli strain W3110 trpEA2, containing the repressor plasmid pDM (23Jurgens C. Strom A. Wegener D. Hettwer S. Wilmanns M. Sterner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9925-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The resulting protein products were purified from the soluble fraction of the crude extract by heat precipitation of the host proteins and metal chelate affinity chromatography. N-terminal His6 tags were removed by proteolysis. Details of gene expression and protein purification are provided as Supplemental Material. As judged by SDS-PAGE, all samples were at least 95% pure. Yields were 0.2-0.8 mg of protein per g wet cell mass. The proteins were dripped into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.Steady-state Kinetics—The ssAnPRT reaction was followed at 60 °C by a fluorimetric assay (CARY Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer, Varian) (12Ivens A. Mayans O. Szadkowski H. Wilmanns M. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at various concentrations of MgCl2. The Michaelis constants KAAm and KPRPPm were determined by analyzing saturation curves that were deduced from initial velocity measurements recorded in the presence of an excess (10 × KM) of the second substrate. The turnover number kcat was obtained by dividing the maximum catalytic rate by the total concentration of active sites.RESULTSCrystal Structures of Wild-type ssAnPRT in Complex with Its Natural Substrates—Atomic models of ssAnPRT in complex with (i) AA, (ii) PRPP/Mg2+, and (iii) AA/PRPP/Mg2+, the latter showing the active site at full occupancy, have been obtained by crystal soaking at 4 °C where catalysis by this thermophilic enzyme is not detectable (12Ivens A. Mayans O. Szadkowski H. Wilmanns M. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The crystal form employed in this study contained two AnPRT dimers in its asymmetric unit. X-ray data and model refinement statistics are given in Table 1.Recognition of Anthranilic Acid—ssAnPRT binds two molecules of AA per protomer (Fig. 2, A, C, and E). The two AA molecules are housed within the N-terminal, α-helical domain in consecutive binding pockets (sites AA-I and AA-II). Site I is defined by enzyme residues Asn-109, Ala-150, His-154, Met-157, and Arg-164, located at the N-terminal end of the binding cleft. Site II, positioned at the middle point of the binding groove, is close to a hinge region at the center of the enzyme architecture. It is formed by protein residues Ala-78, Gly-79, His-107, Gly-108, Asn-109, Gly-177, and Pro-178. Protein-AA interactions both at sites I and II are mostly of hydrophobic character. The charged, lateral groups of AA are involved only in few specific interactions, so their contribution to the productive orientation of this compound in either pocket appears to be moderate. AA-I is oriented primarily via its carboxyl group by protein residues Arg-164 and Asn-109. AA-II interacts with Asn-109 via its carboxyl group, whereas its amino group is oriented toward the PRPP binding cavity via a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl group of Gly-79 (Fig. 2E). As a further contribution to substrate orientation, the imidazole rings of His-154 and His-107 at sites I and II, respectively, act as π-acceptors of the aromatic CH groups of anthranilate. These contacts are better classified as weak hydrogen bonds than as unspecific hydrophobic interactions (24Brandl M. Weiss M.S. Jabs A. Suhnel J. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 25Steiner T. Koellner G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 535-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Both histidine residues are similarly arranged with respect to their corresponding AA ligands. Besides protein-ligand contacts, the two AA molecules interact directly with each other via an electrostatic interaction between the amino group of molecule AA-I and the carboxyl group of AA-II. This is a prominent contribution to the orientation of these molecules in the binding groove of ssAnPRT.To clarify whether ssAnPRT binds AA preferentially at a given pocket, a titration series was carried out in the crystal at AA soaking concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm over 30 min to ensure equilibration. Binding became interpretable only at the highest concentration of 2 mm and in two of the four ssAn-PRT copies in the asymmetric unit. The analysis of electron density maps indicated that the enzyme within the crystal lattice favors binding of AA at pocket II and that the AA binding mode is the same at high and low substrate concentrations. A visual inspection of the lattice suggested that this result is unlikely to be due to impaired accessibility of pocket I.Protein groups involved in AA coordination at sites I and II are highly conserved (>85%) within the AnPRT family (Fig. 3). Glycine residues at positions 79 and 177 are required to prevent steric blockage of substrate binding to pocket II. Of all residues involved, only Arg-164 at site I is absolutely conserved across the AnPRT and PyNP families.FIGURE 3Sequence conservation in the AnPRT and PyNP families.

P stands for residues binding phosphate groups of PRPP in AnPRT or the lytic phosphate in PyNP. M, R, and N represent residues that coordinate a magnesium ion, the ribose moiety of PRPP or of a nucleoside substrate, and the nitrogenated base, respectively. Residues reported to coordinate PRPP in mtAnPRT (7Lee C.E. Goodfellow C. Javid-Majd F. Baker E.N. Shaun Lott J. J. Mol.

The binding site for this substrate is located in a deep depression within the large α/β-domain. The most prominent change in the enzyme upon PRPP binding is the ordering of the glycine-rich loop 79GTGGD83 (Fig. 2, A and D), which is unstructured in the apo form of the enzyme (5Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This loop constitutes one of the signature motifs of the AnPRT family (Fig. 3). Ordering appears to be caused by interactions of residues Gly-79 and Asp-83 with PRPP. Contacts established between enzyme and substrate include in addition residues Thr-87, Asn-89, Ser-91, Thr-92, and Lys-106 (Fig. 2F). The pyrophosphate moiety of PRPP in these structures is similarly coordinated as the PPi leaving group reported previously (5Mayans O. Ivens A. Nissen L.J. Kirschner K. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Kim C. Xuong N.H. Edwards S. Yee, M. C. Madhusudan Spraggon G. Mills S.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Given that divalent ions mediate PRPP binding in all other PRT families (1Sinha S.C. Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and that ssAnPRT requires magnesium for catalysis (12Ivens A. Mayans O. Szadkowski H. Wilmanns M. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we expected Mg2+ ions to also coordinate PRPP in the current complex. Because atoms of this light metal could not be resolved in electron density maps at the working resolution, we used instead manganese in soaking studies to experimentally locate metal sites using anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated with phases from the apo model. Eight ions were identified with peak heights of 7.8σ, 7.6σ, 7.5σ, 7.0σ, 6.7σ, 6.3σ, 5.5σ, and 4.8σ, corresponding to two metal ions per PRPP molecule. A first metal atom (MG-1) is coordinated by the hydroxyl groups of the ribose and pyrophosphate oxygens, so it is internal to PRPP with no protein groups being involved (Fig. 2F). This is likely to correspond to the high affinity metal-binding site present in the PRPP compound, which forms in solution a predominant mono-magnesium complex thought to be the true substrate of PRTs (26Thompson R.E.

Biochem. 2003; 93: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Accordingly, crystal structures of the unrelated PRT-I and -II in complex with PRPP reveal an equivalent metal ion at this site, also lacking direct protein contacts (Fig. 2B) (1Sinha S.C. Smith J.L.

In ssAnPRT, the coordinated action of MG-1 and a hydrogen bond between the amino group of Gly-79 and a phosphate oxygen induce an eclipsed conformation in the pyrophosphate group (Fig. 2, D and F). Eclipsed arrangements are also common in PRPP coordination by the canonical PRT-I, a"
