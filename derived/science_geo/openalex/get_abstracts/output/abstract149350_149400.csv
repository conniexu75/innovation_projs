https://openalex.org/W2101608919,"Most of the energy deposited in cells by ionizing radiation is channeled into the production of abundant free secondary electrons with ballistic energies between 1 and 20 electron volts. Here it is shown that reactions of such electrons, even at energies well below ionization thresholds, induce substantial yields of single- and double-strand breaks in DNA, which are caused by rapid decays of transient molecular resonances localized on the DNA's basic components. This finding presents a fundamental challenge to the traditional notion that genotoxic damage by secondary electrons can only occur at energies above the onset of ionization, or upon solvation when they become a slowly reacting chemical species."
https://openalex.org/W2144860443,Members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily catalyze the addition of molecular oxygen to nonactivated hydrocarbons at physiological temperature—a reaction that requires high temperature to proceed in the absence of a catalyst. Structures were obtained for three intermediates in the hydroxylation reaction of camphor by P450cam with trapping techniques and cryocrystallography. The structure of the ferrous dioxygen adduct of P450cam was determined with 0.91 angstrom wavelength x-rays; irradiation with 1.5 angstrom x-rays results in breakdown of the dioxygen molecule to an intermediate that would be consistent with an oxyferryl species. The structures show conformational changes in several important residues and reveal a network of bound water molecules that may provide the protons needed for the reaction.

A water-soluble palladium(II) bathophenanthroline complex is a stable recyclable catalyst for the selective aerobic oxidation of a wide range of alcohols to aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids in a biphasic water-alcohol system. The use of water as a solvent and air as the oxidant makes the reaction interesting from both an economic and environmental point of view."
https://openalex.org/W1974342767,"The coupling mechanism between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium ion (Ca2+) stores and plasma membrane (PM) store-operated channels (SOCs) is crucial to Ca2+ signaling but has eluded detection. SOCs may be functionally related to the TRP family of receptor-operated channels. Direct comparison of endogenous SOCs with stably expressed TRP3 channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells revealed that TRP3 channels differ in being store independent. However, condensed cortical F-actin prevented activation of both SOC and TRP3 channels, which suggests that ER-PM interactions underlie coupling of both channels. A cell-permeant inhibitor of inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) function, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, prevented both receptor-induced TRP3 activation and store-induced SOC activation. It is concluded that InsP3Rs mediate both SOC and TRP channel opening and that the InsP3R is essential for maintaining coupling between store emptying and physiological activation of SOCs."
https://openalex.org/W2026078372,"Understanding biology at the single-cell level requires simultaneous measurements of biochemical parameters and behavioral characteristics in individual cells. Here, the output of individual flagellar motors in Escherichia coli was measured as a function of the intracellular concentration of the chemotactic signaling protein. The concentration of this molecule, fused to green fluorescent protein, was monitored with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Motors from different bacteria exhibited an identical steep input-output relation, suggesting that they actively contribute to signal amplification in chemotaxis. This experimental approach can be extended to quantitative in vivo studies of other biochemical networks."
https://openalex.org/W2023822923,"A type III protein secretion system encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) has been found to be required for virulence and survival within macrophages. Here, SPI2 was shown to allow Salmonella typhimurium to avoid NADPH oxidase–dependent killing by macrophages. The ability of SPI2-mutant bacteria to survive in macrophages and to cause lethal infection in mice was restored by abrogation of the NADPH oxidase–dependent respiratory burst. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated efficient localization of the NADPH oxidase in the proximity of vacuoles containing SPI2-mutant but not wild-type bacteria, suggesting that SPI2 interferes with trafficking of oxidase-containing vesicles to the phagosome."

https://openalex.org/W1989676021,"To determine the ability of antibodies to provide protection from Ebola viruses, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the Ebola glycoprotein were generated and evaluated for efficacy. We identified several protective mAbs directed toward five unique epitopes on Ebola glycoprotein. One of the epitopes is conserved among all Ebola viruses that are known to be pathogenic for humans. Some protective mAbs were also effective therapeutically when administered to mice 2 days after exposure to lethal Ebola virus. The identification of protective mAbs has important implications for developing vaccines and therapies for Ebola virus."
https://openalex.org/W1932654578,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is implicated as an important mechanism by which diabetes causes vascular complications. We have recently shown that a PKC beta inhibitor ameliorates not only early diabetes-induced glomerular dysfunction such as glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria, but also overexpression of glomerular mRNA for transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, a model for type 1 diabetes. In this study, we examined the long-term effects of a PKC beta inhibitor on glomerular histology as well as on biochemical and functional abnormalities in glomeruli of db/db mice, a model for type 2 diabetes. Administration of a PKC beta inhibitor reduced urinary albumin excretion rates and inhibited glomerular PKC activation in diabetic db/db mice. Administration of a PKC beta inhibitor also prevented the mesangial expansion observed in diabetic db/db mice, possibly through attenuation of glomerular expression of TGF-beta and ECM proteins such as fibronectin and type IV collagen. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that the long-term inhibition of PKC activation in the renal glomeruli can ameliorate glomerular pathologies in diabetic state, and thus suggest that a PKC beta inhibitor might be an useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy."

https://openalex.org/W2314477394,"The mechanisms by which the p53 tumour suppressor protein would, in vivo, co-ordinate the adaptive response to genotoxic stress is poorly understood. p53 has been shown to transactivate several genes that could be involved in two main cellular responses, growth arrest and apoptosis. To get further insight into the tissue-specific regulation of p53 transcriptional activity, we performed an extensive study looking at the expression of four well characterized p53-responsive genes, before and after gamma-irradiation in p53 wild-type (p53+/+) and p53-deficient (p53-/-) mice. The waf1, bax, fas and mdm2 genes were chosen for their different potential roles in the cellular response to stress. Our data demonstrate the strict p53-dependence of mRNA up-regulation for bax, fas and mdm2 in irradiated tissues and confirm such findings for waf1. They further highlight complex levels of regulatory mechanisms that could lead, in vivo, to selective transcriptional activation of genes by p53. In addition, our results provide arguments for the involvement of p53 in the basal mRNA expression of the four genes in some organs. Finally, in situ expression of Bax and p21Waf-1 protein suggests, at least in lymphoid organs, a direct correlation between selective p53-target gene expression and a particular response of a cell to ionising radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2166469808,"Models describing the evolution of the partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen over Phanerozoic time are constrained by the mass balances required between the inputs and outputs of carbon and sulfur to the oceans. This constraint has limited the applicability of proposed negative feedback mechanisms for maintaining levels of atmospheric O 2 at biologically permissable levels. Here we describe a modeling approach that incorporates O 2 -dependent carbon and sulfur isotope fractionation using data obtained from laboratory experiments on carbon-13 discrimination by vascular land plants and marine plankton. The model allows us to calculate a Phanerozoic O 2 history that agrees with independent models and with biological and physical constraints and supports the hypothesis of a high atmospheric O 2 content during the Carboniferous (300 million years ago), a time when insect gigantism was widespread."
https://openalex.org/W2013571370,The hollandite high-pressure polymorph of plagioclase has been identified in shock-induced melt veins of the Sixiangkou L6 chondrite. It is intimately intergrown with feldspathic glass within grains previously thought to be “maskelynite.” The crystallographic nature of the mineral was established by laser micro-Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. The mineral is tetragonal with the unit cell parameters a = 9.263 ± 0.003 angstroms and c = 2.706 ± 0.003 angstroms. Its occurrence with the liquidus pair majorite-pyrope solid solution plus magnesiowüstite sets constraints on the peak pressures that prevailed in the shock-induced melt veins. The absence of a calcium ferrite–structured phase sets an upper bound for the crystallization of the hollandite polymorph near 23 gigapascals.
https://openalex.org/W2085443201,"The large chlorella virus PBCV-1, which contains double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), encodes a 94-codon open reading frame (ORF) that contains a motif resembling the signature sequence of the pore domain of potassium channel proteins. Phylogenetic analyses of the encoded protein, Kcv, indicate a previously unidentified type of potassium channel. The messenger RNA encoded by the ORF leads to functional expression of a potassium-selective conductance in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The channel blockers amantadine and barium, but not cesium, inhibit this conductance, in addition to virus plaque formation. Thus, PBCV-1 encodes the first known viral protein that functions as a potassium-selective channel and is essential in the virus life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1984927780,"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is frequently activated in cancer cells by stabilizing mutations of beta-catenin or loss-of-function mutations of the APC tumor suppressor gene. We have analysed the role of beta-catenin in the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma (HB), an embryonic liver tumor occurring mainly in children under 2 years of age. Sequence analysis of the beta-catenin NH2-terminal domain in 18 epithelial and mixed HBs revealed missense mutations in the GSK3beta phosphorylation motif or interstitial deletions in 12 tumors (67%). In the remaining cases, no truncating mutation of APC could be evidenced. Immunohistochemical analysis of beta-catenin in 11 HBs demonstrated nuclear/cytoplasmic accumulation of the protein in all tumors analysed, with predominant nuclear beta-catenin immunostaining in undifferentiated cells. Membranous beta-catenin localization was preserved only in fetal-type tumoral hepatocytes and was associated with E-cadherin expression. Moreover, we show that beta-catenin is aberrantly overexpressed in a large spectrum of tumor components, including hepatocyte-like cells at various differentiation stages and heterologous elements such as squamous, osteoid and chrondroid tissues, and in occasional other mesenchymally-derived cells. These data strongly suggest that activation of beta-catenin signaling is an obligatory step in HB pathogenesis, and raise the possibility that it interferes with developmental signals that specify different tissue types at early stages of hepatic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2041220310,"The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 has been implicated in regulating cell cycle progression. Pin1 was found to be required for the DNA replication checkpoint in Xenopus laevis. Egg extracts depleted of Pin1 inappropriately transited from the G2 to the M phase of the cell cycle in the presence of the DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin. This defect in replication checkpoint function was reversed after the addition of recombinant wild-type Pin1, but not an isomerase-inactive mutant, to the depleted extract. Premature mitotic entry in the absence of Pin1 was accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25, activation of Cdc2/cyclin B, and generation of epitopes recognized by the mitotic phosphoprotein antibody, MPM-2. Therefore, Pin1 appears to be required for the checkpoint delaying the onset of mitosis in response to incomplete replication."
https://openalex.org/W2331439722,"Cell migration in vivo often requires invasion through tissue matrices. Currently little is known regarding the signaling pathways that regulate cell invasion through three-dimensional matrices. The small GTPases Cdc42, Rac and Rho are key regulators of actin cytoskeletal and adhesive structures. We now show that expression of dominant negative forms of either Cdc42, Rac or Rho inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated Rat1 fibroblast invasion into 3D collagen matrices, indicating that the activity of each of these GTPases is necessary for cell invasion. In contrast, only Rac activation was required for PDGF-BB-stimulated locomotion across a planar substrate in the Boyden chamber. Interestingly, PDGF-induced invasion was also strongly inhibited by expression of constitutively active forms of Cdc42 or Rho, and to a lesser extent by constitutively active Rac. We also show that constitutively active V12-Rac significantly stimulated basal Rat1 fibroblast invasion, independent of PI-3-kinase activity, and that this effect was suppressed by the effector mutant V12/H40-Rac. These results suggest that cellular invasion may require an optimal level of activation of Cdc42, Rho and Rac, and that migration and invasion are differentially modulated by Rho family GTPases."

https://openalex.org/W1540889881,"Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) play a role in the genesis of atherosclerosis. OxLDL are able to induce apoptosis of vascular cells, which is potentially involved in the formation of the necrotic center of atherosclerotic lesions, plaque rupture, and subsequent thrombotic events. Because oxLDL may induce structural modifications of cell protein and altered proteins may impair cell viability, the present work aimed to evaluate the extent of protein alterations, the degradation of modified proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (a major degradative pathway for altered and oxidatively modified proteins) and their role during apoptosis induced by oxLDL. This paper reports the following: 1) oxLDL induce derivatization of cell proteins by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and ubiquitination. 2) Toxic concentrations of oxLDL elicit a biphasic effect on proteasome activity. An early and transient activation of endogenous proteolysis is followed rapidly by a subsequent decay (resulting probably from the 26S proteasome inhibition) and followed later by the inhibition of the 20S proteasome (as assessed by inhibition of sLLVY-MCA hydrolysis). 3) Specific inhibitors of proteasome (lactacystin and proteasome inhibitor I) potentiated considerably the toxicity of oxLDL (nontoxic doses of oxLDL became severely toxic). The defect of the ubiquitination pathway (in temperature-sensitive mutants) also potentiated the toxicity of oxLDL. This suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a role in the cellular defenses against oxLDL-induced toxicity. 4) Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), an aldehyde reagent, prevented both the oxLDL-induced derivatization of cell proteins and subsequent cytotoxicity. Altogether, the reported data suggest that both derivatization of cell proteins (by 4-HNE and other oxidized lipids) and inhibition of the proteasome pathway are involved in the mechanism of oxLDL-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1520948801,"Recently, it was demonstrated that liver injury and TNF-alpha production as a result of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) were attenuated by feeding animals a diet enriched with glycine. This phenomenon was shown to be a result of, at least in part, activation of a chloride channel in Kupffer cells by glycine, which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and blunts increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) similar to its action in the neuron. It is well known that hepatotoxicity due to LPS has a neutrophil-mediated component and that activation of neutrophils is dependent on increases in [Ca(2+)](i). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if glycine affected agonist-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in rat neutrophils. The effect of glycine on increases in [Ca(2+)](i) elicited either by the bacterial-derived peptide formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (FMLP) or LPS was studied in individual neutrophils using Fura-2 and fluorescence microscopy. Both FMLP and LPS caused dose-dependent increases in [Ca(2+)](i), which were maximal at 1 microM FMLP and 100 microgram/ml LPS, respectively. LPS increased intracellular calcium in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. Glycine blunted increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) of approximately 0.3 mM, values only slightly higher than plasma levels. Glycine was unable to prevent agonist-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in chloride-free buffer. Moreover, strychnine (1 microM), an antagonist of the glycine-gated chloride channel in the central nervous system, reversed the effects of glycine (1 mM) on FMLP- or LPS-stimulated increases in [Ca(2+)](i). To provide hard evidence for a glycine-gated chloride channel in the neutrophil, the effect of glycine on radioactive chloride uptake was determined. Glycine caused a dose-dependent increase in chloride uptake into neutrophils with an ED(50) of approximately 0.4 mM, an effect also prevented by 1 microM strychnine. Glycine also significantly reduced the production of superoxide anion from FMLP-stimulated neutrophils. Taken together, these data provide clear evidence that neutrophils contain a glycine-gated chloride channel that can attenuate increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and diminish oxidant production by this important leukocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2335538541,"The tumor suppressor p53 is considered as the guardian of the genome which is activated following genotoxic stress. In many cell types, p53 mediates G1 cell cycle arrest as the predominant cellular response. Inactivation of wild-type p53 leads to loss of G1/S checkpoint control and to genomic instability, including increased spontaneous homologous recombination (HR). To determine whether regulation of the G1/S checkpoint is required for suppression of HR, we assessed recombination events using a plasmid substrate that stably integrated into the genome of p53-null mouse fibroblasts. Exogenous expression of a temperature-sensitive p53 protein (Ala135 to Val), which had lost trans-activation function and could not regulate G1/S transition when in mutant conformation, reduced HR rates to the same extent as wild-type p53. Furthermore, a p53 construct with an alternatively-spliced carboxy terminus also retained this ability in the absence of both activities, G1/S control and non-sequence specific DNA binding as mediated by the carboxy terminus. Our data dissociate regulation of HR by p53 from its role as a cell cycle checkpoint protein. The results support a model which extends p53's role as a guardian of the genome to include transactivation-independent regulatory functions in DNA repair, replication and recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2008693647,"Expression of EBNA3C is essential for the immortalization of B cells by EBV in vitro and, in co-operation with activated ras, EBNA3C has oncogenic activity in primary rodent fibroblasts. This suggested that this viral oncoprotein might disrupt the cyclin/CDK-pRb-E2F pathway, which regulates cell cycle progression at the restriction point (R-point) in G1 of the proliferation cycle. An assay was established in which transfected EBNA3C-positive cells could be sorted and simultaneously analysed for their distribution in the cell cycle. This revealed that in NIH3T3 fibroblasts compelled to arrest by serum-withdrawal, EBNA3C induces nuclear division that is often divorced from cytokinesis and so produces bi- and multinucleated cells. This was confirmed using the ecdysone-inducible system for expression of EBNA3C in human U2OS cells and by microinjection of expression vectors into NIH3T3 and U2OS. Further analysis revealed that in the inducible system, EBNA3C expression inhibits the accumulation of p27KIP1 but not the dephosphorylation of pRb. Experiments using the microtubule destabilizing drug nocodazole, showed that EBNA3C could abrogate the mitotic spindle checkpoint."

https://openalex.org/W1831542174,"Brief episodes of ischemia can render an organ resistant to subsequent severe ischemia. This 'ischemic preconditioning' is ascribed to various mechanisms, including oxidative stress. We investigated whether preconditioning exists on an endothelial level. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transiently confronted with oxidative stress (1 mM H(2)O(2), 5 min). Adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-selectin and release of cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 to subsequent stimulation with TNF-alpha (2.5 ng/ml, 4 h) were measured (flow cytometry and immunoassay), as were nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB (Western blotting, confocal microscopy) and redox status of HUVECs (quantification of glutathione by HPLC). TNF-alpha elevated IL-6 in the cell supernatant from 8.8 +/- 1 to 41 +/- 3 pg/ml and IL-8 from 0.5 +/- 0. 03 to 3 +/- 0.2 ng/ml. ICAM-1 was increased threefold and E-selectin rose eightfold. Oxidative stress (decrease of glutathione by 50%) reduced post-TNF-alpha levels of IL-6 to 14 +/- 3 and IL-8 to 1 +/- 0.2; the rise of ICAM-1 was completely blocked and E-selectin was only doubled. The anti-inflammatory effects of preconditioning via oxidative stress were paralleled by reduction of the translocation of NFkappaB on stimulation with TNF-alpha, and antagonized by the intracellular radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine. 'Anti-inflammatory preconditioning' of endothelial cells by oxidative stress may account for the inhibitory effects of preconditioning on leukocyte adhesion in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1903734838,"The MDR1 multidrug transporter P-gp (P-glycoprotein) is an efflux pump that extrudes diverse hydrophobic drugs and peptides from cells. Since the entry of HIV-1 into cells involves an initial interaction of the viral gp41 hydrophobic peptide with the plasma membrane, a potential effect of P-gp on HIV-1 infectivity was explored. Virus production was greatly decreased when P-gp was overexpressed at the surface of a continuous CD4(+) human T-leukemic cell line (12D7) infected with HIV-1(NL4-3), a T-tropic molecular clone of HIV-1. P-gp overexpression did not significantly alter the surface expression or distribution of either the HIV-1 receptor CD4 or the coreceptor CXCR4. Reduction of HIV-1 infectivity in P-gp-expressing cells occurred both during the fusion of viral and plasma membranes and at subsequent step(s) in the HIV-1 life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2014156081,"The type of RNA editing found in the kinetoplast-mitochondria of trypanosomes and related protozoa, involving uridylate insertions and deletions, creates translatable messenger RNAs (mRNAs) out of nonsense pre-edited RNAs by correcting encoded defects that vary from simple frameshifts to large ""cryptic"" regions. However, any evidence for translation of these mRNAs in the kinetoplast has been missing for decades. We identified a kinetoplast-encoded protein, apocytochrome b, whose mRNA is edited in the 5' region. The determined amino-terminal sequence of the protein coincides with the predicted sequence derived from the edited region, demonstrating that the cognate apocytochrome b mRNA is translated into a functional protein. This finding represents the first direct evidence for a functional translation system in the kinetoplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1483518403,"43K rapsyn is a peripheral protein specifically associated with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) present in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction and of the electrocyte, and is essential for its clustering. Here, we demonstrate a novel specific phosphorylation of 43K rapsyn by endogenous protein kinase(s) present in Torpedo electrocyte nAChR-rich membranes and identify thiamine triphosphate (TTP) as the phosphate donor. In the presence of Mg(2+) and [gamma-(32)P]-TTP, 43K rapsyn is specifically phosphorylated with a (32)P-half-maximal incorporation at approximately 5-25 microM TTP. The presence of TTP in the cytosol and of 43K rapsyn at the cytoplasmic face of the postsynaptic membrane, together with TTP-dependent phosphorylation of 43K rapsyn without added exokinases, suggests that TTP-dependent-43K-rapsyn phosphorylation may occur in vivo. In addition, phosphoamino acid and chemical stability analysis suggests that the residues phosphorylated are predominantly histidines. Inhibition of phosphorylation by Zn(2+) suggests a possible control of 43K rapsyn phosphorylation state by its zinc finger domain. Endogenous kinase(s) present in rodent brain membranes can also use [gamma-(32)P]-TTP as a phosphodonor. The use of a phosphodonor (TTP) belonging to the thiamine family but not to the classical (ATP, GTP) purine triphosphate family represents a novel phosphorylation pathway possibly important for synaptic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1602845273,"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping X-linked gene whose main function is to produce NADPH, a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive bio-synthetic reactions. Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia (triggered by fava beans or other agents) or life-long hemolytic anemia. We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene. From the alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) species from 42 different organisms, we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD: two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved (50–99%) aa; relatively few are in fully conserved aa (where they might be lethal) or in poorly conserved aa, where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency. This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development. Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein. In view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects, this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes.—Notaro, N., Afolayan, A., Luzzatto, L.

https://openalex.org/W2319636149,"The human PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene encodes a phosphatase with specificity towards the D3 phosphate of phosphatidylinositides. PTEN mutations have been reported in the endometrioid type of uterine tumors which are associated with frequent activations of the Ras oncogenes. In this study, we report the ability of PTEN to potently inhibit H-Ras induced morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth in NIH3T3 cells. This novel activity of PTEN was correlated more with its ability to suppress the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-dependent signaling cascade, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To define the minimal region in PTEN protein that is responsible for this anti-oncogenic activity, a panel of carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants was generated. While deletions of 4 and 33 amino acids do not have marked effects, removal of up to 68 amino acids drastically reduced the ability of PTEN to inhibit Ras transformation. The propensity of these mutants to suppress Ras transformation is correlated with their relative ability to dephosphorylate inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate in vitro, and to suppress Akt kinase activity in cultured cells. In addition, we have evidence to suggest that the C-terminal region of PTEN contributes to the stability of the encoded gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1919789442,"Fatty acids are thought to play a role in the activity of uncoupling proteins (UCP) and have been shown to regulate the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in fatty acid handling. Therefore, we investigated whether fatty acids, which are the main substrates for the heart, affect rat cardiac UCP-2 expression in vivo and in vitro. After birth, when the contribution of fatty acid oxidation to cardiac energy conversion increases, UCP-2 expression enhanced rapidly. In the adult heart, however, UCP-2 mRNA levels did not alter during conditions associated with either enhanced (fasting, diabetes) or decreased (hypertrophy) fatty acid utilization. Exposure of neonatal cardiomyocytes and embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells to fatty acids (palmitic and oleic acid) for 48 h strongly induced UCP-2 expression. Stimulation of neonatal cardiomyocytes with triiodothyronine also increased UCP-2 mRNA levels, though only in the presence of fatty acids. Ligands specific to the fatty acid-activated transcription factor PPARalpha, but not to PPARgamma, acted as inducers of cardiomyocyte UCP-2 expression. It is concluded that fatty acids promote UCP-2 expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes, which might explain the rapid increase in UCP-2 mRNA in the postnatal heart. However, UCP-2 mRNA levels in the adult heart appear to be insensitive to changes in cardiac fatty acid handling under various pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2325220074,"Chromosome 18q is lost a high proportion of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Three candidate tumor suppressor genes, DCC, Smad4 and Smad2 have been identified in this chromosome region. DCC and Smad4 aberrations have been previously identified in pancreatic and colorectal tumors. The aim of this study was to compare the presence of concurrent genetic aberrations in DCC and neighboring Smad4 and Smad2 genes during colorectal and pancreatic distal dissemination. We have used a panel of orthotopically implanted colorectal and pancreatic xenografts and corresponding metastases. We have shown that while LOH at DCC locus occurred at a similar frequency in both tumors, diminished DCC protein expression was exclusively present in colorectal tumors harboring intragenic DCC LOH. In contrast, in pancreatic xenografts loss of DCC protein and mRNA expression was restricted to metastases. Smad4 gene aberrations were detected at a similar frequency in both tumors and were selected for during distal dissemination. Acquisition of alterations in both genes occurred independently. Our results suggest that both DCC and Smad4 contribute to pancreatic and colorectal distal dissemination. However, the role of DCC may differ between both tumor types."

https://openalex.org/W1607445214,"Regulation of bone formation is important in the pathogenesis of many conditions such as osteoporosis, fracture healing, and loosening of orthopedic implants. We have recently identified a novel rat cDNA (best5) by differential display PCR that is regulated during osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vitro and in vivo. Expression of best5 mRNA is induced in cultures of osteoblasts by both interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or IFN-gamma. Whereas IFN-alpha induced a rapid, transient induction of best5 expression peaking at 4-6 h poststimulation, IFN-gamma elicited a more prolonged induction of best5 expression, which remained elevated 48 h poststimulation. A polyclonal antibody generated to a peptide derived from the best5 coding region recognized a 27 kDa protein on Western blot analysis of osteoblast lysates. We localized BEST5 protein in osteoblast progenitor cells and mature osteoblasts in sections of rat tibiae and in sections of bones loaded in vivo to induce adaptive bone formation. Best5 may therefore be a fundamental intermediate in the response of osteoblasts to stimuli that modulate proliferation/differentiation, such as interferons or mechanical loading. These findings highlight the close interactions between the immune system and bone cells and may open new therapeutic avenues in modulating bone mass."
https://openalex.org/W1546118090,"We previously showed that skeletal myocytes of the adult rabbit do not accumulate the endoplasmic reticulum glucose-regulated protein GRP94, neither constitutively nor inducibly, at variance with skeletal myocytes during perinatal development (5). Here we show that C2C12 cells up-regulate GRP94 during differentiation and, similarly to primary cultures of murine skeletal myocytes, specifically display GRP94 immunoreactivity on the cell surface. Stable transfection of C2C12 cells with grp94 antisense cDNA shows lack of myotube formation in clones displaying >40% reduction in GRP94 amount. The same result is obtained after in vivo injection of grp94-antisense myoblasts. Conversely, GRP94 overexpression is accompanied by accelerated myotube formation. Analyses of BrdU incorporation, p21 nuclear translocation, and muscle-gene expression show that muscle differentiation is not apparently affected in grp94-antisense clones. In contrast, cell-surface GRP94 is greatly reduced in grp94-antisense clones, as shown by immunocytochemistry and precipitation of cell-surface biotinylated proteins. Thus, cell-surface expression of GRP94 is necessary for maintenance of fusion competence. Furthermore, differentiating C2C12 cells grown in the presence of anti-GRP94 antibody show decreased myotube number suggesting that cell-surface GRP94 is directly involved in myoblast fusion process."

Relatively few studies have been carried out to investigate the function of MMPs during embryogenesis and postembryonic organ development. Using Xenopus development as a model system, we and others have previously isolated three MMP genes as thyroid hormone response genes. They have distinct temporal and organ-specific regulations during thyroid hormone-dependent metamorphosis. We demonstrate here that three MMPs-stromelysin-3 (ST3), collagenases-3 (Col3), and collagenases-4 (Col4)-also have distinct spatial and temporal expression profiles during embryogenesis. Consistent with earlier suggestions that ST3 is a direct thyroid hormone response gene whereas Col3 and Col4 are not, we show that precocious overexpression of thyroid hormone receptors in the presence of thyroid hormone lead to increased expression of ST3, but not Col3. Furthermore, our whole-mount in situ hybridizations reveal a tight but distinct association of individual MMPs with tissue remodeling in different regions of the animal during embryogenesis. These results suggest that ST3 is likely to play a role in ECM remodeling that facilitate apoptotic tissue remodeling or resorption, whereas Col3 and Col4 appear to participate in connective tissue degradation during development."
https://openalex.org/W1583431810,"We have previously reported that attenuation of hyperinsulinemia by diazoxide (DZ), an inhibitor of glucose-mediated insulin secretion, increased insulin sensitivity and reduced body weight in obese Zucker rats. These findings prompted us to investigate the effects of DZ on key insulin-sensitive enzymes regulating adipose tissue metabolism, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as on circulating levels of leptin. We also determined the direct effects of diazoxide on FAS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Seven-week-old female obese and lean Zucker rats were treated with DZ (150 mg/kg/d) or vehicle (C, control) for a period of 6 wk. Changes in plasma parameters by DZ include significant decreases in triglycerides, free fatty acids, glucose, and insulin, consistent with our previous reports. DZ obese rats exhibited lower plasma leptin levels (P<0.03) compared to their C animals. DZ significantly reduced adipose tissue FAS activity in both lean (P<0.0001) and obese (P<0.01) animals. LPL mRNA content was also decreased significantly in DZ-treated obese animals (P<0.009) as compared to their respective controls without a significant effect on lean animals. The possibility that DZ exerted a direct effect on adipocytes was further tested in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although diazoxide (5 microM) alone did not change FAS activity in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, it significantly attenuated insulin's effect on FAS activity (P<0.001). We demonstrate that DZ regulates key insulin-sensitive enzymes involved in regulation of adipose tissue metabolism. These findings suggest that modification of insulin-sensitive pathways can be therapeutically beneficial in obesity management."
https://openalex.org/W2324382281,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by many neurological and developmental abnormalities. CS cells are defective in the transcription coupled repair (TCR) pathway that removes DNA damage from the transcribed strand of active genes. The individuals suffering from CS do not generally develop cancer but show increased neurodegeneration. Two genetic complementation groups (CS-A and CS-B) have been identified. The lack of cancer formation in CS may be due to selective elimination of cells containing DNA damage by a suicidal pathway. In this study, we have evaluated the role of the CSB gene in UV induced apoptosis in human and hamster cells. The hamster cell line UV61 carries a mutation in the homolog of the human CSB gene. We show that both human CS-B and hamster UV61 cells display increased apoptotic response following UV exposure compared with normal cells. The increased sensitivity of UV61 cells to apoptosis is complemented by the transfection of the wild type human CSB gene. In order to determine which functional domain of the CSB gene participates in the apoptotic pathway, we constructed stable cell lines with different CSB domain disruptions. UV61 cells were stably transfected with the human CSB cDNA containing a point mutation in the highly conserved glutamic acid residue in ATPase motif II. This cell line (UV61/ pc3.1-CSBE646Q) showed the same increased apoptosis as the UV61 cells. In contrast, cells containing a deletion in the acidic domain at the N-terminal end of the CSB protein had no effect on apoptosis. This indicates that the integrity of the ATPase domain of CSB protein is critical for preventing the UV induced apoptotic pathway. In primary human CS-B cells, the induction and stabilization of the p53 protein seems to correlate with their increased apoptotic potential. In contrast, no change in the level of either p53 or activation of mdm2 protein by p53 was observed in hamster UV61 cells after UV exposure. This suggests that the CSB dependent apoptotic pathway can occur independently of the transactivation potential of p53 in hamster cells."

https://openalex.org/W1937303571,"The multidrug resistance gene product P-glycoprotein confers drug resistance to tumor cells by acting as a transporter that blocks the entry into the cell of a great variety of drugs and hydrophobic peptides. In this study we find that in drug-resistant cells, the insertion of the influenza virus fusion protein (hemagglutinin-2) into the plasma membrane is blocked and that the fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of these cells is impaired. Multidrug-resistant cells display significant resistance to infection by envelope viruses that invade cells by fusion with the plasma membrane, but not to infection by pH-dependent viruses that penetrate cells by fusion with endocytic vesicles. These observations suggest that multidrug resistance phenomena may protect cells from infection by a large group of disease-causing viruses that includes human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, and some cancer-inducing retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W1853269105,"Metabolic labeling of cells with low-energy beta-emitting radioisotopes such as [(35)S]methionine is often used to follow the biosynthesis, maturation, and degradation of proteins in vivo. Such techniques have generally been assumed to be relatively nonperturbing to the cell. The results presented here indicate that metabolic labeling of cells with [(35)S]methionine under standard experimental conditions can inhibit cell progression into mitosis, cause cell cycle arrest, inhibit cell proliferation in both short-term and colony-forming assays, alter cell morphology, and induce apoptosis over the course of several days. These results thus suggest the need for caution in interpretation of studies using such methods, especially if the experiments rely on the normal progression of the cell cycle or are intended to monitor events occurring in a normally proliferating cell."
https://openalex.org/W2312271005,"Hepatocyte growth-factor (HGF) is a potent, widely produced, pleiotropic mediator of mesenchymal-epithelial interaction. In a study of changes in gene expression initiated by HGF in Balb/MK keratinocytes, we observed the induction of Neu-differentiation factor (NDF) mRNA (also known as heregulin, or HRG). Further characterization of the regulation of NDF expression in Balb/MK keratinocytes revealed potent induction by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), but not by HGF/NK2, an alternative HGF isoform with motogenic but not mitogenic or morphogenic activities. Sustained treatment (8 h) of Balb/MK cells with KGF stimulated secretion of mature NDF protein into the culture medium, and Balb/ MK cells treated with purified recombinant NDF protein showed increased DNA synthesis. We also found evidence of NDF induction in two models of tissue repair in mice: in full-thickness skin wounds, following locally increased KGF production, and in kidney after partial hepatectomy, following elevation of circulating HGF levels. These results reveal that mesenchymally-derived HGF and KGF can activate autocrine NDF signaling in their epithelial targets, and suggest that this mechanism contributes to the coordination of stages of wound repair, and possibly development, where these growth factors act in concert to direct epithelial proliferation, morphogenesis and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1825792201,"We investigated whether and how molecular mimicry affects the shaping of the helper T cell repertoire. We implemented an algorithm that measures the probability of mimicry between epitopes of known immunogenicity and self or nonself proteomes. This algorithm yields 'similarity profiles', which represent the probability of matching between all contiguous overlapping peptides of the antigen under examination and those in the proteome(s) considered. Similarity profiles between helper T cell epitopes (of self or microbial antigens and allergens) and human or microbial SWISSPROT collections were produced. For each antigen, both collections yielded largely overlapping profiles, demonstrating that self-nonself discrimination does not rely on qualitative features that distinguish human from microbial peptides. However, epitopes whose probability of mimicry with self or nonself prevails are, respectively, tolerated or immunodominant and coexist within the same (auto-)antigen regardless of its self/nonself nature. Epitopes (on self and nonself antigens) can cross-stimulate T cells at increasing potency as their similarity with nonself augments. Mimicry, rather than complicating self-nonself discrimination, assists in the shaping of the immune repertoire and helps define the defensive or autoreactive potential of a T cell. Being a predictor of epitope immunogenicity, it bears relevance to vaccine design."

https://openalex.org/W2318491956,"The retroviral oncoprotein v-Rel is a member of the Rel/ NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. v-Rel has multiple changes as compared to the proto-oncoprotein c-Rel, and these changes render v-Rel highly oncogenic in avian lymphoid cells. Previous results have shown that three mutant residues in the eleven helper virus-derived Envelope (Env) amino acids (aa) at the N-terminus of v-Rel are required for its full oncogenicity. In this report, we show that these mutant Env aa also enable sequences in the N-terminal half of v-Rel to activate transcription in yeast and chicken cells, under conditions where the analogous sequences from c-Rel either do not or only weakly activate transcription. Removal of the Env aa from v-Rel or site-directed mutations that revert the three mutant residues to the residues present in the Rev-A helper virus Env protein abolish this transactivation ability of v-Rel. Addition of mutant Env aa onto c-Rel is not sufficient to fully restore the transactivation function; other sequences in the N-terminal half of v-Rel are needed for full transactivating ability. A C terminally-truncated form of NF-kappaB p100 (p85), produced in HUT-78 human leukemic cells, also activates transcription in yeast, under conditions where the normal p52 and p100 proteins do not. Furthermore, transcriptional activation by p85 in yeast is likely to occur through N-terminal sequences. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which transactivation by N-terminal Rel Homology (RH) domain sequences in oncogenic Rel family proteins is influenced by sequences outside the RH domain."
https://openalex.org/W2318390744,"Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) induces proliferation and sustains viability of the mouse interleukin (IL)-3 dependent lymphoid cell line BA/F3 expressing the hGM-CSF receptor. Caspase-3 like enzyme activity and DNA fragmentation were augmented by depletion of this factor from the cell, and exposure to gamma irradiation accelerated kinetics of these events. Anti gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis occurred through various mutant GM-CSF receptors and only the box1 region was essential while the C terminal region, including tyrosine residues which are required for MAPK cascade activation, was dispensable. Consistent with this notion, the addition of PD98059 had no effect on this activity thereby indicating that activation of MAPK is not essential for the activity. As expected, gamma irradiation increased p53 protein and bax mRNA levels and the presence of hGM-CSF dramatically modulated bax/bcl-X(L) ratio. The PI-3K specific inhibitor wortmannin did not affect hGM-CSF dependent anti gamma irradiation induced apoptosis nor bcl-X(L) induction, thus bcl-X(L) but not PI-3K pathway seems to be involved in hGM-CSF dependent anti gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis. It is well documented that the boxl region is essential for GM-CSF dependent activation of JAK2 and JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490 suppressed anti gamma, irradiation-induced apoptosis by hGM-CSF. An artificial JAK2 activating molecule in which extracellular and the transmembrane of beta(c) fused with whole JAK2 can sustain BA/F3 cells survival and proliferation mIL-3 independently, but these cells are susceptible to gamma irradiation. Furthermore GyrB/Jak2, which can activate STAT5 but not the MAPK cascade nor survival of BA/F3 cells, also could not prevent gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis. Although JAK2 is essential for hGM-CSF dependent anti gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis, it appeared that JAK2 does not seem sufficient for the activity."
https://openalex.org/W2315361676,"The p53 homologue p73 efficiently activates p53-responsive genes. The well documented over-expression of p73 spliced forms in a wide variety of tumor types promoted us to elucidate the mechanisms underlying p73-mediated transcription. Using the luciferase reporter gene driven by Mdm2-minimal promoter in p53 null cells, we demonstrate that the weak transcriptional activity mediated by p73alpha was increased by the mutant form p73beta292, which by itself is transcriptionally inactive. Similarly, cooperation between p73beta and an inactive form of p73alpha increased p73beta-mediated transcriptional activities. Conversely, p73beta elicited a silencing effect on a gain of function mutant, p53(281), which by itself mediated efficient transactivation of the MDR promoter. Neither anisomycin nor actinomycin D altered p73-mediated transcriptional activities, whereas sorbitol profoundly inhibited them through a rapid proteasome-dependent degradation of p73. Our observations point to plausible scenarios in which p73, through cooperation between p73 spliced forms and suppression of gain of function mutant p53 may elicit changes in the transcription of p53 target genes that play key roles in cell growth and death."

https://openalex.org/W2322960323,"The elements of the cell cycle regulatory machinery activated by the oncogenic form of Ras, [Lys61]N-Ras, have been analysed in NIH3T3 cells. We demonstrate that [Lys61]N-Ras expression is able to induce full cdk4 activation. As already reported, oncogenic Ras expression was sufficient to induce cyclin D1 and p21cip1 expression and their association with cdk4. Furthermore, serum-starved [Lys61]N-Ras NIH3T3 cells showed nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 and cdk4 not observed in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells. This accumulation of cdk4 into the cell nucleus observed in serum-starved [Lys61]N-Ras NIH3T3 cells was inhibited by a microinjection of neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies. Thus, active [Lys61]N-Ras was a sufficient signal to induce nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1/cdk4, leading to its full activation. Transfection of [Lys61]N-Ras NIH3T3 cells with an inactive form of MEK or their treatment with PD 98059, showed that nuclear translocation of cdk4 was MEK dependent. Interestingly, cells constitutively expressing [Lys61]N-Ras did not inactivate pRb and did not proliferate in the absence of serum. This may be due to the fact that although association of cdk2 with cyclin E and the translocation of those complexes to the nucleus were achieved, [Lys61]N-Ras expression was not sufficient to induce cdk2 activation. The high levels of p27kip1 that were found in cyclin E/cdk2 complexes may be responsible for the inability of oncogenic Ras to activate this kinase. In consequence, oncogenic alterations that lead to a decrease in p27kip1 bound to cyclin E may cooperate with Ras to induce full cdk2 activation, pRb inactivation and thus cell proliferation."
