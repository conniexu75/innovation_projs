https://openalex.org/W2877882896,"Covalent organic frameworks writ large Covalent organic framework (COF) materials have been difficult to characterize structurally and to exploit because they tend to form powders or amorphous materials. Ma et al. studied a variety of three-dimensional COFs based on imine linkages (see the Perspective by Navarro). They found that the addition of aniline inhibited nucleation and allowed the growth of crystals large enough for single-crystal x-ray diffraction studies. Evans et al. describe a two-step process in which nanoscale seeds of boronate ester–linked two-dimensional COFs can be grown into micrometer-scale single crystals by using a solvent that suppresses the nucleation of additional nanoparticles. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed superior charge transport in these crystallites compared with that observed in conventional powders. Science , this issue p. 48 , p. 52 ; see also p. 35"
https://openalex.org/W2622379974,"Engineering coherent systems is a central goal of quantum science. Color centers in diamond are a promising approach, with the potential to combine the coherence of atoms with the scalability of a solid state platform. However, the solid environment can adversely impact coherence. For example, phonon- mediated spin relaxation can induce spin decoherence, and electric field noise can change the optical transition frequency over time. We report a novel color center with insensitivity to both of these sources of environmental decoherence: the neutral charge state of silicon vacancy (SiV0). Through careful material engineering, we achieve over 80% conversion of implanted silicon to SiV0. SiV0 exhibits excellent spin properties, with spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) approaching one minute and coherence times (T2) approaching one second, as well as excellent optical properties, with approximately 90% of its emission into the zero-phonon line and near-transform limited optical linewidths. These combined properties make SiV0 a promising defect for quantum networks."

It is therefore common to model reactions by using potential energy surfaces that depict nuclear motion in a particular electronic state. However, in certain cases, two such surfaces connect in a conical intersection that mingles ultrafast electronic and nuclear rearrangements. Yang et al. used electron diffraction to obtain time-resolved images of CF 3 I molecules traversing a conical intersection in the course of photolytic cleavage of the C–I bond (see the Perspective by Fielding).

To better understand how present-day breeds and populations reflect their introduction to the New World, Ní Leathlobhair et al. sequenced the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of ancient dogs (see the Perspective by Goodman and Karlsson). The earliest New World dogs were not domesticated from North American wolves but likely originated from a Siberian ancestor. Furthermore, these lineages date back to a common ancestor that coincides with the first human migrations across Beringia. This lineage appears to have been mostly replaced by dogs introduced by Europeans, with the primary extant lineage remaining as a canine transmissible venereal tumor.

To investigate the history of the goat, Daly et al. sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear sequences from ancient specimens ranging from hundreds to thousands of years in age. Multiple wild populations contributed to the origin of modern goats during the Neolithic. Over time, one mitochondrial type spread and became dominant worldwide. However, at the whole-genome level, modern goat populations are a mix of goats from different sources and provide evidence for a multilocus process of domestication in the Near East. Furthermore, the patterns described support the idea of multiple dispersal routes out of the Fertile Crescent region by domesticated animals and their human counterparts. Science , this issue p. 85"

However, to deterministically control an optical signal with a single photon requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which have been lacking in a solid-state platform. We realize a single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons, with a switching time of 63 ps. Our results show that semiconductor nanophotonic devices can produce strong and controlled photon-photon interactions that could enable high-bandwidth photonic quantum information processing."

It is mainly used to make plastic, although its ready availability incentivizes its expanded use in pharmaceutical synthesis. Pagar and RajanBabu now report that a cobalt catalyst can couple ethylene with enynes (another comparatively inexpensive feedstock bearing carbon-carbon double and triple bonds) to make complex chiral molecules. Initially, the ethylene reacts with the enyne's triple bond to form an isolable cyclobutene compound. At longer reaction times, the same catalyst can add a second equivalent of ethylene enantioselectively to form cyclobutanes with a quaternary chiral carbon center. Science , this issue p. 68"

Exposure to air pollution during embryonic and early-life development can result in placental epigenetic modification and foetus reprogramming, which can influence disease susceptibility in later life. Objectives: The aim of this paper was to investigate the placental adaptation in the level of global DNA methylation and differential gene expression in the methylation cycle in new-borns exposed to high fine particulate matter in the foetal stage. Study design This is a nested case-control study. We enrolled pregnant healthy women attending prenatal care clinics in Tehran, Iran, who were residents of selected polluted and unpolluted regions, before the 14th week of pregnancy. We calculated the regional background levels of particle mass- particles with aerodynamics diameter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10)—of two regions of interest. At the time of delivery, placental tissue was taken for gene expression and DNA methylation analyses. We also recorded birth outcomes (the new-born’s sex, birth date, birth weight and length, head and chest circumference, gestational age, Apgar score, and level of neonatal care required). Results As regards PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in different time windows of pregnancy, there were significantly independent positive correlations between PM10 and PM2.5 in the first trimester of all subjects and placental global DNA methylation levels (p-value = 0.01, p-value = 0.03, respectively). The gene expression analysis showed there was significant correlation between S-adenosylmethionine expression and PM2.5 (p = 0.003) and PM10 levels in the first trimester (p = 0.03). Conclusion Our data showed prenatal exposures to air pollutants in the first trimester could influence placental adaptation by DNA methylation."

These neurons were activated by food deprivation or hunger hormone. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicated that these cells are necessary and sufficient to control systemic metabolic balance.

In this study we evaluate a program to systematically conduct advance care planning (ACP) communication for hospitalized patients in Taiwan and identify the factors associated with AD completion.In this retrospective evaluation of a clinical ACP program, we identified adult patients with chronic life-limiting illness admitted to Taipei City Hospital between April 2015 and January 2016. Trained healthcare providers held an ACP meeting to discuss patients' preference regarding end-of-life care and AD completion. A multiple logistic regression was performed to determine the factors associated with the AD completion.A total of 2878 patients were determined to be eligible for ACP during the study, among which 1798 (62.5%) completed ACP and data was available for 1411 patients (49.1%). Of the 1411 patients who received ACP communication with complete data, the rate of AD completion was 82.6%. The overall mean (SD) age was 78.2 (14.4) years. Adjusting for other variables, AD completion was associated with patients aged ≥ 85 years [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.80, 95% CI 1.21-2.67], critical illness (AOR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.30), and social workers participating in ACP meetings (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.24-2.45).The majority of inpatients with chronic life-limiting illness had ACP communication as part of this ACP program and over 80% completed an AD. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing ACP discussion in East Asia and suggests that social workers may be an important component of ACP communication with patients."
https://openalex.org/W2812187546,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems against invading nucleic acids. CRISPR locus variability has been exploited in evolutionary and epidemiological studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, for over 20 yr, yet the biological function of this type III-A system is largely unexplored. Here, using cell biology and biochemical, mutagenic, and RNA-seq approaches, we show it is active in invader defense and has features atypical of type III-A systems: mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in its crRNA-CRISPR/Cas protein complex are of uniform length (∼71 nt) and appear not to be subject to 3′-end processing after Cas6 cleavage of repeat RNA 8 nt from its 3′ end. crRNAs generated resemble mature crRNA in type I systems, having both 5′ (8 nt) and 3′ (28 nt) repeat tags. Cas6 cleavage of repeat RNA is ion dependent, and accurate cleavage depends on the presence of a 3′ hairpin in the repeat RNA and the sequence of its stem base nucleotides. This study unveils further diversity among CRISPR/Cas systems and provides insight into the crRNA recognition mechanism in M. tuberculosis, providing a foundation for investigating the potential of a type III-A–based genome editing system.—Wei, W., Zhang, S., Fleming, J., Chen, Y., Li, Z., Fan, S., Liu, Y., Wang, W., Wang, T., Liu, Y., Ren, B., Wang, M., Jiao, J., Chen, Y., Zhou, Y., Zhou, Y., Gu, S., Zhang, X., Wan, L., Chen, T., Zhou, L., Chen, Y., Zhang, X.-E., Li, C., Zhang, H., Bi, L.

https://openalex.org/W2823283959,"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and analgesic drugs, such as N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP; acetaminophen, paracetamol), are widely used by pregnant women. Accumulating evidence has indicated that these molecules can favor genital malformations in newborn boys and reproductive disorders in adults. However, the consequences on postnatal testis development and adult reproductive health after exposure during early embryo-genesis are still unknown. Using the mouse model, we show that in utero exposure to therapeutic doses of the widely used APAP-ibuprofen combination during the sex determination period leads to early differentiation and decreased proliferation of male embryonic germ cells, and early 5-mefhylcytosine and extracellular matrix protein deposition in 13.5 d postcoitum exposed testes. Consequently, in postnatal testes, Sertoli-cell maturation is delayed, the Leydig-cell compartment is hyperplasia and the spermatogonia A pool is decreased. This results in a reduced production of testosterone and in epididymal sperm parameter defects. We observed a reduced sperm count (19%) in utero–exposed (FO) adult males and also a reduced sperm motility (40%) in their offspring (Fl) when both parents were exposed, which leads to subfertility among the 6 mo old Fl animals. Our study suggests that the use of these drugs during the critical period of sex determination affects the germ-line development and leads to adverse effects that could be passed to the offspring.—Rossitto, M., Marchive, C., Pruvost, A., Sellem, E., Ghettas, A., Badiou, S., Sutra, T., Poulat, F., Philibert, P., Boizet-Bonhoure, B.

Kidney and heart failure are frequent complications in adulthood and greatly contribute to patient morbidity and mortality. Because α-Gal A-deficient mouse models do not recapitulate cardiorenal findings observed in patients, a nonmouse model may be beneficial to our understanding of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated disease processes in a recently generated Fabry rat model. We found that male Fabry rats weighed significantly less than wild-type (WT) males, whereas female Fabry rats weighed significantly more than WT females. Whereas no difference in female survival was detected, we observed that male Fabry rats had a decreased lifespan. Skin histology revealed that inflammation and lipoatrophy may be chief disease mediators in patients. With respect to the kidney and heart, we found that both organs accumulate α-Gal A substrates, including the established biomarkers, globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine. Longitudinal serum and urine chemistry panels demonstrated pronounced renal tubule dysfunction, which was confirmed histologically. Mitral valve thickening was observed in Fabry rats using echocardiography.

https://openalex.org/W2828488839,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection triggers the induction of type IIFN, which is mediated by melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 recognition of the viral genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). However, the mechanism of IBDV overcoming the type I IFN antiviral response remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that IBDV genomic dsRNA selectively binds to the host cellular RNA binding protein Staufen1 (STAU1) in vitro and in vivo. The viral dsRNA binding region was mapped to the N-terminal moiety of STAU1 (residues 1–468). Down-regulation of STAU1 impaired IBDV replication and enhanced IFN-β transcription in response to IBDV infection, while having little effect on the viral attachment to the host cells and cellular entry. Conversely, over-expression of STAU1 but not the IBDV dsRNA–binding deficient STAU1 mutant (469–702) led to a suppression of IBDV dsRNA–induced IFN-β promoter activity. Moreover, we found that the binding of STAU1 to IBDV dsRNA decreased the association of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 but not VP3 with the IBDV dsRNA in vitro. Finally, we showed that STAU1 and VP3 suppressed IFN-β gene transcription in response to IBDV infection in an additive manner. Collectively, these findings provide a novel insight into the evasive strategies used by IBDV to escape the host IFN antiviral response.—Ye, C., Yu, Z., Xiong, Y., Wang, Y., Ruan, Y., Guo, Y., Chen, M., Luan, S., Zhang, E., Liu, H.

https://openalex.org/W2853149132,"Late blight and Guatemalan potato tuber moth caused by Phytophthora infestans and Tecia solanivora, respectively, are major phytosanitary problems on potato crops in Colombia and Ecuador. Hence, the development of resistant cultivars is an alternative for their control. However, breeding initiatives for durable resistance using molecular tools are limited due to the genome complexity and high heterozygosity in autotetraploid potatoes. To contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis underlying the resistance to P. infestans and T. solanivora in potato, the aim of this study was to identify QTLs for resistance to P. infestans and T. solanivora using a F1 tetraploid potato segregant population for both traits. Ninety-four individuals comprised this population. Parent genotypes and their progeny were genotyped using SOLCAP 12K potato array. Forty-five percent of the markers were polymorphic. A genetic linkage map was built with a length of 968.4 cM and 1,287 SNPs showing good distribution across the genome. Severity and incidence were evaluated in two crop cycles for two years. QTL analysis revealed six QTLs linked to P. infestans, four of these related to previous QTLs reported, and two novel QTLs (qrAUDPC-3 and qrAUDPC-8). Fifteen QTLs were linked to T. solanivora, being qIPC-6 and qOPA-6.1, and qIPC-10 and qIPC-10.1 stable in two different trials. This study is one of the first to identify QTLs for T. solanivora. As the population employed is a breeding population, results will contribute significantly to breeding programs to select resistant plant material, especially in countries where P. infestans and T. solanivora limit potato production."
https://openalex.org/W2849621418,"Bacterial pore-forming toxins compromise plasmalemmal integrity, leading to Ca2+ influx, leakage of the cytoplasm, and cell death. Such lesions can be repaired by microvesicular shedding or by the endocytic uptake of the injured membrane sites. Cells have at their disposal an entire toolbox of repair proteins for the identification and elimination of membrane lesions. Sphingomyelinases catalyze the breakdown of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphocholine. Sphingomyelin is predominantly localized in the outer leaflet, where it is hydrolyzed by acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) after lysosomal fusion with the plasma membrane. The magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (NSM)-2 is found at the inner leaflet of the plasmalemma. Because either sphingomyelinase has been ascribed a role in the cellular stress response, we investigated their role in plasma membrane repair and cellular survival after treatment with the pore-forming toxins listeriolysin O (LLO) or pneumolysin (PLY). Jurkat T cells, in which ASM or NSM-2 was down-regulated [ASM knockdown (KD) or NSM-2 KD cells], showed inverse reactions to toxin-induced membrane damage: ASM KD cells displayed reduced toxin resistance, decreased viability, and defects in membrane repair. In contrast, the down-regulation of NSM-2 led to an increase in viability and enhanced plasmalemmal repair. Yet, in addition to the increased plasmalemmal repair, the enhanced toxin resistance of NSM-2 KD cells also appeared to be dependent on the activation of p38/MAPK, which was constitutively activated, whereas in ASM KD cells, the p38/MAPK activation was constitutively blunted.-Schoenauer, R., Larpin, Y., Babiychuk, E.

This was a retrospective analysis of relationships between odontogenic or non-odontogenic tumors or cysts and the GT that were visualized using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). The relationship between the size of a mass and expansion of the GT in all odontogenic tumors or cysts to which GTs were contiguous on MDCT, was statistically analyzed. Intact or expanded GTs were detected in MDCT images on the top of almost all odontogenic tumors or cysts, but not on non-odontogenic tumors or cysts. Characteristic image findings regarding the relationship between the GT and the odontogenic mass were detected for the respective odontogenic tumors or cysts in which the GTs were contiguous to the mass on MDCT. In ameloblastomas, expansion of the GTs significantly and very strongly correlated with tumor size (r = 0.741, p = 0.0001), but this correlation was very weak in dentigerous cysts (r = 0.167, p = 0.028) and there was no correlation between these parameters in odontogenic keratocysts (r = -0.089, p = 0.557).

We selected 112 patients (51 (46.4%) women; mean age 51.4±16 years; 102 macroadenomas (91.9%), 9 microadenomas (8.1%)) with complete clinical, radiological, immunohistochemical and molecular data from our data set of pituitary neuroendocrine tumours. Patients were different from those previously studied. We measured the expression of the pituitary-specific hormone genes and type 1 corticotrophin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin 1b receptors, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan probes. Afterwards, we identified the different pituitary neuroendocrine tumour subtypes following the 2017 World Health Organization classification of pituitary tumours, calculating the concordance between their molecular and immuhistochemical identification. The concordance between molecular and immunohistochemical identification of functioning pituitary neuroendocrine tumours with the clinical diagnosis was globally similar to the previous series, where the SYBR Green technique was used instead of TaqMan probes. Our results also corroborated the poor correlation between molecular and immunohistochemical detection of the silent pituitary neuroendocrine tumour variants. This discrepancy was more remarkable in lactotroph, null-cell and plurihormonal pituitary neuroendocrine tumours. In conclusion, this study validates the results previously published by our group, highlighting a complementary role for the molecular study of the pituitary-specific hormone genes in the typification of pituitary neuroendocrine tumours subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W2876340681,"Climate change projections show that temperature and precipitation increases can alter the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and high latitude landscapes, including their freshwaters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in greenhouse gas emissions, but the impact of catchment productivity on DOC release to subarctic waters remains poorly known, especially at regional scales. We test the hypothesis that increased terrestrial productivity, as indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), generates higher stream DOC concentrations in the Stordalen catchment in subarctic Sweden. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the degree to which other generic catchment properties (elevation, slope) explain DOC concentration, and whether or not land cover variables representing the local vegetation type (e.g., mire, forest) need to be included to obtain adequate predictive models for DOC delivered into rivers. We show that the land cover type, especially the proportion of mire, played a dominant role in the catchment’s release of DOC, while NDVI, slope, and elevation were supporting predictor variables. The NDVI as a single predictor showed weak and inconsistent relationships to DOC concentrations in recipient waters, yet NDVI was a significant positive regulator of DOC in multiple regression models that included land cover variables. Our study illustrates that vegetation type exerts primary control in DOC regulation in Stordalen, while productivity (NDVI) is of secondary importance. Thus, predictive multiple linear regression models for DOC can be utilized combining these different types of explanatory variables."
https://openalex.org/W2851671364,"Background The Belgian Superior Health Council (SHC) recently added a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to its recommendations for adult pneumococcal vaccination. This study addresses the policy question regarding whether a single dose of PCV13 should be reimbursed among Belgian adults aged 65–84 years with chronic comorbidities (“moderate-risk”) or immunosuppression (“high-risk”). Methods A cohort model was developed to project lifetime risks, consequences, and costs of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Parameter values were estimated using published literature and available databases, and were reviewed by Belgian experts. PCV13 effectiveness was assumed to be durable during the first 5 years following receipt, and to progressively decline thereafter with 15 years protection. The Belgian National Health Insurance perspective was employed. Results Use of PCV13 (vs. no vaccine) in moderate/high-risk persons aged 65–84 years (n = 861,467; 58% vaccination coverage) would be expected to prevent 527 cases of IPD, 1,744 cases of pneumococcal CAP and 176 pneumococcal-related deaths, and reduce medical care costs by €20.1 million. Vaccination costs, however, would increase by €36.9 million and thus total overall costs would increase by €16.8 million. Cost per QALY gained was €17,126. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, use of PCV13 was cost-effective in 97% of 1,000 simulations. Conclusions Reimbursement of PCV13 in moderate/high-risk Belgian adults aged 65–84 years would be cost-effective from the Belgian healthcare perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2866610756,"Migration of placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells into uterine decidua facilitates the establishment of blood circulation between mother and fetus and is modulated by EVT-decidual cell interaction. Poor or excessive EVT migration is associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia or placenta accreta. Glial cells missing 1 (GCM1) transcription factor is essential for placental development, and decreased GCM1 activity is detected in preeclampsia. To study whether GCM1 regulates trophoblast cell migration, here we showed that GCM1 promotes BeWo and JAR trophoblast cell migration through a novel target gene, WNT10B. Moreover, WNT10B signaling stimulated cytoskeletal remodeling via Rac1 and frizzled 7 (FZD7) was identified as the cognate receptor for WNT10B to up-regulate cell migration. We further showed that secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (SFRP3) is expressed in uterine decidual cells by immunohistochemistry and that SFRP3 expression in telomerase-transformed human endometrial stromal cells (T-HESCs) is elevated under decidualization stimuli and further enhanced by bone morphogenetic protein 2 via SMAD1. SFRP3 blocked the interaction between FZD7 and WNT10B to decrease BeWo cell migration, which corroborated the elevated BeWo cell migration when cocultured with decidualized and SFRP3-knockdown T-HESC monolayer.

In this paper, we propose a system that enables users to schedule programs considering both section video clips and full video clips based on the user detection method with similar preference. And, since the system constituting the contents can be classified according to the program, the proposed method can store a program desired by the user, and thus create and schedule a kind of individual channel. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a higher prediction accuracy; this is accomplished by comparing existing channel recommendation methods with the program recommendation methods proposed in this paper."

However, working in interdisciplinary teams requires the integration of many concepts and a large amount of effort. To help healthcare managers and professionals identify the strengths and weaknesses of their interdisciplinary team and to ensure its continuous improvement, we developed a tool called the IPC65.The purpose of this study was to test the reliability and validity of the IPC65.Based on a comprehensive review of the literature and qualitative and quantitative assessments, the IPC65 was developed. In this study, the analysis was based on 392 healthcare professionals and managers from short-term care settings who provided valid responses throughout the province of Quebec in Canada. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha values, and inter-item correlations were measured, and a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted. Item discrimination was used to provide an improved version of the IPC65.The IPC65 showed good statistical results. The discriminant procedure provided the basis for shortening and improving the IPC65 to form the IPC59. Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.857 to 0.967 in IPC59, demonstrating very good reliability for all four dimensions. The PCA showed good validity.The IPC59 can be used to assess the degree of integration of key concepts leading to interdisciplinarity."

LAMI was assessed by both TUI and MP ultrasounds. Concordance of these two testing results was analyzed. Their correlations with clinical symptoms were also studied.A total of 135 women were included. All the patients with POP had a minimal LAMI depth ≥ 7 mm. Two examinations, TUI and MP, had satisfactory concordance (k = 0.71, P < 0.01). Depth of LAMI in the coronal plane demonstrated good agreement with TUI scores (r = 0.84; P < 0.01). After controlling for age, BMI, and parity, to have clinically significant POP and POP symptoms, the odds ratios (ORs) for the depth of LAMI in the coronal plane were 1.31 (95% CI 1.19-1.44) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.14-1.36), and for TUI scores were 1.72 (95% CI 1.37-2.17) and 1.63 (95% CI 1.31-2.03). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed a cutoff depth of 7 mm of LAMI yielded a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 80% for POP symptoms.TUI and MP had satisfactory concordance in detecting LAMI and correlated with clinical symptoms of POP."

If I was careless with the mangosteen and papaya in my little tropical island bungalow, the ants were sure to invade—and end up squashed among the keys as I pushed out the morning's emails. I would often end up singing “the ants go marching one by one” while trying to reroute them out the door with sticky trails of decoy papaya juice. (“Hurrah! Hurrah!”) This was not a problem I expected to encounter as part of running my scientific editing business. But it was the price—a small one—of my life as a digital nomad.

> “All I would need was a computer and an internet connection.” 

I've always been a travel junkie. Vacations never cut it, so during my Ph.D. and postdoc in biogeography, I traveled for work anytime I could. But eventually, even the rare desk days became too much. After a visit to the Paris herbarium, where I was sorting through 150-year-old dried tree ferns for my postdoc research, I decided it was time. I needed to be somewhere lush and green, among living ferns.

Just a week later, a professor in my department insisted on paying me for my work editing his manuscripts. I had helped many colleagues and friends with this type of work over the years. I enjoyed writing and helping out. But the professor's offer triggered a realization: I could make a living with this work. Even better, all I would need was a computer and an internet connection fast enough to email Word documents and support the occasional Skype call. The adventurer in me saw an opportunity. My postdoc ended 6 months later, and many of my colleagues said they would consider hiring me to edit their manuscripts or books. I was ready to take the leap.

Work was slow at first. When I emailed my network to let people know I was officially in business, many expressed interest but didn't have projects ready for me. I had expected this, so—despite fleeting doubts about the course I had chosen—I remained patient. Every day the work emails failed to show up was another chance to explore and find my nomadic rhythm. I trained to be a divemaster in the fast-moving waters between the islands of Bali and Lombok, the famous division that separates Asian and Australian faunas. I loved diving at Bali's Manta Point, where reef manta rays twice my size glided around me. I watched the sun rise over pagodas in Myanmar, saw ash spewing from Volcan de Fuego in Guatemala, ate schnitzel in the Austrian Alps, and felt the earth shake in New Zealand. When people asked how long I was traveling, I responded, “As long as I want,” feeling impossibly lucky.

Yet in the beginning, while I was only getting work sporadically, I sometimes wondered what I was doing. Was I really an editor, or was I just a vagabond with a computer? I began reflecting on what defines a profession. Was it working 40 (or more) hours a week? Making ends meet? Was it enough to have a business plan and a passion? For a while, I tried to figure out the “right” way to do it. But as I met other digital nomads, I found that each had a unique story and there was no single right way. So I just kept doing it my way. Eventually, as the stamps in my passport piled up, my business grew. The impostor syndrome melted away. In its place I felt a contentment I never found during my years of research.

After two and a half years working and exploring in 18 different countries, I had just finished a major book project and felt that I could call my business a success. However, the now long hours meant I could no longer explore as much as I once had. When I found out that a colleague back in Sweden was creating a biodiversity center, I couldn't help but get excited about working to start it up. The job would involve some travel, which I embraced. I would get work-free vacations, too—a luxury I had come to miss. The time felt right to have a hint of stability again.

But I haven't forgotten my time of adventure. Every now and then, I come across early-career researchers thinking of trying a nontraditional path. I'm happy to give them a push away from routine and into the deep end. After all, there might be mantas down there.

https://openalex.org/W2876551716,"Plans for a controversial multibillion-dollar U.S. nuclear research reactor are coming together at lightning speed—much too fast, say some nuclear policy experts. With a push from Congress, the Department of Energy (DOE) has begun designing the Versatile Fast Neutron Source, which would be the first DOE-built reactor since the 1970s. It would generate high-energy neutrons for testing materials and fuels for so-called fast reactors. But U.S. utilities have no plans to deploy such reactors, which some analysts say pose a proliferation risk because they use plutonium, the stuff of atomic bombs. Researchers are divided on whether the reactor, which would likely be built at Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, is badly needed or a boondoggle. In March, Congress gave the project $35 million for this year, although DOE only requested $10 million. The House of Representatives and the Senate have passed separate bills that call for completing the facility by 2025, with the House bill authorizing DOE to spend $2 billion. Some experts speculate that the cost could reach $10 billion and call for an independent study of the need for the reactor before DOE goes any further with the project."
