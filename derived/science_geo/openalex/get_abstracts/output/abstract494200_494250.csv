https://openalex.org/W2086294280,"Regeneration of the heart muscle after myocardial infarction with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells is demonstrated in non-human primates, with the grafts showing evidence of electromechanical coupling, although they were also associated with non-fatal arrhythmias. Human pluripotent stem cells have proven cardiomyocyte-generating abilities and have been extensively investigated for repair of the injured heart. There is still a long way to go before cardiac regenerative medicine can become a reality, however. In this study Charles Murry and colleagues examine the ability of exogenously delivered human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) to engraft to the host myocardium in a non-human primate model of myocardial infarction. They demonstrate large-scale heart remuscularization, electromechanical coupling of the graft to the host heart, and vascularization of the graft from host vessels. The grafts showed evidence of electromechanical coupling, but non-fatal arrhythmias were also observed in hESC-CM-engrafted primates. Pluripotent stem cells provide a potential solution to current epidemic rates of heart failure1 by providing human cardiomyocytes to support heart regeneration2. Studies of human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in small-animal models have shown favourable effects of this treatment3,4,5,6,7. However, it remains unknown whether clinical-scale hESC-CM transplantation is feasible, safe or can provide sufficient myocardial regeneration. Here we show that hESC-CMs can be produced at a clinical scale (more than one billion cells per batch) and cryopreserved with good viability. Using a non-human primate model of myocardial ischaemia followed by reperfusion, we show that cryopreservation and intra-myocardial delivery of one billion hESC-CMs generates extensive remuscularization of the infarcted heart. The hESC-CMs showed progressive but incomplete maturation over a 3-month period. Grafts were perfused by host vasculature, and electromechanical junctions between graft and host myocytes were present within 2 weeks of engraftment. Importantly, grafts showed regular calcium transients that were synchronized to the host electrocardiogram, indicating electromechanical coupling. In contrast to small-animal models7, non-fatal ventricular arrhythmias were observed in hESC-CM-engrafted primates. Thus, hESC-CMs can remuscularize substantial amounts of the infarcted monkey heart. Comparable remuscularization of a human heart should be possible, but potential arrhythmic complications need to be overcome."
https://openalex.org/W2156319424,"A fusion of the FokI nuclease and a catalytically inactive Cas9 is a highly specific genome editing tool. Monomeric CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for targeted genome editing but can induce unwanted off-target mutations with high frequencies. Here we describe dimeric RNA-guided FokI nucleases (RFNs) that can recognize extended sequences and edit endogenous genes with high efficiencies in human cells. RFN cleavage activity depends strictly on the binding of two guide RNAs (gRNAs) to DNA with a defined spacing and orientation substantially reducing the likelihood that a suitable target site will occur more than once in the genome and therefore improving specificities relative to wild-type Cas9 monomers. RFNs guided by a single gRNA generally induce lower levels of unwanted mutations than matched monomeric Cas9 nickases. In addition, we describe a simple method for expressing multiple gRNAs bearing any 5′ end nucleotide, which gives dimeric RFNs a broad targeting range. RFNs combine the ease of RNA-based targeting with the specificity enhancement inherent to dimerization and are likely to be useful in applications that require highly precise genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W1981160614,"Genome editing by Cas9, which cleaves double-stranded DNA at a sequence programmed by a short single-guide RNA (sgRNA), can result in off-target DNA modification that may be detrimental in some applications. To improve DNA cleavage specificity, we generated fusions of catalytically inactive Cas9 and FokI nuclease (fCas9). DNA cleavage by fCas9 requires association of two fCas9 monomers that simultaneously bind target sites ∼15 or 25 base pairs apart. In human cells, fCas9 modified target DNA sites with >140-fold higher specificity than wild-type Cas9 and with an efficiency similar to that of paired Cas9 'nickases', recently engineered variants that cleave only one DNA strand per monomer. The specificity of fCas9 was at least fourfold higher than that of paired nickases at loci with highly similar off-target sites. Target sites that conform to the substrate requirements of fCas9 occur on average every 34 bp in the human genome, suggesting the versatility of this approach for highly specific genome-wide editing."
https://openalex.org/W1987835826,"This paper describes the deployment of a large-scale study designed to measure human interactions across a variety of communication channels, with high temporal resolution and spanning multiple years—the Copenhagen Networks Study. Specifically, we collect data on face-to-face interactions, telecommunication, social networks, location, and background information (personality, demographics, health, politics) for a densely connected population of 1 000 individuals, using state-of-the-art smartphones as social sensors. Here we provide an overview of the related work and describe the motivation and research agenda driving the study. Additionally, the paper details the data-types measured, and the technical infrastructure in terms of both backend and phone software, as well as an outline of the deployment procedures. We document the participant privacy procedures and their underlying principles. The paper is concluded with early results from data analysis, illustrating the importance of multi-channel high-resolution approach to data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2050903472,"The solution and crystal structures of a bacterial phytochrome photosensory core in both its resting and activated states are determined; switching between closed (resting) and open (activated) forms is found to be mediated by a conserved ‘tongue’, and the structures indicate that smaller changes in the vicinity of the chromophore are amplified in scale as they are transmitted through the tongue and beyond. The crystal structure of the photosensory core of a bacterial phytochrome in both the resting and the active (illuminated) state has now been solved. Working with the phytochrome from the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans, Sebastian Westenhoff and colleagues demonstrate that toggling between resting and active forms is mediated by a conserved 'tongue' that contacts the chromophore. Atomic-scale structural changes in the vicinity of the chromophore are amplified as they are transmitted through the tongue and beyond, culminating in a nanometre-scale conformational signal that feeds into the rest of the cellular signalling network. Sensory proteins must relay structural signals from the sensory site over large distances to regulatory output domains. Phytochromes are a major family of red-light-sensing kinases that control diverse cellular functions in plants, bacteria and fungi1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Bacterial phytochromes consist of a photosensory core and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain10,11. Structures of photosensory cores are reported in the resting state12,13,14,15,16,17,18 and conformational responses to light activation have been proposed in the vicinity of the chromophore19,20,21,22,23. However, the structure of the signalling state and the mechanism of downstream signal relay through the photosensory core remain elusive. Here we report crystal and solution structures of the resting and activated states of the photosensory core of the bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans. The structures show an open and closed form of the dimeric protein for the activated and resting states, respectively. This nanometre-scale rearrangement is controlled by refolding of an evolutionarily conserved ‘tongue’, which is in contact with the chromophore. The findings reveal an unusual mechanism in which atomic-scale conformational changes around the chromophore are first amplified into an ångstrom-scale distance change in the tongue, and further grow into a nanometre-scale conformational signal. The structural mechanism is a blueprint for understanding how phytochromes connect to the cellular signalling network."
https://openalex.org/W2144117535,"Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the central nervous system, promote synapse formation and help to refine neural connectivity. Although they are allocated to spatially distinct regional domains during development, it is unknown whether region-restricted astrocytes are functionally heterogeneous. Here we show that postnatal spinal cord astrocytes express several region-specific genes, and that ventral astrocyte-encoded semaphorin 3a (Sema3a) is required for proper motor neuron and sensory neuron circuit organization. Loss of astrocyte-encoded Sema3a leads to dysregulated α-motor neuron axon initial segment orientation, markedly abnormal synaptic inputs, and selective death of α- but not of adjacent γ-motor neurons. In addition, a subset of TrkA(+) sensory afferents projects to ectopic ventral positions. These findings demonstrate that stable maintenance of a positional cue by developing astrocytes influences multiple aspects of sensorimotor circuit formation. More generally, they suggest that regional astrocyte heterogeneity may help to coordinate postnatal neural circuit refinement."
https://openalex.org/W2013629587,"Genistein (5,7-dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) has been previously proposed as a potential drug for use in substrate reduction therapy for mucopolysaccharidoses, a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by mutations leading to inefficient degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. It was demonstrated that this isoflavone can cross the blood-brain barrier, making it an especially desirable potential drug for the treatment of neurological symptoms present in most lysosomal storage diseases. So far, no comprehensive genomic analyses have been performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect elicited by genistein. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify the genistein-modulated gene network regulating GAG biosynthesis and degradation, taking into consideration the entire lysosomal metabolism. Our analyses identified over 60 genes with known roles in lysosomal biogenesis and/or function whose expression was enhanced by genistein. Moreover, 19 genes whose products are involved in both GAG synthesis and degradation pathways were found to be remarkably differentially regulated by genistein treatment. We found a regulatory network linking genistein-mediated control of transcription factor EB (TFEB) gene expression, TFEB nuclear translocation, and activation of TFEB-dependent lysosome biogenesis to lysosomal metabolism. Our data indicate that the molecular mechanism of genistein action involves not only impairment of GAG synthesis but more importantly lysosomal enhancement via TFEB. These findings contribute to explaining the beneficial effects of genistein in lysosomal storage diseases as well as envisage new therapeutic approaches to treat these devastating diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2058100343,"Although it is well-established that the macrophage M1 to M2 transition plays a role in tumor progression, the molecular basis for this process remains incompletely understood. Herein, we demonstrate that the small GTPase, Rac2 controls macrophage M1 to M2 differentiation and the metastatic phenotype in vivo. Using a genetic approach, combined with syngeneic and orthotopic tumor models we demonstrate that Rac2-/- mice display a marked defect in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Microarray, RT-PCR and metabolomic analysis on bone marrow derived macrophages isolated from the Rac2-/- mice identify an important role for Rac2 in M2 macrophage differentiation. Furthermore, we define a novel molecular mechanism by which signals transmitted from the extracellular matrix via the α4β1 integrin and MCSF receptor lead to the activation of Rac2 and potentially regulate macrophage M2 differentiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a macrophage autonomous process by which the Rac2 GTPase is activated downstream of the α4β1 integrin and the MCSF receptor to control tumor growth, metastasis and macrophage differentiation into the M2 phenotype. Finally, using gene expression and metabolomic data from our Rac2-/- model, and information related to M1-M2 macrophage differentiation curated from the literature we executed a systems biologic analysis of hierarchical protein-protein interaction networks in an effort to develop an iterative interactome map which will predict additional mechanisms by which Rac2 may coordinately control macrophage M1 to M2 differentiation and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2059886028,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly invasive cancer with a poor prognosis. Although microRNA (miRNA) transcripts have a crucial role in carcinogenesis and development, little information is known regarding the aberrant DNA methylation of miRNAs in PDAC. Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-chip analysis, we found that miR-615-5p was hypermethylated in its putative promoter region, which silenced its expression in PDAC cell lines. In addition, the overexpression of miR-615-5p in pancreatic cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is an imprinted gene, and its abnormal expression contributes to tumor growth. Here, we identified IGF2 as a target of miR-615-5p using a luciferase reporter assay. IGF2 upregulation in PDAC tissues was not correlated with a loss of imprinting but was inversely correlated with miR-615-5p downregulation. In addition, miR-615-5p suppressed pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion by directly targeting IGF2, and this effect could be reversed by co-transfection with IGF2. Furthermore, the stable overexpression of miR-615-5p inhibited tumor growth in vivo and was correlated with IGF2 expression. Using RNA sequencing, we further identified miR-615-5p as potentially targeting other genes, such as the proto-oncogene JUNB, and interfering with the insulin signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-615-5p was abnormally downregulated in PDAC cells due to promoter hypermethylation, which limited its inhibition of IGF2 and other target genes, thereby contributing to tumor growth, invasion and migration. These data demonstrate a novel and important role of miR-615-5p as a tumor suppressor in PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2072801868,"Extensive changes in DNA methylation have been observed in schizophrenia (SC) and bipolar disorder (BP), and may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Here, we performed genome-scale DNA methylation profiling using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) on two brain regions (including frontal cortex and anterior cingulate) in 5 SC, 7 BP and 6 normal subjects. Comparing with normal controls, we identified substantial differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in these two brain regions of SC and BP. To our surprise, different brain regions show completely distinct distributions of DMRs across the genomes. In frontal cortex of both SC and BP subjects, we observed widespread hypomethylation as compared to normal controls, preferentially targeting the terminal ends of the chromosomes. In contrast, in anterior cingulate, both SC and BP subjects displayed extensive gain of methylation. Notably, in these two brain regions of SC and BP, only a few DMRs overlapped with promoters, whereas a greater proportion occurs in introns and intergenic regions. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that important psychiatric disorder-related biological processes such as neuron development, differentiation and projection may be altered by epigenetic changes located in the intronic regions. Transcriptome analysis revealed consistent dysfunctional processes with those determined by DMRs. Furthermore, DMRs in the same brain regions from SC and BP could successfully distinguish BP and/or SC from normal controls while differentially expressed genes could not. Overall, our results support a major role for brain-region-dependent aberrant DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of these two disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2050956235,"The Autobiographical Emotional Memory Task (AEMT), which involves recalling and writing about intense emotional experiences, is a widely used method to experimentally induce emotions. The validity of this method depends upon the extent to which it can induce specific desired emotions (intended emotions), while not inducing any other (incidental) emotions at different levels across one (or more) conditions. A review of recent studies that used this method indicated that most studies exclusively monitor post-writing ratings of the intended emotions, without assessing the possibility that the method may have differentially induced other incidental emotions as well. We investigated the extent of this issue by collecting both pre- and post-writing ratings of incidental emotions in addition to the intended emotions. Using methods largely adapted from previous studies, participants were assigned to write about a profound experience of anger or fear (Experiment 1) or happiness or sadness (Experiment 2). In line with previous research, results indicated that intended emotions (anger and fear) were successfully induced in the respective conditions in Experiment 1. However, disgust and sadness were also induced while writing about an angry experience compared to a fearful experience. Similarly, although happiness and sadness were induced in the appropriate conditions, Experiment 2 indicated that writing about a sad experience also induced disgust, fear, and anger, compared to writing about a happy experience. Possible resolutions to avoid the limitations of the AEMT to induce specific discrete emotions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2058784630,"The circadian clockworks gate macrophage inflammatory responses. Given the association between clock dysregulation and metabolic disorders, we conducted experiments to determine the extent to which over-nutrition modulates macrophage clock function and whether macrophage circadian dysregulation is a key factor linking over-nutrition to macrophage proinflammatory activation, adipose tissue inflammation, and systemic insulin resistance. Our results demonstrate that 1) macrophages from high fat diet-fed mice are marked by dysregulation of the molecular clockworks in conjunction with increased proinflammatory activation, 2) global disruption of the clock genes Period1 (Per1) and Per2 recapitulates this amplified macrophage proinflammatory activation, 3) adoptive transfer of Per1/2-disrupted bone marrow cells into wild-type mice potentiates high fat diet-induced adipose and liver tissue inflammation and systemic insulin resistance, and 4) Per1/2-disrupted macrophages similarly exacerbate inflammatory responses and decrease insulin sensitivity in co-cultured adipocytes in vitro. Furthermore, PPARγ levels are decreased in Per1/2-disrupted macrophages and PPARγ2 overexpression ameliorates Per1/2 disruption-associated macrophage proinflammatory activation, suggesting that this transcription factor may link the molecular clockworks to signaling pathways regulating macrophage polarization. Thus, macrophage circadian clock dysregulation is a key process in the physiological cascade by which diet-induced obesity triggers macrophage proinflammatory activation, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1999188297,"We investigated molecular features and cellular roles of PI31 (PSMF1) on regulation of proteasome function. PI31 has a C-terminal HbYX (where Hb is a hydrophobic amino acid, Y is tyrosine, and X is any amino acid) motif characteristic of several proteasome activators. Peptides corresponding to the PI31 C terminus also bind to and activate the 20 S proteasome in an HbYX-dependent manner, but intact PI31protein inhibits in vitro 20 S activity. Binding to and inhibition of the proteasome by PI31 are conferred by the HbYX-containing proline-rich C-terminal domain but do not require HbYX residues. Thus, multiple regions of PI31 bind independently to the proteasome and collectively determine effects on activity. PI31 blocks the ATP-dependent in vitro assembly of 26 S proteasome from 20 S proteasome and PA700 subcomplexes but has no effect on in vitro activity of the intact 26 S proteasome. To determine the physiologic significance of these in vitro effects, we assessed multiple aspects of cellular proteasome content and function after altering PI31 levels. We detected no change in overall cellular proteasome content or function when PI31 levels were either increased by moderate ectopic overexpression or decreased by RNA interference (RNAi). We also failed to identify a role of PI31 ADP-ribosylation as a mechanism for regulation of overall 26 S proteasome content and function, as recently proposed.

All peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by HPLC by the Protein Core Facility at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Sequences of all peptides are those of human PI31 and were verified by mass spectrometry. Binding of various PI31 proteins to 20 S proteasome was determined by pulldown assays utilizing purified bovine 20 S proteasome and either recombinant His-tagged SUMO-PI31-peptide fusion proteins or recombinant His-tagged PI31 proteins. In typical assays, 25 μl of Ni2+ beads were saturated with His-tagged protein. The beads were washed extensively to remove unbound protein and then mixed with 240 nm 20 S proteasome for 15 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in a volume of 100 μl. Some assays were conducted in the presence of 2 mm synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 10 residues of human PI31 (PPPGYDDMYL), human Rpt5 (KKKANLQYYA), or human Rpt3 (KDEQEHEFYK). After incubation, the beads were washed extensively. Bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and Western-blotted with antibodies against 20 S proteasome (α2 subunit). For glycerol density gradient centrifugation, 20 S proteasome (0.7 μm) was incubated with or without His-PI31 protein (1.5 μm) in 160 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the reaction mixture were subjected to glycerol density gradient centrifugation using 12.5–40% linear glycerol gradients in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm ATP, and 5 mm MgCl2. Gradient fractions were collected and analyzed as described in the individual figure legends. Control centrifugations established the sedimentation positions of purified bovine 26 S proteasome, PA700, and 20 S proteasome. For native PAGE, 20 S proteasome (0.8 μm) was incubated alone or with His-PI31proteins (1.6 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were then subjected to native PAGE, as described below. Gels were either stained with Ponceau S or subjected to Western blotting with anti-His antibodies. Proteasome activity was measured in vitro by determining the rate of hydrolysis of peptide and protein substrates as described previously (41Kim Y.C. Li X. Thompson D. DeMartino G.N.

Rates of production of 7-amino-4-methylcourmarin (AMC) from Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC were determined by continuous monitoring of fluorescence using a BioTek Synergy plate reader and were expressed as arbitrary fluorescent units produced per min of incubation. Proteasome-catalyzed hydrolysis of [methyl-14C]casein was determined as described previously (42McGuire M.J. DeMartino G.N.

All reported data represent initial steady state rates of hydrolysis. All assays were conducted under conditions for a linear relationship between proteasome content and enzymatic activity. Assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. For assays with purified 20 S and 26 S proteasomes, protein content was determined by Bradford assays. For assays involving comparative activities of different cell extracts, activities were normalized to total extract protein, determined by the Bradford assay, and/or to actin, determined by Western blotting. Semiquantitative measures of proteasome activity were determined by zymography after native PAGE using Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC substrate (38Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z.

Routine control reactions included preincubation and assay of 20 S proteasome and PA700 in the absence of ATP and preincubation and assay of 20 S proteasome and PA700 in the absence of the other. PA700 has no detectable peptidase activity in the absence of 20 S proteasome. 20 S proteasome activity is typically stimulated 10–20 fold by PA700 under conditions used in these assays, and stimulation is completely dependent on ATP during preincubation. Native PAGE was conducted at 4 °C in 3–8% Bis-acetate gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). After electrophoresis for 2.5 h at 150 V, gels were either stained for protein, subjected to zymography, or processed for Western blotting as described for individual experiments. HEK293 cells and HeLa cells were cultured in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose and glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and disrupted in ice-cold buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol by 15 passages through a 27-gauge needle. In some experiments the lysis buffer contained 0.1% Nonidet P-40, which had no effect on any results. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 20 min to obtain a crude soluble cell extract. Proteasomal degradation of GFP variants in intact cells was determined as described previously using HeLa cells stably expressing either ubiquitin-R-GFP or ubiquitinV76-GFP. After treatments described in legends to specific experiments, cellular GFP content was determined by Western blotting (43Wójcik C. Rowicka M. Kudlicki A. Nowis D. McConnell E. Kujawa M.

Such branch points present favorable gene targets for redirecting metabolic flux toward specific secondary metabolites. However, detailed information regarding the candidate OSCs covering different branches and their regulation is necessary for the desired genetic manipulation. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to characterize members of OSC superfamily from Withania somnifera (Ws), a medicinal plant of immense repute known to synthesize a large array of biologically active steroidal lactone triterpenoids called withanolides. Three full-length OSC cDNAs, β-amyrin synthase (WsOSC/BS), lupeol synthase (WsOSC/LS), and cycloartenol synthase (WsOSC/CS), having open reading frames of 2289, 2268, and 2277 bp, were isolated. Heterologous expression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, LC-MS analyses, and kinetic studies confirmed their monofunctionality. The three WsOSCs were found to be spatially regulated at transcriptional level with WsOSC/CS being maximally expressed in leaf tissue. Promoter analysis of three WsOSCs genes resulted in identification of distinct cis-regulatory elements. Further, transcript profiling under methyl jasmonate, gibberellic acid, and yeast extract elicitations displayed differential transcriptional regulation of each of the OSCs. Changes were also observed in mRNA levels under elicitations and further substantiated with protein expression levels by Western blotting. Negative regulation by yeast extract resulted in significant increase in withanolide content. Empirical evidence suggests that repression of competitive branch OSCs like WsOSC/BS and WsOSC/LS possibly leads to diversion of substrate pool toward WsOSC/CS for increased withanolide production."
https://openalex.org/W2141030461,"Objective The number of women aged 45 and older who become pregnant is increasing. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of medical and obstetric complications among women aged 45 and older. Methods The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify pregnant woman during admission for delivery. Deliveries were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9-CM) codes. Using ICD-9-CM codes, pre-existing medical conditions and medical and obstetric complications were identified in women at the time of delivery and were compared for women aged 45 years and older to women under age 35. Outcomes among women aged 35–44 were also compared to women under age 35 to determine if women in this group demonstrated intermediate risk between the older and younger groups. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for pre-existing medical conditions and medical and obstetric complications for both older groups relative to women under 35. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were also developed for outcomes at delivery among older women, while controlling for pre-existing medical conditions, multiple gestation, and insurance status, to determine the effect of age on the studied outcomes. Results Women aged 45 and older had higher adjusted odds for death, transfusion, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cardiac arrest, acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, acute renal failure, cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, fetal demise, fetal chromosomal anomaly, and placenta previa compared to women under 35. Conclusion Pregnant women aged 45 and older experience significantly more medical and obstetric complications and are more likely to die at the time of a delivery than women under age 35, though the absolute risks are low and these events are rare. Further research is needed to determine what associated factors among pregnant women aged 45 and older may contribute to these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2042550810,"Ocean acidification and warming are expected to threaten the persistence of tropical coral reef ecosystems. As coral reefs face multiple stressors, the distribution and abundance of corals will depend on the successful dispersal and settlement of coral larvae under changing environmental conditions. To explore this scenario, we used metabolic rate, at holobiont and molecular levels, as an index for assessing the physiological plasticity of Pocillopora damicornis larvae from this site to conditions of ocean acidity and warming. Larvae were incubated for 6 hours in seawater containing combinations of CO2 concentration (450 and 950 µatm) and temperature (28 and 30°C). Rates of larval oxygen consumption were higher at elevated temperatures. In contrast, high CO2 levels elicited depressed metabolic rates, especially for larvae released later in the spawning period. Rates of citrate synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in aerobic metabolism, suggested a biochemical limit for increasing oxidative capacity in coral larvae in a warming, acidifying ocean. Biological responses were also compared between larvae released from adult colonies on the same day (cohorts). The metabolic physiology of Pocillopora damicornis larvae varied significantly by day of release. Additionally, we used environmental data collected on a reef in Moorea, French Polynesia to provide information about what adult corals and larvae may currently experience in the field. An autonomous pH sensor provided a continuous time series of pH on the natal fringing reef. In February/March, 2011, pH values averaged 8.075±0.023. Our results suggest that without adaptation or acclimatization, only a portion of naïve Pocillopora damicornis larvae may have suitable metabolic phenotypes for maintaining function and fitness in an end-of-the century ocean."

As endurance exercise affects the endothelium, the objective of the study was to examine levels of EMP and angiogenic growth factors following different endurance exercise protocols.12 subjects performed 3 different endurance exercise protocols: 1. High volume training (HVT; 130 min at 55% peak power output (PPO); 2. 4 × 4 min at 95% PPO; 3. 4 × 30 sec all-out. EMPs were quantified using flow cytometry after staining platelet-poor-plasma. Events positive for Annexin-V and CD31, and negative for CD42b, were classified as EMPs. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), migratory inhibiting factor (MIF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were determined by ELISA technique. For all these measurements venous blood samples were taken pre, 0', 30', 60' and 180' after each intervention. Furthermore, in vitro experiments were performed to explore the effect of collected sera on target endothelial functions and MP uptake capacities.VEGF and HGF significantly increased after HIT interventions. All three interventions caused a significant decrease in EMP levels post exercise compared to pre values. The sera taken after exercise increased the uptake of EMP in target endothelial cells compared to sera taken under resting conditions, which was shown to be phosphatidylserin-dependent. Increased EMP uptake was associated with an improved protection of target cells against apoptosis. Sera taken prior and after exercise promoted target endothelial cell migration, which was abrogated after inhibition of VEGF.Physical exercise leads to decreased EMP levels and promotes a phosphatidylserin-dependent uptake of EMP into target endothelial cells, which is associated with a protection of target cells against apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2069247329,"Among the defects in the early events of insulin biosynthesis, proinsulin misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have drawn increasing attention as causes of β cell failure. However, no studies have yet addressed potential defects at the cytosolic entry point of preproinsulin into the secretory pathway. Here, we provide the first evidence that inefficient translocation of preproinsulin (caused by loss of a positive charge in the n region of its signal sequence) contributes to β cell failure and diabetes. Specifically, we find that, after targeting to the ER membrane, preproinsulin signal peptide (SP) mutants associated with autosomal dominant late-onset diabetes fail to be fully translocated across the ER membrane. The newly synthesized, untranslocated preproinsulin remains strongly associated with the ER membrane, exposing its proinsulin moiety to the cytosol. Rather than accumulating in the ER and inducing ER stress, untranslocated preproinsulin accumulates in a juxtanuclear compartment distinct from the Golgi complex, induces the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and promotes β cell death. Restoring an N-terminal positive charge to the mutant preproinsulin SP significantly improves the translocation defect. These findings not only reveal a novel molecular pathogenesis of β cell failure and diabetes but also provide the first evidence of the physiological and pathological significance of the SP n region positive charge of secretory proteins."

We defined the threshold temperature when the inflection point showed a statistically significant difference in the regression coefficients of the generalized additive models (GAMs) analysis. The analysis was performed on the following subgroups: geographical region, gender, age (<75 years or ≥ 75 years), and MI status (STEMI or non-STEMI).The threshold temperatures during heat exposure were for the maximum temperature as 25.5-31.5°C and for the mean temperature as 27.5-28.5°C. The threshold temperatures during cold exposure were for the minimum temperature as -2.5-1.5°C. Relative risks (RRs) of emergency visits above hot temperature thresholds ranged from 1.02 to 1.30 and those below cold temperature thresholds ranged from 1.01 to 1.05.

We therefore sought to determine if maintaining or increasing PGC-1α levels in the context of pressure overload hypertrophy (POH) would preserve mitochondrial function and prevent contractile dysfunction. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy was induced using 4 wk of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice overexpressing the human PGC-1α genomic locus via a bacterial artificial chromosome (TG) and non-transgenic controls (Cont). PGC-1α levels were increased by 40% in TG mice and were sustained following TAC. Although TAC-induced repression of FAO genes and oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) genes was prevented in TG mice, mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis were equivalently impaired in Cont and TG mice after TAC. Contractile function was also equally impaired in Cont and TG mice following TAC, as demonstrated by decreased +dP/dt and ejection fraction and increased left ventricular developed pressure and end diastolic pressure. Conversely, capillary density was preserved, in concert with increased VEGF expression, while apoptosis and fibrosis were reduced in TG relative to Cont mice after TAC. Hence, sustaining physiological levels of PGC-1α expression following POH, while preserving myocardial vascularity, does not prevent mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction.—Pereira, R.

The aim of this study was to determine how dietary iron derived in this fashion is absorbed in the duodenum. Following a 4 wk run-in on an Fe-deficient diet, mice with intestinal-specific disruption of the Fpn-1 gene (Fpn-KO), or littermate wild-type (WT) controls, were supplemented with Fe2+ sulfate (FeSO4), nanoFe3+, or no added Fe for a further 4 wk. A control group was Fe sufficient throughout. Direct intestinal absorption of nanoFe3+ was investigated using isolated duodenal loops. Our data show that FeSO4 and nanoFe3+ are equally bioavailable in WT mice, and at wk 8 the mean ± sem hemoglobin increase was 18 ± 7 g/L in the FeSO4 group and 30 ± 5 g/L in the nanoFe3+ group. Oral iron failed to be utilized by Fpn-KO mice and was retained in enterocytes, irrespective of the iron source. In summary, although nanoFe3+ is taken up directly by the duodenum its homeostasis is under the normal regulatory control of dietary iron absorption, namely via ferroportin-dependent efflux from enterocytes, and thus offers potential as a novel oral iron supplement.—Aslam, M.

https://openalex.org/W2139858708,"The S100A8/A9 heterodimer is abundantly expressed by myeloid cells, especially neutrophils, but its mechanism of action is only partially determined. In this study we investigated S100A8/A9 involvement in the host response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection making use of S100a9–/– mice that lack heterodimer expression in myeloid cells. S100a9–/–mice that were infected intranasally with pneumococci rapidly succumbed, with 80% mortality after 48 h, whereas the majority of wild-type mice recovered. Over this time period, S100a9–/– mice displayed an average 6-fold reduction in circulating and lung-recruited neutrophils. Taqman analysis of S100a9–/– lungs revealed decreased production of a dominant subset of 5 cytokines and chemokines associated with neutrophil recruitment. The greatest differential was with the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that causes bone marrow release of neutrophils into the circulation (1900-fold difference at 48 h). Treating S100a9–/– mice with G-CSF reversed their increased susceptibility to infection by enhancing both circulating neutrophils and neutrophil recruitment into infected lungs, by reducing pneumococcal colony forming units, and by elevation of chemokine CXCL1, cytokine IL-6, and endogenous G-CSF proteins. Thus S100A9, potentially with its partner S100A8, makes a major contribution in the host response to pneumococcal infection by increasing circulating neutrophils principally regulation of G-CSF production.—De Filippo, K., Neill, D.

https://openalex.org/W1969824786,"Objective Key molecules involved in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, such as DROSHA, XPO5, and DICER, have been identified in trophoblast cells, confirming that the miRNA biogenesis pathway is active in human placenta. In addition, miRNAs regulate uterine gene expression associated with inflammatory responses during the peri-implantation period and participate in maternal-fetal immune tolerance. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether genetic polymorphisms in miRNA machinery genes show an association with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in Korean women. Study design We performed a case-control study with 238 controls and 338 women who had experienced at least two consecutive pregnancy losses between 1999 and 2010. Genotypes of miRNA machinery genes, including DICER rs3742330, DROSHA rs10719, RAN GTPase (RAN) rs14035, and exportin-5 (XPO5) rs11077 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The logistic odds ratios (ORs) of RPL were estimated with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in multivariate analysis after maternal age adjustment. Gene-gene interactions among the loci of the four gene polymorphisms were evaluated using the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Results The RAN rs14035 CC genotype and DICER rs3742330/DROSHA rs10719 GG/TC+CC, rs3742330/RAN rs14035 GG/CC, and DICER rs3742330/XPO5 rs11077 GG/AC+CC combinations were significantly associated with increased RPL risk, whereas the RAN rs14035 CT, DICER rs3742330/RAN rs14035 AA+AG/CT+TT, DROSHA rs10719/RAN rs14035 TC+CC/CT+TT, and RAN rs14035/XPO5 rs11077 CT+TT/AA combinations reduced RPL risk. The A-T-T-C and G-C-T-A allele combinations (DICER/DROSHA/RAN/XPO5) were 20 times more frequent in the RPL group than in the control group. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the relationship between RPL development and the polymorphism of the miRNA machinery gene RAN and combined genotype of DROSHA/DICER."
https://openalex.org/W1978216499,"Epidemiological studies have indicated that impaired glucose metabolism may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates glucose and lipid metabolism via the phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).Thus, we analyzed the expression of pAMPK and its downstream target phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pACC), as well as their impact on the survival of patients with resected SCCHN.One hundred eighteen patients with surgically resected SCCHN were enrolled. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for pAMPK and pACC was performed using tissue microarrays of operative specimens of SCCHN. The expression was divided into two or three groups according to the IHC score [pAMPK: negative (0), positive (1-3); pACC: negative (0), low expression (1, 2), and high expression (3)]. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association of pAMPK expression with clinicopathological features and pACC and pErk expression.The positive rates of pAMPK and pACC expression were 64.4% (76/118) and 68.6% (81/118), respectively. pAMPK was significantly higher in patients aged younger than 60 years (P = 0.024; χ2 test) and those with early-stage (T1/T2; P = 0.02; χ2 test) and oral cavity (P = 0.026; Fisher's exact test) tumors. In multivariate analysis, pAMPK expression was not significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-1.23), whereas high pACC expression was independently associated with worse OS in node-positive patients (adjusted HR: 17.58; 95% CI: 3.50-88.18).Strong expression of pACC was found to be an independent prognostic marker for patients with node-positive SCCHN. Our results suggest that pACC may play a role in tumor progression of SCCHN and may help to identify patient subgroups at high risk for poor disease outcome."

It relies on a symbiotic association offering a unique opportunity to discover biochemical adaptations that allow animals to thrive in such a hostile habitat. Here, by studying the Pompeii worm, we report on the discovery of the first antibiotic peptide from a deep-sea organism, namely alvinellacin. After purification and peptide sequencing, both the gene and the peptide tertiary structures were elucidated. As epibionts are not cultivated so far and because of lethal decompression effects upon Alvinella sampling, we developed shipboard biological assays to demonstrate that in addition to act in the first line of defense against microbial invasion, alvinellacin shapes and controls the worm's epibiotic microflora. Our results provide insights into the nature of an abyssal antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and into the manner in which an extremophile eukaryote uses it to interact with the particular microbial community of the hydrothermal vent ecosystem. Unlike earlier studies done on hydrothermal vents that all focused on the microbial side of the symbiosis, our work gives a view of this interaction from the host side."
https://openalex.org/W2082738187,"Background Previous research found an association of CRP with QT time in population based samples. Even more, there is evidence of a substantial involvement of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha system in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmia, while the role of Interleukin 6 remains inconclusive. Objective To determine the association between inflammation with an abnormally prolonged QT-time (APQT) in men and women of the elderly general population. Methods Data descend from the baseline examination of the prospective, population-based Cardiovascular Disease, Living and Ageing in Halle (CARLA) Study. After exclusion of subjects with atrial fibrillation and missing ECG recording the final study cohort consisted of 919 men and 797 women. Blood parameters of inflammation were the soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNF-R1), the high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and Interleukin 6 (IL-6). In accordance with major cardiologic societies we defined an APQT above a QT time of 460 ms in women and 450 ms in men. Effect sizes and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by performing multiple linear and logistic regression analyses including the analysis of sex differences by interaction terms. Results After covariate adjustment we found an odds ratio (OR) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.17) per 1000 pg/mL increase of sTNF-R1 in women, and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.15) in men. In the covariate adjusted linear regression sTNF-R1 was again positively associated with QT time in women (5.75 ms per 1000 pg/mL, 95% CI: 1.32, 10.18), but not in men. Taking possible confounders into account IL-6 and hsCRP were not significantly related to APQT in both sexes. Conclusion Our findings from cross-sectional analyses give evidence for an involvement of TNF-alpha in the pathology of APQT in women."
https://openalex.org/W2086224264,"Mammalian mitochondrial mRNA (mt-mRNA) transcripts are polyadenylated at the 3' end with different lengths. The SUV3·PNPase complex and mtPAP have been shown to degrade and polyadenylate mt mRNA, respectively. How these two opposite actions are coordinated to modulate mt-mRNA poly(A) lengths is of interest to pursue. Here, we demonstrated that a fraction of the SUV3·PNPase complex interacts with mitochondrial polyadenylation polymerase (mtPAP) under low mitochondrial matrix inorganic phosphate (Pi) conditions. In vitro binding experiments using purified proteins suggested that SUV3 binds to mtPAP through the N-terminal region around amino acids 100-104, distinctive from the C-terminal region around amino acids 510-514 of SUV3 for PNPase binding. mtPAP does not interact with PNPase directly, and SUV3 served as a bridge capable of simultaneously binding with mtPAP and PNPase. The complex consists of a SUV3 dimer, a mtPAP dimer, and a PNPase trimer, based on the molecular sizing experiments. Mechanistically, SUV3 provides a robust single strand RNA binding domain to enhance the polyadenylation activity of mtPAP. Furthermore, purified SUV3·PNPase·mtPAP complex is capable of lengthening or shortening the RNA poly(A) tail lengths in low or high Pi/ATP ratios, respectively. Consistently, the poly(A) tail lengths of mt-mRNA transcripts can be lengthened or shortened by altering the mitochondrial matrix Pi levels via selective inhibition of the electron transport chain or ATP synthase, respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that SUV3·PNPase·mtPAP form a transient complex to modulate mt-mRNA poly(A) tail lengths in response to cellular energy changes."
https://openalex.org/W2028244460,"The red tree coral Primnoa pacifica is an important habitat forming octocoral in North Pacific waters. Given the prominence of this species in shelf and upper slope areas of the Gulf of Alaska where fishing disturbance can be high, it may be able to sustain healthy populations through adaptive reproductive processes. This study was designed to test this hypothesis, examining reproductive mode, seasonality and fecundity in both undamaged and simulated damaged colonies over the course of 16 months using a deepwater-emerged population in Tracy Arm Fjord. Females within the population developed asynchronously, though males showed trends of synchronicity, with production of immature spermatocysts heightened in December/January and maturation of gametes in the fall months. Periodicity of individuals varied from a single year reproductive event to some individuals taking more than the 16 months sampled to produce viable gametes. Multiple stages of gametes occurred in polyps of the same colony during most sampling periods. Mean oocyte size ranged from 50 to 200 µm in any season, and maximum oocyte size (802 µm) suggests a lecithotrophic larva. No brooding larvae were found during this study, though unfertilized oocytes were found adhered to the outside of polyps, where they are presumably fertilized. This species demonstrated size-dependent reproduction, with gametes first forming in colonies over 42-cm length, and steady oocyte sizes being achieved after reaching 80-cm in length. The average fecundity was 86 (± 12) total oocytes per polyp, and 17 (± 12) potential per polyp fecundity. Sub-lethal injury by removing 21-40% of colony tissue had no significant reproductive response in males or females over the course of this study, except for a corresponding loss in overall colony fecundity. The reproductive patterns and long gamete generation times observed in this study indicate that recruitment events are likely to be highly sporadic in this species increasing its vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2124131776,"This paper reports the most cost-effective policy options to support and improve breast cancer control in Costa Rica and Mexico. Total costs and effects of breast cancer interventions were estimated using the health care perspective and WHO-CHOICE methodology. Effects were measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Costs were assessed in 2009 United States Dollars (US$). To the extent available, analyses were based on locally obtained data. In Costa Rica, the current strategy of treating breast cancer in stages I to IV at a 80% coverage level seems to be the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$4,739 per DALY averted. At a coverage level of 95%, biennial clinical breast examination (CBE) screening could improve Costa Rica's population health twofold, and can still be considered very cost-effective (ICER US$5,964/DALY). For Mexico, our results indicate that at 95% coverage a mass-media awareness raising program (MAR) could be the most cost-effective (ICER US$5,021/DALY). If more resources are available in Mexico, biennial mammography screening for women 50–70 yrs (ICER US$12,718/DALY), adding trastuzumab (ICER US$13,994/DALY) or screening women 40–70 yrs biennially plus trastuzumab (ICER US$17,115/DALY) are less cost-effective options. We recommend both Costa Rica and Mexico to engage in MAR, CBE or mammography screening programs, depending on their budget. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution however, as the evidence on the intervention effectiveness is uncertain. Also, these programs require several organizational, budgetary and human resources, and the accessibility of breast cancer diagnostic, referral, treatment and palliative care facilities should be improved simultaneously. A gradual implementation of early detection programs should give the respective Ministries of Health the time to negotiate the required budget, train the required human resources and understand possible socioeconomic barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2029420222,"Deregulation of the transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), an important factor in the centrosome–microtubule system, has been linked to a variety of human cancer types. We have recently reported on the oncogenic potential of TACC3; however, the molecular mechanisms by which TACC3 mediates oncogenic function remain to be elucidated. In this study, we show that high levels of TACC3 lead to the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and disrupt the normal cellular response to DNA damage, at least in part, by negatively regulating the expression of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and the subsequent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling cascade. Cells expressing high levels of TACC3 display defective checkpoints and DSB-mediated homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair systems, leading to genomic instability. Importantly, high levels of TACC3 confer cellular sensitization to radiation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition. Overall, our findings provide critical information regarding the mechanisms by which TACC3 contributes to genomic instability, potentially leading to cancer development, and suggest a novel prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer types expressing high levels of TACC3."
https://openalex.org/W2079330719,"Intrinsically disordered proteins are found extensively in cell signaling pathways where they often are targets of posttranslational modifications e.g. phosphorylation. Such modifications can sometimes induce or disrupt secondary structure elements present in the modified protein. CD79a and CD79b are membrane-spanning, signal-transducing components of the B-cell receptor. The cytosolic domains of these proteins are intrinsically disordered and each has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). When an antigen binds to the receptor, conserved tyrosines located in the ITAMs are phosphorylated which initiate further downstream signaling. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to examine the secondary structure propensity of the cytosolic domains of CD79a and CD79b in vitro before and after phosphorylation. The phosphorylation patterns are identified through analysis of changes of backbone chemical shifts found for the affected tyrosines and neighboring residues. The number of the phosphorylated sites is confirmed by mass spectrometry. The secondary structure propensities are calculated using the method of intrinsic referencing, where the reference random coil chemical shifts are measured for the same protein under denaturing conditions. Our analysis revealed that CD79a and CD79b both have an overall propensity for α-helical structure that is greatest in the C-terminal region of the ITAM. Phosphorylation of CD79a caused a decrease in helical propensity in the C-terminal ITAM region. For CD79b, the opposite was observed and phosphorylation resulted in an increase of helical propensity in the C-terminal part."
https://openalex.org/W2160277321,"The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis produces a unique class of cysteine proteinases termed gingipains that comprises Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp). Growing evidence indicates that these 2 types of gingipains synergistically contribute to the entire virulence of the organism and increase the risk of periodontal disease (PD) by disrupting the host immune system and degrading the host tissue and plasma proteins. Therefore, a dual inhibitor of both gingipains would have attractive clinical potential for PD therapy. In this study, a novel, potent, dual inhibitor of Rgp and Kgp was developed through structure-based drug design, and its biological potency was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. This inhibitor had low nanomolar inhibitory potency (Ki=40 nM for Rgp, Ki=0.27 nM for Kgp) and good selectivity for host proteases and exhibited potent antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis by abrogating its manifold pathophysiological functions. The therapeutic potential of this inhibitor in vivo was also verified by suppressing the vascular permeability that was enhanced in guinea pigs by the organism and the gingival inflammation in beagle dog PD models. These findings suggest that a dual inhibitor of Rgp and Kgp would exhibit noteworthy anti-inflammatory activity in the treatment of PD."

The present study was aimed to investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of Numb and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methodology The expression of Numb was detected in 107 cases of clinical paraffin-embedded hepatocellular carcinoma tissues,5 matched paris of fresh tissues and six hepatocellular cell lines by immunohistochemistry with clinicopathological analyses,RT-PCR or Western blot. Moreover, loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to evaluate the effect of Numb on cell proliferation in vitro. Conclusions We found that Numb was obviously up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines (p<0.05). The Numb up-regulation correlated significantly with poor prognosis, and Numb status was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Over-expression of Numb increased proliferation in SMMC-7721 and BEL-7402 cells, while knock-down of Numb showed the opposite effect. Our study indicates that Numb up-regulation significantly correlates with cell proliferation and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. It may be a useful biomarker for therapeutic strategy in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1964225784,"Phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) and respiratory quinones (RQ) are microbial compounds that have been utilized as biomarkers to quantify bacterial biomass and to characterize microbial community structure in sediments, waters, and soils. While PLFAs have been widely used as quantitative bacterial biomarkers in marine sediments, applications of quinone analysis in marine sediments are very limited. In this study, we investigated the relation between both groups of bacterial biomarkers in a broad range of marine sediments from the intertidal zone to the deep sea. We found a good log-log correlation between concentrations of bacterial PLFA and RQ over several orders of magnitude. This relationship is probably due to metabolic variation in quinone concentrations in bacterial cells in different environments, whereas PLFA concentrations are relatively stable under different conditions. We also found a good agreement in the community structure classifications based on the bacterial PLFAs and RQs. These results strengthen the application of both compounds as quantitative bacterial biomarkers. Moreover, the bacterial PLFA- and RQ profiles revealed a comparable dissimilarity pattern of the sampled sediments, but with a higher level of dissimilarity for the RQs. This means that the quinone method has a higher resolution for resolving differences in bacterial community composition. Combining PLFA and quinone analysis as a complementary method is a good strategy to yield higher resolving power in bacterial community structure."
https://openalex.org/W2020011608,"High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known to protect against atherosclerosis by promoting the reverse cholesterol transport. A new pathway for the regulation of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) removal involving F1-ATPase and P2Y13 receptor (P2Y13R) was described in vitro, and recently in mice. However, the physiological role of F1-ATPase/P2Y13R pathway in the modulation of vascular pathology i.e. in the development of atherosclerotic plaques is still unknown. We designed a specific novel agonist (CT1007900) of the P2Y13R that caused stimulation of bile acid secretion associated with an increased uptake of HDL-c in the liver after single dosing in mice. Repeated dose administration in mice, for 2 weeks, stimulated the apoA-I synthesis and formation of small HDL particles. Plasma samples from the agonist-treated mice had high efflux capacity for mobilization of cholesterol in vitro compared to placebo group. In apoE−/− mice this agonist induced a decrease of atherosclerotic plaques in aortas and carotids. The specificity of P2Y13R pathway in those mice was assessed using adenovirus encoding P2Y13R-shRNA. These results demonstrate that P2Y13R plays a pivotal role in the HDL metabolism and could also be a useful therapeutic agent to decrease atherosclerosis. In this study, the up-regulation of HDL-c metabolism via activation of the P2Y13R using agonists could promote reverse cholesterol transport and promote inhibition of atherosclerosis progression in mice."

We used serum samples from 21 PD patients and 20 age-matched normal people as control to conduct a comparative proteomic study. We performed 2-DE and analyzed the differentially expressed protein spots by LC-MS/MS. In PD group 13 spots were shown to be differentially expressed compared to control group. They were identified as 6 proteins. Among these, 3 proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis. It showed that the frequency of fibrinogen γ-chain (FGG) appeared 70% in PD, which could not be detected in control group. The protein of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITI-H4) was found to exist two forms in serum. The full size (120 kDa) of the protein was increased and the fragmented ITI-H4 (35 kDa) was decreased in PD group. The ratio of full size ITI-H4 to fragmented ITI-H4 in PD patients was 3.85±0.29-fold higher than in control group. Furthermore, fragmented Apo A-IV (∼26 kDa) was mainly detected in control group, while it was rare to be found in PD group. Above findings might be useful for diagnosis of PD.

https://openalex.org/W2009961156,"Upregulated expression of nucleolar GTPase nucleostemin (NS) has been associated with increased cellular proliferation potential and tumor malignancy during cancer development. Recent reports attribute the growth regulatory effects of NS protein to its role in facilitating ribosome production. However, the oncogenic potential of NS remains unclear, as imbalanced levels of NS have been reported to exert growth inhibitory effect by modulating p53 tumor-suppressor activity. It also remains in questions if aberrant NS levels might have a p53-independent role in regulation of cell proliferation and growth. In this study, we performed affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis to explore protein–protein interactions influencing NS growth regulatory properties independently of p53 tumor suppressor. We identified the alternative reading frame (ARF) protein as a key protein associating with NS and further verified the interaction through in vitro and in vivo assays. We demonstrated that NS is able to regulate cell cycle progression by regulating the stability of the ARF tumor suppressor. Furthermore, overexpression of NS suppressed ARF polyubiquitination by its E3 ligase Ubiquitin Ligase for ARF and elongated its half-life, whereas knockdown of NS led to the decrease of ARF levels. Also, we found that NS can enhance NPM stabilization of ARF. Thus, we propose that in the absence of p53, ARF can be stabilized by NS and nucleophosmin to serve as an alternative tumor-suppressor surveillance, preventing potential cellular transformation resulting from the growth-inducing effects of NS overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2036590706,"LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake by Ldlr is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cleavage-dependent activation of membrane-associated sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP-2). Activated SREBP-2 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to an LDLR promoter sterol response element (SRE), increasing LDLR gene expression and LDL-C uptake. SREBP-2 cleavage and translocation steps are well established. Several SREBP-2 phosphorylation sites have been mapped and functionally characterized. The phosphatases dephosphorylating these sites remain elusive. The phosphatase(s) regulating SREBP-2 represents a novel pharmacological target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Here we show that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) promotes SREBP-2 LDLR promoter binding in response to cholesterol depletion. No binding to an LDLR SRE was observed in the presence of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, when PP2A activity was inhibited by okadaic acid or depleted by siRNA methods. SREBP-2 cleavage and nuclear translocation were not affected by loss of PP2A. PP2A activity was required for SREBP-2 DNA binding. In response to cholesterol depletion, PP2A directly interacted with SREBP-2 and altered its phosphorylation state, causing an increase in SREBP-2 binding to an LDLR SRE site. Increased binding resulted in induced LDLR gene expression and increased LDL uptake. We conclude that PP2A activity regulates cholesterol homeostasis and LDL-C uptake. LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake by Ldlr is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cleavage-dependent activation of membrane-associated sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP-2). Activated SREBP-2 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to an LDLR promoter sterol response element (SRE), increasing LDLR gene expression and LDL-C uptake. SREBP-2 cleavage and translocation steps are well established. Several SREBP-2 phosphorylation sites have been mapped and functionally characterized. The phosphatases dephosphorylating these sites remain elusive. The phosphatase(s) regulating SREBP-2 represents a novel pharmacological target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Here we show that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) promotes SREBP-2 LDLR promoter binding in response to cholesterol depletion. No binding to an LDLR SRE was observed in the presence of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, when PP2A activity was inhibited by okadaic acid or depleted by siRNA methods. SREBP-2 cleavage and nuclear translocation were not affected by loss of PP2A. PP2A activity was required for SREBP-2 DNA binding. In response to cholesterol depletion, PP2A directly interacted with SREBP-2 and altered its phosphorylation state, causing an increase in SREBP-2 binding to an LDLR SRE site. Increased binding resulted in induced LDLR gene expression and increased LDL uptake. We conclude that PP2A activity regulates cholesterol homeostasis and LDL-C uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2057121978,"Patterns of poultry exposure in rural and urban areas in China have not been systematically evaluated and compared. The objective of our study is to investigate patterns in human exposure to poultry in rural and urban China. We conducted a two-stage household-based clustered survey on population exposure to live/sick/dead poultry in Xiuning and Shenzhen. Half of the rural households (51%) in Xiuning raised poultry, mostly (78%) free-range. Around half of those households (40%) allowed poultry to stay in their living areas. One quarter of villagers reported having contact with sick or dead poultry. In Shenzhen, 37% urban residents visited live poultry markets. Among these, 40% purchased live poultry and 16% touched the poultry or cages during purchase. Our findings indicated that human exposure to poultry was different in rural and urban areas in China. This discrepancy could contribute to the observed differences in epidemiologic characteristics between urban and rural cases of influenza A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2028037006,"Successful completion of development requires coordination of patterning events with morphogenetic movements. Environmental variability challenges this coordination. For example, developing organisms encounter varying environmental temperatures that can strongly influence developmental rates. We hypothesized that the mechanics of morphogenesis would have to be finely adjusted to allow for normal morphogenesis across a wide range of developmental rates. We formulated our hypothesis as a simple model incorporating time-dependent application of force to a viscoelastic tissue. This model suggested that the capacity to maintain normal morphogenesis across a range of temperatures would depend on how both tissue viscoelasticity and the forces that drive deformation vary with temperature. To test this model we investigated how the mechanical behavior of embryonic tissue (Xenopus laevis) changed with temperature; we used a combination of micropipette aspiration to measure viscoelasticity, electrically induced contractions to measure cellular force generation, and confocal microscopy to measure endogenous contractility. Contrary to expectations, the viscoelasticity of the tissues and peak contractile tension proved invariant with temperature even as rates of force generation and gastrulation movements varied three-fold. Furthermore, the relative rates of different gastrulation movements varied with temperature: the speed of blastopore closure increased more slowly with temperature than the speed of the dorsal-to-ventral progression of involution. The changes in the relative rates of different tissue movements can be explained by the viscoelastic deformation model given observed viscoelastic properties, but only if morphogenetic forces increase slowly rather than all at once."
https://openalex.org/W2003642790,"Measuring metabolism's time- and space-dependent responses upon stimulation lies at the core of functional magnetic resonance imaging. While focusing on water's sole resonance, further insight could arise from monitoring the temporal responses arising from the metabolites themselves, in what is known as functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Performing these measurements in real time, however, is severely challenged by the short functional timescales and low concentrations of natural metabolites. Dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization is an emerging technique that can potentially alleviate this, as it provides a massive sensitivity enhancement allowing one to probe low-concentration tracers and products in a single-scan. Still, conventional implementations of this hyperpolarization approach are not immediately amenable to the repeated acquisitions needed in real-time functional settings. This work proposes a strategy for functional magnetic resonance of hyperpolarized metabolites that bypasses this limitation, and enables the observation of real-time metabolic changes through the synchronization of stimuli-triggered, multiple-bolus injections of the metabolic tracer 13C1-pyruvate. This new approach is demonstrated with paradigms tailored to reveal in vivo thresholds of murine hind-limb skeletal muscle activation, involving the conversion of 13C1-pyruvate to 13C1-lactate and 13C1-alanine. These functional hind-limb studies revealed that graded skeletal muscle stimulation causes commensurate increases in glycolytic metabolism in a frequency- and amplitude-dependent fashion, that can be monitored on the seconds/minutes timescale using dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization. Spectroscopic imaging further allowed the in vivo visualization of uptake, transformation and distribution of the tracer and products, in fast-twitch glycolytic and in slow-twitch oxidative muscle fiber groups. While these studies open vistas in time and sensitivity for metabolic functional magnetic resonance studies in muscle, the simplicity of our approach makes this technique amenable to a wide range of functional metabolic tracer studies."
https://openalex.org/W2041574490,"ORCTL3 is a member of a group of genes, the so-called anticancer genes, that cause tumour-specific cell death. We show that this activity is triggered in isogenic renal cells upon their transformation independently of the cells’ proliferation status. For its cell death effect ORCTL3 targets the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in fatty acid metabolism. This is caused by transmembrane domains 3 and 4, which are more efficacious in vitro than a low molecular weight drug against SCD1, and critically depend on their expression level. SCD1 is found upregulated upon renal cell transformation indicating that its activity, while not impacting proliferation, represents a critical bottleneck for tumourigenesis. An adenovirus expressing ORCTL3 leads to growth inhibition of renal tumours in vivo and to substantial destruction of patients’ kidney tumour cells ex vivo. Our results indicate fatty acid metabolism as a target for tumour-specific apoptosis in renal tumours and suggest ORCTL3 as a means to accomplish this."
https://openalex.org/W2087079674,"release into the cytosol through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) plays a relevant role in numerous physiological processes. IP3R-mediated signals involve -induced -release (CICR) whereby release through one open IP3R induces the opening of other channels. IP3Rs are apparently organized in clusters. The signals can remain localized (i.e., puffs) if CICR is limited to one cluster or become waves that propagate between clusters. puffs are the building blocks of waves. Thus, there is great interest in determining puff properties, especially in view of the current controversy on the spatial distribution of activatable IP3Rs. puffs have been observed in intact cells with optical techniques proving that they are intrinsically stochastic. Obtaining a correct picture of their dynamics then entails being able to detect the whole range of puff sizes. puffs are observed using visible single-wavelength dyes, slow exogenous buffers (e.g., EGTA) to disrupt inter-cluster CICR and UV-photolyzable caged IP3. Single-wavelength dyes increase their fluorescence upon calcium binding producing images that are strongly dependent on their kinetic, transport and photophysical properties. Determining the artifacts that the imaging setting introduces is particularly relevant when trying to analyze the smallest signals. In this paper we introduce a method to estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio of imaging experiments that use single-wavelength dyes. The method is based on the Number and Brightness technique. It involves the performance of a series of experiments and their subsequent analysis in terms of a fluorescence fluctuation model with which the model parameters are quantified. Using the model, the expected signal-to-noise ratio is then computed. Equivalence classes between different experimental conditions that produce images with similar signal-to-noise ratios can then be established. The method may also be used to estimate the smallest signals that can reliably be observed with each setting."
https://openalex.org/W2095059732,"Identifying sources of the apparent variability in non-stationary scenarios is a fundamental problem in many biological data analysis settings. For instance, neurophysiological responses to the same task often vary from each repetition of the same experiment (trial) to the next. The origin and functional role of this observed variability is one of the fundamental questions in neuroscience. The nature of such trial-to-trial dynamics however remains largely elusive to current data analysis approaches. A range of strategies have been proposed in modalities such as electro-encephalography but gaining a fundamental insight into latent sources of trial-to-trial variability in neural recordings is still a major challenge. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept study to the analysis of trial-to-trial variability dynamics founded on non-autonomous dynamical systems. At this initial stage, we evaluate the capacity of a simple statistic based on the behaviour of trajectories in classification settings, the trajectory coherence, in order to identify trial-to-trial dynamics. First, we derive the conditions leading to observable changes in datasets generated by a compact dynamical system (the Duffing equation). This canonical system plays the role of a ubiquitous model of non-stationary supervised classification problems. Second, we estimate the coherence of class-trajectories in empirically reconstructed space of system states. We show how this analysis can discern variations attributable to non-autonomous deterministic processes from stochastic fluctuations. The analyses are benchmarked using simulated and two different real datasets which have been shown to exhibit attractor dynamics. As an illustrative example, we focused on the analysis of the rat's frontal cortex ensemble dynamics during a decision-making task. Results suggest that, in line with recent hypotheses, rather than internal noise, it is the deterministic trend which most likely underlies the observed trial-to-trial variability. Thus, the empirical tool developed within this study potentially allows us to infer the source of variability in in-vivo neural recordings."
https://openalex.org/W2120171570,"Patients with bilateral vestibular loss suffer from severe balance deficits during normal everyday movements. Ballet dancers, figure skaters, or slackliners, in contrast, are extraordinarily well trained in maintaining balance for the extreme balance situations that they are exposed to. Both training and disease can lead to changes in the diffusion properties of white matter that are related to skill level or disease progression respectively. In this study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare white matter diffusivity between these two study groups and their age- and sex-matched controls. We found that vestibular patients and balance-trained subjects show a reduction of fractional anisotropy in similar white matter tracts, due to a relative increase in radial diffusivity (perpendicular to the main diffusion direction). Reduced fractional anisotropy was not only found in sensory and motor areas, but in a widespread network including long-range connections, limbic and association pathways. The reduced fractional anisotropy did not correlate with any cognitive, disease-related or skill-related factors. The similarity in FA between the two study groups, together with the absence of a relationship between skill or disease factors and white matter changes, suggests a common mechanism for these white matter differences. We propose that both study groups must exert increased effort to meet their respective usual balance requirements. Since balance training has been shown to effectively reduce the symptoms of vestibular failure, the changes in white matter shown here may represent a neuronal mechanism for rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W1993930576,"In recent years, the study of resting state neural activity has received much attention. To better understand the roles of different brain regions in the regulation of behavioral activity in an arousing or a resting period, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm (8-arm food-foraging task; 8-arm FFT) using the radial 8-arm maze and examined how AcbC lesions affect behavioral execution and learning. Repetitive training on the 8-arm FFT facilitated motivation of normal rats to run quickly to the arm tips and to the center platform before the last-reward collection. Importantly, just after this point and before confirmation of no reward at the next arm traverse, locomotor activity decreased. This indicates that well-trained rats can predict the absence of the reward at the end of food seeking and then start another behavior, namely planned resting. Lesions of the AcbC after training selectively impaired this reduction of locomotor activity after the last-reward collection without changing activity levels before the last-reward collection. Analysis of arm-selection patterns in the lesioned animals suggests little influence of the lesion in the ability to predict the reward absence. AcbC lesions did not change exploratory locomotor activity in an open-field test in which there were no rewards. This suggests that the AcbC controls the activity level of planned resting behavior shaped by the 8-arm FFT. Rats receiving training after AcbC lesioning showed a reduction in motivation for reward seeking. Thus, the AcbC also plays important roles not only in controlling the activity level after the last-reward collection but also in motivational learning for setting the activity level of reward-seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2026608255,"Detection of somatic mutations for targeted therapy is increasingly used in clinical settings. However, due to the difficulties of detecting rare mutations in excess of wild-type DNA, current methods often lack high sensitivity, require multiple procedural steps, or fail to be quantitative. We developed real-time bidirectional pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization (real-time Bi-PAP) that allows quantitative detection of somatic mutations. We applied the method to quantify seven mutations at codons 12 and 13 in KRAS, and 2 mutations (L858R, and T790M) in EGFR in clinical samples. The real-time Bi-PAP could detect 0.01% mutation in the presence of 100 ng template DNA. Of the 34 samples from the colon cancer patients, real-time Bi-PAP detected 14 KRAS mutant samples whereas the traditional real-time allele-specific PCR missed two samples with mutation abundance <1% and DNA sequencing missed nine samples with mutation abundance <10%. The detection results of the two EGFR mutations in 45 non-small cell lung cancer samples further supported the applicability of the real-time Bi-PAP. The real-time Bi-PAP also proved to be more efficient than the real-time allele-specific PCR in the detection of templates prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Thus, real-time Bi-PAP can be used for rapid and accurate quantification of somatic mutations. This flexible approach could be widely used for somatic mutation detection in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2078364101,"Coronary collateral growth (arteriogenesis) is a physiological adaptive response to transient and repetitive occlusion of major coronary arteries in which small arterioles (native collaterals) with minimal to no blood flow remodel into larger conduit arteries capable of supplying adequate perfusion to tissue distal to the site of occlusion. The ability to reliably and reproducibly mimic transient, repetitive coronary artery occlusion (ischemia) in animal models is critical to the development of therapies to restore coronary collateral development in type II diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Current animal models for repetitive coronary artery occlusion implement a pneumatic occluder (balloon) that is secured onto the surface of the heart with the suture, which is inflated manually, via a catheter connected to syringe, to effect occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). This method, although effective, presents complications in terms of reproducibility and practicality. To address these limitations, we have designed a device for automated, transient inflation of balloon catheters in coronary artery occlusion models. This device allows repeated, consistent inflation (to either specified pressure or volume) and the capability for implementing very complex, month-long protocols. This system has significantly increased the reproducibility of coronary collateral growth studies in our laboratory, resulting in a significant decrease in the numbers of animals needed to complete each study while relieving laboratory personnel from the burden of extra working hours and enabling us to continue studies over periods when we previously could not. In this paper, we present all details necessary for construction and operation of the inflator. In addition, all of the components for this device are commercially available and economical (Table S1). It is our hope that the adoption of automated balloon catheter inflation protocols will improve the experimental reliability of transient ischemia studies at many research institutions."
