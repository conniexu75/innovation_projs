https://openalex.org/W2094631910,"First-order nonlinear differential-delay equations describing physiological control systems are studied. The equations display a broad diversity of dynamical behavior including limit cycle oscillations, with a variety of wave forms, and apparently aperiodic or ""chaotic"" solutions. These results are discussed in relation to dynamical respiratory and hematopoietic diseases."

Other types of promoters such as anthralin, phenobarbital, and saccharin do not have this effect. Various compounds that can inhibit some of the biological and biochemical effects of tumor promoters do not interfere with the induction of cell adherence and differentiation by the effective promoters."

Their power density spectra reveal that single transport sites translocate more than 106 sodium ions per second, which indicates a pore mechanism. The density of open plus amiloride-blocked pores is in the order of 108 pores per square centimeter of skin area with 60 millimolar sodium and 18 micromolar amiloride in the outer solution."

https://openalex.org/W1987925262,"Nuclear matrices from undifferentiated and differentiated Friend erythroleukemia cells have been obtained by a method which removes DNA in a physiological buffer. These matrices preserved the characteristic topographical distribution of condensed and diffuse ""chromatin"" regions, as do nuclei in situ or isolated nuclei. Histone H1 was released from the nuclear matrix of undifferentiated cells by 0.3 M KCl; inner core histones were released by 1 M KCl. Nuclear matrix from differentiated cells did not maintain H1, and histone cores were fully released in 0.7 M KCl. KCl removed the core histones as an octameric structure with no evidence of preferential release of any single histone. Electron microscopy of KCl-treated matrix revealed no condensed regions but rather a network of fibrils in the whole DNA-depleted nuclei. When nuclear matrices from both types of cell were exposed to conditions of very low ionic strength, inner core histones and condensed regions remained. These observations support the contention that inner core histones are bound to matrix through natural ionic bonds or saline-labile elements, and that these interactions are implicated in chromatin condensation. hnRNA remained undegraded and tenaciously associated to the matrix fibrils, and was released only by chemical means which, by breaking hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds, produced matrix lysis. Very few nonhistone proteins were released upon complete digestion of DNA from either type of nuclei. The remaining nonhistone proteins represent a large number of species of which the majority may be matrix components. The molecular architecture in both condensed and diffuse regions of interphase nuclei appears to be constructed of two distinct kinds of fibers; the thicker chromatin fibers are interwoven with the thinner matrix fibers. The latter are formed by a heteropolymer of many different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2047079311,"Specific active transcription units on chromosome IV in the salivary glands of Chironomus tentans have been visualized by the Miller spreading technique and in situ by conventional electron microscopy. These units are likely to be located in the two most conspicuous puffs on chromosome IV, Balbiani ring 1 (BR 1) and Balbiani ring 2 (BR 2). The transcription units in these Balbiani rings generate 75S RNA molecules constituting putative messenger RNA species for the predominant cellular product, the salivary polypeptides. Solitary active transcription units with a mean length of 7.7 micron were observed most frequently. The lateral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fibers of each unit formed a single length gradient. The number of fibers per unit was 123 (+/- 24), or about 16 growing RNP fibers per micron of chromosome fiber. The considerable variation in the number of RNP fibers per unit suggests that transcription can be modulated at the level of the individual gene. The modulation is probably achieved via the initiation event and/or via an early pretermination step, but a change in the elongation rate could not be excluded. The number of polymerases starting to traverse the whole gene was estimated to be six per min and transcription unit, and the rate of RNA chain elongation was calculated to be 31 nucleotides per second at 18 degrees C. The properties of the chromosome fiber within the active 75S RNA units and also within their vicinity were studied in the Miller spreads. The inactive chromosome fiber exhibited a uniform beaded conformation, while the active fiber was sparsely and irregularly beaded. Furthermore, the chromosome fiber was more extended in the active 75S RNA unit than in inactive regions (DNA packing ratios of 1.6 and 1.9, respectively). By comparing the properties of the active 75S RNA gene with those of active genes in other systems, it was inferred that the loss of beads and the extension of the fiber in the active unit is probably directly related to the level of transcriptive activity. Finally, a smooth nonbeaded segment of 0.18 micron in length was found to precede the RNP fiber gradient. This segment may have a role in the process of transcriptional regulation. On the basis of comparison with the active transcription units in spread preparations. It was possible to identify active units in the Balbiani rings in sectioned material using conventional electron microscopy. In both BR 1 and BR 2 an active unit appeared as a loop, consisting of a fiber axis and having RNP granules attached to the loop axis by stalks. The growing RNP fibers therefore seem to be organized into granular structures during the transcription process, and the final products in BR 1 and BR2 are granules, 500 A in diameter, each containing a 75S RNA molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2158405662,"We have used the genetic marker, adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT), an enzyme known to be on human chromosome 16, to establish a method for the transfer of human α-globin genes into mouse erythroleukemia cells. Mouse erythroleukemia cells devoid of detectable levels of APRT were fused with fractions of human marrow enriched in human erythroid cells. The hybrid cells arising from this fusion were isolated in medium supplemented with aminopterin and thymidine, and used adenine as the sole purine source. This population of hybrid cells was dominated by cells (80%) in which human chromosome 16 was present. Human chromosomes 4, 5 and 6 were also found in these cells. The hybrid cells were then placed in medium supplemented with diaminopurine (DAP), which is lethal for cells containing APRT. Greater than 95% of the DAP-selected hybrid cells lacked human chromosome 16. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from the two hybrid cell populations and assayed by molecular hybridization for sequences coding for human α-globin. Carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography was used to study the level of synthesis of human a-globin in the hybrids. The original hybrid cell, which contained a high frequency of human chromosome 16, also contained high levels of human a-globin mRNA and human α-globin chains. Hybrid cells counter-selected in DAP and thus lacking human chromosome 16 were devoid of detectable levels of human APRT, human α-globin mRNA and human α-globin chains. This work shows that transfer of human chromosome 16 into the MEL cell is possible using a chromosomedependent, APRT-mediated method of gene transfer. Using this system in which expression of the human α-globin gene occurs, we were also able to confirm our earlier assignment of the human α-globin gene to human chromosome 16. This system may be of further use in identifying genetic elements governing expression of the human α-globin gene which can be carried with human chromosome 16 as it is donated to the mouse erythroleukemia cell by donor cells of different epigenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1995200391,"Friend cells of the line Fw are not induced to accumulate substantial amounts of hemoglobin and to become benzidine-positive when treated with butyric acid or other inducers, except in the presence of exogenous hemin. The cells are shown to have a deficiency in heme synthesis since they require exogenous hemin during the period of maximal hemoglobin synthesis; since endogenous heme synthesis cannot be induced to the level found in normal inducible Friend cells, even after hemoglobin synthesis has been induced by hemin and butyric acid and the hemin has then been withdrawn; since they are not inducible for ferrochelatase (heme synthetase) activity; and since they accumulate free globin chains after stimulation with butyric acid in the absence of hemin. Comparison of globin synthesis and globin mRNA content of the cells shows that globin synthesis is not controlled by the hemin-controlled repressor of protein synthesis (HCR) nor by any specific translational control of globin synthesis by hemin."

https://openalex.org/W2029701188,"The ability of Friend erythroleukemic cells to bind transferrin and take up its iron increases substantially as a result of dimethyl sulfoxide-stimulated differentiation. Although transferrin-binding activity is also demonstrable in another mouse cell line of hematopoietic origin, the lymphoma cell, it does not increase on exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide. Gel filtration studies corroborate that the binding of transferrin to the erythroleukemic cells is due to the formation of a specific complex of transferrin and a membrane receptor. Thus, the specific interaction of transferrin with its receptor is another expression of dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation in the Friend cell."

https://openalex.org/W2046134079,"The sensitivity to agglutination by several plant lectins has been studied during the induced erythroid differentiation of Friend erythroleukemic cells in culture. In addition, the number of lectin receptors on the cells has been measured. It is shown that early during the differentiation, there is an increase in agglutinability while the receptor density remains constant. In the later phase of the differentiation process, the cells lose their sensitivity to agglutination while the receptor number and density increases. These changes were not observed on nonerythroid mastocytoma culture cells. Two nondifferentiating variants of the FL cells were shown to have altered sensitivities to agglutination by ConA."
https://openalex.org/W1575843979,"A new fast assay procedure for increasing deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase activity was developed. With this assay procedure, this enzyme derived from blast cells of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia was purified at least 1218-fold. The molecular weight was estimated by gel filtration to be 43,000. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity over a pH range of 7 to 8 and the activation energy was estimated to be 6.5 kcal/mol at pH 7.5. While the enzyme had activity in the absence of added divalent cations, the activity could be inhibited by EDTA but not by phenanthroline. The inhibition caused by EDTA could be reversed by Mg2+ or Zn2+. The enzyme had maximal activity in the presence of Mg2+ (40 muM) and Mg2+ (4 mM) stabilized the enzyme at 37 degrees C. Cupric ion (0.5 mM) inhibited (50%) enzyme activity in the presence or absence of Mg2+. The substrate for the enzyme was dUTP and the apparent Km was 1 muM. No other deoxyribonucleoside or ribonucleoside triphosphate served as a substrate for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2041030862,"Low levels of dexamethasone and related gluco-corticoid hormones suppress the expression of globin genes during the DMSO-induced differentiation of Friend leukemia cells. In this response, the glucocorticoids appear to act at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in that 10−8 M dexamethasone prevents the accumulation of both globin mRNA and globin protein, whereas 10−9 M dexamethasone allows the accumulation of normal levels of hybridizable globin mRNA but prevents the accumulation of globin protein. This suppressive action of dexamethasone is more effective with DMSO as the inducer of globin gene expression than with hemin as the inducer. In contrast to the situation with glucocorticoids, certain sex steroids (etiocholanolone, testosterone and estradiol) facilitate the expression of globin genes in DMSO-treated Friend leukemia cells. The modulation of globin gene expression by steroid hormones is achieved in DMSO-treated cells without altering the growth and morphological changes which characteristically attend the differentiation of these cells."

https://openalex.org/W116167402,"Thymidylate synthetase (EC 2.1.1.B.) from blast cells of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia has been purified more than 1470-fold by affinity column chromatography. Methotrexate was the affinity ligand. dUMP was found to be a necessary additive for retention of the enzyme by the affinity column. Disc electrophoresis and sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed a single enzyme species with a molecular weight of 76,000. The enzyme exhibits a temperature-dependent conformational change with activation energies of 5.3 +/- 0.4 and 17.3 +/- 1.9 kcal/mol, respectively, above and below a transitional temperature of 35 degrees. This conformational change is reflected in the binding affinity of dUMP but not of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. The enzyme displays a broad pH maximum in the range of pH 7.4 to 8.8. The Michaelis constants for dUMP and (+/--L-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate are 1.8 +/- 0.2 and 31 +/- 8.3 micrometer, respectively. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies reveal the enzymic mechanism to be ordered sequential. dUMP binds before 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and dihydrofolate is released before TMP. 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxy-5'-uridylate (FdUMP) behaves as in irreversible inhibitor with a Ki of 1.68 +/- 0.45 nM. The enzyme has a turnover number of 6 min-1 per FdUMP binding site. Methotrexate inhibits noncompetitively with respect to dUMP and binds tighter to the enzyme in the presence of dUMP. Methotrexate antagonizes inactivation of the enzyme by FdUMP."
https://openalex.org/W1597160811,"Hemin treatment of mouse Friend virus-transformed cells in cultured caused a dose-dependent increase in hemoglobin synthesis. By the addition of radioactively labeled hemin and by the analysis of the radioactive heme in hemoglobin, only 60 to 70% of heme in the newly synthesized hemoglobin was accounted for by the exogenously added hemin. In keeping with this finding, hemin treatment increased the activity of two enzymes in the heme biosynthetic activity, i.e. delta-aminolevulinate (ALA) dehydratase and uroporphyrinogen-I (URO) synthase in these cells. Incorporation of [2(-14C)]glycine, [14C]ALA, and 59Fe into heme was also significantly increased in the cells treated with hemin, suggesting that essentially all enzyme activities in the heme biosynethetic pathway were increased after hemin treatment. These results indicate that heme in the newly synthesized hemoglobin in hemin-treated Friend cells derives both from hemin added to the culture and from heme synthesized intracellularly. In addition, these results suggest that the stimulation of heme biosynthesis by hemin in Friend virus-transformed cells is in contrast to the hemin repression of heme biosynthesis in liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W1582078759,"Hexamethylenebisacetamide is a potent inducer of erythroid differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells. A series of chemical compounds structurally related to hexamethylenebisacetamide were tested for inducing activity including polymethylene chains terminally substituted with various combinations of carboxylate, amino, amide, or sulfoxide groups. Effective dimerization of dimethyl sulfoxide through a linear polymethylene chain increases its inducing activity by a magnitude similar to that observed when N-methylacetamide is effectively dimerized in such a manner. It was found that all potent inducing agents possess both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic portion of the molecule, as well as a planar portion. All are Lewis bases, possessing a free electron pair available for hydrogen bonding. The polymethylene chain joining functional groups must be flexible and must be 5 to 6 carbon atoms in length to achieve maximal activity. Introduction of triple or double (cis or trans) bonds into the polymethylene chain does not alter activity."

https://openalex.org/W1991909124,"Resident peritoneal macrophages from normal mice were refractory to infection with the RFV or conventional strains of Friend virus (FV). Stimulation of DNA synthesis in the macrophage population by induction of an exudate in vivo or treatment in vitro with macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in productive infection following exposure to virus. Similarly, normal resident macrophages did not become infected in vivo following transfer to leukemic mice, while exudate macrophages did become infected. Bone marrow macrophage stem cells were stimulated to replicate and mature in clonal agar cultures in the presence of colony-stimulating factor. These replicating stem cells could be infected with RFV, as shown by virus production in the resultant progeny macrophages. Transfer of normal resident peritoneal macrophages to leukemic progressor mice caused regression of the disease. In contrast, transfer of normal bone marrow cells was ineffective in causing leukemia regression. During erythroleukemogenesis induced by RFV, macrophage precursor cells in all of the mice became infected with virus. In mice with a progressive and lethal leukemia, mature end-stage macrophages were produced which were also infected with virus. In mice in which the leukemia would later spontaneously regress, the infected stem cells were eliminated and the marrow became repopulated with uninfected cells. The resultant progeny macrophages which appeared in the peritoneal cavity were uninfected and thus capable of participating in or causing leukemia regression."
https://openalex.org/W2067485604,"Friend leukemia cell chromatin has been fractionated into template active and inactive components. The globin gene sequence is associated with the template active component both prior to and after the cells are induced with dimethyl sulfoxide to synthesize hemoglobin and therefore appears to be in an active configuration in uninduced as well as in induced Friend leukemia cells. In cells which have lost the ability to produce hemoglobin, the globin gene sequence is not associated with the template active fraction of chromatin. These results demonstrate the success of the fractionation procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2019580555,"The mechanism of commitment of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells to terminal differentiation has been examined. Before a significant proportion of cells becomes committed, a lag period of at least 9 hr of exposure to inducer is observed. Cells withdrawn from inducer can reinitiate commitment without a lag when reexposed. The proportion of committed cells in a culture discontinuously exposed to inducer is identical to that in a continuously exposed culture even if withdrawal from inducer lasts for 18 hr. The ability to tolerate an interruption in the exposure has been termed ""memory."" The memory of a previous exposure to inducer is complete up to 18 hr. It is partially erased after 36 hr and completely erased after 72 hr. The length of time the memory persists is not affected by the length of the initial exposure to inducer. These results suggest that a cellular component necessary for the commitment event accumulates in response to inducer and that this component has a decay time on the order of 10 hr."
https://openalex.org/W2036508561,"Hybrid cells formed by the fusion of murine teratocarcinoma and Friend erythroleukemia cells synthesize hemoglobin in the presence of chemical inducers such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). By making use of the fact that the parental teratocarcinoma and Friend cells carried different alleles at the locus coding for the alpha chain of hemoglobin, it was possible to demonstrate that the teratocarcinoma-derived genes for the globin alpha chains are genetically active in hemoglobin-synthesizing hybrid cells. In addition, evidence is presented suggesting that the teratocarcinoma-derived genes for the beta-globin chains may also be expressed in the hybrids. Apparently the teratocarcinoma-derived genome has become reprogrammed to express erythroid functions following fusion of the teratocarcinoma cell to the Friend cell."

That this RNA species is transcribed from this puff is indicated by the fact that it is found in RNA extracted from B-2 puffs obtained by microdissection. This confirmed by the specific hybridization of the 14S poly(A)+ RNA to the B-2 locus. Our data indicate that the polyadenylation process takes place at the chromosome level, and that the nuclear sap is not an important compartment in the transport of polyadenylated RNA from the chromosome to the cytoplasm. The kinetics of migration of the 14S species to the cytoplasm were studied; the data indicate that this process is very rapid and, in addition, that the 14S RNA is unstable."

https://openalex.org/W2032460394,"Reversible cross-linking of proteins in nuclei and DNA-depleted nuclei from Friend erythroleukemia cells was used as a probe to determine whether the protein structure was preserved following treatment with DNAase I. Interactions between histones were analyzed through cross-linking with 2-iminothiolane or dimethyl 3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate. No alterations in the interactions between intranucleosomal histone proteins resulted from digestion of the nuclear DNA. There was, however, a diminished extent of cross-linking of histone H1 to itself and to the intranucleosomal histones in DNA-depleted nuclei. The interactions of a group of nonhistone proteins with histone H3 could be monitored by cross-linking through the formation of disulfide bonds caused by oxidation of nuclei with H2O2. These interactions were not markedly affected by treatment of the nuclei with DNAase I. However, differences were observed in the extent of cross-linking of some of these proteins when cross-linking in nuclei from undifferentiated cells was compared to that in nuclei from cells which had been induced to differentiate with dimethylsulfoxide."
