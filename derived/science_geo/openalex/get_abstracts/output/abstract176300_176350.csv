https://openalex.org/W2053431375,"Cell motility requires lamellipodial protrusion, a process driven by actin polymerization. Ena/VASP proteins accumulate in protruding lamellipodia and promote the rapid actin-driven motility of the pathogen Listeria. In contrast, Ena/VASP negatively regulate cell translocation. To resolve this paradox, we analyzed the function of Ena/VASP during lamellipodial protrusion. Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia protruded slower but more persistently, consistent with their increased cell translocation rates. Actin networks in Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia contained shorter, more highly branched filaments compared to controls. Lamellipodia with excess Ena/VASP contained longer, less branched filaments. In vitro, Ena/VASP promoted actin filament elongation by interacting with barbed ends, shielding them from capping protein. We conclude that Ena/VASP regulates cell motility by controlling the geometry of actin filament networks within lamellipodia."
https://openalex.org/W2119260049,"AP2 is the best-characterized member of the family of heterotetrameric clathrin adaptor complexes that play pivotal roles in many vesicle trafficking pathways within the cell. AP2 functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the process whereby cargo enters the endosomal system from the plasma membrane. We describe the structure of the 200 kDa AP2 ""core"" (alpha trunk, beta2 trunk, mu2, and sigma2) complexed with the polyphosphatidylinositol headgroup mimic inositolhexakisphosphate at 2.6 A resolution. Two potential polyphosphatidylinositide binding sites are observed, one on alpha and one on mu2. The binding site for Yxxphi endocytic motifs is buried, indicating that a conformational change, probably triggered by phosphorylation in the disordered mu2 linker, is necessary to allow Yxxphi motif binding. A model for AP2 recruitment and activation is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1974643611,"Snail is a zinc finger transcription factor that triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by directly repressing E-cadherin expression. Snail is required for mesoderm and neural crest formation during embryonic development and has recently been implicated in the EMT associated with tumour progression. In a series of human breast carcinomas, we have analysed the expression of Snail and that of molecules of the E-cadherin/catenin complexes. We have also correlated these data with the pathological features of the tumours. We show that Snail expression inversely correlates with the grade of differentiation of the tumours and that it is expressed in all the infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC) presenting lymph node metastases that were analysed. In addition, Snail is expressed in some dedifferentiated tumours with a negative nodal status. Considering that Snail is involved in the induction of the invasive and migratory phenotype in epithelial cells, these results indicate that it is also involved in the progression of breast ductal tumours, where it could additionally serve as a marker of the metastatic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2096882849,"The neuropeptides pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are implicated in the photic entrainment of circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We now report that mice carrying a null mutation of the VPAC(2) receptor for VIP and PACAP (Vipr2(-/-)) are incapable of sustaining normal circadian rhythms of rest/activity behavior. These mice also fail to exhibit circadian expression of the core clock genes mPer1, mPer2, and mCry1 and the clock-controlled gene arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the SCN. Moreover, the mutants fail to show acute induction of mPer1 and mPer2 by nocturnal illumination. This study highlights the role of intercellular neuropeptidergic signaling in maintenance of circadian function within the SCN."
https://openalex.org/W2118083369,"Yeast contains a family of five related histone deacetylases (HDACs) whose functions are known at few genes. Therefore, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation and intergenic microarrays to generate genome-wide HDAC enzyme activity maps. Rpd3 and Hda1 deacetylate mainly distinct promoters and gene classes where they are recruited largely by novel mechanisms. Hda1 also deacetylates subtelomeric domains containing normally repressed genes that are used instead for gluconeogenesis, growth on carbon sources other than glucose, and adverse growth conditions. These domains have certain features of heterochromatin but are distinct from subtelomeric heterochromatin repressed by the deacetylase Sir2. Finally, Hos1/Hos3 and Hos2 preferentially affect ribosomal DNA and ribosomal protein genes, respectively. Thus, acetylation microarrays uncover the ""division of labor"" for yeast histone deacetylases."
https://openalex.org/W2087505934,"Fanconi anemia (FA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) are clinically distinct autosomal recessive disorders characterized by spontaneous chromosome breakage and hematological cancers. FA cells are hypersensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), while AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we identify the Fanconi anemia protein, FANCD2, as a link between the FA and ATM damage response pathways. ATM phosphorylates FANCD2 on serine 222 in vitro. This site is also phosphorylated in vivo in an ATM-dependent manner following IR. Phosphorylation of FANCD2 is required for activation of an S phase checkpoint. The ATM-dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 on S222 and the FA pathway-dependent monoubiquitination of FANCD2 on K561 are independent posttranslational modifications regulating discrete cellular signaling pathways. Biallelic disruption of FANCD2 results in both MMC and IR hypersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2077406857,"Electrical silencing of Drosophila circadian pacemaker neurons through targeted expression of K+ channels causes severe deficits in free-running circadian locomotor rhythmicity in complete darkness. Pacemaker electrical silencing also stops the free-running oscillation of PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins that constitutes the core of the cell-autonomous molecular clock. In contrast, electrical silencing fails to abolish PER and TIM oscillation in light-dark cycles, although it does impair rhythmic behavior. On the basis of these findings, we propose that electrical activity is an essential element of the free-running molecular clock of pacemaker neurons along with the transcription factors and regulatory enzymes that have been previously identified as required for clock function."
https://openalex.org/W2065063645,"The mechanism by which bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces osteoblast differentiation is not precisely known. We investigated the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway in modulation of this process. BMP-2 stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in osteogenic cells. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity with the specific inhibitor Ly-294002 prevented BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation. Expression of dominant-negative PI 3-kinase also abolished osteoblastic induction of alkaline phosphatase in response to BMP-2, confirming the involvement of this lipid kinase in this process. BMP-2 stimulated Akt serine/threonine kinase activity in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner in osteoblast precursor cells. Inhibition of Akt activity by a dominant-negative mutant of Akt blocked BMP-2-induced osteoblastic alkaline phosphatase activity. BMP-2 stimulates its own expression during osteoblast differentiation. Expression of dominant-negative PI 3-kinase or dominant-negative Akt inhibited BMP-2-induced BMP-2 transcription. Because all the known biological activities of BMP-2 are mediated by transcription via BMP-specific Smad proteins, we investigated the involvement of PI 3-kinase in Smad-dependent BMP-2 transcription. Smad5 stimulated BMP-2 transcription independent of addition of the ligand. Dominant-negative PI 3-kinase or dominant-negative Akt inhibited Smad5-dependent transcription of BMP-2. Furthermore dominant-negative Akt inhibited translocation of BMP-specific Smads into nucleus. Together these data provide the first evidence that activation of BMP receptor serine/threonine kinase stimulates the PI 3 kinase/Akt pathway and define a role for this signal transduction pathway in BMP-specific Smad function during osteoblast differentiation.

Full-Text PDF Open Access bone morphogenetic protein BMP receptor phosphatidylinositol dominant-negative hemagglutinin transforming growth factor green fluorescence protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase p-nitrophenylphosphate luciferase Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs),1 a group of polypeptides within the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily, were originally identified by their ability to induce endochondral bone formation in ectopic extraskeletal sites in vivo (1Reddi A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). BMPs stimulate differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells into the osteogenic lineage and enhance the differentiated function of osteoblasts. Among many other BMPs, BMP-2 induces differentiation of preosteoblasts into mature osteoblasts by regulating signals that stimulate a specific transcriptional program required for bone formation (2Sakou T. Bone. 1998; 22: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh-Choudhury N. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Crit. Rev. Euk. Gene Exp. 1994; 4: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar to TGF-β, BMPs exert their effect via type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (4Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 5Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar). The type II receptor binds the ligand with high affinity. The type I receptors, Alk3 (BMPRIA) and Alk6 (BMPRIB) are mainly responsible to transduce the signal, although they have weak BMP binding properties (6Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyaxono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Binding of BMP to its receptors induces phosphorylation of the type I receptor in its GS domain and recruitment of receptor-specific Smads (4Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 5Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar, 7Heldin C.-H. Myazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, Smad1, or one of its close homologs Smad5 and Smad8, heterodimerizes with the common Smad, Smad4. This complex translocates to the nucleus where it associates with transcriptional coactivators and acts as a transcription factor to regulate tissue or cell type-specific genes required for the divergent biological functions of BMPs (4Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 5Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar, 7Heldin C.-H. Myazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). In osteogenic cells, BMP-specific Smads stimulate expression of Cbfa1, the only known osteoblast-specific transcription factor to induce genes required for mature osteoblast differentiation and maintenance (8Karsenty G.

Differentiation in response to extracellular factors depends on the action of kinases including both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases (10Bonni A. Sun Y. Nadal-Vicens M. Bhatt A. Frank D.A.

Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). In the case of neuronal differentiation, the tyrosine kinase activity of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor and its downstream target ERK1/2-type of mitogen-activated serine/threonine protein kinase are essential (12Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). Recently a critical role for a lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), has been suggested in muscle and adipocyte differentiation (13Jiang B-H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14179-14183Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Suginoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Activation of PI 3-kinase is often associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation induced by growth and differentiation factors (15Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase functions as the focal point in cellular signaling leading to cell growth, regulating cytoskeletal structure, and preventing apoptosis (16Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 17Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Involvement of PI 3-kinase has recently been shown to regulate some of the biological properties of TGF-β such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and matrix protein expansion (19Bakin A.V.

However, the role of PI 3-kinase has not been investigated in osteogenesis, especially in response to BMPs. In this study, we show that BMP-2 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activity in osteogenic cells. We demonstrate the requirement of PI-3 kinase and its downstream target, Akt serine/threonine kinase, for BMP-2-induced expression of an osteoblast differentiation marker alkaline phosphatase, and for BMP-2 transcription. Finally we demonstrate that a cross-talk exists between BMP-specific Smad and PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway to induce transcription of BMP-2, a necessary growth and differentiation factor for osteogenic cells.

Immunocomplex PI 3-kinase assay showed that BMP-2 moderately increased PI 3-kinase activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1A). The mechanism by which PI 3-kinase is activated by growth factors depends upon tyrosine phosphorylation of protein(s) where the SH2 domain of the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associates with specific phosphotyrosine (15Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tested the effect of BMP-2 on tyrosine phosphorylation of protein in 2T3 cells. Immunoblotting of BMP-2-treated 2T3 cell lysates showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins to a variable extent (Fig.1B). Although the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase has been reported to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, BMP-2 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of any 85-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). However, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of p85 immunoprecipitates from BMP-2-treated 2T3 cell lysate showed increased association of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that PI 3-kinase is present in a tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling complex in BMP-2-treated cells indicating a possibility where the lipid kinase can be activated by association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in response to BMP-2. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was therefore used to immunoprecipitate and assay PI 3-kinase from lysates of BMP-2-treated 2T3 cells. BMP-2 significantly increased anti-phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1D) similar to that demonstrated in PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitates. Together these data indicate that BMP-2 regulates PI 3-kinase activity by stimulating association of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein present in a signaling complex. We showed previously that BMP-2-induced mature osteoblast formation in 2T3 cells is associated with expression of alkaline phosphatase mRNA, which directly correlates with its enzymatic activity (3Ghosh-Choudhury N. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Crit. Rev. Euk. Gene Exp. 1994; 4: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Ghosh-Choudhury N. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Harris M.A. Guerrero D.L. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used alkaline phosphatase activity as a measure of osteoblast differentiation. To study the potential role of PI 3-kinase in osteoblast differentiation, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, Ly-294002. 2T3 cells were treated with Ly-294002 followed by incubation with BMP-2. PI 3-kinase assay of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates showed that Ly-294002 blocked BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.2A, compare lane 4with lane 2). To test the effect of PI 3-kinase on BMP-2-mediated alkaline phosphatase expression, we treated 2T3 cells with BMP-2 in the presence and absence of Ly-294002 and stained for alkaline phosphatase activity. As expected, BMP-2 increased expression of alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2B, compare panel bwith panel a). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by Ly-294002 significantly blocked BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2B, compare panel d with panel b). In a parallel experiment, we assayed alkaline phosphatase activity in the lysates of 2T3 cells incubated with Ly-294002 plus BMP-2 and with BMP-2 alone. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity completely blocked BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig.2C). To further confirm the requirement of PI 3-kinase in this process, we transfected 2T3 cells with a dominant-negative p85 regulatory subunit that blocks the enzymatic activity of the catalytic p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase (34Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M-L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The cells were then treated with BMP-2, and expression of alkaline phosphatase was tested by activity staining. Expression of dominant-negative PI 3-kinase significantly blocked BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase expression (Fig.2D, compare panel d with panel b). Similarly, expression of dominant-negative p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase significantly blocked alkaline phosphatase activity in the lysates of 2T3 cells (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that PI 3-kinase-dependent signal transduction regulates BMP-2-induced expression of alkaline phosphatase. Although PI 3-kinase-independent activation of Akt has been documented, one of the principal downstream targets of PI 3-kinase is the serine/threonine kinase Akt (35Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar, 36Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Akt by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinases 1 and 2 represents the activated state of this enzyme (37Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To investigate whether BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation is mediated by Akt, we investigated the effect of BMP-2 on activation of Akt in 2T3 cells. Activation was determined by immunoblot analysis of lysates from BMP-2-treated 2T3 cells using an anti-phospho-Akt-specific antibody that recognizes the activated form. Akt was activated in response to BMP-2 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3A). The kinetics of BMP-2-induced Akt activation were similar to those of BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase activity in these cells (Fig. 1), suggesting that activation of Akt may be PI 3-kinase-dependent. To test this directly, we treated 2T3 cells with Ly-294002 followed by BMP-2. Similar to Akt activation determined by anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Fig.3A), BMP-2 stimulated Akt kinase activity as determined by Akt immunocomplex kinase assay using histone H2B as substrate (Fig.3B). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by Ly-294002 abolished BMP-2-induced Akt activity (Fig. 3B, compare lane 4 with lane 2). These data indicate that BMP-2 stimulates Akt kinase via activation of PI 3-kinase. Because PI 3-kinase is required for BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 2), we investigated whether the downstream target of PI 3-kinase, Akt serine/threonine kinase, regulates this process. We transfected a kinase-deficient Akt, which this group and others (25Ghosh Choudhury G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35636-35643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) have shown previously to act in a dominant-negative fashion, into 2T3 cells. Transfected cells were then incubated with BMP-2, and expression of alkaline phosphatase was tested by activity staining. Expression of dominant-negative Akt significantly blocked BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase staining (Fig.4A, compare panel dwith panel b). To confirm this observation, the alkaline phosphatase activity in the lysates was measured. Expression of dominant-negative Akt inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig.4B). Together these data indicate that BMP-2-stimulated PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade regulates alkaline phosphatase, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation. In the activated oligomeric receptor complex, BMPRI acts as the signal transmitter (6Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyaxono K.

To examine whether PI 3-kinase and Akt are stimulated by both these receptors, we used adenovirus vectors containing constitutively active BMPRIA (Ad-BMPRIA-QD) and BMPRIB (Ad-BMPRIB-QD). Infection of 2T3 cells with these vectors showed significant levels of expression of both these receptors (Fig.5A). As expected, BMPRIA migrated slightly slower than did BMPRIB (Fig. 5A) (41Fujii M.

Holliday junction hydroxyurea methylmethane sulfonate camptothecin displacement loop double-stranded break nuclear localization sequence green fluorescent protein topoisomerase I Edinburgh Minimal Medium A key intermediate of homologous recombination is the four-way DNA (Holliday) junction (HJ),1which is formed by the reciprocal exchange of strands between homologous DNA molecules in a reaction catalyzed by the RecA/Rad51 family of proteins. HJs can also form from the regression of stalled replication forks (1Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 2Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Once formed, HJs have to be removed from the DNA to enable chromosome segregation. In Escherichia coli RuvABC processes HJs by the combined action of a branch migration enzyme (RuvAB) and a junction-targeted endonuclease (RuvC). In the absence of RuvABC the presence of an alternative branch migration enzyme (RecG) together with mutations that activate the expression of an alternative resolvase (RusA) means that recombination and DNA repair can proceed at near wild-type levels (reviewed in Ref. 4Sharples G.J. Ingleston S.M. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key role for these enzymes is to facilitate the restart of replication when replication forks stall at blockages in the DNA template (reviewed in Ref. 5Kuzminov A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). One strategy involves the regression of the fork by RecG, which forms an HJ when the two nascent DNA strands anneal. Cleavage of this HJ by RuvABC collapses the replication fork, and the resulting free double-stranded end is processed to generate a 3′-OH terminated single-stranded tail that, in a RecA-mediated reaction, invades the intact chromosome to form a displacement loop (D loop). PriA promotes assembly of the replisome at the 3′ invading strand end of the D loop. At the opposite end of the D loop, an HJ is formed that is cleaved by RuvABC to complete the process. To identify genes involved in processing HJs, in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe, we have systematically screened recombination/repair mutants for suppression of their phenotypes by RusA. We have reported previously that RusA partially suppresses aberrant chromosome segregation in rqh1−mutants (6Doe C.L. Dixon J. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). rqh1 encodes a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases that also includes the Bloom’s, Werner’s, and Rothmund-Thomson’s syndrome helicases in humans (7Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). RecQ helicases are implicated in controlling recombination at stalled replication forks by reversing the regression of the fork and thereby preventing its collapse through cleavage of the HJ that is formed (6Doe C.L. Dixon J. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C.

A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It appears that RusA provides an alternative way of removing HJs that would otherwise remain unprocessed in a rqh1−mutant and impede sister chromatid segregation (6Doe C.L. Dixon J. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mus81-Eme1 is a heterodimeric endonuclease that is required for spore viability, tolerance of UV light and hydroxyurea (HU), and viability in the absence of Rqh1 (10Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Mus81-Eme1 is also an essential component of an activity, purified from S. pombe cells, that resolves synthetic HJs in vitro (a similar activity has been detected with human Mus81 purified from HeLa cells) (11Boddy M.N.

McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates III, J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Based on these data Russell and co-workers (11Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.-H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates III, J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) have proposed that Mus81-Eme1 resolves HJs during meiotic recombination and, in vegetative cells, provides an alternative to Rqh1 for processing HJs formed at regressed replication forks. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mus81 forms a heteromeric complex with Mms4, which shares sequence similarity to Eme1 (13Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ScMus81-Mms4, like SpMus81-Eme1, is required for the tolerance of agents that cause replication fork stalling and for viability in the absence of Sgs1 (a homologue of Rqh1) (14Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike SpMus81-Eme1, spore viability is not dramatically reduced in the absence of ScMus81-Mms4 (15de los Santos T. Loidl J. Larkin B. Hollingsworth N.M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1511-1525PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recombinant ScMus81-Mms4 purified from E. colicleaves synthetic HJs very poorly, whereas replication fork substrates are cleaved well (13Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These data have lead to the proposal that ScMus81-Mms4, rather than resolving HJs, cleaves stalled replication forks to facilitate replication restart and in meiosis removes 3′ DNA flaps formed during the repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) by a pathway of “strand displacement and annealing” (13Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 15de los Santos T. Loidl J. Larkin B. Hollingsworth N.M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1511-1525PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide additional evidence that Mus81-Eme1 and Rqh1 provide overlapping activities for processing DNA junctions at stalled replication forks. However, based on the in vitro activity of recombinant protein, we propose that Mus81-Eme1 cleaves replication forks before they have regressed to form an HJ. We also present evidence that Mus81-Eme1 and Rqh1 promote the repair of collapsed replication forks, although here their functions appear not to overlap.

The nucleotide sequence of the cloned eme1 cDNA revealed that the first of its two putative introns is larger than predicted in the current S. pombe gene data base by 9 bp (S. pombe GeneDB). A gtttgt sequence 5′ of the predicted gtattt splice donor site appears to be the real donor site (data not shown). The eme1 cDNA was cloned into pET14b to make pMW560, which expresses Eme1 with a hexahistidine tag at its N terminus. pMW562 was made by cloning mus81 with the T7 phage Ø10 promoter from pMW525 into pMW560 to make a plasmid that expresses both His-tagged Eme1 and untagged Mus81 from independent T7 phage Ø10 promoters. 1-Liter batches of E. coli BL21(DE3) plysS (18Studier F.W.

At a cell density corresponding to an A600 of 0.5, NLS-RusA-GFP was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, following which the cells were incubated for a further 2 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol), and frozen at −80 °C until required. All of the subsequent steps were at 4 °C. The defrosted cells were mixed with 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors before passage through a French pressure cell at 30,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at 43,700 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.2m NaCl. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a 10-ml phosphocellulose column, which was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A with 0.2 m NaCl before eluting protein with a 160-ml gradient from 0.2 to 1.0 m NaCl. NLS-RusA-GFP eluting between 0.7 and 0.8 m NaCl was pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A with 0.2 m NaCl. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 27,200 × g for 15 min, and the pelleted material, consisting mainly of NLS-RusA-GFP, was redissolved in Buffer A with 1.0m NaCl before aliquoting and storage at −20 °C. E. coli BL21-RIL cells (Stratagene) containing pMW562 were grown and induced as for NLS-RusA-GFP above. The harvested cells were resuspended in Buffer H (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100 and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 30,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation at 43,700 × g for 50 min, the supernatant was loaded directly onto a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) that was washed with 60 ml of Buffer H and 25 mmimidazole before eluting bound Mus81-Eme1 with Buffer H and 200 mm imidazole into 2-ml fractions. The second 2-ml fraction contained the peak of Mus81-Eme1 and was loaded directly onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), which was then developed with 120 ml of Buffer A with 150 mmNaCl. The fractions containing Mus81-Eme1 were detected by both SDS-PAGE and screening fractions for fork and X-12 cleavage activity, and the peak fractions were then pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl), and stored as aliquots at −80 °C.

Nuclease reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 0.5 nm labeled substrate DNA in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and protein as indicated.

To see whether they are also hypersensitive to replication fork collapse,mus81, eme1, and rqh1 single mutant strains and a mus81 eme1 double mutant strain were tested for their sensitivity to the topoisomerase I (Top1) poison camptothecin (CPT) (Fig. 1). CPT stabilizes Top1-DNA covalent intermediates by inhibiting the religation step and in so doing leads to the accumulation of strand breaks in the DNA (22Porter S.E. Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The toxic effect of CPT appears to be due to the collapse of replication forks at these strand breaks (23Avemann K. Knippers R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 24Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). mus81 andeme1 mutant strains are extremely sensitive to CPT, whereasrqh1− cells are sensitive but less so (Fig.1A). S. cerevisiae mus81/mms4 top1 andsgs1 top1 double mutants each grow slower than their respective single mutants (14Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore at least part of the CPT hypersensitivity of mus81/eme1 andrqh1 mutants might be attributable to an overlap in function with Top1. To investigate this possibility we constructedmus81− top1− andrqh1− top1− double mutant strains and compared them with their respective single mutant strains for viability in the presence and absence of CPT (Fig.1C). In the absence of CPT themus81− top1− double mutant strain grew about as well as the mus81−single mutant strain, and the rqh1−top1− double mutant grew only slightly slower than the rqh1− single mutant strain. These data show that the hypersensitivity of mus81− andrqh1− to CPT is not due to an overlap in function with Top1. Instead the rescue ofmus81− and rqh1−hypersensitivity to CPT by deleting top1 (Fig.1C) shows that Top1 is required to mediate the toxic effect of CPT. These data indicate that Mus81-Eme1 and Rqh1 promote the repair of collapsed replication forks. In S. cerevisiae the repair of collapsed replication forks is dependent on the RAD52 epistasis group of proteins (29Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of the mus81 mutant with strains mutated for several S. pombe homologues of the RAD52epistasis group shows that it is more sensitive to CPT than therad50, rhp51, rhp55, andrad22A mutant strains (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the only member of this group that is more sensitive thanmus81− is rhp54−. These data emphasize the importance of Mus81 and Eme1 for the repair of collapsed replication forks. The hypersensitivity of an rqh1mutant to UV light and HU can be partially suppressed by the E. coli RusA resolvase that is highly specific for cleaving HJs (6Doe C.L. Dixon J. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For these experiments RusA was modified to include an N-terminal NLS that efficiently targets it to the nucleus of S. pombe and a C-terminal GFP tag that provides a marker for expression and localization. Expression of NLS-RusA-GFP was controlled from the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter on a pREP1 plasmid (pREP1-rus). A pREP41 derivative (pREP41-rus) was also used that expressed the NLS-RusA-GFP from an attenuated nmt1 promoter. Using these plasmids or strains containing the Pnmt-NLS-rusA-GFP cassette integrated into the chromosome, we tested whether the hypersensitivity of anrqh1− mutant to MMS and CPT is suppressed by RusA (Fig. 2 and data not shown). An approximate 10-fold improvement in survival in the presence of MMS is obtained when NLS-RusA-GFP is expressed from the chromosome or from a plasmid in the absence of thiamine similar to the suppression of UV light and HU hypersensitivity observed previously (6Doe C.L. Dixon J. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The expression of a nuclease-dead D70N mutant of RusA that retains wild-type levels of DNA binding failed to suppress MMS sensitivity, confirming that suppression depends on the cleavage of HJs. In contrast, neither NLS-RusA-GFP nor NLS-RusAD70N-GFP suppresses the hypersensitivity ofrqh1− to CPT (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Furthermore, the hypersensitivity of rqh1− to ionizing radiation is also not suppressed by NLS-RusA-GFP (data not shown). From these results we conclude that Rqh1 has a role in promoting the repair of collapsed replication forks and DSBs that cannot be substituted by an HJ resolvase. mus81, eme1, and mus81 eme1 mutant strains were tested for suppression of their hypersensitivities to UV light, HU, MMS, and CPT by RusA. In the case of the mus81− strain expression of NLS-RusA-GFP from either pREP1-rus or pREP41-rus suppresses its sensitivity to UV light, HU, MMS, and CPT about as well as plasmid-expressed Mus81 (pREP41-mus81) (Fig. 3). Interestingly pREP1-rus provides better levels of suppression than pREP41-rus for HU, MMS, and CPT sensitivities but not for UV light sensitivity. This may be due to a toxic effect of too much HJ resolution in the presence of UV light damage. When the expression of NLS-RusA-GFP is repressed in the presence of thiamine, the hypersensitivities ofmus81− cells transformed with pREP41-rus and pREP41-mus81 are indistinguishable from those transformed with the empty pREP1 vector. However, some beneficial effect of pREP1-rus is still observed because of incomplete repression of the nmt1promoter. To see whether suppression depends on the resolution of HJs, the nuclease-dead D70N mutant of RusA was used. Neither pREP1-rusD70N nor pREP41-rusD70N suppresses the DNA damage sensitivity of themus81− strain consistent with the resolution of HJs being necessary for suppression. In fact a marked negative effect of pREP1-rusD70N was observed possibly because of high levels of the mutant RusA protein binding to HJs and preventing their processing. Results similar to those shown in Fig. 3 were obtained with theeme1 and mus81 eme1 mutant strains (data not shown). The ability of RusA to substitute for Mus81-Eme1 provides strong evidence that the essential function of these proteins is to resolve HJs or DNA junctions that would otherwise become HJs. Furthermore, the suppression of CPT hypersensitivity by RusA provides an interesting contrast to rqh1− cells where RusA fails to reduce CPT sensitivity. Seemingly the critical role of Mus81-Eme1 in repairing collapsed replication forks is to resolve HJs or DNA junctions that can mature into HJs. Mus81 is essential for viability in the absence of Rqh1 (10Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We have found that the same is true for Eme1.2 To see whether the essential defect here is an inability to process HJs or DNA junctions that can become HJs, we attempted to rescue the inviability of rqh1− mus81− cells by the expression of RusA. rqh1− andmus81− strains carrying chromosomally integrated Pnmt-NLS-rusA-GFP were crossed in the absence of thiamine. Asci from the cross were then microdissected, and the liberated spores were grown in the absence of thiamine on nutrient agar plates. Once grown the colonies were replica-plated onto medium containing thiamine, allowed to grow, and then replica-plated again onto thiamine-containing medium and also onto medium with no thiamine. Using this strategy, putative rqh1 mus81 double mutants that were viable when RusA was expressed but dead when it was repressed were identified (Fig.4). The double mutant status of these strains was confirmed by the segregation ofrqh1− and mus81− cells after back-crossing to a wild-type strain (data not shown). These data indicate that the essential defect in rqh1−mus81− cells is an inability to process HJs or DNA junctions that can become HJs. The fact that RusA only suppressesrqh1− hypersensitivity to agents that cause fork stalling suggests that the lethal DNA junctions inrqh1− mus81− cells arise at stalled forks as opposed to during the repair of collapsed forks. Our interpretation of the preceding data depends on the high specificity of RusA for cleaving HJs. RusA is a homodimer of 14-kDa subunits that binds to a range of DNA junctions; however, its nuclease activity is essentially restricted to HJs where cleavage occurs 5′ of CC dinucleotides positioned at or close to the junction cross-over point (30Chan S.N. Harris L. Bolt E.L. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14873-14882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Chan S.N. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This has been reinforced by recent work from Bolt and Lloyd, 3R. Lloyd, personal communication. who have shown that optimal nuclease activity by RusA depends on the interaction of both its subunits with symmetrically positioned cleavage sites ensuring that cleavage activity is directed to HJs with high specificity. To further substantiate the contention that RusA is a valid probe for HJs, we have compared the ability of purified NLS-RusA-GFP to cleave a synthetic HJ (X-12), a model replication fork, and two junctions that resemble replication forks that have regressed to expose either a 3′ or 5′ single-stranded tail (regressed forks 1 and 2, respectively). Each substrate is related by a common radiolabeled strand and contains potential CC dinucleotide cleavage sites for NLS-RusA-GFP (Fig.5B). As expected NLS-RusA-GFP cleaves X-12 very efficiently to generate nicked linear duplex products (Fig. 5C, lanes b and c). In contrast, NLS-RusA-GFP failed to cleave the fork substrate (Fig. 5C, lanes g and h) and generated only a very low level of cleavage products with both regressed forks 1 and 2 (lanes l, m, q, and r). These data are consistent with the high specificity of RusA for HJs. To further investigate the specificity of NLS-RusA-GFP, we tested whether it could suppress the DNA damage sensitivity of rad16, swi10, rad2, and exo1 mutants. These genes all encode DNA structure-specific nucleases. Rad16, like Mus81, is a member of the XPF family of endonucleases and forms a complex with Swi10 that makes the 5′ incision during nucleotide excision repair and removes 3′-ended single-stranded flaps during the repair of DSBs by single-stranded annealing (32Carr A.M.

Experimental model systems designed to study cellular transformation ex vivo have relied to date on the in vitro selection of a subpopulation of cells that have become immortalized through treatment with chemical or physical mutagens and the selection of rare clonal variants. In this study, we describe the direct immortalization of primary human airway epithelial cells through the successive introduction of the Simian Virus 40 Early Region and the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT. Cells immortalized in this way are now responsive to malignant transformation by an introduced H-ras or K-ras oncogene. These immortalized human airway epithelial cells, which have been created through the stepwise introduction of genetic alterations, provide a novel experimental model system with which to study further the biology of the airway epithelial cell and to dissect the molecular basis of lung cancer pathogenesis."

To investigate the structural requirements for the cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1, we have determined the topology of these two domains and generated transporters harboring five naturally occurring missense mutations in them. These mutants, unlike wild type ABCA1, produced little or no apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux when transfected into 293 cells, establishing their causality in Tangier disease. Because all five mutant proteins were well expressed and detectable on the plasma membrane, their interaction with the ABCA1 ligand, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, was measured using bifunctional cross-linking agents. Four of five mutants had a marked decline in cross-linking to apoA-I, whereas one (W590S) retained full cross-linking activity. Cross-linking of apoA-I was temperature-dependent, rapid in onset, and detectable with both lipid- and water-soluble cross-linking agents. These results suggest that apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux cannot occur without a direct interaction between the apoprotein and critical residues in two extracellular loops of ABCA1.

Although it is clear that ABCA1 plays a critical role in the transfer of lipid to apoA-I, the structural determinants of this molecular interaction have not been elucidated. Both the topological disposition of ABCA1 within the lipid bilayer and the domains of the transporter that are required for the interaction within apoA-I remain unclear. We previously showed that the first hydrophobic domain of the transporter acts as a signal sequence, leading to the extracellular positioning of the largest putative loop of the protein, comprising amino acids ∼44–640 (17Fitzgerald M.L.

Other laboratories subsequently confirmed this finding in ABCA1 as well as in another A class ABC transporter, ABCR (also called ABCA4) (18Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R.

Although the disposition of this loop with respect to the extracellular space is firmly established, there remains a controversy over the tethering of this loop to the plasma membrane at its N-terminal end. Data from Tanaka et al. (19Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggested that the loop was not tethered, whereas our studies (17Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) provided evidence for an uncleaved signal anchor sequence that would tether the loop to the plasma membrane at both ends. In addition to this N-terminal extracellular loop, ABCA1 also contains an unusual, highly hydrophobic sequence in the central region of the transporter that was originally modeled as a hairpin structure embedded in but not traversing the lipid bilayer (20Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Such a model has been challenged by recent experimental data on ABCR, a close homolog of ABCA1. Mutation of potential N-glycosylation sites in ABCR indicated that its highly hydrophobic domain traverses the lipid bilayer, producing another large extracellular domain in the central region of the protein (18Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Whether the central highly hydrophobic domain of ABCA1 adopts a similar topology remains an unanswered question. The topological arrangement of these two domains is particularly important, because approximately half of all described missense mutations associated with Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia fall within these two regions (6Brooks-Wilson A.

If both regions are indeed extracellular, they provide a potential target for binding of the apolipoprotein ligands that stimulate ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. In this study, we demonstrate that the highly hydrophobic domain of ABCA1 also traverses the plasma membrane, resulting in the extracellular positioning of amino acids ∼1371–1650. With this data in hand, it was plausible then to test the hypothesis that mutations in these loops affect the interaction of ABCA1 with its apolipoprotein ligand, apoA-I. The results of these experiments indicate that both of the large extracellular loops contain residues that are critical to the direct interaction of apoA-I and ABCA1 and that alterations in these residues can lead to a loss of function of the transporter. This work establishes the causality of these mutations in individuals with disrupted ABCA1 function and also clarifies the process by which apoA-I interacts with the transporter. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated suppliers: LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), DSP, DSG, DSTTP (Pierce), Gamma Bind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, FLAG-bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Sigma),N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), and poly-d-Lysine coated tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Five missense mutants of ABCA1 (R587W, W590S, Q597R, C1477R, and S1506L) were generated using overlap polymerase chain reaction methods, as described previously (17Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J.

The regulatory domain construct (AA 843–1650) and the highly hydrophobic sequence (HHS) construct (AA 1311–1650) were generated by PCR using wt-ABCA1 cDNA as a template. The forward primers contained anNcoI site that generates a Kozak consensus sequence with a favorable initiator methionine, and the reverse primer encoded a 9-amino acid rhodopsin epitope (TETSQVAPA) at the C terminus of the constructs. The 8-amino acid FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was inserted after AA 207 and 1396 by restricting the ABCA1 cDNA with BstEII and Bsu36I, respectively, and ligating in duplex oligonucleotides encoding the FLAG tags. All of the constructs and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, to confirm both the introduction of the desired changes and the absence of unintended PCR mutations. HEK293-EBNA-T cells (generous gift of Brian Seed, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated plates and transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 as described previously (17Fitzgerald M.L.

For immunoprecipitations of untagged ABCA1 polypeptides, a polyclonal rabbit anti-serum directed against the last 200 AA of ABCA1 was used (17Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P.

Cholesterol efflux assays, cellular association of apoA-I, and cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1 were carried out as described by Wang et al. (13Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) with the minor modifications noted below. For efflux assays, HEK293-EBNA-T cells plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates were transfected with empty vector or the appropriate ABCA1 construct (1 μg of DNA/well) and radiolabeled for 24 h with [1,2-3H]cholesterol (0.5 μCi/ml). The labeled cells were wash twice with warm PBS and allowed to incubate in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were transferred into fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin) with or without delipidated apoA-I (10 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. The medium was removed and clarified of cellular material, and the effluxed cholesterol was quantitated by scintillation counting. The cell layers were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and the cellular cholesterol was quantitated by scintillation counting. The cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percentage effluxed (media counts/(media counts + cellular counts) ×100). Other inducers of ABCA1 expression (e.g. LXR agonists, cAMP mimetics, or cholesterol loading) were not included. ABCA1 constructs carrying the FLAG epitopes were transfected into HEK293-EBNA-T cells in 24-well plates. 24 h after transfection, the cells were chilled on ice. To analyze cell surface FLAG tag expression, the medium was directly replaced with blocking solution (1× PBS, 5% dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin). To measure total FLAG tag expression, the cells were first fixed and permeabilized by incubation in 1× PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by two washes in 1× PBS, and a subsequent incubation in 1× PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min with a final two washes in 1× PBS before incubation in blocking solution. The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was then added to the blocking solution (4 μg/ml), the cells were incubated for 1 h on ice and washed three times with cold PBS. Bound M2 antibody was subsequently detected by a 1-h incubation on ice in blocking buffer containing 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (4 μg/ml). The cells were washed three times with cold 1× PBS and lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and bound counts were determined by γ counting. The total cellular protein in the lysates was determined using a micro-BCA assay (Pierce), and bound counts were expressed per mg of total cellular protein. Putative mutations in the ABCA1 transporter, identified by genetic studies of families with Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, have the potential to provide important insights into the structural requirements for transporter function (6Brooks-Wilson A.

Before exploring structure/function relations using such mutants, their functional significance needs to be confirmed to eliminate the possibility that the putative mutations represent sequence polymorphisms in linkage dysequilibrium with another as yet unidentified causal mutation. In this work, we selected five missense mutations reported in Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia families and generated constructs that permitted the measurement of their functional activity. These mutations mapped to two domains in the transporter, one of which we had demonstrated to be extracellular (17Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These loops were of interest, because approximately half of the missense mutations reported in Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia cohorts fall within these two regions of the transporter. We hypothesized that both loops might be extracellular and could therefore mediate a direct interaction with the ABCA1 ligand, apoA-I. If this hypothesis were correct, the mutations might disrupt this interaction, providing both an explanation for their causality and, perhaps, novel insights into the mechanism by which apoA-I stimulates ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Five missense mutations (R587W, W590S, Q597R, C1477R, and S1506L) were introduced into a wild type ABCA1 cDNA using PCR mutagenesis techniques. Three of these mutations (R587W, W590S, and Q597R) fall in a tight cluster within the large N-terminal loop at a point near the putative second transmembrane domain shown in Fig. 3. The other two mutations (C1477R and S1506L) fall within the central loop of the protein. To characterize whether these single amino acid changes did indeed disrupt ABCA1 lipid transport, cholesterol efflux assays were performed comparing the mutants to wild type ABCA1. 24 h after transfection and labeling with [3H]cholesterol, 293-EBNA-T cells were left alone or exposed to 10 μg/ml delipidated apoA-I for 4 h. For all five mutants, a profound deficit in efflux activity was measured (Fig.1). These findings indicate that each of these mutations is causally involved in the disruption of cellular cholesterol efflux, which is a cell biologic hallmark of Tangier disease. To explore further the mechanism of this disruption, it was important to establish their topological location within the ABCA1 transporter.Figure 1Missense mutations in the two large extracellular loops ablate ABCA1 efflux activity. The cells were transfected with either empty vector (mock), wild type ABCA1 (WT), or ABCA1 constructs carrying the indicated point mutations (R587W, W590S, Q597R, C1477R, and S1506L). After labeling for 24 h with [3H]cholesterol, the cells were exposed to apoA-I (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h or to medium alone. Counts of [3H]cholesterol were determined for the medium and cells and expressed as apoA-I-dependent efflux (apo-A1-dependent efflux minus medium-only-dependent efflux). Absolute apoA-I and medium efflux values, respectively, are as follows: mock, 1.59 ± 0.04%versus 1.21 ± 0.39%; WT, 3.92 ± 0.13%versus 1.9 ± 0.08%; R587W, 1.78 ± 0.11%versus 1.61 ± 0.24%; W590S, 1.92 ± 0.24%versus 1.63 ± 0.08%; Q597R, 1.5 ± 0.14%versus 1.49 ± 0.03%; C1477R, 1.67 ± 0.18%versus 1.52 ± 0.15%; and S1506L, 1.66 ± 0.28%versus 1.6 ± 0.13%.

Theerror bars represent the standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the three mutations clustered around position 590 in the N-terminal loop were clearly in the loop previously shown to be positioned in the extracellular space, the topological location of the other two mutations was unknown. ABCA1 contains an additional hydrophobic sequence (AA 1351–1370) that is unique to the A class of ABC transporters. Originally called the HHS, this loop has been modeled as a hairpin embedded in the lipid bilayer but not traversing it (Ref.20Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar and Fig. 2, left panel). However, a recent study of another A class transporter (ABCR) indicated that its homologous HHS could indeed traverse the bilayer (18Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine the topology of the HHS and the adjacent central region of ABCA1, two approaches were employed. The first was aimed at testing whether the HHS segment could function as a transmembrane domain when tested in the context of a subdomain of the full-length transporter. This approach permitted the use of glycosylation assays to establish the orientation of loops flanking the HHS domain. The second approach utilized the insertion of a 9-amino acid epitope tag (FLAG) in the full-length cDNA, followed by analysis of anti-FLAG antibody binding to this FLAG-tagged construct. When HHS is expressed in the context of the entire central region of ABCA1 (AA 843–1650) as depicted in Fig. 2 (REG, left bottom panel) or as part of a smaller subregion (AA 1311–1650, HHS, right bottom panel), the resulting polypeptides were found to be glycosylated, as evidenced by their increased migration in SDS-PAGE gels following treatment with glycosidases (Fig. 2,center panels). These results establish that the highly hydrophobic sequence, when expressed in these subdomain contexts, can function as a transmembrane domain and position amino acids 1371–1650 in the extracellular space (Fig. 2, right top panel). To confirm that the HHS functioned as a transmembrane domain in the context of a full-length transporter, glycosylation assays could not be used. Instead, a FLAG epitope tag was inserted at AA 1396 (Fig.3) and binding to anti-FLAG antibody measured in permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells. A control construct was created using the same FLAG tag inserted in the extracellular N-terminal loop (at AA 207, Fig. 3). The two FLAG-tagged transporters effluxed as much cellular cholesterol to apoA-I as wild type, untagged ABCA1 (Fig. 4A, WT versus N-FL and R2-FL, respectively), indicating that the FLAG insertions at these two positions did not disrupt functional activity. When transfected into cells, they also stimulated cellular binding to apoA-I. The stimulation of binding by the N-terminal FLAG construct was indistinguisha"

In cycling extracts from Xenopus embryos, progression into M phase requires the polyadenylation-induced translation of cyclin B1 mRNA. Polyadenylation is mediated by the phosphorylation of CPEB by Aurora, a kinase whose activity oscillates with the cell cycle. Exit from M phase seems to require deadenylation and subsequent translational silencing of cyclin B1 mRNA by Maskin, a CPEB and eIF4E binding factor, whose expression is cell cycle regulated. These observations suggest that regulated cyclin B1 mRNA translation is essential for the embryonic cell cycle. Mammalian cells also display a cell cycle-dependent cytoplasmic polyadenylation, suggesting that translational control by polyadenylation might be a general feature of mitosis in animal cells."

The recently discovered proangiogenic activity of leptin suggested the hypothesis that its production might be regulated by hypoxia, as are other angiogenic factors. To examine this proposal, the expression of leptin protein and mRNA was measured and found to be markedly up-regulated in response to ambient or chemical hypoxia (upon exposure to desferrioxamine or cobalt chloride), an effect that requires intact RNA synthesis, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism. Transient transfection of cultured cells with deletion constructs of the leptin gene promoter linked to a reporter gene revealed a functional hypoxiaresponse element (HRE) located at position –116 within the proximal upstream region. This putative HRE harbors a characteristic 5′-RCGTG-3′ core motif, a hallmark of hypoxia-sensitive genes and recognized by the hypoxia-induciblefactor 1 (HIF1), which consists of a HIF1α/HIFβ heterodimer. Constructs harboring this –116/HRE supported reporter gene expression in response to hypoxia but not when mutated.

Virtually all cells are capable of sensing changes in O2 tension (pO2) and respond adaptively when the O2 demand exceeds supply, a condition referred to as hypoxia (1Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Hypoxia can develop as a result of ischemia resulting from hypoperfusion, either as a pathological condition or as a transient physiological event (1Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Under chronic conditions of hypoxia, typical adaptation responses generally include changes in the expression of genes encoding molecules that facilitate O2 delivery or by activating metabolic pathways that do not require O2, thus maintaining energy homeostasis when O2 availability is limited (1Gleadle J.M.

Underlying the changes in expression of these erythropoietic, vasoactive, or enzymatic molecules are regulatory mechanisms that modulate transcription of the corresponding genes as well as the rate of mRNA degradation (15Semenza G.L.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). A crucial component in the induction of hypoxia-regulated genes is the transcription factorhypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), which activates transcription by binding to a specificcis-acting regulatory sequence referred to ashypoxia response element (HRE), a hallmark of hypoxia-sensitive target genes (2Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar, 17Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The HIF1 protein complex consists of a heterodimer composed of HIF1α and HIF1β subunits (17Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar, 18Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Each of these subunits contains basic-helix-loop-helix motifs and other functional domains required for DNA binding, protein heterodimerization, and transactivation of target genes (2Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar, 15Semenza G.L. Agani F. Iyer N. Jiang B.H. Leung S. Wiener C. Yu A.

The HIF1α subunit, an 826-amino acid protein of 93 kDa, is a member of the PAS protein family by virtue of its homology toDrosophila melanogaster genes encoding the period (Per) and single-minded (Sim) transcription factors and to the mammalian arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein (ARNT), which is now recognized to be the HIF1β subunit (17Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). The HIF1β/ARNT subunit can also heterodimerize with the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) forming HIF1β·AHR complexes, which mediate the transcriptional xenobiotic response (19Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). However, under conditions of hypoxia, it is the HIF1α/β heterodimer that is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to HREs in target genes, thereby causing activation of transcription (15Semenza G.L. Agani F. Iyer N. Jiang B.H. Leung S. Wiener C. Yu A. Chest. 1998; 114: 40S-45SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The HRE consists of the pentanucleotide core consensus sequence 5′-RCGTG-3′, which can be located in the 5′- or 3′-flanking regions as well as within the introns of hypoxia-inducible genes (16Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the hormone leptin exhibits robust angiogenic activity when assayed by in vitro and in vivo experiments (20Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Nath A.K. Murakami C. Garcia-Cardena G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Madge L.A. Schechner J.S. Schwabb M.B. Polverini P.J. Flores-Riveros J.R. Science. 1998; 281: 1683-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). This unexpected biological activity of leptin is in contrast with the prevailing view of its function, which portrays leptin as a key regulator of body weight primarily through its extensively documented central nervous system-mediated effects on food intake and energy expenditure (21Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). However, a more complex scheme of leptin action has subsequently emerged involving other peripheral physiological systems in addition to central regulation of appetite and body weight (21Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 22Fantuzzi G. Faggioni R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 437-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role in angiogenesis, it is conceivable that leptin expression might also be modulated by physiological cues that typically regulate angiogenic factors. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the hypothesis that expression of the leptin gene is induced by hypoxia through transcriptional machinery and mechanisms commonly used by genes encoding products involved in angiogenesis or oxygen homeostasis. Here we show that leptin expression is markedly up-regulated in response to hypoxia, an event that requires intact RNA synthesis. We examine the activity of the leptin gene promoter linked to a reporter gene in transiently transfected cells and demonstrate the existence of a functional HRE, which is required for hypoxic induction and is transactivated by HIF1α. We also show that the HIF1α/β heterodimer binds to this leptin promoter HRE upon exposure to hypoxia, and we demonstrate that HRE mutations that disable HIF1α/β binding eliminate leptin promoter activation. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the leptin gene is actively engaged by hypoxia through mechanisms that are common to other hypoxia-inducible genes, consistent with the concept of leptin as a bona fideangiogenic factor. The monoclonal antibodies against human cell-specific markers (fibroblast, CD31, cytokeratin-1, muscle-specific actin) used for immunostaining and verification of fibroblastic character were purchased from Dako Ltd. (Cambridgeshire, UK). Fetal bovine serum, cell culture medium (RPMI), and reagents were from Invitrogen. Radioimmunoassay kits for detection of human leptin were obtained from Linco Research, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The pCR2.1/TA vector for direct cloning of PCR products was purchased from Invitrogen, and the pGL3-Basic vector for promoter/luciferase plasmid construction was from Promega (Madison, WI). The unique site-elimination mutagenesis kit, Hybond-N+ nylon membranes, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kits and high performance ECL film (Hyperfilm) were all purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The TRI-Reagent for preparing RNA was obtained from Molecular Research Center (Cincinnati, OH). The pSVβGal reporter vector was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), and the reporter lysis buffer and β-galactosidase chemiluminescence assay kit were purchased from Promega. The HIF1α cDNA expression vector was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and the anti-HIF1α and anti-HIF1β antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). CoCl2 and desferrioxamine (DFO) were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Bio-Rad. The isotopes [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. For initial experiments, human skin dermal fibroblasts (hSDF) were isolated from explants of human dermis cut into 5-mm3 pieces and covered with RPMI culture medium, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin, until fibroblasts began to migrate out of the explants. Residual explants were then removed, and freshly isolated cells were propagated in RPMI medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. For studies of endogenous leptin expression, cells were kept at low passage (never exceeding 4) and grown to reach 70–80% confluence. Only freshly isolated cells were grown (never from a frozen stock). The fibroblastic character of the cells isolated was verified by positive stain reaction with anti-human fibroblast (clone 5B5) and negative stain with anti-human CD31 (clone JC/70A), cytokeratin-1 (clone 34βB4), or muscle specific actin (clone HHF35). For other experiments involving hSDF, normal human dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured in fibroblast growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, insulin, and human basic fibroblast growth factor (Clonetics), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Only cells from passages 3–12 were used in this study. For some experiments, HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin sulfate. For experiments requiring ambient hypoxia conditions, cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere connected to a source of nitrogen. The oxygen level was adjusted by mixing in a balanced tension of N2 through a gas inlet valve controlled by a model 110 Proox programmable oxygen sensor (Reming Bioinstruments, Redfield, NY), set to either 21% O2 for normoxia or the indicated levels of oxygen (5–0.5%) for hypoxia. For experiments requiring chemical hypoxia, cells were incubated in the presence of 150 mm CoCl2 or 100 mm DFO for the indicated periods of time. Culture medium from subconfluent monolayers of fibroblasts exposed to the indicated levels of oxygen (hypoxia or normoxia) was collected and stored immediately at –80 °C until further use. The concentration of leptin was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit for human leptin, essentially following the manufacturer’s instructions. Duplicate samples were serially diluted 2-fold falling within the sensitivity range of the assay kit (0.05–10 ng/ml), using human recombinant leptin as a calibration standard. Fibroblasts exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions were harvested, and total cellular RNA was extracted by a modified acid-guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (TRI-Reagent). Reverse transcription and PCR amplification of the full-length leptin coding region in the mRNA transcript (Ref. 23Gong D.W., Bi, S. Pratley R.E. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3971-3974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; GenBank accession no. U43653) were conducted using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of 0.5 μg of total RNA, a forward primer (5′-CCATCCTGGGAAGGAAAATG-3′), and a reverse primer (5′-CCCTTAACGTAGTCCTTGCAG-3′). The resulting PCR products were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A hybridization probe for human leptin was generated by RT-PCR using 1 μg of total RNA prepared from human adipose tissue and the same primers mentioned above. The resulting 526-bp RT-PCR product was ligated directly into a pCR2.1/TA vector, and the presence of the insert was then verified by automated DNA sequencing, using the fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). For probe preparation, the cDNA insert was excised by digestion with EcoRI, gel purified, and then radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For Northern blot analysis, equal amounts of fibroblast total RNA (13 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on 1% agarose and formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+). Hybridization was performed in 5× SSC, 10× Denhardt’s, and 1% SDS, for 16 h at 60 °C. Membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 1% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C and once in 0.2× SSC at 22 °C before exposure to autoradiography. A genomic DNA fragment of the human leptin gene (23Gong D.W., Bi, S. Pratley R.E. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3971-3974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) containing ∼2.9 kb of 5′-flanking region was prepared by PCR amplification of human DNA using the primers 5′-AAGGATGGAGAGGCCCTAGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTGCAACCGTTGGCGCTGCG-3′ (reverse). A 2.9-kb PCR amplicon product was obtained and cloned into a pCR2.1/TA vector. The insert in the resulting construct was then isolated and fully verified by automated DNA sequencing. From this construct, a series of 5′-nested deletion mutants was generated by restriction enzyme digestion withHindII, NsiI, ScaI, StuI,SacII, and XhoI, which cleave respectively at positions –2643, –2041, –1687, –983, –375, and –172, preceding the start site of transcription. Each fragment was subcloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in a pGL3-Basic vector and designated accordingly. For creating the p(–63)/LUC deletion construct, PCR amplification of the 2.9-kb human genomic DNA fragment was conducted in the presence of primers spanning the region between –63 and +28. The forward primer 5′-AATCGctcgagCGGGGCAGTTGCGCAAGTTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACTGaagcttGCAACCGTTGGCGCTGCG-3′ were used, where each primer is designed to contain a 5′-overhang restriction site (lowercase underlined), XhoI for the forward primer andHindIII for the reverse primer, thus allowing for directional insertion of the amplified product into pGL3-Basic vector. PCRs were conducted for 30 cycles in a total volume of 50 μl using a program consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Mutations of the –116/HRE were introduced into the p(–172)/LUC by the unique site elimination method (25Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), using the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-GCAGCCGCCCGGtAtGTCGCTACCCTGAGG-3′, thus replacing C by T within the –116/HRE core motif (lowercase underlined). The sequence of the resulting construct was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into cultured hSDF by lipofection using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fibroblasts were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 0.6 μg of each reporter plasmid. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by cotransfection with 0.1 μg of pSVβGal reporter gene. After 24 h, cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for the times indicated (generally 12–16 h), and total lysates prepared from each well were added to 0.2 ml of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using a chemiluminescence assay kit and read in a model 1450-024 multiwell plate luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For some experiments, 0.6 μg of a HIF1α cDNA expression plasmid was cotransfected with the indicated leptin promoter/reporter plasmids, and cell lysates were prepared and processed for reporter gene expression activity as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (26Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation, and exposed to a hypotonic buffered solution (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation and extracted for 1 h with a high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The resulting extracts were collected after centrifugation of nuclei, snap frozen, and kept at –70 °C until used. The EMSA double-stranded probes were based on the sequence of the human leptin gene promoter contained in p(–172)/LUC, which harbors the proximal HRE at –116 in a reverse orientation toward the 5′-end of the insert. Specifically, the sequence of the EMSA probes used was: 5′-GCCGCCCGGCACGTCGCTACCCTG-3′ for the wild type (LepHRE) and 5′-GCAGCCGCCCGGtAtGTCGCTACCCTGAGG-3′ for the mutant (LepHRE-mut), where the sequence corresponds to the sense strand and mutations are shown in lowercase and italics. For some experiments, a 21-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide probe based on the 3′-enhancer of the Epo gene (27Beck I. Ramirez S. Weinmann R. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15563-15566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a HIF1 binding HRE site, was used and had the sequence 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGCCTCGCAT-3′. The annealed, double-stranded leptin promoter probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (28Chaconas G. van de Sande J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the resulting radiolabeled probes were then purified on NucTrap columns (Stratagene). Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 4 μg of nuclear extract protein, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 250 ng of poly(dI·dC). After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, radiolabeled probe (50,000 cpm, 1 ng) was added, and the incubation continued for 15 min. For gel supershift assays, 1 μg of anti-HIF1α antibody alone or in combination with 1 μg of anti-ARNT (HIF1β) antibody was added to the complete binding reaction mixtures, and the incubation continued for 60 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, a 10–100-fold molar excess of the indicated unlabeled probes was preincubated with nuclear extract and poly(dI·dC) prior to the addition of 32P-labeled probe. The DNA·protein complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 0.5% TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried, and radioactivity was detected by bioimaging using a Cyclone PhosphorImaging System and the Optiquant software package (Packard Instruments Co., Downers Grove, IL). Nuclear extracts were prepared from normoxia or hypoxia-treated cells, and proteins were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10 μg/lane) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.15m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with 1 μg/ml anti-HIF1α or anti-HIF1β antibody. Blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 60 min at room temperature. Immune complexes were detected by ECL followed by exposure to high performance chemiluminescence film (Hyperfilm). A large body of experimental evidence has been collected showing that adipocytes represent the major source of leptin, although additional, non-adipocyte sites of leptin synthesis have also been uncovered more recently, including placenta, skeletal muscle, stomach fundic mucosa, and mammary epithelium (21Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 22Fantuzzi G. Faggioni R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 437-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of independent studies on the role of angiogenesis in wound healing, the discovery was made that skin dermal fibroblast-like cells actively express leptin upon inflicting incisional, full-thickness skin wounds in mice, an observation supported by immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR data. 2M. R. Sierra-Honigmann, A. K. Nath, and A. Murad, manuscript in preparation. Although the possible significance of this observation is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, we surmised that dermal fibroblasts might actively engage in leptin synthesis in response to the hypoxia conditions known to develop in the wound environment, most likely as a result of hypoperfusion ischemia (29Chang N. Goodson III, W.H. Gottrup F. Hunt T.K. Ann. Surg. 1983; 197: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 30Jonsson K. Jensen J.A. Goodson III, W.H. Scheuenstuhl H. West J. Hopf H.W. Hunt T.K. Ann. Surg. 1991; 214: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Therefore, hSDF were used primarily throughout the experiments described herein as a non-adipocyte cellular system with which to study possible regulation of leptin expression by hypoxia. However, for certain experiments, HeLa cells were also utilized as a convenient source of nuclear proteins for verification of gel shift assay results (see below). To determine whether the expression of leptin might be regulated in response to a reduction in O2 tension, freshly prepared hSDF in culture were exposed to an atmosphere of normoxia (21% oxygen) or the indicated levels of hypoxia (5% oxygen or less) for 48 h. The quantity of leptin secreted into the culture medium was then determined by radioimmunoassay using antibodies specific for human leptin (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.1, exposure of dermal fibroblasts to escalating levels of hypoxia (from 5 to 0.5% oxygen) leads to a marked increase in the amount of leptin produced and secreted by these cells into the culture medium. For example, exposure of fibroblasts to hypoxia at 1% O2 gives rise to an increase in the level of immunoreactive leptin in the culture medium by >8-fold, from <0.05 ng/ml (u"

The small-eye phenotype caused by an eye-specific overexpression of aDrosophila TNF superfamily ligand, Eiger, was dramatically suppressed by down-regulation of Wengen using RNA interference. In addition, Wengen and Eiger physically interacted with each other through their TNFR homology domain and TNF homology domain, respectively.

Members of the TNFR superfamily mediate a wide spectrum of physiological and pathological events such as cell activation, proliferation, inflammation, and cell death. The TNFR superfamily proteins are type I or III membrane proteins (1Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) that share significant sequence homology in their extracellular domains (TNFR homology domains) because of the presence of highly conserved cysteine residues in each cysteine-rich domain. The different cellular signals from extrinsic TNF superfamily proteins are transmitted through members of the TNFR superfamily and their adapter proteins, thereby initiating the individual pathway (2Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A number of the TNF/TNFR superfamily members have been identified, and physiological and genetic studies have been carried out in vertebrates (3Locksley R.M. Kileen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). In contrast, until the discovery of Eiger, no TNF or TNFR family protein had been reported in invertebrates. Drosophila is a powerful genetic model for studying thein vivo role of genes and their physiological regulations. Recently we identified Eiger, the first invertebrate TNF superfamily ligand, in a Drosophila misexpression screen (4Igaki T. Kanda H. Goto Y. Kanuka H. Kuranaga E. Aigaki T. Miura M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Eiger in the Drosophila compound eye induces cell death through the activation of the DrosophilaJNK. The Eiger-induced small-eye phenotype was executed through caspase-independent pathways. It remained to be elucidated how Eiger transmits its signals to the intracellular molecules. To address this question, we have conducted a dominant modifier screen to identify downstream molecules of Eiger using eye-specific Eiger overexpressing flies (GMR>eigerregg1 ) and a collection of deficiency-bearing flies. Here, we describe Wengen, the first member of the Drosophila TNFR superfamily, which we identified in this screen. TheDrosophila EST clone SD13923 was sequenced, and the full-length wengen coding region was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pUAST vector (GenBank accession number for the full-length wengen cDNA, AB085747). cDNAs for a C-terminally Flag-tagged Wengen (Wengen-Flag), a Wengen without the cytoplasmic domain (WengenΔcyt-Flag), a Wengen without the TNFR homology domain (WengenΔTNFR-Flag), a C-terminally HA-tagged Wengen (Wengen-HA), an N-terminally HA-tagged Wengen (HA-Wengen), an N-terminally HA-tagged Eiger (HA-Eiger), and an Eiger with the TNF homology domain deleted (HA-EigerΔTNF) were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pUAST vector. The expression constructs for the HA-tagged caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of DRONC were used. A head-to-head inverted repeat construct forwengen, pUAS-wengen-IR, was generated by inserting the partial fragment of wengen cDNA (nucleotides 39–1032) into the EcoRI site of pUAS-wengen. Fly culture and crosses were carried out at 25 °C. Canton-S orwhite1118 was used as the wild-type strain.UAS-wengen-IR transgenic flies were generated by general P element-mediated transformation.GMR>eigerregg1 flies were generated as described previously (4Igaki T. Kanda H. Goto Y. Kanuka H. Kuranaga E. Aigaki T. Miura M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and a series of deficiency-bearing flies was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. Drosophila eye-specific Eiger misexpressing (GMR>eigerregg1 ) flies were crossed with a collection of deficiency lines. Our strategy was based on the reasoning that if a deficiency spanned a gene which encoded a molecule that functioned downstream of Eiger, the Eiger-induced small-eye phenotype would be suppressed in the F1 progeny. Drosophila S2 cells (5Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured at 26 °C and transfected using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) as described previously (6Hisahara S. Kanuka H. Shoji S. Yoshikawa S. Okano H. Miura M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 667-673PubMed Google Scholar). For immunostaining, an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:200; 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:100; Chemicon) were used. For the detection of HA-Wengen and HA-CARD, S2 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors together with pWAGAL4. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were lysed in 1.5× SDS sample buffer containing 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm dithiothreitol, 3% SDS, 0.15% bromphenol blue, 9% glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol. For the immunoprecipitation assay, S2 cells were transiently transfected with each expression vector together with pWAGAL4. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Total RNA was isolated from embryonic, larval, pupal, and adult stages of Drosophila and amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as described previously (4Igaki T. Kanda H. Goto Y. Kanuka H. Kuranaga E. Aigaki T. Miura M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). wengen cDNA was amplified by using the following primers: 5′-ATG CGT AGT CGG AGC AGC AGC AGT G-3′ and 5′-GTG GTG GAT GAG GAT GCA GGC GGC C-3′. The primer sequences used for detection of glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA have been described (7Kanuka H. Sawamoto K. Inohara N. Matsuno K. Okano H. Miura M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 757-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To detect the expression of wengen or GAPDH, 32 or 26 cycles of PCR were performed, respectively, and then their expression was analyzed on an agarose gel. For the detection of HA-Wengen and HA-CARD, an anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:500; MBL) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, anti-rabbit IgG; Transduction Laboratories) were used. For the immunoprecipitation assay, cell lysates were incubated with an anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or a protein G-Sepharose-conjugated anti-HA 3F10 mAb (Roche) at 4 °C overnight. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot analysis with appropriate antibodies. In a Drosophila dominant-modifier screen using the chromosomal deficiency lines that covered more than 70% of the genome, we obtained several lines that suppressed the small-eye phenotype caused by Eiger overexpression (GMR>eigerregg1 ) (4Igaki T. Kanda H. Goto Y. Kanuka H. Kuranaga E. Aigaki T. Miura M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). Through the analysis of these deficiency lines, we identified a line,Df(1)E128/FM7c (8Engels W.R. Preston C.R. Genetics. 1984; 107: 657-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which the deficiency spans the coding region of a predicted gene, CG6531 (Fig. 1 D).CG6531 was speculated to encode a protein with a cysteine-rich domain (TNFR homology domain), the hallmark of the TNFR superfamily (3Locksley R.M. Kileen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). We named this gene wengen for a village at the foot of Mt. Eiger. Analysis of the wengen nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 343 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig.1 E and data not shown). Alignment analysis revealed that Wengen harbored a TNFR homology domain in the extracellular region and a membrane-spanning region without signal sequence (Fig. 1,E and F). This is a characteristic of the type III membrane protein of TNFR superfamily (extracellular N terminus, intracellular C terminus, lacking a signal peptide) (1Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The TNFR homology domain of Wengen had significant structural and amino acid homology with the TNFR domains of human EDAR (hXEDAR) and human TNFR1 (hTNFR1) (Fig. 1 G). The TNFR homology domains of Wengen, hXEDAR, and hTNFR1 share the topologically distinctive modules (termed A1 and B2 module, except for the TNFR homology domain of hTNFR1 (amino acids 168–195), which is composed of the A1 and C2 modules) (9Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Wengen was indeed a type III membrane protein like the other TNFR superfamily members, we examined its subcellular localization (Fig. 1, H–K). S2 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for C-terminally HA-tagged Wengen (Wengen-HA) and GFP. In GFP-positive cells, which were assumed to be overexpressing Wengen-HA, Wengen-HA was detected on the surface membrane with anti-HA antibody when the S2 cells were permeabilized (Fig. 1, H and I); the signal was not detected in GFP-positive cells without permeabilization (Fig. 1, J andK). These data suggest that the Wengen C-terminal domain is indeed cytoplasmic. These results suggest that Wengen is a member of the type III TNFR superfamily. We then examined the expression ofwengen in flies. RT-PCR analysis revealed thatwengen mRNA was expressed at all stages of development (Fig. 1 L). Its putative ligand, Eiger, is also expressed at all stages of Drosophila development (4Igaki T. Kanda H. Goto Y. Kanuka H. Kuranaga E. Aigaki T. Miura M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). To assess whether Wengen is required for Eiger to induce the small-eye phenotype, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to down-regulate the endogenous expression of Wengen. A head-to-head inverted repeat construct for wengen, pUAS-wengen-IR, was generated, and we examined its ability to knock down thewengen expression (Fig.2 A). Co-transfection of pUAS-HA-wengen together with pUAS-wengen-IR into S2 cells dramatically reduced Wengen expression but had no effect on the expression of HA-CARD (Fig. 2 B), suggesting thatwengen-IR works as a specific inhibitor of Wengen expression. To assess the biological functions of Wengen inDrosophila, we generated transgenic flies that misexpresswengen-IR in the developing retina. The small-eye phenotype induced by the eye-specific ectopic expression of Eiger (GMR>eigerregg1 ; Fig. 2 C) was suppressed by the coexpression of wengen-IR (Fig.2 D). These results strongly suggest that Wengen is required as a functional transducer of Eiger signaling. Next, we assessed the physical interactions between Wengen and Eiger using various deletion mutants (Fig.3 A). Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that full-length Wengen and Eiger physically interacted with each other (Fig. 3 B, first lane, and C, first lane). Eiger interacted with WengenΔcyt but not with WengenΔTNFR (Fig. 3 B,second and third lanes). In addition, full-length Wengen could not interact with Eiger ΔTNF (Fig.3 C, second lane). These results suggest that Wengen can interact with Eiger, and this interaction is mediated through the TNFR homology domain of Wengen and the TNF homology domain of Eiger. In this study, we identified the firstDrosophila member of the TNFR superfamily, Wengen. Most of the genes for the TNFR superfamily encode type I or III membrane proteins with one or more extracellular ligand-binding domains and a cytoplasmic region that activates cell functions. In general, the extracellular domain of this family of proteins shows a relatively low level of sequence conservation, despite sharing a common fundamental structure. The cytoplasmic regions of the receptors show considerably more diversity in sequence and size than the extracellular regions. There are no common intracellular motifs found in all members of the TNFR superfamily except for some domains such as the TRAF2-binding domain ((P/S/A/T)X(Q/E)E or PXQXXD) (10Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Keiff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which is required for both NF-κB activation and JNK activation, or a domain of ∼80 amino acids called the “death domain” (3Locksley R.M. Kileen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar) for caspase activation. However, the amino acid sequence of Wengen reveals that it has neither a TRAF2-binding domain nor a death domain in the cytoplasmic region, suggesting that there should be another mechanism to transduce signals. Whereas Eiger can stimulate the JNK pathway (4Igaki T. Kanda H. Goto Y. Kanuka H. Kuranaga E. Aigaki T. Miura M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we failed to detect the stimulation of the JNK pathway in response to the overexpression of Wengen in S2 cells or the Drosophila compound eye (data not shown). It is possible that because the amount of ligand is limited, overexpression of Wengen was not sufficient to activate the downstream signals. It is also possible that intracellular adapter proteins, which are required for transducing signals, are not expressed or limited in Wengen-expressing cells. Otherwise, Wengen may require one or more co-receptors that transduce signals to the cytoplasm. For instance, heteromeric receptor complex is used to transduce Hedgehog signaling (11Kalderon D. Cell. 2000; 103: 371-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Hedgehog binds to its receptor Patched, and then the inhibitory function of Patched against its binding partner, Smoothened, is cancelled. In this way, Hedgehog signaling is transduced into the cells. Because the heteromeric complex of receptors has never been reported to transduce TNF family signaling, it is possible that Eiger/Wengen may use the novel type of TNF signaling mechanisms. In any case, further genetic and biochemical studies of Eiger/Wengen should help to elucidate the unique signaling mechanisms that include the caspase-independent pathway triggered by Eiger.

However, the ability of MDA-7 to suppress lung cancer in vivo has not been previously demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the possibility of inducing overexpression of the mda-7 gene in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells in vivo and its effects on tumor growth. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MDA-7 in p53-wild-type A549 and p53-null H1299 subcutaneous tumors resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition through induction of apoptosis. In addition, decreased CD31/PECAM expression and upregulation of APO2/TRAIL were observed in tumors expressing MDA-7. In vivo studies correlated well with in vitro inhibition of lung tumor cell proliferation and endothelial cell differentiation mediated by Ad-mda7. These data demonstrate that Ad-mda7 functions as a multi-modality anti-cancer agent, possessing both, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties. We demonstrate for the first time the potential therapeutic effects of Ad-mda7 in human lung cancer."

In yeast, at least two signal transduction pathways are activated to regulate processes necessary for ion homeostasis and osmotic adjustment. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG)1 pathway is primarily responsible for the control of osmotic adaptation while the calcineurin pathway regulates ion homeostasis. The HOG pathway, which includes as a key intermediate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Hog1p, is initiated as a consequence of hypertonic stress perception by either of two osmosensing proteins Sln1p or Sho1p (1Gustin M.C.

Signaling through calcineurin regulates the expression of ENA1/PMR2A, which encodes the P-type ATPase that is primarily responsible for Na+ efflux across the plasma membrane, and of PMC1 and PMR1, which encode endomembrane-localized Ca2+-ATPase pumps. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the zinc finger transcription factor Crz1p/Tcn1p/Hal8p, a process that facilitates its mobilization to the nucleus (9Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J.

Recently, it was determined that hypertonic shock triggers a transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt that was attributed to the function of a transient receptor potential-like channel (Yvc1p), which mediates the release of Ca2+ from the vacuole (20Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).

Herein, direct evidence is presented that Ca ext2+ influx facilitates salt adaptation of yeast. Hyperosmotic shock induces a short duration transient increase in [Ca2+]cytthrough Cch1p-Mid1p that mediates ionic but not hyperosmotic stress tolerance.

Homologous recombination of the PCR product introduced a kanMX4 disruption in the CCH1(YGR217W) open reading frame beginning at +719 bp from the translation start site to −941 bp from the translation stop site.

Thecch1Δ mid1Δ double mutation was generated by using the PCR-based gene-targeting system and HIS3MX6 (31Wach A. Brachat A. Rebischung C. Steiner S. Pokorni K. te Heesen S. Philippsen P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 26: 67-81Google Scholar) in place of the kanMX4 for the mid1Δ mutation and was introduced into cch1::kanMX4mutant. Yeast cells were grown using standard procedures (32Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar) in YPD medium (1% Difco yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or in S.D. medium (0.17% Difco YNB-AA-AS, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose) that was supplemented with amino acids or osmotic solutes as indicated. The pH of all media was adjusted to 6.5. For spot assays, cultures were diluted to an OD600 of ∼0.4 and then further diluted 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold (Shimadzu UV-1601). EGTA or CaCl2 in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) solutions were added to media after autoclave sterilization. Aequorin luminescence was determined with a luminometer (TD-20/20 Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) following procedures used to quantify [Ca2+]cyt in yeast and tobacco cells (19Batiza A.F. Schulz T.

Masson, 19) containing theAPOAEQUORIN gene. Leucine autotrophic cells at stationary phase were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in YPD medium to an OD600 of ∼0.1–0.2. Cells were grown to an OD600 of ∼0.4–0.6. The cells were concentrated about 5-fold by centrifugation and 1 μl of 590 μmcoelenterazine (Biotum Inc., Fremont, CA) in absolute methanol was added to 100 μl of culture. After incubation for 30 min on a rotating drum in the dark, a cellular luminescence baseline was determined by 1 min of recordings at 5/s intervals. Hypertonic shock was administered to yeast cells by diluting the suspension 1:1 with YPD medium containing NaCl, LiCl, or sorbitol at 2× final concentration. All inhibitory or chelating compounds were diluted in 50 mm MES (pH 6.5) and added to the cultures as indicated. EGTA and BAPTA solutions (0.5 m) were made in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5). NiCl2, MgCl2, or GdCl3 was dissolved in water to a concentration of 0.3 m and diluted with MES buffer (50 mm final concentration, pH 6.5) to 10- to 20-fold the concentration in the treatment solution. These chemical agents or an equal volume of 50 mm MES were added to cells immediately before the acquisition of the basal luminescence reading and in the osmotic pretreatment media. Luminescence from aequorin that remained in cells at the end of an experiment was determined after treating cells with Triton X-100 (5–10%) and CaCl2 (2–5 m). These data were used to calculate the [Ca2+]cyt using Equation 1, [Ca2+]=((L/Lmax)1/3+[118(L/Lmax)1/3]-1)/(7×106-[7×106(L/Lmax)1/3])Equation 1 where L is the luminescence intensity at any time point and Lmax is the integrated luminescence intensity (34Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1977; 195: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Procedures for determining Ca2+ uptake into cells were as described, with modifications (17Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 28Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cells in the exponential growth phase (YPD medium) were inoculated into fresh medium (OD600 ∼0.1) that contained 1 μCi/ml of45Ca2+ (45CaCl2, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Cells were grown for 5 h and harvested for determination of intracellular radioactivity. Cells in the log-growth phase (OD600 of ∼0.4–0.6) were subjected to osmotic pretreatment (30 min) by diluting the suspension 1:1 with YPD medium containing NaCl or sorbitol at 2× final concentration. Cells were collected by centrifugation (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) at 3000 rpm for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in growth medium to an OD600of ∼0.2–0.3, and growth was monitored (OD600). Wild type andcch1Δ cells were transformed with pKC201 containing anENA1-lacZ fusion (provided by Dr. K. Cunningham, Ref. 9Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Cells from three independent transformation events were grown to late log phase in S.D. medium. Cells were collected, resuspended in YPD medium to an OD600 of ∼0.1, and grown to log phase (OD600 of ∼0.4–0.6). These cells were exposed to hypertonic shock by diluting the culture 1:1 with medium containing NaCl, or 1:1 with CaCl2 at 2× final concentration. A stock solution of 2 mg/ml FK506 (provided by Fujisawa Healthcare Inc., Deerfield, IL) that was dissolved in 90% ethanol and 10% Tween-20 was added to medium as indicated. Cells were collected after 4 h, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and processed for determination of β-galactosidase activity (35Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1993: 13.6.1-13.6.4Google Scholar). The same period of 4 h was used previously to determine calcineurin-dependent induction ofFKS2, PMC1, and ENA1 expression, after stimulation by NaCl, Ca2+, or mating pheromone (9Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). NaCl shock initiates an immediate and transient elevation in [Ca2+]cytof about 1 min in duration (Fig.1A). Because similar Ca2+ transient profiles were obtained after treatment of cells with equiosmolar concentrations of NaCl, sorbitol, LiCl (Fig. 1,A–C), or Na2SO4 or KCl (not shown), the increase in [Ca2+]cyt is caused, in a concentration-dependent manner, by hypertonic shock and not ionic stress. A new and higher [Ca2+]cyt steady state is established after the initial transient (Fig. 1B). This higher [Ca2+]cyt steady state may be due to continued influx from the extracellular pool, release from an internal cellular store, or limited vacuolar sequestration (36Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P., Fu, L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The hyperosmotic stress-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt was attenuated by the inclusion of 2.5 or 5 mm NiCl2, or by 5 mm MgCl2 in the medium (Fig. 1D). Ni2+ effectively inhibits L-type Ca2+ channel activity of guinea pig ventricular myocytes (37Hobai I.A. Hancox J.C. Levi A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H692-H701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Mg2+competes with Ca2+ for channel conductance in tobacco cells (33Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Reduction in the amplitude of the transient rise in [Ca2+]cyt by Ni2+ and Mg2+ implicates the extracellular pool as the cation source. The transient elevation in [Ca2+]cyt that is triggered by 1m NaCl was inhibited also by inclusion in the medium of the membrane impermeable, divalent cation chelating agent EGTA (Fig.1E). Similar attenuation of the transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt occurred if BAPTA, a chelating agent with 105-fold higher affinity for Ca2+ than for Mg2+, was substituted for EGTA in the medium (Fig. 1E). These results also confirm that the hyperosmotically induced transient rise in [Ca2+]cyt is dependent on influx across the plasma membrane of cells that are inoculated into YPD medium, which contains about ∼75 μm Ca2+(38Difco Manual (1998) Difco Laboratories. Sparks, MDGoogle Scholar). Gd3+ (GdCl3) reduced the amplitude of the hypertonic shock-induced [Ca2+]cyttransient in cells, albeit incompletely (Fig. 1F). Because incubation of cells with GdCl3 was initiated 1 min prior to addition of NaCl, it is unlikely that Gd3+ permeated into the cell and inhibited endomembrane localized Ca2+-permeable channel activity to cause the attenuation of the transient elevation in [Ca2+]cyt. Gd3+ is an inhibitor of stretch-activated Ca2+ channels of yeast, plant, and animal cells (39Ding J.P. Pickard B.G. Plant J. 1993; 3: 83-110Crossref Google Scholar, 40Gustin M.C. Zhou X.L. Martinac B. Kung C. Science. 1998; 242: 762-765Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and effectively reduces Ca cyt2+ transients in yeast and tobacco cells (19Batiza A.F. Schulz T. Masson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23357-23362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results implicate the involvement of a Gd3+-sensitive, plasma membrane Ca+ channel protein, perhaps Mid1p, in the Ca ext2+influx that results in increased [Ca2+]cyt (29Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1999; 285: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). cch1Δ, mid1Δ, or cch1Δmid1Δ disruption/deletion mutations were generated in W303-1A cells. These cells were then transformed to express apoaequorin from pEVP11/AEQ (ADH::AEQ). Net 45Ca2+ accumulation in W303-1Acch1Δ cells was reduced to about 60% of the level that accumulated in wild type cells (not shown). cch1Δ caused a similar reduction in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation in another yeast strain (28Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transient incch1Δ or mid1Δ cells was substantially, and to a similar degree, lower than in wild type cells (Fig. 1,G and H). The cch1Δmid1Δ double mutation did not cause an additive effect. The NaCl-induced transient elevation in [Ca2+]cyt in cch1Δ,mid1Δ, and cch1Δ mid1Δ cells is comparable to that in wild type cells after treatment with 5 mm GdCl3. It can be concluded that the hyperosmotically induced [Ca2+]cyttransient is mediated predominantly by influx through Cch1p and Mid1p that are genetically functioning as a single Ca2+ uptake system. However, there may be contribution to the [Ca2+]cyt transient through an alternative uptake system or from internal stores (20Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) because the elevation in [Ca2+]cyt is not completely abrogated by pharmacological agents or by null mutations in the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel. cch1Δ and mid1Δ cells are Li+ sensitive (28Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cch1Δ andmid1Δ cells are Na+ but not hyperosmotic sensitive (mid1Δ data not shown), and Na+ and Li+ sensitivities of these cells are exacerbated by EGTA or attenuated by Ca2+ supplementation to the media (Fig.2). Because cells exhibit Ca2+-dependent growth enhancement on media supplemented with Na+ or Li+ but not with sorbitol, it is concluded that the divalent cation facilitates ionic adaptation (Fig. 2). Neither Na+ nor Li+sensitivity, nor the modulation of sensitivity to these ions by EGTA or Ca ext2+, is additive incch1Δ mid1Δ cells compared withcch1Δ or to mid1Δ cells (not shown). These results indicate that the hyperosmotic shock-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt that is mediated in part by Cch1p and Mid1p is necessary for ionic stress adaptation and that the proteins function together as an individual influx system. Cell growth in ionic or osmotic stress media was enhanced by a 30-min hyperosmotic pretreatment (Fig.3). Interestingly, pretreatment with 20 mm Ca2+ enhanced cell growth only in medium that was supplemented with NaCl (Fig. 3, B–D). Cells exposed to high [Ca2+]extexhibit an immediate and transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt (not shown; Refs. 20Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar and36Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P., Fu, L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hypertonic shock-induced NaCl adaptation was enhanced by Ca ext2+ or attenuated by EGTA (Fig.3C). EGTA did not affect salt adaptation when the chelating agent was added to hyperosmotic pretreatment medium 25 min (30 min total) after cell inoculation, indicating that sufficient Ca2+ influx had occurred by this time to mediate ionic stress adaptation (not shown). Osmotic pretreatment was substantially less effective at enhancing growth of cch1Δ cells compared with wild type cells in NaCl-containing medium (Fig. 3C). The reduced salt-adaptive capacity of cch1Δ cells was similar to that determined when wild type cells were exposed to EGTA. In contrast, growth of cch1Δ cells was equivalent to wild type after osmotic pretreatment and inoculation into medium with 2m sorbitol (Fig. 3D). Together, these findings link the hyperosmotically generated [Ca2+]cyt transient to ionic stress adaptation and implicate Cch1p and Mid1p as the major Ca ext2+ influx determinants. Monitoring of ENA1 expression using theENA1-lacZ promoter-reporter fusion system (9Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) confirmed that β-galactosidase activity is constitutively lower incch1Δ compared with wild type cells (Fig.4 and Ref. 28Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ENA1expression is induced by inclusion of NaCl or CaCl2 into the medium and the induction is greater in wild type than incch1Δ cells (Fig. 4). EGTA abrogates the difference in NaCl-induced ENA1 expression between wild type andcch1Δ cells, which indicates that Ca ext2+ influx through Cch1p is required for transcriptional activation of this gene (Fig. 4). The calcineurin-specific inhibitor FK506 (9Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 10Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) reducedENA1-lacZ expression to near basal levels in cells that were in medium with CaCl2 but not with NaCl. The difference may reflect the contribution of the HOG pathway to ENA1induction that is elicited by NaCl treatment. Almost total abrogation of NaCl-induced ENA1-lacZ expression by a combination of EGTA and FK506 is evidenc"

In addition to its antiprotease activity, SLPI has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties including down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α expression by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in monocytes, inhibition of NF-κB activation by IgG immune complexes in a rat model of acute lung injury, and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infectivity in monocytic cells via as yet unidentified mechanisms. In this report we have shown that SLPI prevents LPS-induced NF-κB activation by inhibiting degradation of IκBα without affecting the LPS-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκBα. We have also demonstrated that SLPI prevents LPS-induced interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase and IκBβ degradation. In addition, we have demonstrated that oxidized SLPI, a variant of SLPI that has diminished antiprotease activity, cannot prevent LPS-induced NF-κB activation or Inhibitor κB α/β degradation indicating that the anti-inflammatory effect of SLPI on the LPS-signaling pathway is dependent on its antiprotease activity. These results suggest that SLPI may be inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NF-κB regulatory proteins, an effect that is dependent on the antiprotease activity of SLPI.

SLPI forms inhibitory complexes with a variety of proteolytic enzymes including neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G and therefore appears to be an important component of the antiprotease defense of the lung (6Gauthier F. Frysmark U. Ohlsson K. Bieth J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 700: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of SLPI and the resulting NMR solution structure have revealed a protein composed of two highly homologous domains of 53 and 54 amino acids, 8 disulfide bridges in total, and a large number of positively charged residues (7Seemuller U. Arnhold M. Fritz H. Wiedenmann K. Machleidt W. Heinzel R. Applehans H. Gassen H.G. Lottspeich F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 199: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The small size of SLPI and the large number of disulfide bridges were thought to confer resistance of SLPI to proteolysis. However, we have demonstrated recently (8Taggart C.C. Lowe G.J. Greene C.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33345-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that SLPI is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by members of the elastolytic cathepsin family and that cathepsin L present in the emphysematous lung results in SLPI cleavage and inactivation of its antiprotease activity. Recently, it has been demonstrated that SLPI also possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial activity. LPS-hyporesponsive cells have been shown to transcribe SLPI, and transfection of macrophages with SLPI was shown to suppress LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and production of nitric oxide and TNFα by an unknown mechanism (9Jin F.-Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D. Ding A. Cell. 1997; 88: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, IFNγ suppressed expression of SLPI and restored LPS responsiveness to SLPI-producing cells (9Jin F.-Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D. Ding A. Cell. 1997; 88: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). SLPI has also been shown to inhibit HIV infectivity of monocytes by blocking viral DNA synthesis by a mechanism that does not involve binding to HIV directly but is most likely due to interaction with the host cell (10McNeely T.B. Shugars D.C. Rosendahl M. Tucker C. Eisenberg S.P. Wahl S.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11McNeely T.B. Dealy M. Dripps D.J. Orenstein J.M. Eisenberg S.P. Wahl S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In a model of acute lung injury, induced by intrapulmonary deposition of IgG immune complexes in rats, prior administration of SLPI attenuated pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils and decreased lung injury (12Lentsch A.B.

In addition, prior administration of SLPI to these animals resulted in greatly reduced NF-κB activation in whole lung samples, although interestingly down-regulation of NF-κB activation was not observed in alveolar macrophages isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage from these animals (12Lentsch A.B.

Further investigation of the NF-κB regulatory proteins revealed that IκBβ degradation was prevented in animals pretreated with SLPI. These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of SLPI are selective for the signal transduction pathway leading to NF-κB activation. With these results as background, we have further investigated the effects of SLPI inhibition on LPS-induced NF-κB activation in U937 cells. In this report we show that SLPI inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB activation in U937 cells by preventing degradation of IκBα but without affecting the phosphorylation or ubiquitination of IκBα. In the presence of SLPI, phosphorylated and ubiquitinated IκBα appears to accumulate. We have also demonstrated the prevention of degradation of IRAK and IκBβ by LPS in U937 cells. Finally, we have shown that SLPI does not affect 20 S proteasome peptidase-related activity. Given that IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ are phosphorylated and degraded by the proteasome following activation with LPS, these results would suggest that SLPI is inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway either directly or indirectly. RPMI 1640 medium was obtained from Invitrogen, and U937 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Recombinant human SLPI was obtained from R & D Systems (Abingdon, Oxon, UK). Antibodies to IRAK and IκBβ were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Antibodies to IκBα (native and phosphorylated forms) were from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, Herts, UK). Anti-ubiquitin antibody was purchased from Affiniti Research Products Ltd. (Mamhead, Exeter, UK). Western blotting reagents were obtained from Tropix (Bedford, MA). Z-ARR-AMC, Z-LLE-AMC, Suc-LLVY-AMC, and the proteasome inhibitors, ALLN and MG-132, were from CN Biosciences (Beeston, Nottingham, UK). All other general reagents were from Sigma. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with 10,000 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) end-labeled oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (4% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin) and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma). In some experiments, unlabeled wild-type or mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to extracts before incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide. Reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on native 5% polyacrylamide gels that were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Human myelomonocytic U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. One hundred micrograms of recombinant SLPI were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 500 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm potassium chloride, 1 mmmagnesium chloride, pH 5.0, and 20 mm hydrogen peroxide (6%; Ovelle, Dundalk, Ireland). At this pH methionine is oxidized selectively to methionine sulfoxide (13Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). At the end of the reaction, the hydrogen peroxide was removed by desalting the mixture, twice, through a Microcon-3 column (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Protein concentration of the sample was measured by Bradford assay before and after desalting to ensure no loss of SLPI during the desalting process. The antiprotease activity of the sample was determined by titrating increasing amounts of oxidized SLPI against a fixed standard of neutrophil elastase of known activity. Residual neutrophil elastase activity was measured using the substrateN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide (14McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hebert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). After treating cells with the indicated reagents for the indicated times in 24-well plates (1 × 106 cells/ml), the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then lysed for 10 min on ice in 20 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% Igepal CA-630. Lysates were centrifuged as before, and the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was retained for Western analysis (see below). The remaining nuclear pellet was lysed in 15 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 13,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, nuclear extracts were removed into 50 μl of storage buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT). Protein concentrations were determined (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar), and the extracts were stored at −80 °C. After treating cells with the indicated reagents for the indicated times cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as shown above. Protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from each sample (10 μg for each of IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ) were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and blotted. Transferred proteins were blocked in I-Block (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in PBST. Proteins were detected using primary antibodies directed against IRAK (1:500), IκBα (1:1000), phosphorylated IκBα (1:2000), and IκBβ (1:1000) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:7500). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Phosphorylated IκBα levels were quantified by densitometry using GeneGenius Gel Documentation and Analysis System (Syngene, Cambridge, UK) and Syngene GeneSnap and GeneTools software. Cytoplasmic extracts (200 μg of protein), made up to 100 μl with buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphorylated-IκBα IgG (1:100). The samples were then treated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C after which the samples were centrifuged and washed 5 times in buffer. The beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample treatment buffer and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was blotted and incubated with a monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin (1:1000 for 1 h) followed by incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody (1:7500). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The various peptidase activities associated with the 20 S proteasome were measured using the fluorogenic substrates Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (for chymotrypsin-like activity), Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC (for peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activity), and Z-Ala-Arg-Arg-AMC (for trypsin-like activity). Treated cells were lysed in 250 μl of 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.5, with 2 mm DTT (16Mullally J.E. Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30366-30373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were incubated with each substrate (50 μm, final concentration) in lysis buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, and fluorescence (substrate turnover) was determined by excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. In some experiments, a further aliquot of SLPI (10 μg/ml) was added to the cell extract of cells already incubated with SLPI/LPS, and 20 S peptidase activity was measured as above. U937 cells were incubated with LPS (0.1 μg/ml) for 2 h following time course and dose-response experiments (data not shown). Some samples were preincubated with SLPI at various concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10 μg/ml) for 1 h followed by incubation with LPS (0.1 μg/ml). LPS was found to induce significantly more NF-κB nuclear localization in U937 cells (Fig. 1a,lane 2) compared with cells incubated in medium alone (Fig.1a,lane 1). SLPI inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a,lanes 3–5). These experiments were repeated three times with similar results. U937 cells were also preincubated with oxidized SLPI (10 μg/ml) followed by incubation with LPS (0.1 μg/ml) for 2 h. Oxidized SLPI (10 μg/ml) did not prevent LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig.1b,lanes 6 and 7 versus lanes 2 and 3, LPS alone) compared with cells preincubated with native SLPI (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 1b,lanes 4 and 5). U937s were incubated in medium alone or with LPS (1.0 μg/ml) alone or following preincubation with SLPI (10 μg/ml, 1 h) or oxidized SLPI (10 μg/ml, 1 h) for 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts showed LPS-induced degradation of IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ by 120 min (Fig.2, a–c, top rows), whereas preincubation of U937s with native SLPI resulted in inhibition of the degradation of IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ at 120 min (Fig. 2,a–c,middle rows). Preincubation of U937s with oxidized SLPI followed by activation with LPS gave a similar pattern of IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ degradation by 120 min when compared with LPS alone (Fig. 2, a–c, bottom rows versus Fig. 2, a–c,top rows). These results demonstrate that SLPI prevents LPS-induced degradation of IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ, but oxidized SLPI has lost the ability to prevent LPS-induced degradation. To assess the effect of SLPI on LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB regulatory proteins, phosphorylation of IκBα was assessed. U937s were initially incubated with the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (100 μg/ml) for 30 min to stabilize the labile phosphorylated IκBα. Cells were incubated in medium alone, preincubated with SLPI or oxidized SLPI (10 μg/ml) alone, or stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 30 min. Phosphorylation of IκBα was observed in all samples treated with LPS (Fig.3a,lanes 3–5) but not in the control sample (Fig. 3a,lane 1, the only sample not preincubated with ALLN). Some phosphorylated IκBα was detected in the control sample treated with ALLN (Fig. 3a,lane 2) and the samples incubated with SLPI or oxidized SLPI alone (Fig. 3a,lanes 6 and 7). Densitometric analysis of three experiments revealed that incubation of cells with SLPI/LPS (+ALLN) resulted in a 9.56 ± 0.04-fold increase in the levels of phosphorylated IκBα compared with control (+ALLN) (Fig. 3b). This is compared with an increase of 3.68 ± 0.31- and 3.74 ± 0.54-fold for LPS (+ALLN) and oxidized SLPI/LPS (+ALLN), respectively, compared with control (+ ALLN) (Fig. 3b). Cells treated with SLPI and oxidized SLPI alone (+ALLN) did not result in an increase in phosphorylated IκBα above control (+ALLN) (Fig. 3b). Therefore, incubation of cells with SLPI, in the presence of LPS, resulted in increased amounts of phosphorylated IκBα compared with cells treated with LPS or oxidized SLPI/LPS. To investigate whether accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα in the presence of SLPI also results in accumulation of ubiquitinated, phosphorylated IκBα, cells were treated with ALLN followed by preincubation with SLPI/oxidized SLPI and subsequent incubation with LPS. Equal amounts of cell extract were electrophoresed, blotted, and incubated with anti-phosphorylated IκBα. The blot was overdeveloped to ensure visualization of ubiquitinated IκBα. High molecular weight bands (∼200 kDa) were observed in the samples treated with SLPI (Fig.3c,lanes 4 and 5) that were not present in the other lanes. To confirm that the high molecular weight bands in the SLPI-treated samples were ubiquitinated forms of phosphorylated IκBα, we immunoprecipitated phosphorylated IκBα from samples treated with SLPI, oxidized SLPI, or LPS in the presence of ALLN. The resulting blot was incubated with anti-ubiquitin and revealed the presence of a high molecular weight band in the SLPI-treated lane (Fig. 3d,lane 3) of the same size as that present in phosphorylated IκBα blot (Fig.3c,lanes 4 and 5). The same high molecular weight band was also present in the LPS and oxidized SLPI/LPS-treated lanes (Fig. 3d,lane 2 and4) although to a much lesser degree. This confirmed that the high molecular weight band is a polyubiquitinated form of phosphorylated IκBα. To investigate further the possible effect of SLPI on various peptidase activities associated with the 20 S proteasome, cells were lysed and peptidase activity measured. Chymotrypsin-like activity (Suc-LLVY-AMC), peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activity (Z-LLE-AMC), and trypsin-like activity (Z-ARR-AMC) were not significantly decreased in those samples treated with SLPI compared with control and LPS-treated samples (Fig. 4). Samples treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, exhibited significantly decreased activity for all three 20 S peptidases examined (Fig. 4). To confirm that any potential inhibitory effect of SLPI on 20 S peptidase activity was not lost during cell extract preparation, cells that had been treated with SLPI/LPS, followed by cell extract preparation, were further incubated with SLPI (10 μg/ml) and 20 S activities measured. As can be seen from Fig. 4 (SLPI + SLPI/LPS), re-incubation with SLPI did not decrease any of the proteasomal peptidase activities measured confirming that SLPI did not inhibit 20 S activity of the proteasome. SLPI inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB activation in the U937 monocytic cell line by preventing degradation of the regulatory proteins, IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ. The antiprotease activity of SLPI appears to be required for this mechanism of inhibition because oxidized SLPI (which does not possess antiprotease activity) cannot prevent LPS-induced NF-κB activation nor prevent IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ degradation. In addition, SLPI does not inhibit LPS-induced phosphorylation or ubiquitination of IκBα but does, in fact, lead to an accumulation of phosphorylated, ubiquitinated IκBα. Finally, SLPI does not inhibit any of the 20 S-associated peptidase activities of the proteasome. Therefore, it would appear that SLPI is exerting its affect by inhibiting, directly or indirectly, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by a mechanism dependent on its antiprotease activity. SLPI has been shown previously to act as an anti-inflammatory mediator by inhibiting HIV infection of monocytic cells (10McNeely T.B. Shugars D.C. Rosendahl M. Tucker C. Eisenberg S.P. Wahl S.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and LPS-induced TNFα and MMP-9 expression by monocytes (9Jin F.-Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D. Ding A. Cell. 1997; 88: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Y. DeWitt D.L. McNeely T.B. Wahl S.M. Wahl L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, SLPI has been demonstrated to prevent NF-κB activation in the lungs of rats challenged with IgG immune complexes (12Lentsch A.B. Jordan J.A. Czermak B.J. Diehl K.M. Younkin E.M. Sarma V. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 239-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In an extension to this study, analogues of SLPI, mutated at the active site residue, were shown to have varying effects on IgG immune complex-induced NF-κB activation (18Mulligan M.S. Lentsch A.B. Huber-Lang M. Guo R.F. Sarma V. Wright C.D. Ulich T.R. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1033-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A SLPI mutant possessing a lysine at position 72 was more active than the wild-type molecule at suppressing intrapulmonary activation of NF-κB (18Mulligan M.S. Lentsch A.B. Huber-Lang M. Guo R.F. Sarma V. Wright C.D. Ulich T.R. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1033-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SLPI has also been shown to up-regulate the production of certain anti-inflammatory proteins including hepatocyte growth factor- and LPS-induced interleukin-10 (19Kikuchi T. Abe T. Yaekashiwa M. Tominaga Y. Mitsuhashi H. Satoh K. Nakamura T. Nukiwa T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Sano C. Shimizu T. Sato K. Kawauchi H. Tomioka H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 121: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the former study, it was demonstrated that unlike the wild-type SLPI protein, oxidized SLPI did not up-regulate hepatocyte growth factor (19Kikuchi T. Abe T. Yaekashiwa M. Tominaga Y. Mitsuhashi H. Satoh K. Nakamura T. Nukiwa T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this report we have also demonstrated that oxidized SLPI does not inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB activation, unlike wild-type SLPI, indicating that the ability of SLPI to inhibit the LPS signaling pathway may reside in its antiprotease activity. This result suggests that SLPI may be acting to inhibit a protease or proteases involved in LPS activation of monocytic cells. In this regard, a recent study (21Mansell A. Reinicke A. Worrall D.M. O'Neill L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) has shown that another serine protease inhibitor, antithrombin III, inhibits NF-κB activation by LPS. Apart from the antiprotease and anti-inflammatory properties of SLPI, this multifaceted molecule also possesses anti-bacterial properties and has been demonstrated to have in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (22Hiemstra P.S. Maassen R.J. Stolk J. Heinzel-Wieland R. Steffens G.J. Dijkman J.H. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4520-4524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another microbicidal peptide, PR-39, has recently been shown to inhibit TNFα-induced IκBα degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by binding to the α7 subunit of the 26 S proteasome (23Gao Y. Lecker S. Post M.J. Hietaranta A.J., Li, J. Volk R., Li, M. Sato K. Saluja A.K. Steer M.L. Goldberg A.L. Simons M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although SLPI and PR39 do not share sequence homology, they do share a number of common features including (i) a high positive charge, (ii) a large number of proline residues, (iii) bactericidal activity, and (iv) inducibility of expression by LPS. Therefore, it is possible that SLPI acts similarly to PR39 by entering the cell and inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and thereby inhibiting LPS-induced degradation of the regulatory proteins IRAK, IκBα, and IκBβ and subsequently preventing NF-κB activation. Previous studies (10McNeely T.B. Shugars D.C. Rosendahl M. Tucker C. Eisenberg S.P. Wahl S.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that addition of SLPI to monocytes results in SLPI binding to the cell and subsequent detection in cell lysates indicating that SLPI may enter cells to effect its action. In conclusion, the evidence presented in this study shows that SLPI inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB activation in monocytic cells in a manner that is dependent on its antiprotease activity. Due to its high concentration in the (upper) respiratory tract, the ability of SLPI to inhibit LPS activation of inflammatory cells may be important in disease states such as cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In a previous study (8Taggart C.C. Lowe G.J. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A.T. O'Neill S.J. Levine R.L. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33345-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) we have shown that SLPI is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by members of the elastolytic cathepsin family, including cathepsins B, L, and S, resulting in the diminution of the antiprotease activity of SLPI. Proteolysis of SLPI may not only impair its anti-elastase activity but also its anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, oxidation or proteolysis of SLPI during infection or inflammation on the respiratory surface may result in uncontrolled protease activity, generation of greater amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators, and subsequent lung damage."
https://openalex.org/W2019208824,"The proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the formation of membrane-bound C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and of soluble beta-amyloid peptides likely influences the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show that in human brain a subset of CTFs are tyrosine-phosphorylated and form stable complexes with the adaptor protein ShcA. Grb2 is also part of these complexes, which are present in higher amounts in AD than in control brains. ShcA immunoreactivity is also greatly enhanced in patients with AD and occurs at reactive astrocytes surrounding cerebral vessels and amyloid plaques. A higher amount of phospho-ERK1,2, likely as result of the ShcA activation, is present in AD brains. In vitro experiments show that the ShcA-CTFs interaction is strictly confined to glial cells when treated with thrombin, which is a well known ShcA and ERK1,2 activator and a regulator of APP cleavage. In untreated cells ShcA does not interact with either APP or CTFs, although they are normally generated. Altogether these data suggest that CTFs are implicated in cell signaling via Shc transduction machinery, likely influencing MAPK activity and glial reaction in AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2083499533,"NP95, which contains a ubiquitin-like domain, a cyclin A/E-Cdk2 phosphorylation site, a retinoblastoma (Rb) binding motif, and a ring finger domain, has been shown to be colocalized as foci with proliferating cell nuclear antigen in early and mid-S phase nuclei. We established Np95 nulligous embryonic stem cells by replacing the exons 2–7 of theNp95 gene with a neo cassette and by selecting out a spontaneously occurring homologous chromosome crossing over with a higher concentration of neomycin. Np95-null cells were more sensitive to x-rays, UV light,N-methyl-N′′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), and hydroxyurea than embryonic stem wild type (Np95+/+) or heterozygously inactivated (Np95+/−) cells. Expression of transfectedNp95 cDNA in Np95-null cells restored the resistance to x-rays, UV, MNNG, or hydroxyurea concurrently to a level similar to that of Np95+/− cells, although slightly below that of wild type (Np95+/+) cells. These findings suggest that NP95 plays a role in the repair of DNA damage incurred by these agents. The frequency of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange was significantly higher forNp95-null cells than for Np95+/+cells or Np95+/− cells (p < 0.001). We conclude that NP95 functions as a common component in the multiple response pathways against DNA damage and replication arrest and thereby contributes to genomic stability.

When growing cells are exposed to DNA damage or DNA replication blocks, they arrest their cell cycle processes, apparently to allow time for repair to be completed satisfactorily. This arrest is part of a “checkpoint” function that monitors the physical state of DNA at different stages of the cycle. Cells that have lost a checkpoint control may be as DNA damage-sensitive as cells that have lost DNA repair capability. Many genes are involved in controlling the cell cycle and determining checkpoints (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 2Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 3Zhou B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a possible link between checkpoint failure, hypersensitivity to DNA damage or replication blockage, and genomic instability has provided an important insight into processes contributing to the cellular dysfunction that leads to cancer (4Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar). We previously produced a monoclonal antibody, Th-10a mAb,1 that recognizes a 95-kDa mouse nuclear protein (NP95). NP95 was detected by the Th-10a mAb, specifically in the S phase of normal mouse thymocytes. In contrast, mouse T cell lymphoma cells showed a constantly high level for NP95 accumulation irrespective of cell stages during the cell cycle (5Muto M. Utsuyama M. Horiguchi T. Kubo E. Sado T. Hirokawa K. Cell Prolif. 1995; 28: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By immunoscreening a λgt-11 cDNA expression library with the Th-10a mAb, we isolated the cDNA encoding NP95 (6Fujimori A. Matsuda Y. Takemoto Y. Hashimoto Y. Kubo E. Araki R. Fukumura R. Mita K. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the whole 3.5-kb cDNA revealed that NP95 is a novel nuclear protein with an open reading frame consisting of 782 amino acids. The open reading frame contains an unusual N-terminal domain that bears a striking resemblance to ubiqutin, a leucine zipper motif, a zinc finger motif, a potential ATP/GTP binding site, a putative cyclin A/E-cdk2 phosphorylation site, retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-binding motifs, and a ring finger domain (6Fujimori A. Matsuda Y. Takemoto Y. Hashimoto Y. Kubo E. Araki R. Fukumura R. Mita K. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NP95 was shown to be localized in S phase nuclei as dot-like foci (7Uemura T. Kubo E. Kanari Y. Ikemura T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Double immunostaining for NP95 and chromatin-bound PCNA revealed that NP95 was almost exclusively colocalized with chromatin-bound PCNA throughout the nucleus in early S phase and partly in mid-S phase. However, distinct localization of the two proteins became evident in some part in mid-S phase and late-S phase (7Uemura T. Kubo E. Kanari Y. Ikemura T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Miura M. Watanabe H. Sasaki T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggested that NP95, rather than committing DNA replication itself as a component of replication machinery, contributes to some other DNA replication-linked events (8Miura M. Watanabe H. Sasaki T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, to gain further insights into the physiological role of NP95, we attempted to produce a targeted disruption of mouseNp95. We made strenuous but ultimately futile efforts to obtain Np95 null mice, probably because Np95inactivation caused mid-gestational embryonic lethality. We, therefore, established Np95-null embryonic stem (ES) cells by treatingNp95+/− ES cells with a higher concentration of G418 (2 mg/ml) to select out a mitotic crossing over. We examined the effect of the homozygous Np95 disruption on the sensitivity to x-rays, UV light, andN-methyl-N′′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and found that Np95-null ES cells were more sensitive to treatment with these agents than ES wild type (E14.wt) or 19(Np95+/−) cells. In addition,Np95-null ES cells turned out to be more sensitive to DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) than E14.wt or 19(Np95+/−) cells. To obtain further insights into the role of NP95 in DNA recombination and chromosomal stability, we examined the frequency of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in NP95-deficient cells. In view of the characteristics of NP95-deficient cells, we suggest that NP95 functions as a common component in the multiple DNA damage response pathways and that it plays a role in the maintenance of genomic stability. To construct the targeting vector of Np95, genomic DNA segments corresponding to the Np95 were obtained by screening of the strain 129 genomic library, λ129 (9Gomi H. Yokoyama T. Fujimoto K. Ikeda T. Katoh A. Itohara S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), with 1.8 kb of N-terminal cDNA of Np95 cDNA. Selected genomic fragments containing the Np95 gene were subcloned into pBluescriptII SK (−). Sequencing of each clone was done using dye terminator beginning with the T3 and T7 ends (GenBankTMaccession number AB066245). The exon-intron boundary predictions were based upon comparison of the genomic sequence with Np95cDNA (6Fujimori A. Matsuda Y. Takemoto Y. Hashimoto Y. Kubo E. Araki R. Fukumura R. Mita K. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The targeting vector, pNPKO1, was constructed using two genomic clones, pNP1 and pNP7. The upstream 1.5-kb BamHI fragment from pNP1 and downstream 6.2-kbSalI/EcoRI fragment from pNP7 were inserted into sites of restriction enzymes, ClaI and XbaI, in pgk-Neo cassette. This insertion resulted in deletion from exon 2 to exon 7 (see Fig. 1A). ES cells, E14, were kindly provided by Dr. Martin L. Hooper (Department of Pathology, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK) (10Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). These were cultured in ES medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (430-2800ED, Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum,l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, nucleoside mixture (adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, cytidine and uridine), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 10−4m2-mercaptoethanol, and 103 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO; ESG1107, Chemicon International) (11Itohara S. Mombaerts P. Lafaille J. Iacomini J. Nelson A. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Farr A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 72: 337-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and then they were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. For labeling experiments, ES medium without nucleoside supplementation was employed (“labeling ES medium”). E14 cells were grown on embryonic fibroblast feeder cells, electroporated in the presence of 30 μg of NotI linearized targeting vector, pNPKO1, and selected on neomycin-resistant feeder cells with G418 at 125 μg/ml for 7 days. Homologous recombinants were identified by PCR using primers NC (+) (AGAGGAGAGTGCGGATCGCCGCCGTGAGAG) in exon 1 and NEO (−) (GATTCGCAGCGCATCGCCTTCTATCG) in the poly(A) signal of thepgk-Neo cassette. PCR-positive clones were confirmed with Southern blots using probe A (300 bp) and probe B (EcoRI/KpnI fragment outside of pNPKO1). Heterozygous ES cell lines for the Np95 gene were expanded for several passages and plated onto 10 gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes at a density of 1.0 × 106 cell/dish, cultured for 24 h, and grown in the presence of 2 mg/ml of G418. Homozygous clones that survived for 10 days were identified by Southern blots using probe A. Inactivation of the Np95 gene was confirmed by Western blot with Th-10a mAb. ES cell colonies surviving for 7 days were trypsinized and grown for 1.5 days in 96-well plates. The cells were trypsinized and duplicated. Half of these cells were centrifuged and boiled in 100 μl of distilled water. A portion of cell lysate (10 μl) was subjected to 30-cycle PCR amplification of homologous recombined allele using the primer set, exon 1 primer, NC (+), and pgk poly(A) signal primer, NEO (−). Amplification was performed with LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) as follows: initial 4-min incubation at 94 °C, 30 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s with a final 5-min elongation step at 72 °C. Genomic DNA isolated from ES cell lines was digested with BamHI, separated by electrophoresis through 0.6% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membrane in 2× SSC. The probe utilized is described in Fig. 1A and was32P-labeled with random primer labeling kit (TaKaRa Bio, Inc.). The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC and analyzed with Bio-image analyzer BAS2000. 3 × 106 ES cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes, and after 12 h, they were washed twice with PBS(++) and immediately lysed in lysis buffer (8Miura M. Watanabe H. Sasaki T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) plus SDS sample buffer (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Dai-ichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and transferred to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). Membranes blocked in 5% skim milk (DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI) in PBS for 1 h were rinsed and incubated with anti-NP95 (Th-10a) or anti-PCNA (PC10, BD PharMingen) antibody in 0.5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS-T (0.1% Tween in PBS). Binding of primary antibody was revealed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rat IgG antibody P0450 (DAKO, Kyoto, Japan) diluted at 1:5000 in 0.5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS-T. Signals were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Lumi-Light Plus; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were fixed with cold 70% ethanol for 30 min at 0 °C, washed twice with PBS supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FPBS), resuspended with 30 μl of anti-Np95 monoclonal antibody (Th-10a) in FPBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with FPBS and resuspended in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG (F234, Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with FPBS and subjected to flow cytometric analysis (FACscan, BD PharMingen). Np95 cDNA was inserted into pcDNA 3.1 vector containing a V5 epitope and His tag (Invitrogen). To construct pIRES.hyg.Np95.V5HA expression vector, an Np95 cDNA fragment containing the Kozack sequence in the N terminus and connected with a V5 epitope and His tag in the C terminus was inserted into the BamHI site of the pIRES.hyg vector (CLONTECH). pIRES.hyg.Np95.VA.HA plasmid or empty vector (pIRES.hyg) were linearized by digestion with FspI, and 19.4(Np95−/−) cells were transfected with these plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The cells were subsequently cultured for 10 days in the presence of Hygromycin B (70–100 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Thirty colonies resistant to Hygromycin B were isolated, and DNA from these colonies was isolated and analyzed to determine whether the full-length Np95 cDNA was detected by PCR. Finally, these clones were confirmed to produce NP95 by flow cytometric analysis following immunostaining of the cells with anti-NP95 mAb(Th-10a) and anti-V5 mAb. ES clones were trypsinized and plated on gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes (Falcon, BD PharMingen) at a density ranging from 1.5 × 103 to 6 × 103per dish. Following incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, ES cells were exposed to various doses of x-rays. Irradiation was performed with a Shinai-III x-ray generator (Shimadzu Seisakusho Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) at 0.72 Gy/min (200 kVp (kilovolts at peak), 20 mA, with filters of 0.5 mm copper and 0.5 mm aluminum). ES clones were trypsinized, plated on gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes, and cultured at 37 °C for 16 h. ES cells were washed twice and then overlaid with 5 ml of Dulbecco’s PBS(−) (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The cells were irradiated with UV light emitted from germicidal lamps (15 watts, GL-15, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature. The fluence rate was 0.285 J/m2/s as measured with a UV intensity meter (Topcon UVR-254, Tokyo Kogaku, Tokyo, Japan). ES clones were trypsinized and plated on gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes at 1.0–1.5 × 103 cells per dish. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, ES cells were exposed to various concentrations of MNNG in ES medium for 60 min at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS(−), and then cultured further in ES medium. ES clones were trypsinized and plated on gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes at 1.5 × 103 cells. Following incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, ES medium was removed, and various concentrations of HU (Sigma) were added to the cultures. After the treatment for 4 h at 37 °C, ES cells were washed with 15 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and cultured further in ES medium. Following these treatments, ES cells were incubated with ES medium for 7 days, and colonies were scored. Plating efficiencies ranged from 30 to 50%. Relative survivals in terms of the loss of clonogenicity were based on at least two or three experiments carried out in triplicate. Twenty thousand ES cells were plated into labeling ES medium containing 0.02 μCi/ml, [2-14C]thymidine (7 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were grown for 24 h. After removal of the radioactive medium, each culture was further incubated in fresh ES medium for at least another 2 h to deplete residual 14C-labeled thymidine from endogenous DNA precursor pools. Cultures were then irradiated with 4 Gy of x-rays. At specific times during subsequent incubation, the corresponding x-ray- and sham-treated cell monolayers were pulse-labeled for 1 h with 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (88.2 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The paired cultures were rinsed with ice-cold 1× SSC and lysed with 1 ml of lysis solution (0.05% SDS, 10 mmEDTA). The lysates were precipitated on wet Whatman GF/C glass filters followed by addition of 1 ml of 8% perchrolic acid. The filters were rinsed with ice-cold 4% perchrolic acid, rinsed twice with 70 and 100% ethanol, dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman Instruments). The rate of semiconservative DNA synthesis in irradiated cultures was calculated as follows and expressed as a percentage of incorporations for sham-treated controls, as shown in Equation 1,*{[(cpm*3H+14C)−14C only]/cpm*14C}irradiated{[cpm*3H+14C−14C only]/cpm*14C}sham­irradiated×100Equation 1 ES clones were trypsinized and plated on gelatin-coated 25-cm2 flasks (for x-rays and MNNG treatment) and 10-cm2 plates (for UV treatment) at a 1.0 × 106 cell density. After overnight culture, ES medium was changed, and the cells were treated with x-rays, UV, and MNNG as described above. The cells were then cultured for approximately two cell cycle periods (24 h) with ES medium containing 5 μmbromodeoxyuridine and pulsed with 0.04 μg/ml Colcemid for the final 1 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and exposed to 0.075 m KCl hypotonic solution for 12 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with the fixative (methanol:acetic acid = 3:1) and suspended in a small volume of the fixative. The cell suspension was dropped onto ice-cold wet glass slides and air-dried at 60 °C for 2 h. Sister chromatid differential staining was obtained by a method described earlier (12Perry P. Wolff S. Nature. 1974; 251: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3026) Google Scholar, 13Kurihara T. Inoue M. Tatsumi K. Mutat. Res. 1987; 184: 147-151PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells on the 2-day slides were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in 0.067m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 10 min, rinsed with 0.067m PBS (pH 7.0) and then overlaid with coverslips. The coverslipped slides were exposed to black light (λ = 352 nm) at a distance of 9 cm for 2 h. After removal of coverslips, the slides were incubated in 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl plus 0.03m sodium citrate) solution at 60 °C for 1 h and then stained with 5% Giemsa solution in 13 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for 10 min, rinsed in water, and air-dried. Student’st test was employed for statistical analyses. To further elucidate the physiological function of NP95, we generated cell lines with disrupted Np95. Mouse Np95 gene cloned from the genomic library of strain 129 spans about 23 kb. We constructed a targeting vector in which part of the Np95 genomic region from exon 2 containing initiation codon to exon 7 was replaced by apgk-neo gene cassette (Fig.1A). After transfection with electroporation and selection in ES medium containing 125 μg/ml G418, we isolated 234 G418-resistant ES clones and two clones (No. 19 and No. 169) were homologous recombinants in Np95 genome locus (Fig.1B). To obtain NP95-deficient ES cells disrupted in both alleles, heterozygous 19(Np95+/−) clone was selected in medium containing highly concentrated G418 (2 mg/ml), and 17 resistant clones were isolated. Two clones (19.4 and 19.7) were shown to be mutated in both of the alleles (Fig.1B). Reverse transcript-PCR analysis (data not shown) and Western blot analysis were performed, and the Np95 gene was not expressed in these cells (Fig. 1C). Since expression of NP95 is restricted in S phase cells and co-localized with PCNA (7Uemura T. Kubo E. Kanari Y. Ikemura T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Miura M. Watanabe H. Sasaki T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it was assumed that NP95 was associated with DNA replication and that NP95-deficient ES cells were lethal. However, NP95-deficient ES cell lines were grown in leukemia inhibitory factor-containing medium, and the doubling time was 12 h, similar to E14.wt and 19(Np95+/−) cell lines (data not shown). Plating efficiency of NP95-deficient ES cells was normal. This indicated that NP95 participates in DNA replication-linked events other than DNA replication itself as a replication machinery, a finding that is consistent with a previous observation (8Miura M. Watanabe H. Sasaki T. Tatsumi K. Muto M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PCNA is known to be co-localized with proteins involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation (14Chuang L.S.H. Ian H. Koh T., Ng, H., Xu, G. Li B.F.L.

Biol. 2001; 77: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To determine whether deletion of the Np95 gene affects the DNA repair, we examined the sensitivity of NP95-deficient ES cells to various types of DNA damage. E14.wt, 19(Np95+/−), and NP95-deficient ES cells (19.4(Np95−/−) and 19.7(Np95−/−)) were exposed to various doses of x-rays, and the survival curve was obtained as shown in Fig.2. The results indicated that NP95-deficient ES cells were more sensitive to x-rays than E14.wt cells or 19(Np95+/−) cells. D37 (the dose required to reduce the fraction of surviving cells to 0.37) was 1.5 Gy for Np95−/− cells, 2.4 Gy forNp95+/− cells, and 3.1 Gy forNp95+/+ cells. NP95-deficient cells were also more sensitive to UV light and the alkylating agent, MNNG, than E14.wt cells. D37 for Np95−/− cells and E14.wt Np95+/+ cells was ∼2.6 J/m2and 4.7 J/m2 for UV and 4.2 μm and 8.5 μm for MNNG, respectively (Fig.3, A and B). Thus, NP95-deficient ES cells exhibited an ∼2-fold sensitization to the three different kinds of DNA damaging agents as compared with E14.wt cells. The marginal difference in the cytotoxicity between E14.wt cells and 19(Np95+/−) cells was statistically significant for 2 and 4 Gy of x-rays but not for 10 and 20 μm of MNNG.Figure 3Effect of disruption and restitution of theNp95gene on cellular resistance to UV and MNNG. As shown in A, relative surviving fractions as a function of UV dose in E14.wt(Np95+/+) cells (◯), Np95 cDNA-transfected N2 cells (▪), 19.4(Np95−/−) cells (♦), and empty vector-transfected PV-1 cells (⊙) were determined. Data points denote means of a representative single experiment carried out in triplicate. Bars show standard errors. As shown inB, relative surviving fractions as a function of the concentration of MNNG in E14.wt(Np95+/+) cells (◯), Np95 cDNA-transfected N2 cells (▪), 19(Np95+/−) cells (▪), empty vector-transfected PV-1 cells (⊙), 19.4(Np95−/−) cells (♦), and 19.7(Np95−/−) cells (•) were determined.Data points denote means from two independent experiments each carried out in triplicate. Bars show standard errors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since NP95-deficient ES cells were shown to be more sensitive to various DNA damaging agents than ES wild type cells, we examined whether transfection with Np95 cDNA into NP95-deficient ES cells could restore the response to DNA damage to a level similar to that of E14.wt and 19(Np95+/−) cells. We constructed NP95 expression vector, in which Np95cDNA connected with a V5 epitope and His tag at the C terminus was inserted into pIRES.hyg expression vector (CLONTECH). The NP95 expression construct was linearized and transfected into 19.4(Np95−/−) cells. After screening of hygromycin B-resistant clones based on PCR and flow cytometric analysis, we obtained a considerable number of stable transfected subclones of 19.4(Np95−/−) cells. Among these, two Np95-transfected subclones, N2 and N8, were confirmed to have an intact structure by PCR data and concomitant detection of NP95 protein and V5 epitope. Empty vector-transfected PV-1 cells were subjected to subsequent analyses as a negative control. The transfection with Np95 cDNA restored the resistance of 19.4(Np95−/−) cells to x-rays to a considerable extent, although virtually similar to that of 19(Np95+/−) cells (N2 and N8 in Fig. 2). Less than complete recoveries to the wild type level of x-ray sensitivity were unequivocal as the difference in the surviving fraction between N8 and E14.wt was statistically significant; p < 0.02 for 2 Gy, p < 0.001 for 4 Gy. Immunostaining of these cells against NP95 followed by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that the levels of NP95 expression in both N8 and N2 cells gained only about a quarter of those of E14.wt or 19(Np95+/−) (data not shown). These inadequate levels of NP95 expression in N8 and N2 may explain the insufficient recovery. The unexpected suppression of NP95 function by the pIRES.hyg vector itself was ruled out since no difference was observed in the extent of the hypersensitivity to x-rays between 19.4(Np95−/−) cells and empty vector-transected PV-1 cells in an independent experiment (data not shown). Clonogenic survivals after exposure to UV light or MNNG in Np95 cDNA-transfected cells indicated that the cellular resistance to those agents was also regained, although the extent of recovery was again incomplete (N2 cells in Fig. 3, A and B). Empty vector transfection had no effect on the sensitivity of 19.4(Np95−/−) cells to UV or MNNG exposure (PV-1 cells in Fig. 3, A and B). These results strongly indicate that Np95 is one of the genes bestowing cellular resistance concurrently to ionizing radiation (IR), UV, and MNNG. Expression of a kinase-inactive allele ofATR (ATRkd) in human fibroblasts caused an increased sensitivity to IR, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and UV together with an DNA replication inhibitor, HU, and displayed a loss of checkpoint control (22Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 23Wright J.A. Keegan K.S. Herendeen D.R.

Since NP95-deficient cells were also hypersensitive to x-rays, UV, and MNNG (Figs. 2 and 3, A andB), it seemed possible to presume that the loss of NP95 likewise results in an increased sensitivity to HU. NP95-deficient ES cells were indeed more sensitive to HU than either E14.wt cells or 19(Np95+/−) cells (19.4 cells and 19.7 cells in Fig. 4). Moreover, Np95cDNA-transfected cells restored the resistance to HU to an extent similar to that of 19(Np95+/−) cells (N8 cells and N2 cells in Fig. 4). Empty vector-transfected PV-1 cells and 19.4(Np95−/−) cells showed a similar hypersensitivity to HU exposure, as we had expected. Thus, theNp95 gene appeared to confer the cellular capability to cope with DNA replication blocks incurred by HU. The cultured skin fibroblasts derived from the patients with ataxia-telangiectasia are sensitive to IR, but such cells show little or no increase in the sensitivity to UV, alkylating agents, or anti-metabolic inhibitors of DNA replication. These cells are also characterized by an enhanced RDS (24Painter R.B. Young B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7315-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 25Wit J.d.

https://openalex.org/W2134580583,"Yeast SIR2 is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase required for heterochromatic silencing at telomeres, rDNA, and mating-type loci. We find that the Drosophila homolog of Sir2 (dSir2) also encodes deacetylase activity and is required for heterochromatic silencing, but unlike ySir2, is not required for silencing at telomeres. We show that dSir2 interacts genetically and physically with members of the Hairy/Deadpan/E(Spl) family of bHLH euchromatic repressors, key regulators of Drosophila development. dSir2 is an essential gene whose loss of function results in both segmentation defects and skewed sex ratios, associated with reduced activities of the Hairy and Deadpan bHLH repressors. These results indicate that Sir2 in higher organisms plays an essential role in both euchromatic repression and heterochromatic silencing."

In this study, LPA production and response were characterized in two human prostate cancer (CaP) cell lines: PC-3 and Du145. Bombesin, a neuroendocrine peptide that is mitogenic for CaP cells, stimulated focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Similar responses were elicited by 18:1 LPA (oleoyl-LPA). Studies using radioisotopic labeling revealed that both PC-3 and Du145 generate LPA and that LPA production is increased by bombesin. The kinetics of bombesin-induced phospholipase D activation and LPA production were similar. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, 18:1 LPA was found to be an abundant LPA species in CaP cell medium. Structure activity studies of acyl-LPAs revealed that 18:1 LPA is most efficacious for activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phospholipase D in CaP cells. Incubation with 18:1 LPA caused homologous desensitization of LPA response, whereas bombesin caused heterologous desensitization. LPA was present at nanomolar levels in medium from bombesin-treated cells. LPA extracted from the medium induced calcium mobilization in CaP cells. These results demonstrate that bioactive LPA is generated by CaP cells in response to a mitogen and suggest that 18:1 LPA can act as an autocrine mediator.

S1P can act as an autocrine mediator of cell migration in fibroblasts (5Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 29: 1800-1803Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Although LPA was first shown to be released by activated platelets, many cell types have now been shown to produce LPA (reviewed in Ref.6Xie Y. Gibbs T.C. Meier K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because LPA receptors are widely expressed in embryonic and adult tissues (7Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), LPA can potentially act as both a paracrine and autocrine mediator. For example, LPA is produced by adipocytes and can serve as a paracrine mediator to stimulate proliferation of preadipocytes (8Pages G. Girard A. Jeanneton O. Barbe P. Wolf C. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ascites fluid from ovarian cancer patients contain elevated levels of LPA (9Westermann A.M.

Kennedy A. Webster K. Belinson J. Xu Y. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 290: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Ovarian cancer cells can produce and respond to LPA (11Shen Z. Belinson J. Morton R.E. Xu Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 1998; 71: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, vascular endothelial growth factor released from ovarian cancer cells in response to LPA can induce angiogenesis in endothelial cells (12Hu V.-L. Tee M.-K. Goetzl E. Auersperg N. Mills G.B. Ferrara N. Jaffe R.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These latter findings suggest that LPA can act as an paracrine and/or autocrine growth factor in tumors. The metabolic pathways involved in LPA production have not been well defined. Possibilities include: 1) hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid (PA) by phospholipase D (PLD), followed by hydrolysis of PA by a phospholipase A2 (PLA2), 2) generation of lyso-phospholipid by PLA2, followed by hydrolysis by a lyso-PLD, and 3) phosphorylation of monoglyceride by monoglyceride kinase. The agonist-regulated steps in these pathways have not yet been defined. Nonetheless, it is clear that production of LPA can be stimulated as a result of receptor-mediated signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 6Xie Y. Gibbs T.C. Meier K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). LPA refers to a family of glycerophospholipids with carbon chains of varying length and saturation linked to glycerol by acyl, alkyl, or alkenyl linkages. Research concerning the structure activity relationship of LPAs has been complicated by the numerous possible variations in its composition. The phosphate head group is critical for LPA activity, whereas manipulations of the lipophilic substituent and its linkage to the glycerol backbone have variable effects on LPA activity in different systems (13Lynch K.R. Macdonald T.L. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Med. 2001; 64: 3-45Google Scholar). The fact that cells typically express multiple LPA receptors with overlapping but distinct ligand specificities (14Swarthout J.T. Walling H.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1978-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggests that response profiles for LPA species will differ between cell types according to their receptor expression. Oleoyl-LPA (1-acyl 18:1 LPA), a species present in biological samples, is most often used experimentally as an agonist. Studies have shown that 18:1 LPA and 16:0 LPA are most efficacious at inducing a variety of cellular responses (15Santos W.L. Rossi J.A. Boggs S.D. MacDonald T.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 90 5: 232-241Google Scholar). We previously reported that 18:1 LPA is mitogenic for prostate cancer (CaP) cells (16Qi C. Park J.H. Gibbs T.C. Shirley D.W. Bradshaw C.D. Ella K.M. Meier K.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that PC-3 and Du145, two human CaP cell lines, express the LPA receptors LPA1/Edg-2 and LPA2/Edg-4, but not LPA3/Edg-7 (17Gibbs T.C. Xie Y. Meier K.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 2T. C. Gibbs, Y. Xie, and K. E. Meier, submitted for publication. Mitogenic responses of PC-3 cells to LPA have been confirmed by others (18Kue P.F. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 2162-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Guo C. Luttrell L.M. Price D.T. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our work has also shown that CaP cells can generate LPA (20Xie Y. Meier K.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 344: 294-305Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that LPA serves as an autocrine growth factor in human CaP cells. In this report, we provide evidence that: 1) extracellular 18:1 LPA is generated by CaP cells, 2) LPA levels are increased by bombesin, 3) bombesin induces desensitization of LPA response, and 4) LPA produced in response to bombesin is biologically active. LPAs (caproyl (6:0), myristoyl (14:0), palmitoyl (16:0), oleoyl (18:1), and stearoyl (18:0)) were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). [3H]Lyso- PAF (1-O-[3H]octadecyl-alkyl-sn-glyceryl-phosphorylcholine) was from Amersham Biosciences; [3H]palmitic acid, [3H]oleic acid, and ENhance were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bombesin and phospholipase B were from Sigma. Anti-phospho-ERK, -Raf, -MEK, and -pp90rsk were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA); and anti-phospho-FAK was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). PC-3 cells and Du145 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in F12K and RPMI 1640 media, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air on standard tissue culture plastic and serum-starved by incubation in serum-free medium for 18–24 h. LPA production was assessed in cells and medium as described previously (20Xie Y. Meier K.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 344: 294-305Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells grown in 6-well plates, with replicate wells for each treatment, were serum-starved and simultaneously labeled by incubation for 18 h with 5 μCi/ml [3H]lyso-PAF, [3H]palmitic acid, or [3H]oleic acid in 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed and then incubated with agonists in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. The lipids were extracted and separated by TLC on silica gel plates impregnated with 0.5 m oxalic acid. Unlabeled 18:1 LPA was added as standard. 3H-Labeled lipids were visualized by autoradiography after spraying with ENhance. LPA bands, as well as the remainder of each lane, were scraped and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The results are expressed as percentages of the total radioactivity recovered. LPA extraction and separation were done as described above but without radioisotope labeling. LPA bands were scraped from the TLC plate and then eluted from the silica using chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v). The samples were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in methanol. ESI-MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) were performed on a LCQTM ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source (Finnigan Corp., San Jose, CA). The samples were delivered into the ESI source using a syringe pump via direct infusion. The mobile phase was methanol/H2O (1:1 v/v); flow rate was 5 μl/min. The capillary temperature was maintained at 200 °C. LPA was detected in the negative mode with a capillary voltage of −17 V. The tube lens offset voltage was 10 V. The collision energies were 28% for MS/MS. To validate MS/MS spectra, 17:0, 18:1, and 16:0 LPAs were used as standards. An assay for bulk LPA levels was carried out according to the method of Saulnier-Blache and co-workers (21Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.-F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this assay involves conversion of unlabeled LPA to [14C]PA using bacterially expressed mammalian LPA acyltransferase. The LPA acyltransferase construct was kindly provided by Dr. J. S. Saulnier-Blache (INSERM, Toulouse, France) with the permission of Dr. K. Kume (University of Tokyo). LPA was extracted from CaP cell medium as described above for the isotopic assay. Medium from one 150-mm dish of cells (12 ml) was used for each experimental treatment. In some experiments, the medium was incubated with phospholipase B (PLB) (0.2 unit/ml; Sigma) for 12 h at 37 °C prior to lipid extraction; the controls were incubated similarly, without PLB. The lipid extracts were dried and then suspended in assay buffer containing Tween 20, [14C] oleoyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and microsomal membranes fromEscherichia coli expressing murine LPA acyltransferase (22Kume K. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following incubation, the lipids were extracted and separated by TLC. The [14C]PA band was localized by autoradiography and then quantitated by densitometry using NIH Image software. PLD assays were performed in intact cells by methods described previously (23Meier K.E. Gibbs T.C. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. Oxford University, Oxford, UK1999: 301-319Google Scholar). The materials and procedures for this assay are similar to those described above for isotopic LPA analysis. Briefly, the cells were grown in 6-well plates, with triplicate or quadruplicate wells for each experimental condition. Serum-starved cells were labeled with 5 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid. The cells were washed and then incubated with 0.5% ethanol and agonists in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) at 37 °C. Extracted cellular lipids were separated by TLC. [3H]Phosphatidylethanol (PEt) and [3H]PA bands were collected and then quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Whole cell extracts, prepared from cells treated with and without agonists, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (24Gibbs T.C. Meier K.E. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 182: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Protein loading was equalized to 100 μg/lane, as determined using a Coomassie protein assay (Pierce). Antibodies against phosphoproteins recognized the following: phospho-Raf, Ser259; phospho-MEK1/2, Ser217/221; phospho-ERK1/2, Thr202/Tyr204; phospho-p90rsk, Ser381; and phospho-FAK, Tyr397. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (AmershamBiosciences). LPA-induced calcium mobilization was analyzed as described previously by Heise and colleagues (25Heise C.E. Santos W.L. Schreihofer A.M. Heasley B.H. Mukhin Y.V. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The lipids were extracted from CaP cell medium as described above for the radioenzymatic LPA assay; the media from three 150-mm dishes were combined for each experimental condition. For some experiments, the medium was incubated with phospholipase B prior to extraction as described above for the radioenzymatic assay. The lipid extract was suspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) before use in the bioactivity assay. PC-3 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were plated in clear bottom black 96-well plates overnight and then serum-starved for 18–24 h. The cells were loaded with Fluo3-AM ester (Molecular Probes) in a loading buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, washed four times with the loading buffer, and then incubated with various concentrations of LPA standards and lipid extract using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices). Five to six replicate wells were analyzed for each experimental condition. The data were analyzed using the fluorometric imaging plate reader software with appropriate negative control corrections. The first question that we addressed was whether LPA is produced by prostate cancer cells in response to a mitogenic agonist. Although previous work in our lab had established that 18:1 LPA is mitogenic for PC-3 cells (16Qi C. Park J.H. Gibbs T.C. Shirley D.W. Bradshaw C.D. Ella K.M. Meier K.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), an alternative agonist was needed for studies of mitogen-induced LPA production. Bombesin, a peptide mitogen for CaP cells (26Bologna M. Festuccia C. Muzi P. Biordi L. Ciomei M. Cancer. 1989; 63: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), is secreted by neuroendocrine cells in prostate tumors (27Abrahamsson P.A. Prostate. 1999; 39: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), binds to G protein-coupled receptors expressed by CaP tumors (28Markwalder R. Reubi J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1152-1159PubMed Google Scholar) and cells (29Sun G. Halmost G. Schally A.V. Wang X. Martinez M. Prostate. 2000; 42: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and induces transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in PC-3 cells (30Prenzel N. Zwick E. Dabu H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The following studies were performed to establish the activity of bombesin in PC-3 and Du145 cells and to compare its effects to those of 18:1 LPA. Immunoblotting was used to test the effects of bombesin on signal transduction pathways in PC-3 and Du145 cells (Fig.1). The effects of bombesin were compared with those of 18:1 LPA. FAK and ERKs have been established as downstream targets of both bombesin and LPA. In Fig. 1A, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was examined in PC-3 cells by immunoblotting for phospho-FAK. Bombesin and 18:1 LPA both induced FAK phosphorylation by 5 min. The bombesin response was attenuated by 15 min, whereas the LPA response was not. In Fig. 1B, the effects of bombesin and 18:1 LPA on activation of Raf, MEK, ERK, and p90rsk, components of the ERK MAPK pathway, were examined in PC-3 and Du145 cells by immunoblotting for the phosphorylated active kinases. In PC-3 cells, bombesin and 18:1 LPA similarly induced phosphorylation of Raf, MEK1/2, ERK, and p90rsk at 10 min. In Du145 cells, 18:1-LPA was more efficacious than bombesin in activating the ERK cascade. In summary, bombesin and 18:1 LPA activate two of the same signal transduction pathways in PC-3 and Du145 cells. LPA production was first assessed using an isotopic assay (20Xie Y. Meier K.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 344: 294-305Google Scholar). PC-3 cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]lyso-PAF or [3H]palmitic acid overnight. The lipids from cells and medium were extracted, separated by TLC, and then visualized by autoradiography. The results shown in Fig. 2A illustrate that LPA can be produced from either [3H]lyso-PAF or [3H]palmitic acid and is effectively separated from other cellular lipids using this method. Fig. 2B shows that [3H]oleic acid can also be used as a metabolic label for LPA production. Subsequent experiments used [3H]lyso-PAF as precursor, because the assay background was lowest with this isotope. Fig. 2B directly compares the total LPA recovered from cells and medium after a 60-min incubation. This panel demonstrates that the total amount of labeled LPA is lower in medium than in cells. The lipid profile was different between the two compartments, with LPA being a more prominent species in medium as compared with cells. Similar results were obtained using all three labeled precursors ([ 3H]palmitate, [3H]lyso-PAF, and [ 3H]oleate). These data suggested that the LPA in the medium is not cell-associated. To further exclude this possibility, we incubated attached cells in fresh medium for times up to 60 min and then sedimented and counted detached cells. The total number of detached cells collected from one well was less than 60 from a total of 3 × 105 cells seeded. This result suggested that cell-associated LPA contributed negligibly to LPA in the medium. Having established an assay for LPA production, we examined whether LPA levels were regulated by agonist. Fig.2C shows that LPA in the medium was increased by treatment of PC-3 cells with 100 nm bombesin for 20 min. The effects of bombesin on LPA in both cells and medium will be further addressed below. We next sought to identify the endogenous LPAs secreted by CaP cells. MS has been used to detect and analyze phospholipid and sphingolipid species (31Harrison K.A. Clay K.L. Murphy R.C. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 330-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Carrier A. Parent J. Dupuis S. J. Chromatogr. 2000; 876: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because this work has shown that 18-acyl-LPAs are abundant in biological samples, we focused our efforts on identifying these species in CaP cell culture medium. After using TLC to separate LPA from other lipids, we extracted LPA from the TLC plate and identified LPA species by ESI-MS. In Fig.3A, acyl-LPAs with 18-carbon fatty acid chains (central m/z at 435) were identified from the medium of PC-3 cells. A species withm/z of 435.3, corresponding to that of 18:1 (oleoyl) LPA, is the major peak detected in this spectrum. MS/MS was further used to verify the structure of peak 435.3. In Fig.3B, the fragments with m/z of 171 and 153 represent the glycerol phosphate backbone of LPA with or without an oxygen atom at sn-1 or sn-2, respectively. MS/MS has been used by others under the same conditions to confirm the structure of acyl-LPAs, with similar fragments observed (33Xiao Y. Chen Y. Kennedy A.W. Belinson J. Xu Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 242-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In Du145 medium, we used the same approach to detect and verify the presence of 18:1 LPA as a major species (data not shown). In summary, bombesin increases LPA production in PC-3 and Du145 cells. ESI-MS revealed that 18:1 LPA is generated by both cell lines. The results presented above demonstrated that bombesin can increase production of LPA in CaP cells. It has been reported that PLD and PLA2, which may contribute to LPA generation, are rapidly activated by bombesin in other cell lines (34Singh I.N. McCartney D.G. Kanfer J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Nishino H. Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G525-G534PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics and location (cells versus medium) of bombesin-induced LPA production were therefore examined in more detail. PC-3 and Du145 were treated with 100 nm bombesin for varying times, and LPA generation was assessed in cells and medium, using the isotopic assay (Fig. 4). As shown in the top left panel, bombesin induced a maximal increase in LPA in PC-3 cells at 10–20 min. In the top right panel, bombesin caused a more gradual increase in LPA in PC-3 medium, with a significant (p = 0.012) increase seen at 40 min. The data in this experiment were normalized to total lipid recovered; note that LPA represents a higher percentage of the total lipid in medium than in cells. This was expected, because the cells have a higher background of total labeled lipid (Fig. 2B). As noted previously, the total amount of LPA is greater in cells than in medium. A dose-response study established that LPA production in PC-3 cells was maximal with 100 nm bombesin (data not shown). The bottom panels show that bombesin increases LPA in Du145 cells and medium, with kinetics similar to those observed in PC-3 cells. The effects of bombesin on PLD activity were next examined using PC-3 cells. PEt is a relatively stable PLD product produced by a transphosphatidylation reaction in the presence of ethanol, whereas PA is the product of the hydrolysis reaction. Fig.5 (upper panel) indicates that PEt formation was stimulated by bombesin at 10 and 20 min. PEt levels decreased by 40 min, suggesting that the response to bombesin was transient. As shown in the lower panel, PA was elevated by 10 min and decreased by 20 min. The earlier decline in PA, as compared with PEt, likely reflects its more rapid metabolism to products such as diglyceride and LPA. In summary, bombesin induces LPA production in PC-3 and Du145 cells. LPA appears first in the cells and later in the medium. The kinetics of bombesin-induced PLD activation and cellular LPA production are similar. PC-3 and Du145 cells express the LPA receptors LPA1/Edg2 and LPA2/Edg 4 (17Gibbs T.C. Xie Y. Meier K.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). ERK MAPKs and PLD are rapidly activated by 18:1 LPA in PC-3 and Du-145 cells (16Qi C. Park J.H. Gibbs T.C. Shirley D.W. Bradshaw C.D. Ella K.M. Meier K.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).2 LPA-induced ERK activation (e.g. Fig.1B) has been confirmed by others for PC-3 cells (18Kue P.F. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 2162-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Guo C. Luttrell L.M. Price D.T. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine structure activity relationships, ERK and PLD activities were assessed in Du145 cells incubated with 1-acyl-LPAs containing 6:0, 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, or 18:1 substituents. As shown in Fig. 6A, 18:1 LPA is the most efficacious agonist of the species tested for ERK activation in Du145 cells, followed in decreasing order by 18:0, 14:0, and 16:0 LPA. The results indicate that 6:0 LPA does not induce ERK activation in Du145 cells. Dose-response data for 18:0 and 18:1 LPA are presented in Fig. 6B. ERK phosphorylation was maximal at 10 μm for both 18:0 and 18:1 LPA. At all active concentrations, 18:1 LPA was more efficacious than 18:0 LPA. In Fig. 7, PLD activation was tested in Du145 cells incubated with different species of LPA. Among the five LPAs tested, 18:1 LPA was most effective in stimulating PLD, followed in decreasing order by 14:0, 16:0, and 18:0 LPA. This order of efficacy was slightly different from that seen for ERK activation (Fig. 6), suggesting that different profiles of LPA receptors may mediate the two responses. Nonetheless, 18:1 LPA was the most efficacious for activation of both ERK and PLD. As one approach to address whether the LPA produced in response to bombesin is capable of activating LPA receptors, we tested whether cross-talk occurs between bombesin and LPA receptors. Following ligand binding, G protein-coupled receptors are desensitized by a complex series of events involving receptor phosphorylation as well as endocytosis (37Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that, if the LPA generated in response to bombesin was able to activate LPA receptors, then heterologous desensitization of LPA response should be observed in bombesin-treated cells. Du145 cells were treated with either bombesin or 18:1 LPA for 2 h and then treated with either bombesin or 18:1 LPA for 15 min. ERK phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblotting for phospho-ERK. As shown in Fig.8A (left lanes), 15 min of incubation with bombesin induced only modest ERK activation, whereas LPA and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate elicited robust responses. As noted previously (Fig. 1B), LPA is more effective than bombesin at inducing ERK activation in Du145 cells. Pretreatment with LPA (right lanes) completely inhibited subsequent response to LPA (homologous desensitization). Bombesin pretreatment (center lanes) likewise inhibited the subsequent response to bombesin (homologous desensitization). Most importantly, bombesin pretreatment resulted in partial inhibition of the response to 18:1 LPA (heterologous desensitization). Quantitation by densitometry revealed that LPA-induced ERK activation was reduced by 32.1 ± 6.5% (n = 3 separate experiments;p < 0.01) in cells pretreated with bombesin. In contrast, the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was not significantly inhibited by pretreatment with either bombesin or LPA (center and right lanes), suggesting that heterologous desensitization did not occur at a step downstream of Ras (38Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The partial extent of desensitization to LPA may reflect partial occupation of LPA receptors, with the caveat that the heterologous desensitization induced by bombesin probably involves more than one mechanism and is not solely due to LPA generation. In Fig.8A, the concentrations of LPAs achieved after bombesin treatment appeared to represent less than 10 μm, the concentration eliciting complete desensitization. To further address this issue, a dose-response study (Fig. 8B) was performed to determine the concentration of 18:1 LPA required to achieve homologous desensitization. Partial desensitization was observed in cells preincubated with 0.1 μm 18:1 LPA, whereas complete desensitization required 1 μm 18:1 LPA. In this experiment, the inhibition of LPA response seen in bombesin-treated cells was in the range of that observed between 10 and 100 nm 18:1 LPA. As shown previously (Fig. 6B), such concentrations of 18:1 LPA (<1 μm) elicit minimal ERK activation du"

By sequential unbinding and relabeling with different colors of α-bungarotoxin, we selectively labeled adjacent pools of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at neuromuscular junctions of adult mice. Timelapse imaging in vivo revealed that synaptic AChRs completely intermingle over ∼4 days and many extrasynaptic AChRs are incorporated into the synapse each day. In mice that lacked α-dystrobrevin, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, rates of AChR turnover, and intermingling were increased ∼4- to 5-fold. These results demonstrate remarkable molecular dynamism underlying macroscopic stability of the postsynaptic membrane, and establish α-dystrobrevin as a key control point for regulation of mobility and turnover."

Camptothecin treatment of Ramos B cells leads to the degradation of Rb protein and phosphorylation of its family members, p107 and p130. This correlates with an increase in the levels of cyclin E as well as the kinase activity associated with it. Inactivation of Rb leads to the dissociation and release of free E2F. We find also that E2F activity is induced upon camptothecin treatment, but this increase is absent in prohibitin overexpressing cells. It thus appears that prohibitin may be inhibiting apoptosis by downregulating E2F activity when Rb family members are inactive."
https://openalex.org/W2077385888,"Thermogenesis against cold exposure in mammals occurs in brown adipose tissue (BAT) through mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP1). Expression of the Ucp1 gene is unique in brown adipocytes and is regulated tightly. The 5′-flanking region of the mouse Ucp1 gene contains cis-acting elements including PPRE, TRE, and four half-site cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) with BAT-specific enhancer elements. In the course of analyzing how these half-site CREs are involved in Ucp1 expression, we found that a DNA regulatory element for NF-E2 overlaps CRE2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competition assays with the CRE2 element indicates that nuclear proteins from BAT, inguinal fat, and retroperitoneal fat tissue interact with the CRE2 motif (CGTCA) in a specific manner. A supershift assay using an antibody against the CRE-binding protein (CREB) shows specific affinity to the complex from CRE2 and nuclear extract of BAT. Additionally, Western blot analysis for phospho-CREB/ATF1 shows an increase in phosphorylation of CREB/ATF1 in HIB-1B cells after norepinephrine treatment. Transient transfection assay using luciferase reporter constructs also indicates that the two half-site CREs are involved in transcriptional regulation of Ucp1 in response to norepinephrine and cAMP. We also show that a second DNA regulatory element for NF-E2 is located upstream of the CRE2 region. This element, which is found in a similar location in the 5′-flanking region of the human and rodent Ucp1 genes, shows specific binding to rat and human NF-E2 by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts from brown fat. Co-transfections with an Nfe2l2 expression vector and a luciferase reporter construct of the Ucp1enhancer region provide additional evidence that Nfe2l2 is involved in the regulation of Ucp1 by cAMP-mediated signaling.

Each of these animals with increased UCP1 has increased brown fat activity, energy expenditure, and reduced adiposity. Accordingly, determining mechanisms to increase UCP1 has practical applications to the problem of obesity. There are two aspects of Ucp1 expression that require explanation, one is the molecular basis of its unique expression in BAT (5Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the other is its tightly controlled regulation by the hypothalamus via the sympathetic nervous system (17Girardier L.

Recently, it has been shown that synergism between retinoids, isoproterenol, and thiazolidinedione regulate human Ucp1 transcription in an enhancer region located 3.5 kb upstream of the gene (23del Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The brown adipocyte-specific expression of Ucp1 almost certainly involves the interaction of PPARγ, RXR, and PGC1 via the PPRE site. Additional regulatory elements and transcription factors are likely to be involved. The strong evidence that induction is initiated by norepinephrine action on G protein-coupled β1 and β3 adrenergic receptors (24Arch J.R.S. Ainsworth A.T. Cawthorne M.A. Piercy V. Senitt M.V.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that cyclic AMP (cAMP) directly regulates the expression of Ucp1 through the interaction of CREB with putative CREs in the 5′-flanking region of the Ucp1 gene. An alternative mechanism, suggested by Spiegelman and co-workers (27Puigserver P., Wu, Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar, 28Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), postulates that the adrenergic regulation of Ucp1 does not involve CREB binding to Ucp1, rather CREB activatesPgc1 expression by the protein kinase A pathway andUcp1 is subsequently induced by the coactivation of PPARγ by PGC1. However, there is no evidence that CREB is involved in the activation of Pgc1. We only know that Pgc1mRNA levels are increased in BAT in response to cold exposure (27Puigserver P., Wu, Z. Park C.W.

Previous transient transfection analyses utilizing primary cell cultures from a SV40 t-antigen-induced brown adipocyte tumor showed that mutations to two of four half-site CREs in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-reporter construct carrying 3 kb of the 5′-flanking region almost completely abolished expression. These sites, CRE2 and CRE4, were located in the enhancer region and just 5′ of the TATA box region, respectively. Mutations to CRE1 and CRE3 showed only slight reductions in reporter activity. However, it was not established whether these essential half-site CREs bind homodimers of serine 133-phosphorylated CRE-binding protein (CREB) or whether they interacted with heterodimers formed between CREB and novel transcription factors. In this study, we have demonstrated that CRE2 in the enhancer region interacted with CREB using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Furthermore, transient transfection assays of luciferase reporter constructs and site-directed mutagenesis indicates that CREs are involved in transcriptional regulation of theUcp1 through interaction with phosphorylated CREB in response to cold exposure or administration of norepinephrine. We also show that two NF-E2 regulatory motifs, one of which overlaps with the CRE2 motif, bind to Nfe2l2 in a cAMP-dependent manner to control transcription of Ucp1. HIB-1B cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (4,500 mg/literd-glucose, 584 mg/liter l-glutamine, and 15 mg/liter phenol red, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Medium was changed every 2 days. Reporter constructs were transiently transfected into HIB-1B cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The day before transfection, 2 × 105 cells were seeded into a 24-well cluster dish (Corning). Briefly, 0.5 μg of reporter construct was transfected with 50 ng of pRL/SV40 (Promega), a plasmid containingRenilla luciferase gene under control of SV40 promoter, in a mixture of PLUS and LipofectAMINE reagent. For the co-expression experiment, each 0.3 μg of reporter construct and expression vector were transfected with 50 ng of pRL/SV40. Transfected cells were cultured in the medium in the presence or absence 1 μmnorepinephrine (Sigma) or 0.5 mm 8-bromo-cAMP (Calbiochem) for 16 h. Cell extracts were prepared, and the activity ofPhotinus and Renilla luciferase were determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For each construct, the activity of the Photinus luciferase was divided by the activity of the Renilla luciferase to correct for transfection efficiency. Under each treatment, the corrected activity was again divided by activity from pGL3/basic (Promega), the empty vector, to estimate the -fold increase for each construct. The -fold increase for the overexpression experiment was obtained by dividing the corrected activity by the empty vector (pCMV/tag). Each experiment was performed in duplicate dishes. The 3.1 kb of the 5′-flanking region containing the four CRE and the 220-bp BAT-specific enhancer of the mouse Ucp1 gene were obtained by PCR amplification. The 3.85-kb BglI fragment in pGEM, which was previously used in our characterization of Ucp1 (19Kozak U.C. Kopecky J. Teisinger J. Enerback S. Boyer B. Kozak L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (note that nucleotide positions correspond to those in the Ucp1 gene as described in GenBankTMU63418), was used as a template with forward and reverse primers, 5′-ggggtaCCGTGCACACTGCCAAATCATCTC (4379/4355, a new KpnI site is underlined) and 5′-gggagCTCCTGCAGAGCCACCTGGGCTAGG (7514/7538, a newSacI site is underlined), respectively, and subcloned into pGL3/basic using the KpnI and SacI restriction enzyme sites. To obtain the Ucp1 promoter with or without CRE4, forward primers 5′-ggggatccGAGTGACGCGCGGCTGGG (nucleotide sequences for CRE4 are shown as bold and a new BamHI site is underlined, 7261/7278) or 5′-ggggatcCGGCTGGGAGGCTTGCGCA (a new BamHI site is underlined, 7271/7289) and reverse primer 5′-gggaagcttGGGCTAGGTAGTGCCAG (a new HindIII site is underlined, 7504/7520) were used for PCR amplification and subcloned into pGL3/basic using BglII and HindIII restriction enzyme sites. For the 220 bp of BAT-specific enhancer region, the 3.85-kb BglI fragment was PCR amplified using primers 5′-ggggagCTCCTCTACAGCGTCACAGAGG (SacI site is underlined, 4841/4862) and 5′-gggctcgagAGTCTGAGGAAAGGGTTGA (a new XhoI site is underlined, 5025/5045) and subcloned into the luciferase reporter construct containing the Ucp1 promoter (give nucleotide sequences). For the rat Ucp1enhancer region, genomic DNA from rat liver was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-gtgaaccttgctgccgctcctttgc (forward primer, the putative NF-E2 site is underlined, −2519/−2494) and 5′-tgtgatgtcagctcaagacagggag (reverse primer, −2283/−2308) and subcloned into the luciferase reporter construct containing theUcp1 promoter. To generate the mutations in NF-E2 site, primer 5′-gtgaacctgtaggccgctcctttgc (forward primer, the putative NF-E2 site is underlined with mutations shown italic, −2519/−2494) and 5′-tgtgatgtcagctcaagacagggag (reverse primer, −2283/−2308) were used for PCR amplification. The structure of each fragment was verified by DNA sequencing. Nfe2l2 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Ney (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital). A Nfe2l2 expression vector was made by cloning aNotI fragment into the pCMV/tag1 (Stratagene). CRE2 and CRE3 sequences in the 220 bp of the BAT-specific enhancer region were mutated using PCR and subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3/basic. For CRE3 the forward primer was 5′-ggggagCTCCTCTACAGCtgaACAGAGG (CRE3 shown in bold with lowercase italic letters that represent mutations; a new SacI site is underlined, 4841/4862) and the reverse primer was 5′-gggctcgagAGTCTGAGGAAAGGGTTGA (a newXhoI site is underlined, 5025/5045). To mutate CRE2, two pairs of primers were required in separate amplifications. The first pair was 5′-ggggagCTCCTCTACAGCGTCACAGAGG (forward primer, a new SacI site is underlined, 4841/4862) and the 5′-AGTGGAAAGGTtcaGACTAGTTCAG (reverse primer, CRE2 is shown in bold with lowercase italic letters representing mutations, 4883/4907). The second pair was 5′-CTGAACTAGTCtgaACCTTTCCACT (forward primer, CRE2 is shown in bold with lowercase italic letters representing mutations, 4883/4907) and 5′-gggctcgagAGTCTGAGGAAAGGGTTGA (reverse primer, a newXhoI site is underlined, 5025/5045). To generate the 220-bp enhancer region with mutations in CRE2, aliquots (1 μl of each 50 μl PCR reactions) of the two PCR products were mixed and subjected to PCR amplification using primer pairs for intact the 220-bp BAT-specific enhancer region. The resulting mutations were confirmed by sequencing. To mutate both CRE2 and CRE3, the 220-bp fragment, which contains the mutation in CRE2, was subjected to PCR amplification using primer pairs 5′-ggggagCTCCTCTACAGCtgaACAGAGG (CRE3 shown in bold with lowercase italic letters that represent mutated sites; a new SacI site is underlined, 4841/4862) and 5′-gggctcgagAGTCTGAGGAAAGGGTTGA (a new XhoI site is underlined, 5025/5045). After the mutations were verified by sequencing, the DNA fragments containing the mutated sites in CRE2 and/or CRE3 were subcloned into luciferase reporter plasmid containingUcp1 promoter with or without CRE4. Nuclear extracts from various tissues of A/J or C57BL/6J (B6) mice, and HIB-1B cells were prepared as described (35Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), except that phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma) were added. The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (36Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. Hasselberger F.X. Schulz D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 18-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To prepare probes for EMSA, single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified (Operon). 200 pmol each of the complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 100 μl containing 100 mm NaCl to obtain a double-stranded probe. Five μg of nuclear extract (or in vitro translated CREB, Nfe2l2, and p18) were incubated initially for 10 min at room temperature in 29 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1.5 μg of poly(dA-dT), and 5 mmMgCl2. The mixture was then incubated for an additional 20 min after adding 32P-labeled probe (4 × 105 cpm/μl) with or without an unlabeled competitor or antibody for supershift. The antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The reaction was electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was then dried and exposed to a phosphorimage screen. The radioactivity was visualized and quantified using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). Western blot analyses were performed as described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Towbin et al. (38Towbin H. Stachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) with little modification. Cell lysates from HIB-1B cells were prepared by adding SDS sample buffer containing 62.5 mmTris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue with 1% (v/v) phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). After cell lysates were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The blots were then incubated with antibody against CREB (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz), or phospho-CREB (Ser133, 1:1,000 dilution, New England Biolabs), overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxide conjugated, Amersham Biosciences). Bands were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to X-Omat film (Kodak). In vitro protein translation was performed using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturers protocol. The cDNA for CREB and Nfe2l2 was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene) and pCITE4a (Novagen) vectors, respectively, then used for template. The cDNA for p18 was provided by Dr. Paul Ney (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital). To generate 32P-end-labeled probe for the DNase I footprinting assay, pGL3/3.1 kb (20 μg) was digested with theBstEII restriction enzyme. After cleaning up with phenol-chloroform extraction, the 5′ overhang was filled-in with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) and Klenow fragment polymerase (New England Biolabs), and residual nucleotides were removed using the Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. A 286-bp of32P-end-labeled probe containing NF-E2 as well as CRE2 and CRE3 was isolated from DNA digested with XbaI and separated on the 0.8% agarose gel. Eluted DNA was subjected to further purification using Elutip-d (Schleicher & Schu¨ll). Nuclear extracts or in vitro translated CREB were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a probe (15,000 cpm per reaction) in 180 μl of assay buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 ng/ml calf thymus DNA, and 100 mm KCl. 0.05 unit of DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, then incubated another 2 min at 37 °C for DNase digestion. DNA was precipitated by adding 700 μl of DNase I stop solution and separated on sequencing gel with the32P-end-labeled size marker. Four potential CRE sites were located in the 5′-flanking region ofUcp1 (Table I). All four CREs have half-site consensus sequences (CGTCA) and evidence that these sites are involved in the regulation of Ucp1 is limited to loss of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter activity in transient expression assays in a BAT cell line (19Kozak U.C. Kopecky J. Teisinger J. Enerback S. Boyer B. Kozak L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). From this analysis CRE2 and CRE4 appeared to be essential; mutations to CRE1 showed no loss of expression and mutations to CRE3 only slightly reduced expression. This study will largely focus on evaluating the function of CRE2 located in the upstream enhancer (Fig.1). A CRE2 probe for EMSA was made with 5 bp of half-site CRE2 (CGTCA) flanked by 14 bp of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences as shown in Table I. Nuclear extracts, prepared from BAT of newborn mice maintained at room temperature, and BAT, retroperitoneal fat tissue, inguinal fat tissue, and liver of mice kept in the cold (4 °C) overnight, showed a major retarded band that was eliminated by competition with a 20-fold excess of cold CRE2 (specific shifted bands are shown with the dark arrow in Fig.2A). However, probes prepared from the region just downstream of the CRE2 motif failed to form a similar retarded band (data not shown). The complex from liver was ∼10 times stronger than that of other fat tissues (loading for liver was 1/10th of the reaction as indicated in the legend; the second retarded band in liver is nonspecific and can be seen with other probes, data not shown). It is of great interest that the binding activity of nuclear extracts of newborn mice is much greater than that of adult mice (Fig. 2C).Table ISynthetic double-stranded CRE sequences used for electomobility shift assayNameLocationSequencesCRE14419/4437TTATAGTGCCGTCACTAACAATATCACGGCAGTGATTGCRE24884/4902TGAACTAGTCGTCACCTTTACTTGATCAGCAGTGGAAACRE34843/4861CCTCTACAGCGTCACAGAGGGAGATGTCGCAGTGTCTCCRE47258/7276TGGGAGTGACGCGCGGCTGACCCTCACTGCGCGCCGACCRE (Somatostatin)TTGGCTGACGTCAGAGAGAAACCGACTGCAGTCTCTCTmlCRE2AACTAGTCtgaACCTTTTTGATCAGactTGGAAAm2CRE2AACTAtgaGTCACCTTTTTGATactCAGTGGAAAEach DNA containing the half-site CRE motif (CGTCA) from mouseUcp1 or palindromic sequences from the somatostatin gene was annealed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Consensus sequences for CRE are underlined (lowercase letters represent mutations).

To further characterize the binding sites of CRE2, we have performed competitive binding assays with the same mutation, GTC to TGA, in two contiguous locations in the sequence. For the m1CRE2 probe, the mutation occurs in the middle of the half-site CRE motif, whereas the m2CRE2 mutation only overlaps the first C in the CRE motif (Table I). In competitive EMSA, the m1CRE2, but not the m2CRE2 mutant oligonucleotide, has lost the ability to compete with the labeled CRE2 probe (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the half-site CRE motif, but not the flanking 5′-region, is active in binding the specific factor(s). To identify the nuclear factor(s) that bind to CRE2, we applied specific antibodies against Fos, Jun, CBP, or CREB/ATF1 in an EMSA reaction. Because of the sequence similarity of CRE and AP-1-binding sites for the Jun/Fos heterodimer (palindromic CRE, TGACGTCA; palindromic AP-1, TGA(C/G)TCA; half-site CRE sequences are shown underlined) and the known interaction between CREB and CBP, we have tested their antibodies in the supershift assay. The data in Fig. 2A demonstrates that the factors that bind to CRE2 are part of the CREB/ATF1 family. It suggests that CREB/ATF1 does not interact with either jun andfos or CBP. To quantify binding of the four half-site CREs to CREB/ATF1, we measured the ability of each CRE to compete with the C"

Increased concentration of HYAL1-type hyaluronidase correlates with tumor progression and is a marker for grade (G) 2 or 3 bladder cancer. Using bladder tissues and cells, prostate cancer cells, and kidney tissues and performing reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA cloning, DNA sequencing, and in vitro translation, we identified splice variants of HYAL1 and HYAL3. HYAL1v1 variant lacks a 30-amino acid (aa) sequence (301–330) present in HYAL1 protein. HYAL1v1, HYAL1v2 (aa 183–435 present in HYAL1 wild type), HYAL1v3 (aa 1–207), HYAL1v4 (aa 260–435), and HYAL1v5 (aa 340–435) are enzymatically inactive and are expressed in normal tissues/cells and G1 bladder tumor tissues. However, HYAL1 wild type is expressed in G2/G3 tumors and in invasive tumor cells. Stable transfection and HYAL1v1-specific antibody confirmed that the HYAL1 sequence from aa 301 to 330 is critical for hyaluronidase activity. All tumor cells and tissues mainly express HYAL3 variants. HYAL3v1 lacks a 30-aa sequence (299–328) present in HYAL3 protein, that is homologous to the 30-aa HYAL1 sequence. HYAL3v1, HYAL3v2 (aa 251–417 present in HYAL3 wild type), and HYAL3v3 (aa 251–417, but lacking aa 299–328), are enzymatically inactive. Although splicing of a single independent exon generates HYAL1v1 and HYAL3v1, internal exon splicing generates the other HYAL1/HYAL3 variants. These results demonstrate that alternative mRNA splicing controls cellular expression of enzymatically active hyaluronidase and may explain the elevated hyaluronidase levels in bladder/prostate cancer.

HYAL1, HYAL2, and HYAL3 occur on chromosome 3p21.3, and PH20, HYAL4, and HYALP1 occur on chromosome 7q31.3.

We have also shown that elevated levels of HYAL1-type HAase coincide with the presence of angiogenic HA fragments in prostate tumor tissues and in the urine of bladder cancer patients (17Lokeshwar V.B.

HYAL1 type HAase was originally purified from human plasma and urine (28Frost G.I. Csoka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(31Triggs-Raine B. Salo T.J. Zhang H. Wicklow B.A. Natowicz M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6296-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have shown that a lack of functional HYAL1 results in a disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis IX. In this study the authors identified that aa Glu268 is crucial for HYAL1 activity. HYAL2 was originally designated as the lysosomal HAase, and it cleaves high molecular mass HA into ∼20-kDa HA fragments (32Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has a pH optimum of ∼4.0 and is possibly less active than other HAases. HYAL-2 may also be exposed to the cell surface through a GPI anchor (32Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The third HAase gene in the 3p21.3 locus is HYAL3. Although HYAL3 transcripts have been detected in brain and liver tissues, its protein product is uncharacterized (31Triggs-Raine B. Salo T.J. Zhang H. Wicklow B.A. Natowicz M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6296-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence information deposited in GenBankTM HYAL3 is predicted to be made up of either 463 aa (accession number AF040710(gi number 2935327)) or 417 aa (accession number BC012892 (gi number 15277616)).Besides acidic HAases, PH20 (i.e. testicular HAase) is well characterized. PH20 is a sperm surface HAase that has a broad pH activity profile (pH 3.2–9.0) (33Cherr G.N. Yudin A.I. Overstreet J.W. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition to being a HA-degrading enzyme, PH20 may also interact with HA to increase internal calcium, possibly by binding HA through aa 205–235 (34Vines C.A., Li, M.W. Deng X. Yudin A.I. Cherr G.N. Overstreet J.W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 60: 542-552Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This study also revealed that N-glycosylation and intrachain disulfide linkages are important for the HAase activity of PH20 (34Vines C.A., Li, M.W. Deng X. Yudin A.I. Cherr G.N. Overstreet J.W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 60: 542-552Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Recently, the crystal structure of the bee venom HAase has been documented (35Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The bee HAase shares ∼30% sequence identity with human HAases. The crystal structure of bee HAase reveals a classical TIM barrel topology, where the catalytic site corresponds to Asp143 and Glu145 (aa numbering according to GenBankTM accession number AAA27730.1). Glu145is involved the cleavage of the β-1,4 glycosidic bond betweenN-acetyl-d-glucosamine andd-glucuronic acid through an acid-base catalytic mechanism. These Asp and Glu residues are conserved in all mammalian HAases (32Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For example, in HYAL1, the putative catalytic site residues are Asp131 and Glu133, respectively, and in HYAL3, they are Asp127 and Glu129, respectively (according to GenBankTM accession numbers AAD09137.2 andAAH12892.1). Based on the amino acid homology between bee HAase and mammalian HAases and conservation of several aa residues involved in both HA binding (i.e. substrate binding groove) and its catalysis (i.e. active site), a TIM barrel topology and a similar mechanism for the catalytic cleavage of HA are likely for the mammalian HAases (32Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified several mRNA splice variants of HYAL1 and HYAL3 expressed in bladder and prostate cancer cells and in bladder and kidney tissues. These splice variants were characterized in terms of their protein product and HAase activity. We also identified a 30-aa region that is crucial for the HAase activity of HYAL1 and HYAL3 proteins.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have identified a 30-aa sequence that is well conserved in several HAases and is required for enzyme activity of at least two human HAases (i.e. HYAL1 and HYAL3). The nucleotide sequence of HYAL1 gene reveals this gene contains three exons and two introns. Exons 1 (∼1.5 kb) and 3 (0.9 kb) are relatively large compared with exon 2 (90 bp). The HYAL1 genomic sequence shows that the 90-bp sequence (nucleotides 1520–1609) that is missing in HYAL1v1 is the entire exon 2. Other HYAL1 variants appear to be generated by internal exon splicing events that usually involve exon 1. For example, the HYAL1wt described in this study is generated by an internal exon 1 splicing event, involving nucleotides 110 and 596. This splice variant has been described previously (GenBankTMaccession number AF173154). HYAL1v2 appears to be generated by internal exon splicing involving nucleotides 109 and 952 as donor/acceptor sites, respectively, both of which are present in exon 1. Generation of HYAL1v3 variant is interesting in that it involves 2 splicing events. The first is the same internal exon 1 splicing involving nucleotides 110 and 596. The second splicing involves splicing of nucleotide 1239 present in exon 1 to nucleotide 1577 that is present in exon 2. Generation of HYAL1v4 again involves an internal exon splicing event involving exon 1; both the donor (nucleotide 108) and acceptor (nucleotide 1369) sites are present in exon 1. Generation of HYAL1v5 involves internal exon 1 splicing that starts at nucleotide 109 and ends nearly at the end of exon 1 (nucleotide 1519). Thus, the analysis of HYAL1 variants demonstrates that exon 1 in HYAL1 gene has several internal donor and acceptor sites suitable for alternative mRNA splicing resulting in the generation of various HYAL1 splice variants. In addition, exon 2 can be alternatively spliced. It is interesting to note that each of these splicing events (either internal exon splicing or splicing of two exons) maintain the same open reading frame as the HYAL1 protein, resulting in different HYAL1 variant proteins.Our study on HYAL3 splice variants confirms that the 30-aa sequence that is important for enzyme activity is encoded by an independent exon. The nucleotide sequence of HYAL3 gene reveals that this gene contains four exons separated by three introns. Exon 3 is 90 bp in length and corresponds to the 90-bp v1 region (nucleotides 1090–1179). Thus, splicing out of the independent exon 3 generates HYAL3v1. As observed for HYAL1 variants, HYAL3v2 and HYAL3v3 splice variants are generated by an internal exon splicing events that involve exons 2 and 3. For example, HYAL3v2 variant is generated by an internal splicing event involving exon 2 (nucleotides 178–943 are deleted), and HYAL3v3 is generated by the same internal splicing event involving exon 2 and also splicing of the independent exon 3.It is interesting to note that different bladder and lymph node specimens and cells show differences in the pattern and types of HYAL1 and HYAL3 splice variant that are expressed. The reason for this heterogeneity is unknown at present. It is noteworthy that bladder tumors show heterogeneity in their ability to progress and recur. This heterogeneity in turn relates to the differences in the biological behavior of different bladder tumors (41Lee R. Droller M.J. Urol. Clin. North Am. 2000; 27 (, vii): 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It is possible that the heterogeneous expression of the HYAL1 or HYAL3 variant may be related to the different biological behavior of different bladder tumors. Because in both HYAL1 and HYAL3 proteins the loss of the 30-aa sequence results in the loss of HAase activity and because the 30-aa sequence is coded by one single independent exon, the 90-bp-long independent exon in both genes seems to encode an aa sequence that is critical for HAase activity.Other studies involving site-directed mutagenesis of PH20, identification of a naturally occurring mutation in HYAL1, and the crystal structure of bee HAase have identified several aa present in different parts of HAase that are conserved and are important for activity (31Triggs-Raine B.

The crystal structure of bee HAase reveals that the insect and possibly mammalian HAases have a classical (β/α)8 TIM barrel structure (35Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The dominant feature of the HAase structure is a large groove that extends perpendicular to the barrel axis. In bee HAase, loops following the β strands 2, 3, and 4 form one wall of the groove, and those of 1, 5, 6, and 7 form the other wall. This groove is large enough to accommodate a hexasaccharide (35Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U.

Co-crystallization of bee HAase with a hexasaccharide shows that the catalytic site that cleaves the glycosidic bond betweenN-acetyl-d-glucosamine andd-glucuronic acid lies in aa residues Asp143and Glu145 (numbering according to GenBankTMaccession number AAA27730.1). In a substrate-assisted acid-base catalytic mechanism, Glu145 acts as the proton donor, and the N-acetyl group of the substrate acts as the nucleophile. In all human HAases, this Glu residue is conserved along with Asp and is believed to be responsible for substrate cleavage (32Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the HYAL1 sequence this Glu is aa 131 (numbering according to GenBankTM accession number AAD09137.2), and in HYAL3 it is aa 129 (numbering according to GenBankTM accession numberAAH12892.1). Thus, the 30-aa sequence that we have identified in HYAL1 (aa 301–300) and in HYAL3 (aa 299–328) most likely is not a part of the catalytic site.Based on the bee HAase crystal structure, the 30-aa sequence from aa 313 to 342 (Fig. 11), that is homologous to the 30-aa sequences in HYAL1 and HYAL3, forms β sheets 6 and 7, α-helix 8, and the loops in between (35Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because the loops following β strands 6 and 7 are involved in forming one of the walls of the substrate binding groove, loss of the 30-aa sequence in HYAL1 and HYAL3 proteins may result in the loss of substrate binding. The substrate-associated catalytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond betweenN-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-glucuronic acid requires accurate positioning of theN-acetyl side chain of the substrate with respect to the catalytic site (35Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This is achieved by two hydrogen bonding interactions and a hydrophobic interaction. The crystal structure shows that in bee HAase, Trp333 is involved in hydrophobic interaction with the N-acetyl side chain (35Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This Trp333 corresponds to Trp321 in HYAL1 and Trp319 in HYAL3, both of which are present in the respective 30-aa sequences (Fig. 11). This Trp residue is also conserved in all HAases and other chitinolytic enzymes (43Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 44Tews I. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Dijkstra B.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7954-7959Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of this Trp residue in HYAL1v1 and HYAL3v1 mutant proteins may lead to improper positioning of the substrate resulting in no catalysis. It remains to be determined why this 30-aa sequence is so well conserved in various HAases and what role other conserved residues play in terms of substrate binding and catalysis. It should be noted that the loss of β sheets 6 and 7, α-helix 8, and the loops in between, because of the 30-aa deletion in HYAL1v1 and HYAL3v1, may also result in complete loss of the TIM barrel structure, making these proteins enzymatically inactive.Other HYAL1 and HYAL3 variant proteins also illustrate the importance of various structural domains for HAase activity. For example, HYAL1v3 variant, which contains the putative catalytic site (i.e.Asp129 and Glu131) but lacks aa 208–435, has no HAase activity. It is likely that the HYAL1v3 protein does not form a proper TIM barrel structure, and at the very least, it lacks the substrate-binding groove. HYAL1v2 (aa 183–435) and HYAL1v4 (aa 260–435) proteins retain the 30-aa sequence and also Glu268, which has been shown to be critical for HAase activity. However, these variants are enzymatically inactive, because they lack the putative catalytic site as well as parts of the substrate-binding groove. A similar situation may hold true for HYAL3v2 variant (aa 251–435), which also does not have any HAase activity. The variants HYAL1v5 (aa 340–435) and HYAL3v3 (aa 251–435 but lacking aa 299–328) lack more than two-thirds of the respective molecules and hence will not fold properly, lack the HAase catalytic site, and have no substrate binding groove. Thus, this study illustrates the involvement of several structural domains that are conserved in various HAases and are important for enzyme activity.Detection of various HYAL1/HYAL3 variants in bladder and prostate cancer lines, bladder tumor tissues, as well as normal kidney tissue suggest that the expression of functionally active HAase in various cells and tissues may be regulated by alternative mRNA splicing. We have previously shown that HAase levels are elevated (3–7-fold) in the urine of bladder cancer patients who have high grade (i.e.G2/G3) disease (39Pham H.T. Block N.L. Lokeshwar V.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57 (; Correction (1997) Cancer Res.57, 1662): 778-783PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a study of 504 patients, we demonstrated that the HAase level serves as a highly sensitive (82%) and specific (83%) marker for detecting G2/G3 bladder cancer (18Lokeshwar V.B. Obek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Urinary HAase levels together with HA levels (i.e. HA-HAase test) are sensitive and specific in detecting bladder cancer and monitoring its recurrence (18Lokeshwar V.B. Obek C. Pham H.T. Wei D.

We have also shown that both invasive bladder and prostate cancer cells secrete high levels of HAase activity, and HYAL1 is the major HAase expressed in these carcinomas (17Lokeshwar V.B. Rubinowicz D. Schroeder G.L. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Block N.L. Nadji M. Lokeshwar B.L. J. Biol.

Consistent with these observations, in this study we observed that the full-length HYAL1wt transcript that encodes a functional HAase is expressed only in bladder and prostate cancer cells, G2/G3 bladder tumor tissues, and lymph node specimens showing tumor invasion. In normal bladder and G1 bladder tumor tissues, in a normal bladder primary culture, and in bladder tissues showing no evidence of tumor, the major HYAL1 transcript that is expressed is the HYAL1v5 variant. Because this transcript or other HYAL1 variant transcripts (i.e. HYAL1v2-v4) that are also expressed in some of these specimens do not encode a functional HAase, it may explain why in these tissues or cells no HAase activity and wild type HYAL1 protein are detected (30Lokeshwar V.B.

Haqqi T. Markowitz S. Wilson J. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7832-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, because HYAL1 (and also HYAL2 and HYAL3) is present on chromosome 3p 21.3 locus, and this region is a critical tumor homozygous deletion region in lung and breast cancers, it has been suggested that HYAL1 may be a tumor suppressor (7Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 49Frost G.I. Mohapatra G. Wong T.M. Csoka A.B. Gray J.W. Stern R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent study clearly demonstrates that the RASSF1 gene and not HYAL1 is the tumor suppressor gene present in that locus (50Ji L. Nishizaki M. Gao B. Burbee D. Kondo M. Kamibayashi C., Xu, K. Yen N.

Thus, several observations, including elevation of HAase levels in bladder and prostate tumors (18Lokeshwar V.B. Obek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J.

Decreases in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and levels of dopamine and its metabolites were observed 1 day after MPTP discontinuance. Ascorbic acid and glutamate levels had increased, dehydroascorbic acid and GSH decreased, whereas catabolites of high-energy phosphates (inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid) were unchanged. In addition, gliosis was observed in both striatum and substantia nigra compacta (SNc). Sections of SNc showed some terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. Neurochemical parameters of dopaminergic activity showed a trend toward recovery 3 days after MPTP discontinuance. At this time point, TUNEL-positive cells were detected in SNc; some of them showed nuclei with neuronal morphology. A late (days 6–11) increase in striatal dopamine oxidative metabolism, ascorbic acid oxidative status, and catabolites of high-energy phosphates were observed concomitant with nigral neuron and nigrostriatal glial cell apoptotic death, as revealed by TUNEL, acridine orange, and Hoechst staining, and transmission electron microscopy. These data suggest that MPTP-induced activation/apoptotic death of glial cells plays a key role in the sequential linkage of neurochemical and cellular events leading to dopaminergic nigral neuron apoptotic death.

Consequently, the functioning of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is impaired. Although cellular and molecular pathways leading to neuronal death in PD are still unknown, major biochemical processes such as oxidative stress and impaired energy metabolism are involved (for review, see Ref. 1Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces in man a clinical syndrome closely resembling PD and is widely employed as a Parkinson's disease model in experimental animals (2Bloem B.R. Irwin I. Buruma O.J.S. Haan J. Roos R.A.C. Tetrud J.W. Langston J.W. J. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 97: 273-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Astrocytes are the primary site of bioactivation of the innocuous MPTP to the toxic metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium ion (MPP+) via the monoamine oxidase-dependent formation of a dihydropyridinium intermediate (3Di Monte D.A., Wu, E.Y. Irwin I. Delanney L.E. Langston J.W. Glia. 1992; 5: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The dihydropyridinium intermediate is a reactive radical that undergoes autoxidation with formation of superoxide anion (O2O) and MPP+. In addition, the dihydropyridinium intermediate readily crosses the cellular membrane and undergoes autoxidation also in the extracellular space to form additional O2O and MPP+ (3Di Monte D.A., Wu, E.Y. Irwin I. Delanney L.E. Langston J.W. Glia. 1992; 5: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MPTP-induced hydroxyl radical formation in the striatum and substantia nigra of the mouse has been shown in vivo (4Muralikrishnan D. Mohanakumar K.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 905-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in addition, MPP+ alone promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation (5Obata T. Chiueh C.C. J.

MPTP/MPP+-induced neuronal death has been widely demonstrated in experimental animals, including rodents (8Turski L. Bressler K. Retting K.J. Lo¨schman P.A. Wachtel H. Nature. 1991; 349: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 9Tatton N.A. Kish S.J. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1037-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The mode of neuronal death has been extensively studied in vitro. MPTP and MPP+ induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells (10Sheehan J.P. Palmer P.E. Helm G.A. Tuttle J.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), dopaminergic cell cultures (11Hartley A. Stone J.M. Heron C. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H.V. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1987-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Chun H.S. Gibson G.E. Degiorgio L.A. Zhang H. Kidd V.E. Son J.H. J.

Int. 1997; 31: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Only a few reports, however, have addressed the mode of MPTP-induced neuronal death in vivo. It has been demonstrated in mice (9Tatton N.A. Kish S.J. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1037-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) that MPTP can induce necrotic or apoptotic neuronal death according to the dosage schedule. Recent histological studies performed on brains from Parkinsonian patients suggest that nigral cell death could be apoptotic (14Mochizuki H. Goto K. Mori H. Mizuno Y. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 137: 120-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 15Anglade P. Vyas S. Javoy-Agid F. Herrero M.T. Michel P.P. Marquez J. Mouatt-Prigent A. Ruberg M. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar). However, apoptotic degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD disease is still a controversial issue (for review, see Ref. 16Hartmann A. Hirsch E.C. Adv. Neurol. 2001; 86: 143-153PubMed Google Scholar). MPTP, besides damaging nigrostriatal neurons, induces glial activation (17Francis J.W. Von Visger J. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1995; 17: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Glia plays a key role in the antioxidant defense of the brain (18Wilson J.X. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar); in addition, dopaminergic neurons in SNc, which degenerate in PD, can be maintained by the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (19Lapchak P.A. Mov. Disord. 1998; 13: 49-54PubMed Google Scholar). Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor induces both protective and restorative effects on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of MPTP-treated mice (20Tomac A. Lindqvist E. Lin L.F. Ogren S.O. Young D. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Nature. 1995; 373: 333-335Crossref Scopus (993) Google Scholar) and monkeys (21Gash D.M. Zhang Z. Ovadia A. Cass W.A., Yi, A. Simmerman L. Russell D. Martin D. Lapchak P.A. Collins F. Hoffer B.J. Gerhardt G.A Nature. 1996; 380: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). All these findings suggest that glia plays an important role in protecting the functioning of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system from MPTP toxicity. In reality, there is evidence suggesting that alterations in glial functioning may be an important contributor to the pathologic process that occurs in PD (22Banati R.B. Daniel S.E. Blunt S.B. Mov. Disord. 1998; 13: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 23Jenner P. Olanov C.W. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44 Suppl. 3: S72-S84Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine: (i) whether MPTP might produce cell damage in nigrostriatal glial cells of the mouse besides that in dopaminergic neurons; (ii) whether the eventual cellular damage might be characteristic of changes leading to apoptosis; (iii) whether neuronal and glial damage might be correlated with MPTP-induced striatal neurochemical changes. Experiments were conducted on 3-month-old Swiss mice (Morini strain, Reggio Emilia, Italy), body weight 20–25 g, maintained, under standard animal care conditions, on a 12-h day/night cycle and given food and water ad libitum. All studies were carried out in accordance with the European EC Directive 86/609 included in the Decreto number 116/1992 of the Italian Ministry of the Public Health. MPTP (HCl) was purchased by Research Biochemical International, Natick, MA; l-dihydroxyphenilalanine (l-DOPA), tyrosine, dihydropteridine reductase, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine, and nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form, were purchased by Sigma. Groups of 8 mice per time period received an intraperitoneal injection of MPTP-HCl, 30 mg/kg/day, at 24-h intervals on 5 consecutive days. This dosage is below that producing necrotic cell death (9Tatton N.A. Kish S.J. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1037-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The control group (n= 11) was given a vehicle (saline, 2 ml/kg intraperitoneal). Mice were killed by decapitation at 1, 3, 6, 11, and 14 days after the last MPTP injection. Controls were killed after the last MPTP group. Heads were cooled by rapid immersion in liquid nitrogen. Thereafter, striata and SNc of both sides were rapidly removed as previously described (24Desole M.S. Miele M. Esposito G. Fresu L. Migheli R. Zangani D. Sircana S. Grella G. Miele E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1995; 51: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Whereas striata of the left side were frozen at −80 °C for subsequent HPLC determination of neurochemicals (24Desole M.S. Miele M. Esposito G. Fresu L. Migheli R. Zangani D. Sircana S. Grella G. Miele E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1995; 51: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), striata and SNc of the right side were fixed with a freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution (4% in PBS, pH 7.4) for light microscopy. Left SNc were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodilate buffer for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After extensive washing, the fixed tissue fragments were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, then passed in xylene and embedded in paraffin. Specimens (5–7 μm) were washed in xylene and rehydrated according to standard protocols. Sections were either stained with hematoxylin/eosin, or used for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL); some sections were processed for fluorescence microscopy and therefore fluorochromized with acridine orange (AO) or Hoechst 33342. Striatal and nigral sections were incubated, after rehydration, with proteinase K (20 μg/ml in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4–8) for 15 min at 21 °C. The blocking of endogenous peroxidase was performed with a solution of 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Sections were permeabilized by incubation with a solution of Triton X-100 0.1% in PBS and incubated with fluorescein-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Thereafter, sections were stained by an antifluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and subsequently incubated with diaminobenzidine substrate to produce a dark brown precipitate. Stained sections were analyzed under light microscopy. Astrocytes within the SNc were identified by means of GFAP immunocytochemistry. GFAP is the major component of intermediate filaments of astrocytes and is a common marker for astrocytes. Rehydrated sections were preincubated for 30 min with 0.1 mPBS containing 20% horse serum and 0.01 m Tween 20. Sections were incubated with: (i) a monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (1:400, DAKO) overnight at room temperature; (ii) biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody (DAKO) for 30 min at room temperature; (iii) buffer containing 3% H2O2 to inactivate the endogenous peroxidases; (iv) alkaline phosphatase-labeled avidin (1:100) for 30 min at room temperature. Between incubation steps, sections were washed 3 times in 0.1 m PBS containing 0.001m Tween 20. Phosphatase was visualized by fast red. At this point, sections were incubated with fluorescein-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to characterize the apoptotic nucleus. Thereafter, sections were stained by an anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and subsequently incubated with diaminobenzidine substrate to produce a dark brown precipitate. A series of stained sections were analyzed under light microscopy. Striatal and nigral sections were defatted (9Tatton N.A. Kish S.J. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 1037-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) in Tris-buffered phenol for 25 min followed by 10 min in chloroform/methanol (1:1). Sections were rinsed in 100% ethanol for 2 min, air dried, and then rinsed in freshly made 1% glacial acetic acid for 1 min followed by distilled water for 1 min. Sections were kept for 30 s in a 0.01% solution of AO in PBS (pH 6.2), rinsed in PBS with mild agitation, and then mounted in 95% glycerol in PBS for immediate viewing under excitation at 488 nm on a Nikon Optiphot microscope. Double-stranded DNA complexes with AO to emit maximally at 530 nm as a bright green fluorescence, whereas single-stranded RNA emits maximally at 640 nm as a bright orange-red fluorescence. Rehydrated sections were rinsed in PBS and then fluorochromized with Hoechst 33342 (5 μ g/ml in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature. The specimens were observed with an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Optiphot). Gliosis was assessed by means of hematoxylin/eosin staining of rehydrated sections of striatum and SNc, using routine protocol. The presence of some morphological features, such as enlarged and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and the presence of lengthened eosinophilic structures (Rosenthal fibers) were considered as a histopathological index of gliosis (25Eng F.L. Lee Y.L. Kwan H. Brenner M. Messing A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amount of both enlarged nuclei and Rosenthal fibers/microscopic field allowed us to quantify gliosis. Fragments from SNc were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 3 h at 4 °C and washed with the same buffer containing 7% sucrose; the specimens were then post-fixed in 1% OsO4 for 2 h at 4 °C and washed repeatedly in buffer. Thereafter, specimens were dehydrated in acetone, passed through propylene oxide, and finally embedded in epoxy resin (agar 100). Ultrathin section (60 nm) were collected on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The specimens were observed with a Zeiss EM 109 at 50 kV. Dopamine, DOPAC, HVA, 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), glutamate, inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid determinations were performed by HPLC according to methods previously described (24Desole M.S.

Esposito G. Delogu M.R. Migheli R. Rocchitta G. Miele M. Aging Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 12: 470-477Crossref Google Scholar). GSH was determined according to the enzymatic recycling method of Anderson (27Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 348-355Google Scholar). Striata of the left side were weighed and homogenized in 1%meta-H3PO4 containing 1 mm edta. After centrifugation (17,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was divided into five aliquots. The first was filtered and immediately injected into the HPLC system for dopamine, DOPAC, HVA, 3-MT, ascorbic acid, and uric acid determinations. HPLC with electrochemical detection was done with a high-pressure pump Varian 9001 with a Rheodyne injector, 15 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter TSK-ODS-80 TM column, electrochemical detector BAS LC-4B, and integrator Spectra Physics SP 4290. The mobile phase 0.1m was citric acid, 0.1 mK2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% MeOH, and 70 mg/liter sodium octylsulfate (pH 3.0), the flow rate was 1.2 ml/min and 10 μl of sample were injected. The second aliquot was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 45% K2HPO4 and 1%dl-homocysteine was added to reduce DHAA to ascorbic acid. The sample was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, then adjusted to pH 3.0 with 30% meta-H3PO4, filtered, and injected (20 μl) for total ascorbic acid determination. DHAA concentration was calculated from the difference in ascorbic acid content between the first and second aliquot. The third aliquot was processed for GSH determination (26Desole M.S. Serra P.A. Esposito G. Delogu M.R. Migheli R. Rocchitta G. Miele M. Aging Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 12: 470-477Crossref Google Scholar). Glutamate determinations were performed, on 20 μl of the fourth aliquot, by HPLC with fluorimetric detection with a Varian model 9010 gradient system (at 360 and 450 nm excitation and emission wavelengths) following derivatization witho-phthalaldehyde. Briefly, derivatized amino acids were separated on a Ultrasphere C18 high speed 75 × 4.6-mm Beckman column. A gradient was run from 26 mmNa2HPO4/acetonitrile (95:5) (pH 6.6 with H3PO4) to Na2HPO4/acetonitrile (70:30) in 20 min at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. On the fifth aliquot, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine determinations were performed (26Desole M.S. Serra P.A. Esposito G. Delogu M.R. Migheli R. Rocchitta G. Miele M. Aging Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 12: 470-477Crossref Google Scholar) directly by injecting 50 μl of the filtered supernatant using the above high-pressure pump, column ODS-80 TM and a similar precolumn, UV detector (254 nm), and integrator. The mobile phase was composed of two eluants: K2HPO4/MeOH (97:3). TH activity was assessed by measuring tyrosine conversion to l-DOPA, according to Pothos et al. (28Pothos E.N. Przedborski S. Davila V. Schmitz Y. Sulzer D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5575-5585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Groups of 3 mice per time period were given MPTP according to the above treatment schedule. Controls were given saline intraperitoneally. Mice were killed by decapitation at 1, 3, and 6 days after the last MPTP injection. Heads were cooled by rapid immersion in liquid nitrogen. Thereafter, striata of both sides of each animal were rapidly removed, pooled, weighed, and homogenized in 10 volumes of (w/v) ice-cold 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.0), containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v). Protein content was determined on a 50-μl aliquot of the homogenate according to Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the remainder was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. TH activity in the supernatant was determined at the incubation conditions as describe by Coyle (30Coyle J.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1972; 21: 1935-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Fifty μl of the supernatant were added to 16-ml tubes containing the following reaction mixture: 10 μl of 1 mKH2PO4 buffer (pH 5.5), 1.100 units of catalase in 10 μl of distilled water, 5 μl of 6.4 mm2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine (freshly prepared in 0.005 m HCl), 10 μl of dihydropteridine reductase, 5 μl of 0.01 m nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form, 10 μl of 0.1 m mercaptoethanol, and 10 μl of 3 mm FeSO4. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 2.0 mm tyrosine; the reaction mixtures was incubated for 10, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C. Experiments were done in triplicate. TH activity was assessed by HPLC-EC determination (as described above) of l-DOPA formed. The percentage variation was calculated on the basis of the total amount ofl-DOPA formed at the 3 incubation time points indicated above. All values were expressed in nanomole or picomole of milligrams/protein and given as mean ± S.E. Biochemical data were analyzed using ANOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls’st test post-hoc analysis. In some instances (TH activity) unpaired t test was also used. Striatal dopamine and DOPAC + HVA levels had significantly decreased by about 58 and 60%, respectively, as compared with controls (Fig.1, panel A); the (DOPAC + HVA)/dopamine ratio, which is a reliable index of dopamine turnover, did not statistically differ from controls (Fig. 1, panel C). 3-MT levels, which can be assumed to be an index of dopamine release (31Westerink B.H.C. Spaan S.J. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), had significantly decreased by about 38% (Fig. 1,panel B). All these changes denote an impairment of the functioning of the dopaminergic system and may be related to the MPTP-induced decrease of TH activity (32Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In fact, striatal TH activity, assessed by measuring tyrosine conversion tol-DOPA, had reduced by about 80%, as compared with controls (Fig. 2). Ascorbic acid (+15%) and glutamate (+33%) levels had significantly increased, whereas GSH (−28%) and DHAA (−33%) levels decreased. The DHAA/ascorbic acid ratio, which can be assumed to be a reliable index of the ascorbic acid oxidative status and ROS formation (33Noack H. Lindenau J. Rothe F. Asayama K. Wolf G. Glia. 1998; 23: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), had decreased by about 38% (Fig. 3, panels A–D). Inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid levels, as well as the inosine/hypoxanthine ratio, were in the range of control values (Fig.4, panels A–D). It is widely accepted that increases in regional brain inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid levels reflect degradation of intracellular high-energy phosphates (26Desole M.S. Serra P.A. Esposito G. Delogu M.R. Migheli R. Rocchitta G. Miele M. Aging Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 12: 470-477Crossref Google Scholar, 34Hillered L. Kotwica Z. Ungerstedt U. Res. Exp. Med. 1991; 191: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of changes in compounds associated with high-energy phosphate degradation denotes that at this time point MPTP did not yet induce energy failure.Figure 2TH activity in the striatum of mice at different days after MPTP discontinuance.

A metastable three-site complex LER progresses into a more stable type 0 complex in which a tetrameric transposase is poised for DNA cleavage. ""Difference topology"" has revealed five trapped negative supercoils within type 0, three contributed by crossings of E with L and R, and two by crossings of L with R. This is the most complex DNA arrangement seen to date within a recombination synapse. Contrary to the prevailing notion, the enhancer appears not to be released immediately following type 0 assembly. Difference topology provides a simple method for determining the ordered sequestration of DNA segments within nucleoprotein assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2055998837,"The tumor suppressor ARF is transcribed from the INK4a/ARF locus in partly overlapping reading frames with the CDK inhibitor p16Ink4a. ARF is able to antagonize the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53, leading to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the cellular context. However, recent data point to additional p53-independent functions of mouse p19ARF. Little is known about the dependency of human p14ARF function on p53 and its downstream genes. Therefore, we analysed the mechanism of p14ARF-induced cell cycle arrest in several human cell types. Wild-type HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (p53+/+p21CIP1+/+ 14-3-3σ+/+), but not p53−/− counterparts, underwent G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest following infection with a p14ARF-adenovirus. In p21CIP1−/− cells, p14ARF did not induce G1 or G2 arrest, while 14-3-3σ−/− counterparts were mainly arrested in G1, pointing to essential roles of p21CIP1 in G1 and G2 arrest and cooperative roles of p21 and 14-3-3σ in ARF-mediated G2 arrest. Our data demonstrate a strict p53 and p21CIP1 dependency of p14ARF-induced cell cycle arrest in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2031011785,"The binding and signaling properties of neuronal NTS2 neurotensin (NT) receptors were examined in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells. As shown by reverse transcription-PCR, receptor autoradiography, and confocal microscopic localization of fluorescent NT, these cells selectively express the NTS2 receptor subtype. Accordingly, a single apparent class of125I-NT-binding sites, with an affinity of 3.1 nm, was detected in cerebellar granule cell cultures. This binding was competed for with high affinity (IC50 = 5.7 nm) by the NTS2 ligand levocabastine and with low affinity (IC50 = 203 nm) by the NTS1 antagonist SR48692. Hypertonic acid stripping of surface-bound ligand and hyperosmolar sucrose treatment revealed that 64% of specifically bound125I-NT was internalized at equilibrium via a clathrin-dependent pathway. In cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fluo4, SR48692, but neither NT nor levocabastine, triggered a marked increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]i. By contrast, both NT and levocabastine, but not SR48692, induced a sustained (>60 min) activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, p42/p44, indicating functional coupling of NTS2 receptors. Complementary experiments carried out on synaptosomes from adult rat cerebellum demonstrated the presence of presynaptic NTS2 receptors. However, in contrast to perikaryal NTS2 sites, these presynaptic receptors did not internalize in response to NT stimulation.

Checler F. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Rev. Clin. Basic Pharm. 1985; 5: 397-486PubMed Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, NT has been shown to modulate dopamine transmission in nigrostrial and mesolimbic pathways (2Nemeroff C.B. Biol. Psychiatry. 1980; 15: 283-302PubMed Google Scholar) and to play a role in the regulation of pain, temperature, appetite, and pituitary hormone secretion (for review see Ref. 3Rostene W.H. Alexander M.J. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 18: 115-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). NT exerts its central and peripheral effects through interaction with specific membrane receptors. Three different subtypes of NT receptors, referred to as NTS1, NTS2, and NTS3, have been cloned (for review see Ref. 4Vincent J. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Although most of the documented effects of NT appear to be exerted through the high affinity, NTS1 receptor, recent studies suggest that the levocabastine-sensitive, low affinity NTS2 subtype may be responsible for the mediation of the antinociceptive actions of NT (5Dubuc I. Sarret P. Labbe-Jullie C. Botto J.M. Honore E. Bourdel E. Martinez J. Costentin J. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. Mazella J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 503-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, whereas the binding and internalization properties of NTS2 have been characterized in astrocytes (14Nouel D. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), nothing is known of its pharmacological and functional properties in neurons. NT, levocabastine, and the NTS1 antagonist SR48692 were all found to induce an inward calcium-activated chloride current inXenopus oocytes transfected with cDNA encoding the mouse NTS2 receptor (7Mazella J. Botto J.M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5613-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Botto J.M. Guillemare E. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 223: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By contrast, SR48692, but neither NT nor levocabastine, was capable of activating classical second messenger systems, including Ca2+ mobilization, inositol phosphate (InsPs) production, or MAPK phosphorylation in mammalian cells transfected with human NTS2 (16Vita N. Oury-Donat F. Chalon P. Guillemot M. Kaghad M. Bachy A. Thurneyssen O. Garcia S. Poinot-Chazel C. Casellas P. Keane P., Le Fur G. Maffrand J.P. Soubrie P. Caput D. Ferrara P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 360: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of SR48692 were blocked by NT and levocabastine, suggesting that these drugs could act as competitive antagonists at NTS2 sites (16Vita N. Oury-Donat F. Chalon P.

Yet mouse NTS2 receptors expressed in transfected epithelial cells were reported to internalize upon NT binding (17Botto J.M. Chabry J. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a property usually associated with activation by agonists. The aim of the present study was to characterize the binding, internalization, and signaling properties of NTS2 receptors in central neurons and to determine whether NT is agonist or antagonist at these sites. These properties were tested on rat cerebellar granule cells, because these cells express among the highest concentrations of NTS2 mRNA in the brain (10Sarret P. Beaudet A. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 394: 344-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and can be maintained for several weeks in culture (18Gonzalez B. Leroux P. Lamacz M. Bodenant C. Balazs R. Vaudry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9627-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a feature required by the late ontogenetic appearance of the receptor. We also examined the pharmacological properties of NTS2 receptors in synaptosomes from adult rat cerebellum to discriminate putative presynaptic from post-synaptic features. All of the animal-related procedures were approved by the McGill and Sherbrooke University Animal Care Committees and carried out according to the regulations of the Canadian Council on animal care. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g; Charles Rivers, St. Constant, Canada) were killed by decapitation, and their brains were rapidly frozen by immersion in liquid isopentane at −40 °C for 30 s. The brains were then deposited on dry ice for 10 min and stored at −80 °C until use. Sagittal sections (20 μm thick) were cut on a cryostat at −18 °C, mounted onto polylysine-coated slides, and stored at −20 °C for at least 24 h before further processing. For 125I-Tyr3-neurotensin (125I-NT) labeling, the sections were equilibrated at 4 °C for 5 min in ice-cold binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, and 0.2% BSA). They were then incubated with 8 nm125I-NT (100 Ci/mmol) (kindly provided by Dr. Jean Mazella, Sophia-Antipolis, France), with or without 1 μm levocabastine, for 60 min at 4 °C in 125 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 0.8 mm1,10-phenanthroline. Additional sections were incubated in the presence of 10−5m unlabeled NT for the determination of nonspecific binding. After incubation, the sections were washed twice for 2 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% BSA and again twice for 2 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Autoradiographs were obtained by apposition of 125I-labeled sections to βmax hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 weeks at room temperature in a light-proof x-ray cassette. Films were scanned using an AGFA Duoscan T1200 scanner at 1200 pixels/inch resolution. The resulting TIFF files were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and Deneba Canvas 7 imaging software on an Apple PowerBook G3. Primary cultures of mixed cerebellar cells were prepared as described by Cambray-Deakin (19Cambray-Deakin MA Cohen J. Wilkin G.P. Neural Cell Culture: A Pratical Approach.

The tissue was transferred to buffer A (0.25 mg/ml trypsin and 200 μl of solution 4 (BSA fraction V (150 mg/ml), 0.7m glucose, 75 mmMgSO4·7H2O) in 10 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution) and incubated for 15 min in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Buffer B (0.4 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 200 μl of solution 4, 25 units of DNase I, and 6 mmMgSO4·7H2O in 10 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution) was then added to the tissue mixture, and the suspension was centrifuged for 10 s at 180 × g to pellet the tissue chunks. The cells were then dispersed mechanically by repeated gentle pipetting through a sterile siliconized Pasteur pipette in 1.5 ml of buffer C (0.4 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 200 μl of solution 4, 75 units of DNase I, and 6 mmMgSO4·7H2O in 10 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution). After 1–2 min of settling time, the supernatant was passed through a 4% BSA gradient and then centrifuged at 180 ×g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was suspended in culture medium (minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum, 0.4 mml-glutamine, 1.2 mg/ml glucose, 0.36 mg/ml KCl, and 0.25% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)) and seeded into Petri dishes precoated with poly-d-Lysine (0.1 mg/ml) at an initial plating density of 1000 cells/mm2. The cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2, at 37 °C and used for experiments after 20 days in culture. Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cerebellar granule cells as well as from adult rat brain using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). These total RNAs (2 μg) were then reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h using 1 μg of oligo(dt)15 primer (reverse transcription system kit; Promega) and 30 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a total volume of 20 μl of the supplied buffer. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. First strand cDNAs were subjected to 35 cycles of PCR in 25 μl of a final reaction volume containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% BSA, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5 unit ofTaq DNA polymerase, and 100 ng of either one of the following three pairs of sense and antisense primers. The first pair (5′-ACACCCATTGTGGACACAGCC-3′ and 5′-TTCATCCGAGATATAGCAGAA-3′) allowed the amplification of a fragment of NTS1 receptor cDNA from bases 676–1011 in the sequence reported previously (21Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 847-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The predicted size of the amplified fragment was 335 bp. The second pair (5′-GAATGTGCTGGTGTCCTTCGC-3′ and 5′-ACTTGTATTTCTCCCAGGCTG-3′) allowed amplification of a fragment of NTS2 receptor cDNA from bases 667–1287 in the sequence reported previously (22Chalon P. Vita N. Kaghad M. Guillemot M. Bonnin J. Delpech B., Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Caput D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The predicted sizes of the amplified fragments were 620 bp for NTS2 and 439 bp for the splice variant form of this receptor (23Botto J.M. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The third pair (5′-TCCCGAGAACTCTGGAAAGGT-3′ and 5′-CACAGAGGCGAAGAGGAAACG-3′) allowed amplification of a fragment of NTS3 receptor cDNA from bases 255–681 in the sequence reported previously (24Morris N.J.

The predicted size of the amplified fragment was 426 bp. Amplification was carried out with a first cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, 52 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by 34 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 8 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. In all of the reverse transcription experiments, two types of controls were performed: 1) each total RNA sample was subjected to reverse transcription (RT) in the absence of enzyme to control for intrinsic contamination by genomic DNA, and 2) the reaction was performed on the RT mixture without RNA added to control for contamination during the experiment. To determine the binding parameters of 125I-NT to cultured granule cells and to investigate whether specifically bound125I-NT was internalized in these cells, three sets of binding experiments were carried out. For saturation studies, the culture medium was discarded from 12-mm dishes containing 2 × 105 cells, and the cells were equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C in Earle's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 0.1% BSA. Equilibration buffer was then replaced by 250 μl of Earle's buffer containing 0.1–16 nm of 125I-NT isotopically diluted with unlabeled NT in the presence of 0.8 mm 1,10-phenanthroline for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of equilibration buffer and harvested with 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. The associated radioactivity was then counted in a γ counter. Dissociation constant (K d) and maximal binding capacity (B max) were derived from Scatchard analysis of the data. The competition experiments were carried out on membranes freshly prepared from cerebellar granule cells. For this purpose, the cells were scraped off the culture dishes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged in microcentrifuge tubes at 15,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized by incubation in hypotonic TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and sonicated. The membrane homogenates were then recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The cell membranes (50 μg) were incubated with 2 nm125I-NT (100 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 25 °C in 250 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% BSA and 0.8 mm 1–10 phenanthroline) in the presence of increasing concentrations (from 10−11to 10−5m) of nonradioactive NT,Nα-Bodipy-NT-(2–13), levocabastine (kindly provided by Janssen Research, Beerse, Belgium) (6Schotte A. Leysen J.E. Laduron P.M. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 333: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), or SR48692 (kindly provided by Sanofi Research, Toulouse, France) (25Gully D. Canton M. Boigegrain R. Jeanjean F. Molimard J.C. Poncelet M. Gueudet C. Heaulme M. Leyris R. Brouard A. Pelaprat D. Labbe-Jullie C. Mazella J. Soubrie P. Maffrand J.P. Rostene W. Kitabgi P. Le Fur G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The binding experiments were terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold buffer followed by filtration through cellulose acetate filters (Sartorius). The filters were then washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer, and the radioactivity retained in them was counted in a γ counter. The IC50 values were determined from inhibition curves as the unlabeled ligand concentration inhibiting 50% of125I-NT-specific binding. To investigate 125I-NT internalization, whole cells were incubated with 0.4 nm125I-NT in Earle's buffer, with or without 0.45 m sucrose, for 45 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice either with 1 ml of Earle's buffer or with 1 ml of a hypertonic acid buffer (Earle's buffer containing 0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4) for 3 min to strip off surface-bound radioactivity. The cells were then harvested with 1 ml of 0.1m NaOH, and associated radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding, as measured in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled NT, represented less than 5% of the total binding. All of the binding/internalization data were calculated and plotted using Prism 3.02 (Graph Pad Software) and represent the means ± S.D. of n determinations (as indicated under “Results”). For fluo-NT labeling, the cerebellar granule cells were grown on 12-mm polylysine-treated glass coverslips in 18-mm Petri dishes. The cells were equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C in Earle's buffer containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% glucose and then incubated for 10 or 40 min in the same buffer with 20 nm fluo-NT (kindly provided by PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of 10−5m nonfluorescent NT, 10−5m levocabastine, or 10−5mSR48692. To determine whether fluo-NT internalization proceeded through clathrin-coated pits, a second set of experiments was performed on whole cells by leaving them untreated or adding 0.45m sucrose, 10 μm phenylarsine oxide (Sigma) or 1 μm monodansylcadaverine (Sigma) to both the equilibration and binding buffers. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice either with binding buffer or with hypertonic acid buffer (pH 4) for 3 min. The cells were then either air-dried and mounted on glass slides with Aquamount or further processed for immunocytochemistry as described below. To identify cell types and intracellular compartments in which fluo-NT had been internalized, fluo-NT-incubated granule cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing the cross-linking agent Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (5 mm; Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with Earle's buffer, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), preincubated with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 2% BSA for 20 min, rinsed again with PBS, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with one of the following mouse antibodies: anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200; Sigma), anti-neurofilament (N52; 1:200; Sigma), and anti-syntaxin 6 (3 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories). All of the primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.5% normal goat serum and 0.02% Triton X-100. After rinsing three times (5 min each time) with PBS, bound primary antibodies were revealed with goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate (diluted 1:50 in PBS) or to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes; diluted 1:500 in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Aquamount and examined with either a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped for epifluorescence using a B-1E fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (Nikon, Mississauga, Canada) or a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (CLSM 410) equipped with an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope and an argon/krypton laser. To determine the proportion of neurons endowed with NTS2 receptors, the percentage of N52-immunoreactive neurons exhibiting fluo-NT labeling was determined in 12 wells from three different experiments (total of 425 neurons counted), and the results were expressed as the means ± S.E. For intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurements, the cells were cultured for 21 days on plastic coverslips (Sartstedt, St-Laurent, Canada) and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 μmfluo-4/acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with 0.5% BSA and further incubated in PBS-HEPES (140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.35) at 37 °C for 30 min to allow for hydrolysis of the acetoxymethyl ester form. The coverslips were then mounted on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. The cells were maintained at 37 °C throughout the experiments with a heating Peltier element. NT, levocabastine, and SR48692 diluted in 1 ml of fresh PBS-HEPES were added to the incubation medium, individually or in combination, at concentrations of 10−8–10−6m. Images were acquired each 10 s using a CoolSnap fx digital CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) cooled at −35 °C. Band pass filters were used for excitation and emission (450–490 and 520–560 nm, respectively). Average intensity for each cell was measured on-line using the Metafluor software package (Universal Imaging Corp, West Chester, PA). Further analyses were performed with the Metafluor software on images stocked on the hard disc of an IBM-compatible computer. Each Ca2+ curve represents the average response (± S.D.) of n cells as indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was verified using Student's ttest. The experiments were performed as described previously (26Gallo-Payet N. Guillon G. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown for 21 days in minimum essential culture medium containing 10% horse serum and labeled for 18 h with fresh medium containing 5 μCi/ml of myo-[3H]inositol. The radioactive medium was then discarded, and the cells were incubated in isotope-free culture medium. After 1 h, the cultures were equilibrated for 15 min in Hanks' balanced salts solution with glucose and LiCl (10 mm). The stimulation was performed for 15 min using NT (10−7 and 10−6m), levocabastine (10−7 and 10−6m), SR48692 (10−7 and 10−6m), or fluoroaluminate. The incubation was stopped by aspiration of the medium and rapid addition of 1 ml of 5% (v/v) HClO4 and 200 μl of BSA (20 mg/ml). InsPs were separated by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 1 × 8 columns. The radioactivity incorporated in the InsPs fractions was determined by scintillation counting in gel phase in a Beckman β counter, with a counting efficiency of 18%. The values correspond to the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Cultured granule cells (21 days post-plating) were incubated for various time intervals (from 1 to 120 min) at 37 °C in culture medium in the presence of NT (10−8 and 10−7m), levocabastine (10−6m), or SR48692 (10−7 and 10−6m). The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium and the addition of Hanks' balanced salt solution with glucose containing 0.1 μm staurosporine and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate. The cells were then lysed at 4 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 μm staurosporine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostic Laboratories). The cell extracts were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −20 °C until use. Equal amounts of proteins (30 μ g) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The Western blots were performed as described previously (27Gendron L. Laflamme L. Rivard N. Asselin C. Payet M. Gallo-Payet N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Diagnostic Laboratories) containing proteins were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-phosphorylated p42/p44mapk (dilution 1:1,000; New England Biolabs, Missisauga, Canada), anti-p42/p44mapk (dilution 1:1,000; New England Biolabs) antibodies, followed by four washes with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 buffer. Detection was accomplished using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:2,000;Amersham Biosciences) and an ECL detection system (Roche Diagnotics Laboratories). To quantitate the effects of NT and SR48692 on p42/p44mapkphosphorylation, the ratios of phosphorylated p42/p44mapk over total p42/p44mapk levels were determined by densitometry, using Molecular Dynamics Image Quant Imaging software. The statistical significance was verified using Barlett's test, and the pvalues were obtained from Dunett's tables. The calculations and statistical analyses were performed using Excel 2000 (Microsoft) and Prism 3.02 (Graph Pad Software). To determine whether cerebellar granule cells did target NTS2 receptor proteins presynaptically, synaptosomes were prepared from the cerebelli of rat. The rats were killed by decapitation, and their brains were rapidly removed. The cerebelli from 10 rats were pooled and homogenized with a hand glass homogenizer using a Teflon-coated pestle rotating at 900 rpm in ice-cold HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.32 m sucrose and peptidase inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was recuperated and further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The synaptosomal P2 pellet was equilibrated in 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in modified Earle's buffer (150 mmcholine chloride, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, and 0.9 mm MgCl2) for experimental use. To assess morphological preservation, the synaptosomes were fixed with 2% acrolein-2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. To test the effects of experimental manipulations on morphological integrity, the synaptosomes were preincubated for 25 min in Earle's buffer, rinsed or not with a hypertonic solution (pH 4) containing 0.5 m NaCl, and fixed as above. The synaptosomes were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 30 min and rinsed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer. They were then dehydrated in graded alcohols, embedded in Epon, pelleted in a plastic mold by centrifugation (11,000 × g), and polymerized for 4 days at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were cut on an ultramicrotome and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination with a JEOL 100CX electron microscope (Peabody, MA). For saturation binding experiments, 100 μg of synaptosomal proteins were incubated in 250 μl of Earle's buffer containing increasing concentrations (from 0.5 to 10 nm) of [3H]NT (108 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.8 mm1,10-phenanthroline for 25 min at 37 °C. For determination of nonspecific binding, additional samples were incubated in the presence of 1 μm nonradioactive NT. Binding was terminated by two successive additions of 12 ml of ice"
https://openalex.org/W2009655369,"In order to investigate activation and internalization of c-kit we created a functional c-kit-EGFP chimera by inserting EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) within the extracellular domain of c-kit immediately downstream of the signal sequence, SS-EYFP-kit. This location was chosen because the C-terminal fusion of EGFP to c-kit unexpectedly caused constitutive activation of the c-kit tyrosine kinase. As analysed in fixed cells and by real time imaging in vivo, SCF induced activation led to internalization of the fusion construct and translocation to punctate structures resembling vesicles. Analysis of the internalization process by time lapse imaging revealed high mobility and discontinuous movement of these vesicles and their predominantly radial tracks. Two subsets of vesicles were observed: Traffic of the majority of vesicles was directed from the periphery to the center of the cell and most likely represents the internalization of activated receptor molecules via the endosomal pathway. However, some vesicular structures were observed to move towards the periphery of the cell and probably contain newly synthesized protein to replace internalized receptor molecules. The calculated velocity of moving vesicles ranged from 0.05 to 0.2 microm per se. Vesicle formation upon SCF induced dimerization of the receptor was strictly dependent on kinase activity of c-kit. Treatment of cells with phenylarsine oxide, an agent blocking receptor internalization, prior to SCF stimulation resulted in abrogation of the translocation of the chimera to vesicles whereas accumulation of vesicles was observed when cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors. Cholesterol depletion of the cell membrane by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin resulted in dose dependent reduction of receptor internalization indicating that c-kit may be present in lipid rafts or that intact lipid rafts are required for efficient internalization of the receptor. Using the induction of vesicular structures as a sign of efficient internalization of the receptor analysis of mutant c-kit constructs deficient either in activation of PI3-Kinase or Src revealed that internalization of c-kit is dependent on recruitment of Src but not PI3-Kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2046292599,"Short chain carboxylic acids are well known as the precursors of fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis. Iso-fatty acids, which are important for the control of membrane fluidity, are formed from branched chain starter units (isovaleryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA), which in turn are derived from the degradation of leucine and valine, respectively. Branched chain carboxylic acids are also employed as starter molecules for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, e.g. the therapeutically important anthelmintic agent avermectin or the electron transport inhibitor myxothiazol. During our studies on myxothiazol biosynthesis in the myxobacterium, Stigmatella aurantiaca, we detected a novel biosynthetic route to isovaleric acid. After cloning and inactivation of the branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex, which is responsible for the degradation of branched chain amino acids, the strain is still able to produce iso-fatty acids and myxothiazol. Incorporation studies employing deuterated leucine show that it can only serve as precursor in the wild type strain but not in theesg mutant. Feeding experiments using13C-labeled precursors show that isovalerate is efficiently made from acetate, giving rise to a labeling pattern in myxothiazol that provides evidence for a novel branch of the mevalonate pathway involving the intermediate 3,3-dimethylacryloyl-CoA. 3,3-Dimethylacrylic acid was synthesized in deuterated form and fed to the esg mutant, resulting in strong incorporation into myxothiazol and iso-fatty acids.

The various groups of prokaryotes differ remarkably in the structure and synthesis of fatty acid-derived lipids, which serve as reliable systematic marker molecules in chemotaxonomy (1Fuchs G. Lengeler J. Drews G. Schlegel H. Biology of the Prokaryotes. Blackwell Science, Stuttgart, Germany1999: 110-157Google Scholar). Unsaturated and branched chain (or iso-) FA increase the fluidity of the membrane and fulfill the function of thermal adaptation. The higher the content of these FA, the lower is the solid-to-liquid phase transition temperature of lipids. The biosynthesis of FA has been elucidated in detail, revealing that the difference between the biosynthetic pathways to FA and iso-FA lies only in the respective acylated primer acyl carrier proteins and in the condensing enzymes, which prefer modified primer acyl chains for elongation instead of the “normal” acetyl primer (1Fuchs G. Lengeler J. Drews G. Schlegel H. Biology of the Prokaryotes. Blackwell Science, Stuttgart, Germany1999: 110-157Google Scholar, 2Michal G. Biochemical Pathways, 1. Spektrum Akad. Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1999Google Scholar). The modified primers used for iso-FA biosynthesis are the coenzyme A esters of isovaleric acid (IVA, resulting in iso-odd FA with an uneven number of carbon atoms), isobutyric acid (IBA, resulting in iso-even FA with an even number of carbon atoms), or 2-methyl butyric acid (2MBA, resulting in ante-iso FA, in which the methyl branch is located on the third carbon atom counted from the ω-end of the chain), which can be generated via the degradation pathway from branched chain amino acids or from intermediates of the biosyntheses of these essential amino acids (Fig. 1). The branched chain amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine are transaminated by a separate enzyme and then oxidatively decarboxylated by the Bkd (branched chain keto aciddehydrogenase) complex, resulting in IVA-CoA, IBA-CoA, and 2MBA-CoA, respectively (3Voet D. Voet J. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). These precursors are not only employed in iso-FA biosynthesis but can as well serve as starter molecules for the formation of polyketides. These represent a group of immensely diverse natural products with biological activity, many of which are widely used in the clinic. Examples of polyketides with a branched chain carboxylic acid starter moiety are the anthelmintic agent avermectin produced by Streptomyces avermitilis (4Ikeda H. Omura S. Chem.

During our studies on the biosynthesis of the latter secondary metabolites in myxobacteria, we became interested in the Bkd locus of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1, because it seems to regulate the production of starter molecules for primary metabolism (iso-FA) and secondary metabolism. In addition, myxobacteria show a so-called social behavior that culminates in the formation of multicellular fruiting bodies under starvation conditions (9Dworkin M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 70-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model organism Myxococcus xanthus has been studied extensively to reveal the mechanisms underlying this process. It has been shown in M. xanthusthat a knockout of the bkd gene leads to a development-defective phenotype (10Downard J. Ramaswamy S.V. Kil K.S. J.

Additionally, FA analyses of esg mutants of M. xanthus published by the Shimkets and the Downard groups (11Downard J. Toal D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.-J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that the mutant strain was still able to produce iso-FA, which left both groups with the question how this might be accomplished. In general,M. xanthus contains an immense diversity of FA, which include saturated, unsaturated, branched chain, and hydroxylated species (14Ware J. Dworkin M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We here describe the cloning and inactivation of the esggene in S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 and provide evidence for an unexpected biosynthetic pathway complementing Bkd disruption in myxobacteria. This pathway was characterized in feeding experiments with labeled precursors and intermediates. It must be taken into consideration when analyzing the nature of the developmental E signal in M. xanthus and S. aurantiaca. Southern analysis of genomic DNA was performed using the standard protocol for homologous probes of the DIG High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR was carried out using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 5% Me2SO was added to the mixture. The conditions for amplification with the Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient were as follows: denaturation 30 s at 95 °C, annealing 30 s at 55 °C, and extension 45 s at 72 °C for 30 cycles and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Sequencing was performed using the Big Dye RR terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Biosystems), and the gels were run on ABI-377 sequencers. All other DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Amino acid and DNA alignments were done using the programs of the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR Inc.) and Clustal W (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). A set of three oligonucleotide combinations designed to bind to the M. xanthus esg sequence enabled the PCR amplification of a esg gene fragment from genomic DNA of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 (primers used were esgup, 5′-ggcatccgcgggtccatct-3′, and esgdown, 5′-gcggggccagcagcgagtag-3′). The amplified fragment (592 bp) was cloned into pCR2.1/TOPO (Invitrogen) (resulting in pEBS5). Subsequently primers esgup and esgd2 (5′-aggccttgatgagctcccagtcg-3′) were used to identify a cosmid harboring the complete gene (EBS15) from a pooled library of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 as described (6Silakowski B. Schairer H.U. Ehret H. Kunze B. Weinig S. Nordsiek G. Brandt P. Blo¨cker H. Ho¨fle G. Beyer S. Mu¨ller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37391-37399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A 3-kilobase pair BamHI/XhoI fragment from EBS17 was shown to hybridize with the probe and next cloned into pSK(−) (Stratagene), resulting in pEBS22. The sequence of the insert was obtained via primer walking. Based on the sequence, a 476-bp fragment of the β-subunit of the esg complex was amplified (using oligonucleotides esgup and esgd2) and cloned into a vector harboring a kanamycin resistance gene (pCR2.1/TOPO). The resulting plasmid pEBS7 was electroporated into S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 (6Silakowski B. Schairer H.U. Ehret H. Kunze B. Weinig S. Nordsiek G. Brandt P. Blo¨cker H. Ho¨fle G. Beyer S. Mu¨ller R. J.

Microbiol. 1999; 172: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The correctness of the integration of the plasmid into the chromosome of kanamycin resistant colonies (S. aurantiaca EBS7) was verified using Southern hybridization (data not shown). Fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from 40 mg of cells scraped from Petri dishes by saponification, methylation, and extraction using minor modifications of the methods of Miller (18Miller L.T. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1982; 16: 584-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Kuykendall et al. (19Kuykendall L.D. Roy M.A. O'Neill J.J. Devine T.E. Int. J. Syst. Bact. 1988; 38: 358-361Crossref Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The fatty acid methyl ester mixtures were separated using a Sherlock microbial identification system (Microbial ID, Newark, DE), which consisted of a Hewlett-Packard model 5980 gas chromatograph fitted with a 5% phenyl-methyl silicone capillary column (0.2 mm × 25 m), a flame ionization detector, a Hewlett-Packard model 7673A automatic sampler, and a Hewlett-Packard model KAYAK XA computer (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA). The peaks were automatically integrated, and the fatty acid names and percentages were calculated by the microbial identification system standard software (Microbial ID). The gas chromatographic parameters were as follows: carrier gas, ultra-high purity hydrogen; column head pressure, 60 kPa; injection volume, 2 μl; column split ratio, 100:1; septum purge, 5 ml/min; column temperature, 170–270 °C at 5 °C/min; injection port temperature, 250 °C; and detector temperature, 300 °C. FA analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was done on a Finnigan MAT GCQ gas chromatograph (San Jose, CA) connected to an ion trap mass spectrometer running in the EI mode (70 eV) under conditions similar to those described above. Myxothiazol was isolated fromS. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 and its decendants by repeated methanol extraction of cells and adsorber resin (see below) followed by evaporation of the solvent. The resulting aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic solvent was evaporated to dryness. The combined residues were dissolved in a small amount of methanol and extracted repeatedly with n-heptane. The resulting methanolic solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and subjected to preparative reverse phase HPLC on a Nucleodur 100–10 C18 EC column (259 mm length/21 mm Ø (Macherey & Nagel, Du¨ren, Germany); the solvent was methanol/water (8/2) with a flow rate of 12 ml/min; detection was at 234 nm) resulting in 2–6 mg/liter of myxothiazol. The 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX400 at 100.6 MHz in CD3OD with the solvent as internal standard. Feeding experiments using [13C]acetate were performed withS. aurantiaca in one or two 400-ml cultures of probione medium (20Silakowski B. Kunze B. Mu¨ller R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with 1% of the adsorber resin XAD-16 (Rohm & Haas, Germany) in 1000-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Mutant strains were grown in the same medium after the addition of kanamycin to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After inoculation with 1 × 107 cells/ml from a preculture in tryptone starch medium (10 g of tryptone, 2 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 4 g of soluble starch, 11.9 g of HEPES Pufferan buffer/sliter; pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH), the cells were grown at 30 °C for 93 h before harvest. After 20, 29, 44, and 53 h, 50 mg of labeled acetate were added to each flask. Feeding of IVA, 2MBA, and IBA was done in 50 ml of tryptone medium (6Silakowski B. Schairer H.U. Ehret H. Kunze B. Weinig S. Nordsiek G. Brandt P. Blo¨cker H. Ho¨fle G. Beyer S. Mu¨ller R. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were used in this study. The branched chain acids were added individually in concentrations of 1 mm and as a mixture of all three of them (each 1 mm). The cells were counted and harvested after 48 h. Growth was almost identical except for the cells grown in the mixture, which did not grow at all. FA analysis was additionally performed on the wild type and the mutant cells of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 to analyze the FA composition in correlation with the growth phase. The cells were harvested after 0, 14.5, 24 and 38.5 h. Feeding of 3,3-dimethylacrylic acid (DMAA) and leucine to S. aurantiaca and M. xanthus strains was performed in tryptone or CTT medium (23Hodgkin J. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2932-2942Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar) after the addition of 1 mm of [D6]DMAA ordl-[D10]leucine (Campro Scientific, Berlin, Germany) and inoculation of 50 ml cultures with 1 × 107 cells/ml. The cultures were harvested after 70 h (S. aurantiaca) and 52 h (M. xanthus) for fatty acid analysis. For the incorporation of [D6]DMAA or [D10]dl-leucine into myxothiazol, S. aurantiaca was cultivated in 50 ml of probione medium with XAD, and 1 mg of the precursor was added at 18, 48, 66, and 72 h. The cells were harvested after 92 h, and the incorporation of the precursors into myxothiazol was determined after methanol extraction of cells and XAD by HPLC-MS (Series 1100 HPLC, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA; SCIEX API 2000 ESI-MS, PerkinElmer). To a solution of diisopropylamine (1.5 ml, 10.8 mmol) in 20 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofurane was added 2.5 mbutyllithium solution (4.3 ml,10.8 mmol) in hexane at −15 °C under an argon atmosphere, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min at room temperature. It was then cooled to −78 °C, and 2.16 ml (10.8 mmol) of triethylphosphonoacetate was added slowly. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature for 30 min and then cooled again to −78 °C. Acetone-d6 (1.6 ml, 21.6 mmol) of was then added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h. The reaction was quenched with water at −78 °C, and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature. The product was extracted with three portions of 10 ml of ethyl ether, and the combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl ether = 9:1, v/v). Concentration of the appropriate fractions afforded ethyl 3,3-dimethyl-d6-acrylate (1.2 g, 8.96 mmol, 83%) as a yellowish liquid; Rf 0.46 (hexane/ethyl ether, 5/1 v/v).

To a solution of ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-3,3-d6-acrylate (1.1 g, 8.2 mmol) in 3 ml of methanol and 4.8 ml of tetrahydrofurane was added 8 ml of 2 m LiOH solution. The mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature. The organic solvent was removed in vacuo, and 1 nHCl solution was added to adjust the pH to 2–3. The product was extracted with five portions of 15 ml of ethyl acetate, and the combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate = 2/1 v/v) to give 3,3-dimethyl-d6-acrylic acid (677 mg, 6.38 mmol, 78%) as colorless crystal; Rf 0.2 (hexane/ethyl acetate, 2/1, v/v).

The nucleotide sequence reported here is available in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data base under the accession number AJ439341. We became interested in the branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase gene locus from S. aurantiacaDW4/3-1, because of the possibility of using it for mutasynthesis to generate novel myxothiazol derivatives. We speculated that inactivation of the encoding genes would result in an inability of the bacteria to degrade leucine, which would in turn lead to a lack of precursors (IVA-CoA) for secondary metabolite production and therefore shut down myxothiazol biosynthesis. Feeding of alternative starter units to theesg mutant was speculated to result in the formation of novel myxothiazols. Cloning of the esg locus from S. aurantiacaDW4/3-1 was performed based on the known esg sequence fromM. xanthus (21Toal D.R. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. Downard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A 3-kilobase pair fragment was sequenced that encodes the α- and the β-subunit of the Bkd complex. The α-subunit comprises 885 bp and starts with ATG, which is preceded by a putative ribosome-binding site (GAGGAG). A 2-bp intergenic region can be found between the α- and the β-subunit. The latter is encoded by a gene 1056 bp in size, which starts with an ATG preceded by the putative RBS GAGAAG. The DNA sequence is highly homologous to the known sequence from the M. xanthus esg locus (the DNA levels were 82.4% identity for the α-subunit and 83.3% for the β-subunit; the protein levels were 82.7% for the α-subunit and 82.3% for the β-subunit). After homologous recombination of the plasmid pEBS7 into the chromosome of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1, the esg locus is inactivated, because the mutants harbor two truncated versions of the target gene (one copy with a deletion of the 5′-end and one copy with a deletion at the 3′-end of the gene). The resulting esgmutant S. aurantiaca EBS7 was further analyzed in comparison with the wild type. Secondary metabolite production was analyzed as described previously (6Silakowski B. Schairer H.U. Ehret H. Kunze B. Weinig S. Nordsiek G. Brandt P. Blo¨cker H. Ho¨fle G. Beyer S. Mu¨ller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37391-37399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Myxothiazol is still produced in the esg mutant. Nevertheless, an approximately 3-fold decrease in productivity was observed (as judged by the comparison of the peak areas representing myxothiazol in HPLC analysis). The analysis of the fatty acid composition of both S. aurantiaca strains revealed some striking differences compared with the fatty acid analysis of M. xanthus and the corresponding esg mutant Ω258. In general, production of leucine- and valine-derived fatty acids was decreased in the esg mutants, whereas the production of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was increased (Fig. 2). Feeding of the short chain carboxylic acids IVA, IBA, and 2MBA to the S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 esg mutant was performed and resulted in an almost complete restoration of wild type fatty acid levels in the IVA feeding experiment. The addition of IBA did not result in complete restoration, whereas 2MBA feeding had no effect (Fig. 2). The addition of all three acids abolished growth, whereas the addition of a single compound had no effect on the cell count after 48 h. A time course study revealed that the fatty acid composition does not differ significantly over time (the cells were harvested after 15, 24, 39, and 48 h prior to the analysis). Furthermore, feeding of IVA, IBA, or 2MBA to the wild type had no effect on the fatty acid composition (data not shown). Analysis of fatty acid composition in M. xanthus DK1622 and strain Ω258 was performed as well, revealing as expected an enrichment of iso-even FA, iso-odd FA, and ante-iso FA after the addition of IBA, IVA, and 2MBA, respectively (data not shown; compare Refs. 13Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.-J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13990-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 21Toal D.R. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. Downard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An approximate restoration of wild type levels of fatty acids could only be seen in IVA and DMAA fed mutants. Thus, DMAA could replace the effect of IVA in M. xanthus and in S. aurantiaca mutants. Feeding of IVA had been reported to increase the amount of iso-odd FA (mostly FA iso 15:0) in the M. xanthus esg mutant 2-fold, whereas FA 16:1 ω5c was dramatically reduced under these conditions (13Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.-J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13990-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We only observe an increase of iso-odd FA by a factor of 1.5 (Ω258; data not shown), which compares very well to the data reported by the Downard group (21Toal D.R. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. Downard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In S. aurantiaca, only restoration but no increase above wild type levels of iso-odd FA can be detected in the esg mutant (Fig. 2). A significant decrease of FA 16:1 ω5c below the wild type level was not detected, neither inM. xanthus nor in S. aurantiaca esg mutants after IVA feeding. Because inactivation of theesg gene did not result in loss of production of myxothiazol and iso-fatty acids, we suspected that the strain carries an isogene ofesg. Comparable results regarding iso-FA production inM. xanthus esg mutants have led to similar speculations (10Downard J. Ramaswamy S.V. Kil K.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7762-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.-J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13990-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on conserved sequences within known bkdgenes, degenerate primers were constructed to amplify genomic sequences encoding further bkd genes. In addition, Southern blot analyses under low stringency conditions were performed using theesg gene as a probe (data not shown). No indication of the presence of a second esg gene was found. Because no iso-gene could be detected, we wanted to analyze biochemically whether leucine could still be incorporated into myxothiazol.dl-[D10]leucine was fed to the wild type and to the mutant strain of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1. Subsequently, myxothiazol was isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The data generated clearly show that leucine is incorporated into myxothiazol in the wild type (∼50%; Fig. 3), whereas no incorporation could be detected in the esg mutant. This shows that the mutant strain is not able to use leucine as precursor for myxothiazol biosynthesis and indicates that a previously unidentified pathway must be responsible for the formation of activated IVA as a starter molecule for myxothiazol biosynthesis. To shed light onto this pathway [1-13C]acetate, [2-13C]acetate, and [1,2-13C2]acetate were fed to the mutant strain and to the wild type. Incorporation of the labeled acetate into myxothiazol was analyzed after purification of the compound by13C NMR spectroscopy. Almost no incorporation of acetate into the starting unit in the wild type was observed (TableI), whereas in the esgmutant, the incorporation was almost half of the incorporation of other malonyl-CoA derived carbon atoms (Fig. 4and Table I). The labeling pattern corresponds to intact incorporation of acetate units from C1 to C2 and from C3 to C4 of the IVA starter molecule (identical to C10-C11 and C12-C13 (or C12-C14; C13 and C14 cannot be distinguished via NMR) in myxothiazol; see Fig. 4). The methylbranch carbon (C14 or C13) is derived from the C2 of acetate.Table IRelative 13C-enrichments in comparison with natural abundance in myxothiazol after feeding of [1-13C], [2-13C], and [1,2-13C2]acetate to S. aurantiaca DW4/3–1 and EBS7 and coupling constants obtained after feeding [1,2-13C2]acetateC atomδc[1-13C]acetate[2-13C]acetate[1,2-13C2]acetateDW4/3–1EBS7DW4/3–1EBS7DW4/3–1EBS7Jcc1-aAll spectra were recorded at 100.6 MHz in CD3OD.ppmHz8133.71021—1-b—, no enrichment detected.—137729133.3——18141577210128.1—13———47111143.1———7—4711232.3—10———43513/1422.7———6—41-cEnrichment of intact acetate was determined from the overall enrichment of C-13/C-14 in analogy to C-12.3517132.9——1917168481886.21625——208482194.4——21171196922172.13025——15969No 13C enrichment was observed for other carbon atoms.1-a All spectra were recorded at 100.6 MHz in CD3OD.1-b —, no enrichment detected.1-c Enrichment of intact acetate was determined from the overall enrichment of C-13/C-14 in analogy to C-12. Open table in a new tab No 13C enrichment was observed for other carbon atoms. From the labeling pattern observed, a hypothetical pathway to IVA branching from the mevalonate biosynthetic route is postulated as shown in Fig.5. This pathway putatively involves 3,3-dimethylacrylyl-CoA as an intermediate. Therefore, the corresponding free acid was synthesized in deuterated form ([D6]DMAA) and fed to the culture broth of theesg mutants and wild type strains of S. aurantiaca and M. xanthus. Analysis of myxothiazol from S. aurantiaca using mass spectrometry revealed that [D6]DMAA was incorporated with an efficiency of 45% in the esg mutant but gave almost no incorporation in the wild type. [D6]DMAA was also incorporated into iso-FA, which could be detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis via the expected mass increase of the fatty acid methyl esters by 6 units (TableII). Most significantly, DMAA was incorporated into iso-even and iso-odd-FA (∼75%) inM. xanthus and S. aurantiaca esg mutants. DMAA feeding almost restored wild type levels of iso-fatty acids (data not shown). In contrast to S. aurantiaca EBS7, there was still a low level of incorporation of dl-[D10]leucine into iso-FA in M. xanthus mutant Ω258, indicating that the mutant is leaky.Table IIIncorporation (in %) of [D6]DMAA (A) and [D10]leucine (B) into selected iso-even and iso-odd fatty acidsFatty acidDW4/3–1EBS7DK1622Ω258[D6]DMAA[D10]leucine[D6]DMAA[D10]leucine[D6]DMAA[D10]leucine[D6]DMAA[D10]leucineIso-15:006700013852Iso-15:0 3OH—2-a—, Iso-15:0 3OH was not found in S. aurantiaca.———09701Iso-17:007800011904Iso-17:0 3OH011770012645Iso-14:0 3OH01271009783Iso FA 15:0 3OH was not found in S. aurantiaca DW4/3–1.2-a —, Iso-15:0 3OH was not found in S. aurantiaca. Open table in a new tab Iso FA 15:0 3OH was not found in S. aurantiaca DW4/3–1. During the course of this study an unexpected biosynthetic pathway to IVA in S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 and M. xanthuswas detected. The initial indication for a second route in the strain leading to the formation of IVA came from the experiment that showed that the esg mutant of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 is unable to create iso-FA and myxothiazol from leucine. The subsequent feeding experiments employing different forms of13C-labeled acetate provided evidence for a previously unknown biosynthetic route branching from HMG-CoA as depicted in Fig.5. Further evidence for the existence of this route comes from feeding experiments using DMAA, which was synthesized in labeled form and is incorporated into myxothiazol and iso-FA with high efficiency. One could argue that DMAA is unspecifically reduced to IVA in the bacterial cell and subsequently serves as precursor unit. This is rather unlikely, because no incorporation of DMAA into iso-FA and myxothiazol was found in wild type cells of either S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 or M. xanthus. Unspecific reduction of DMAA should have occurred under these conditions as well. In addition, we fed DMAA to several other bacterial species known to produce iso-FA and analyzed the FA. In agreement with the data presented here, no incorporation into iso-FA was found, again arguing against unspecific reduction of DMAA. 2H. B. Bode, T. Mahmud, and R. Mu¨ller, unpublished data. DMAA and IVA need to be activated in the cell by an CoA ligase, which has already been speculated to be present in M. xanthus (10Downard J. Ramaswamy S.V. Kil K.S. J.

The data presented here show again that standard biochemistry does not always apply in nature and provide further evidence for the assumption that novel biochemistry can still be detected by close analysis of not only secondary but also primary metabolism. The pathway proposed in Fig. 5 builds up myxothiazol and iso-FA from 3,3-dimethylacrylyl-CoA directly. Alternatively, IVA could be generated from 3-methyl-3-butenoyl-CoA after isomerization of the endo- to the exo-double bond. The latter compound is speculated to be derived from HMG-CoA by decarboxylation and dehydration (similar to isopentenylpyrophosphate from activated mevalonic acid). DMAA could as well be formed from HMG-CoA via 3-methyl-glutaconyl-CoA (after dehydration) and subsequent decarboxylation. Intriguingly, DMAA is incorporated into secondary metabolites and primary metabolites in form of not only iso-odd FA but also iso-even FA, which came as a surprise. We therefore speculate that DMAA can serve as precursor for IBA biosynthesis as well (e.g. via hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and oxidative decarboxylation of IVA and subsequent activation of IBA). It will be interesting to see whether the pathway described is present in all myxobacteria or even in other organisms. We performed several feeding experiments employing DMAA with eubacteria and other myxobacterial species. 3H. B. Bode and R. Mu¨ller, unpublished data. Although these experiments did not result in any detectable incorporation into iso-FA, it seems likely that the pathway is present in at least other myxobacterial species and possibly other organisms, because incorporation of DMAA could be detected in two myxobacterial species already (S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 and M. xanthus esg mutants). There was no detectable incorporation in wild type cells, which implies that the bypass via DMAA is only used as rescue pathway in esg mutants, which are currently not available for the other strains tested. This finding also indicates that the pathway is only expressed when the degradation of branched chain amino acids is impaired. Currently, the expected selective expression of the pathway genes in esg mutants is being analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins involved in the novel pathway based on the M. xanthus genome sequence (available at Cereon Genomics for academic use). Shimkets and co-workers (13Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.-J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13990-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) describe in the esg mutant ofM. xanthus selective enrichment of the FA 16:1 ω5c, the production of which they correlate to the E signal. Using an excitation assay for FA content, chemically synthesized 1,2-O-Bis(11-(Z)-hexadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:1 ω5c/16:1 ω5c) was shown to elicit chemotactic activity ofM. xanthus cells in much lower concentrations than other phosphoethanolamines tested. Although the general outcome of our feeding experiments is in good agreement with the data from the Shimkets group, we did not see a comparable increase over wild type levels of 15:0 iso-FA in Ω258 fed with IVA, and saw no increase at all in S. aurantiaca EBS7. Neither did we see the strong reduction of 16:1 ω5c in both strains after IVA feeding as described for Ω258. Nevertheless, the general response of the strains seems to be consistent in that they up-regulate iso-odd FA if lower amounts of unsaturated FA (e.g. FA 16:1 ω5c) can be generated. Our data would explain why the reversal period reported for the extract from Ω258 fed with IVA differs only very little from the wild type (13Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.-J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13990-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Kearns et al. (13Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.-J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13990-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggested that the question of what role the lipid plays in development can be best addressed by devising a method to limit the concentration of phosphoethanolamine containing 16:1 ω5c FA during development to examine the morphological and behavioral consequences, and they pointed out that this is difficult to achieve. Alternatively, one could prove the involvement of FA 16:1 ω5c by further selectively enriching the phosphoethanolamines in this FA. If genes involved in the bypass pathway to IVA described in this paper can be isolated and inactivated in addition to the esg gene, one should expect this to result in mutants unable to generate iso-FA and thus to increase the relative amount of 16:1 ω5c FA.

https://openalex.org/W1986198687,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays important roles during central nervous system development. Cdk5 kinase activity depends on its regulatory partners, p35 or p39, which are prominently expressed in the central nervous system. We have previously demonstrated the involvement of Cdk5 in the regulation of acetylcholine receptor expression at the neuromuscular junction, suggesting a novel functional role of Cdk5 at the synapse. Here we report the identification of Pctaire1, a member of the Cdk-related kinase family, as a p35-interacting protein in muscle.

Pctaire1 is associated with p35 in cultured myotubes and skeletal muscle, and is concentrated at the neuromuscular junction. Furthermore, Pctaire1 can be phosphorylated by the Cdk5/p25 complex, and serine 95 is the major phosphorylation site. In brain and muscle of Cdk5 null mice, Pctaire1 activity is significantly reduced. Moreover, Pctaire1 activity is increased following preincubation with brain extracts and phosphorylation by the Cdk5/p25 complex. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Pctaire1 interacts with p35, both in vitroand in vivo, and that phosphorylation of Pctaire1 by Cdk5 enhances its kinase activity.

Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas other members of the family associate with cyclins, the serine/threonine kinase activity of Cdk5 requires the association with one of its regulatory units, p35 or p39. A C-terminal proteolytic product of p35, p25, has also been shown to activate Cdk5 (2Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Although Cdk5 is ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, the expression of its activators is largely restricted to neurons. The temporal and spatial specificity of Cdk5 kinase activity is therefore because of the neuronal expression of p35 and p39 (3Ishiguro K. Kobayashi S. Omore A. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Anzai K. Imahori K. Uchida T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Lew J. Huang Q.Q., Qi, Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

Recent studies demonstrate that p35 transcript and p35-associated Cdk5 kinase activity can also be detected in muscle (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Fu W.Y., Fu, A.K.Y. Lok K.-C., Ip, F.C.F. Ip N.Y. NeuroReport. 2002; 13: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whereas the best characterized role for Cdk5 is in regulating neuronal migration and axonal guidance as well as cytoskeletal dynamics, there is also evidence that links Cdk5 activity to the regulation of membrane transport and dopamine signaling (2Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In addition to its known functions in neuronal development, recent evidence suggests a novel role for Cdk5 in the modulation of postsynaptic functions. For example, Cdk5 regulates the expression of acetylcholine receptors in muscle during the formation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cdk5 and its activators are localized to the NMJ in adult muscle and mediate the actions of neuregulin by associating with the ErbB receptors (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to playing a key role at the NMJ, Cdk5 has recently been demonstrated to regulateN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that Cdk5 is also involved in modulating postsynaptic functions in the central nervous system (9Li B.S. Sun M.K. Zhang L. Takahashi S., Ma, W. Vinade L. Kulkarni A.B. Brady R.O. Pant H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the functional roles of Cdk5 at the NMJ, it is important to examine the proteins interacting with the active Cdk5/p35 complex in postsynaptic sites. In this study, we have used p35 as bait to perform a yeast two-hybrid screen using a muscle cDNA library. Pctaire1, a member of the Cdk-related protein kinase family, is identified as a p35-interacting protein. Pctaire1 and its related proteins, Pctaire2 and -3, are 50–60-kDa proteins consisting of a core kinase domain flanked by unique N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The catalytic domain of Pctaire proteins contains all the motifs and amino acid residues conserved in the Cdk family (10Meyerson M. Enders G.H., Wu, C.L., Su, L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the N-terminal domains of Pctaire define the specific function of the particular Pctaire family members (11Hirose T. Kawabuchi M. Tamaru T. Okumura N. Nagai K. Okada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2113-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Pctaire1 can be phosphorylated by the Cdk5/p35 complex. Two of the potential Cdk5 phosphorylation sites for Pctaire1 reside on the N-terminal region that shows no amino acid homology with other Cdks. Our results show that one of them, serine 95, is the major phosphorylation site. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that p35 and Pctaire1 interact with each other, both in vitro and in vivo, and that Pctaire1 is a novel substrate of Cdk5. Whereas Cdk5/p25 alone cannot directly activate Pctaire1, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of Pctaire1 by the Cdk5 complex enhances its kinase activity. cDNA encoding full-length p35 was subcloned into the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding vector pAS2-1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to construct GAL4bd-p35, which was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Similarly, cDNAs encoding p25 and p10 were also subcloned into pAS2-1. Partial cDNA fragments of mouse Pctaire1 (encoding amino acids 1–161, 162–456, 457–496, 1–456, or 162–496 of Pctaire1) were amplified by PCR, subcloned into the GAL4 transcriptional activation vector pACT2 (CLONTECH), and used in the experiment described in the legend to Fig. 1. Full-length mouse Pctaire1 was subcloned into expression vector pMT21 for overexpression experiments. The GST-Pctaire1 fusion construct was made by subcloning full-length mouse Pctaire1 into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Point mutations (Ser/Thr to Ala) as well as the K194A mutation were generated by PCR using complementary primers containing the mutations and subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 and pMT21. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Antibodies specific for Cdk5, p35, and Pctaire1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). It is noteworthy that similar results for Pctaire1 could be obtained with a second Pctaire1 antibody raised against the peptide GEAPTRVAPGELSIR. Yeast two-hybrid screen was performed following the Matchmaker two-hybrid screen protocol (CLONTECH). p35 was used as bait to screen a mouse muscle cDNA library that has been constructed in the GAL4 transcriptional activation vector (pACT2). Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with the bait and the library plasmids and transformants were selected on SD-Trp-Leu-His plates. β-Galactosidase activity of His+ colonies was assayed by filter assay. The Pctaire1 clone isolated from the two-hybrid screen encodes the full-length protein with 369 nucleotides at the 5′ end of the initiation codon. A construct without this extra sequence still interacts with p35 (data not shown); therefore these extra nucleotides were not necessary for the interaction between p35 and Pctaire1. Subsequent two-hybrid interaction analyses were carried out by co-transformation of plasmids containing the GAL4 DNA-binding (pAS2-1) and activation (pACT2) domains into yeast. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed by a filter assay. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. Mouse C2C12 cells were maintained and differentiated as previously described (12Fu A.K.Y. Cheung W.M.W., Ip, F.C.F. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with Pctaire1 or p35 plasmids using the calcium phosphate method. COS-7 cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Brain and muscle tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF) with various protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For kinase assay, brain and muscle extracts from wild type and Cdk5 knockout mice were prepared in lysis buffer B as previously described (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations of COS-7 cell lysates were performed in lysis buffer A. Two-hundred μg of COS-7 cell lysates were incubated with the corresponding antibody (2 μg) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were washed with buffer A and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Membrane and cytosolic fractions of muscle extracts were prepared as described previously (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GST-Pctaire1 was expressed in the BL21 strain and purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column following the instructions of the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences). The untagged form of Pctaire1 was produced by digesting GST-Pctaire1 with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences). For the binding assay, GST or GST-p25 was incubated with Pctaire1 and glutathione-Sepharose beads in 500 μl of PBS. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the beads were washed five times with PBS and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-Pctaire1 antibody. Binding between GST-Pctaire1 and His-p25145–170 was carried out as described previously (13Wang X. Ching Y.P. Lam W.H., Qi, Z. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31763-31769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For pull-down studies, 5 μg of GST or GST-Pctaire1 were first incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads in PBS buffer supplemented with 5 μg/μl BSA. After incubation at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation for 1 h, the beads were washed three times with PBS. GST or GST-Pctaire1 bound to the beads was then incubated with 100 μg of COS-7 extracts overexpressing p35 in buffer A at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 5 times with buffer A. The bound protein was resuspended in SDS loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Total RNA was prepared from rat tissues by lithium chloride/urea extraction (12Fu A.K.Y. Cheung W.M.W., Ip, F.C.F. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (14Ip F.C.F. Glass D.J. Gies D.R. Cheung J. Lai K.O., Fu, A.K.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA fragment of Pctaire1 was used as the probe. Pctaire1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Pctaire1 antibody was used as a substrate for recombinant Cdk5/p25 in the in vitrokinase assay. The kinase assay was done at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 15 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Two-hundred ng of recombinant proteins (including GST-Pctaire1, Pctaire1 cleaved from GST fusion, kinase-dead mutant, and phosphorylation site mutants) were also utilized as the substrates for Cdk5/p25 in the same assay. The phosphorylated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Similarly, the kinase activity of Pctaire1 immunoprecipitated from brain and muscle of rat as well as wild type and Cdk5 knockout mice was measured using histone H1 as the substrate. Recombinant Cdk5/p25 protein (0.5 μg) was incubated with 0.5 μg of purified GST-Pctaire1 proteins (WT and K194A mutant), and the activity of the mixture was measured in the same kinase assay. Purified GST-Pctaire1 proteins (WT and K194A) were preincubated with adult rat brain lysate for 2 h at 4 °C followed by pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose beads and the kinase activity was measured in the same assay using MBP or histone H1 as the substrate. In some experiments, GST-Pctaire1 was incubated with or without recombinant Cdk5/p25 complex for 5 or 10 min and Cdk5/p25 was removed by washing with buffer B prior to the kinase assay. Adult rat muscle sections (10 μm) were collected and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Double staining was performed by incubating the sections with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (10−8m; Molecular Probes) and primary antibodies specific for Pctaire1 or p35 at 4 °C overnight, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at room temperature for 1 h as described. The sections were then washed and mounted for confocal microscopy. Pctaire1 was isolated as a positive clone from a mouse muscle cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length p35 as the bait. Pctaire1 encodes a polypeptide of 496 amino acids, containing a 295-amino acid core kinase region that is similar to Cdc2, a 161-amino acid N-terminal extension, and a 40-amino acid C-terminal extension (15Okuda T. Cleveland J.L. Downing J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2249-2258PubMed Google Scholar). As the first step to dissect the regions of Pctaire1 that interact with p35, different constructs containing combinations of the N-terminal, kinase, and C-terminal domains of Pctaire1 were made. The ability of these constructs to interact with p35 in yeast was examined (Fig.1). Our findings demonstrated that the full-length Pctaire1 interacted strongly with p35, whereas the individual domains did not bind to p35. In addition to the full-length Pctaire1, the construct comprising the kinase region and the C-terminal region also bound to p35, albeit to a lesser extent. It is noteworthy that in our yeast two-hybrid assay, binding was neither observed between Pctaire2 and p35, nor between Pctaire1 and Cdk5 (data not shown). To further characterize the interaction between p35 and Pctaire1, the N-terminal (p10) and C-terminal (p25) regions of p35 were tested for their ability to bind to Pctaire1. The p25 protein is a cleavage product of p35 that activates Cdk5 kinase robustly but lacks the N-terminal 100 residues of p35 necessary for membrane targeting (16Patrick G. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. Monte S.D. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). We found that Pctaire1 interacted with the fragment encoding the C-terminal p25 protein and not the N-terminal region of p35 (Fig.1). To test whether Pctaire1 binds to p35 directly, in vitro binding assay was performed. Pctaire1 was cleaved from the GST-Pctaire1 fusion protein, purified, and incubated with GST or GST-p25. Prominent binding between p25 and Pctaire1 was detected (Fig.2A, upper panel). A region of 26 amino acid residues (residues 145 to 170) of p35 has been identified to contain the binding sites of a number of p35-binding proteins (13Wang X. Ching Y.P. Lam W.H., Qi, Z. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31763-31769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also examined whether Pctaire1 binds to this region by using GST-Pctaire1 and His-p25145–170 in the binding assay. Pctaire1 also binds to this region (Fig. 2A, middle panel). The association between Pctaire1 and p35 was also observed using anin vitro pull-down assay. A cell lysate of COS-7 cells overexpressing p35 was incubated with GST or GST-Pctaire1 protein. The recombinant Pctaire1, but not GST, was able to pull-down p35 protein from the transfected cell lysate (Fig. 2A, lower panel). To examine whether the interaction between Pctaire1 and p35 could be detected in mammalian cells, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with both Pctaire1 and p35. Pctaire1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with Pctaire1 antibody, and the presence of p35 in the complex was analyzed by immunoblotting with p35 antibody. We found that Pctaire1 antibody, but not normal IgG, co-immunoprecipitated Pctaire1 with p35 from the COS-7 extract (Fig. 2B). Similarly, positive interaction was observed between Pctaire1 and p35 when p35 antibody was used for co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.2B). We have examined the expression of Pctaire1 in C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Pctaire1 was increased in C2C12 myotubes (Fig.3A). Association between Pctaire1 and p35 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3A). To test whether Pctaire1 interacts with p35 in muscle, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using muscle extracts. Whereas Pctaire1 expression could be observed in both membrane and cytosolic fractions, p35 could only be detected in the membrane-enriched fractions (Fig. 3B) (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Pctaire1 can be co-immunoprecipitated by p35 antibody in membrane fractions of E21 muscle (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that Pctaire1 could interact with p35 in vitro as well as in vivo. To examine the spatial and temporal profiles of Pctaire1 in rat tissues, Northern blot analysis was performed. It was previously reported that expression of Pctaire1 was prominently detected in adult rat brain, eye, skeletal muscle, heart, and reproductive organs (10Meyerson M. Enders G.H., Wu, C.L., Su, L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 15Okuda T. Cleveland J.L. Downing J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2249-2258PubMed Google Scholar). The level of Pctaire1 transcripts in skeletal muscle was higher during embryonic and early postnatal stages and subsequently decreased in later stages of development (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the mRNA expression of Pctaire1 in brain was more prominent during postnatal stages. An antibody raised against a peptide of Pctaire1 recognized a doublet in muscle and brain lysates (Fig.4B). Both bands can be totally blocked by preincubation with the Pctaire1 peptide (data not shown). Pctaire1 detected in adult muscle apparently migrated slower than that in E18 and P5 muscles. The band was downshifted after phosphatase treatment (data not shown), suggesting that Pctaire1 is phosphorylated in adult muscle. Whereas Cdk5 protein was expressed at high levels in embryonic muscle, the expression of the p35 protein was much lower (Fig. 4B) and could only be detected in the membrane-enriched fractions of the E18 muscle (7Fu A.K.Y., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K., Ip, F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Pctaire1 during development was also examined. When histone H1 was used as the substrate, a higher level of Pctaire1 kinase activity was seen in embryonic muscle (E18) than in P5 and adult muscles, whereas the kinase activity remained very high throughout brain development (Fig. 4C). To compare the subcellular localization of Pctaire1 with p35 in adult muscle, immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Pctaire1 staining was localized at the sarcolemma of muscle and concentrated at the NMJ co-stained with α-bungarotoxin. The staining for Pctaire1 overlapped with and was broader than that observed for acetylcholine receptor. Compared with Pctaire1, p35 was found to be more restricted to the NMJ regions in muscle (Fig.5). Cdk5 is a proline-directed kinase that phosphorylates serine and threonine residues immediately upstream of the proline residue. Because we were able to identify three potential Cdk5 phosphorylation sites (S/T)PX(K/H/R) in Pctaire1, the ability of active Cdk5 to phosphorylate Pctaire1 was examined. The purified Cdk5/p25 recombinant protein was able to phosphorylate Pctaire1, either in the form of GST-Pctaire1 fusion protein or after cleavage (Fig. 6A). GST alone was not phosphorylated by the Cdk5/p25 complex (data not shown). Moreover, active Cdk5 was also able to phosphorylate Pctaire1 immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells overexpressing Pctaire1 (Fig.6B). These results suggest that Pctaire1 is a novel substrate identified for Cdk5. To determine which of the three potential sites can be phosphorylated by Cdk5, we generated point mutations (Ser/Thr to Ala) for each of the sites (Ser95, Ser138, and Thr380) as well as double or triple mutations. GST-Pctaire1 fusion proteins containing these mutations were purified and used as substrates for thein vitro kinase assay. Mutation of serine 95 to alanine completely abolished the phosphorylation of Pctaire1 by Cdk5, as seen in single as well as in double or triple mutants containing this mutation (Fig. 6C). Phosphorylation was slightly decreased in the S138A mutant, whereas no change was seen in the T380A mutant. A similar result was obtained when Pctaire1 containing these mutations were overexpressed in COS-7 cells and used as the substrate for the kinase assay (data not shown). This result demonstrates that Pctaire1 is a novel substrate of Cdk5 and that serine 95 is the major Cdk5 phosphorylation site. To rule out the possibility that Pctaire1 phosphorylation is a result of autophosphorylation, we mutated the catalytic lysine 194 to alanine in the ATP binding pocket. The inactive Pctaire1 protein with this mutation can still be phosphorylated in the presence of Cdk5, in the same manner as the wild type protein (Fig. 6D). Therefore, the phosphorylation of Pctaire1 in the presence of Cdk5 is not mediated by its own kinase activity. To further establish the kinase-substrate relationship between Cdk5 and Pctaire1, we compared the kinase activity of Pctaire1 in wild type and Cdk5 knockout mice. Pctaire1 immunoprecipitated from brain or muscle extracts of both wild type and Cdk5 knockout mice was used in the kinase assay with histone H1 as the substrate. Phosphorylation of histone H1 by Pctaire1 was significantly reduced in Cdk5 knockout mice than in wild type mice for both muscle and brain extracts (Fig. 7). Cdk5 could not be detected in the immunoprecipitates by Western blotting (data not shown). This result suggests that Cdk5 might be involved in regulating the kinase activity of Pctaire1 in vivo. Purified bacterial expressed GST-Pctaire1 does not have any kinase activity, and preincubation of Pctaire1 with recombinant Cdk5/p25 complex could not increase the kinase activity (data not shown) (17Charrasse S. Carena I. Hagmann J. Wood-Cook K. Ferrari S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 611-620PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether Pctaire1, like Cdk5, depends on an activator protein for kinase activity, we preincubated purified wild type and kinase-dead mutants of GST-Pctaire1 with adult brain lysate. After preincubation, the Pctaire1 protein was affinity precipitated and tested for kinase activity. We found that a high level of kinase activity was displayed by the wild type Pctaire1, and not the mutant protein (Fig.8A). Moreover, no kinase activity was detected with Pctaire1 samples preincubated with COS-7 cells or adult rat muscle lysates (data not shown) (18Besset V. Rhee K. Wolgemoth D.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 173-181PubMed Google Scholar). These results were compatible with the suggestion that Pctaire1 depends on a brain-specific cellular activator for kinase activity. Because we have shown that Cdk5 phosphorylates Pctaire1, and that Pctaire1 activity decreases in Cdk5 knockout mice, it is interesting to know whether Cdk5 can regulate Pctaire1 activity. To test this possibility, wild type as well as the kinase-dead mutant of Pctaire1 that had been preincubated with brain extract were further incubated with the recombinant Cdk5/p25 complex under protein phosphorylating conditions. The recombinant Cdk5/p25 complex was then removed by a stringent wash and Pctaire1 activity was examined. MBP instead of histone H1 was used as the substrate protein because it is a poor substrate for Cdk5. We found that Pctaire1 activity was increased after 10 or even 5 min of incubation with the Cdk5/p25 complex, whereas the activity of its kinase-dead mutant was not affected, suggesting that Cdk5 phosphorylation on Pctaire1 could enhance its activity (Fig.8B). The use of MBP as the substrate, together with the stringent wash that resulted in undetectable Cdk5 in the precipitates, ruled out the possibility of Cdk5 contamination in the MBP phosphorylation assay. The mutation that changes serine 95 of Pctaire1 to alanine completely abolished the phosphorylation of Pctaire1 by Cdk5 (Fig. 6C). When GST-Pctaire1 harboring this mutation was used in the same assay, no significant increase in the phosphorylation of MBP was seen (Fig. 8C). These results suggested that Cdk5 phosphorylation on Pctaire1 could enhance Pctaire1 activity, which is consistent with the in vivo data from Cdk5 null mice. In the present study, Pctaire1 was identified as an interacting protein with p35 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Our findings demonstrate that p35 and Pctaire1 interact with each other, both in vitro and in vivo. The full interaction between p35 and Pctaire1 requires the presence of the N-terminal, core kinase, and C-terminal regions, suggesting that the three-dimensional structure of Pctaire1 is important for its association with p35. This finding is consistent with previous reports on the interaction between Pctaire1 and p11 or 14-3-3 proteins (19Sladeczek F. Camonis J.H. Burnol A.F. Le Bouffant F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Le Bouffant F. Capdevielle J. Guilemot J.C. Sladeczek F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), i.e. both the N- and C-terminal domains are required. We also found that Pctaire1 can be phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25 on serine 95, and is therefore a novel substrate of active Cdk5. Although the precise significance of this interaction remains to be elucidated, our findings suggest that Cdk5 regulates the kinase activity of Pctaire1. Based on the yeast two-hybrid screen, previous studies have identified several proteins that interact with Cdk5/p35, including neurofilament, tau, cables, and nudel (21Qi Z. Tang D.M. Zhu X.D.

Morabito M. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 697-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Our identification of Pctaire1 as a novel substrate for Cdk5 provides the first demonstration of a Cdk-related kinase, other than Cdk5, that interacts with p35. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of Pctaire1, a Cdc2-like kinase, identifies the presence of domains conserved among Cdks, including kinase subdomains with ∼52% similarity to Cdc2 kinases (20Le Bouffant F. Capdevielle J. Guilemot J.C. Sladeczek F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it exhibits several features that are distinct from other members of the Cdk family. For example, the size of Pctaire1 is twice that of other Cdks (i.e. ∼60 kDa compared with ∼30 kDa) because of the presence of the N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. Unlike other Cdks, and similar to Cdk5, Pctaire1 is not involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. The expression of Pctaire1 is ubiquitous, and is prominently expressed in highly differentiated tissues, including brain, eye, skeletal muscle, and heart (18Besset V. Rhee K. Wolgemoth D.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 173-181PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, Pctaire1 is abundant in the cytoplasm of terminally differentiated cells, such as elongated spermatids in testis, and postmitotic neurons in brain. Although Pctaire1 is expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, their precise functions are still unknown. Kinase activity has been detected in both brain and testis (18Besset V. Rhee K. Wolgemoth D.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 173-181PubMed Google Scholar, 20Le Bouffant F. Capdevielle J. Guilemot J.C. Sladeczek F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Pctaire1 in the process of differentiation in these tissues. However, purified Pctaire1 does not exhibit kinase activity, 2K. Cheng and N. Y. Ip, unpublished observation. (17Charrasse S. Carena I. Hagmann J. Wood-Cook K. Ferrari S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 611-620PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Pctaire1 activation requires binding to a regulatory partner. We report here that the kinase activity of Pctaire1 depends on a brain-specific activator, consistent with the observation that Pctaire1 activity is much higher in adult brain than in adult muscle. Thus, like the other members of the Cdk family, such as p35 for Cdk5 or cyclins for other Cdks, Pctaire1 needs to associate with specific activator(s) to trigger its activity. Whereas p35 is not the activator of Pctaire1 (5Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar),2 we have provided several lines of evidence to demonstrate that Cdk5/p35 is involved in the regulation of Pctaire1 activity. We found that Pctaire1 is phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25 and that its kinase activity is significantly reduced in brain and muscle of Cdk5 null mice. In addition, Pctaire1 activity can be further enhanced by incubation with Cdk5/p25. Taken together, our findings suggest that Pctaire1 activity is regulated by Cdk5 in vivo. It is possible that p35 may act as a substrate-targeting protein for Cdk5 to phosphorylate Pctaire1, which in turn modulates the activity of Pctaire1. The identification of the brain-specific activator of Pctaire1 will be critical to delineate the biological functions of Pctaire1 in Cdk5 signaling and to facilitate our understanding of the regulation of this protein.

Cheung for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2012228485,"Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) plays an important role in signal transduction through modulating the balance between two signaling lipids, diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. In yeast two-hybrid screening, we unexpectedly found a self-association of the C-terminal part of DGKδ containing a sterile α-motif (SAM) domain. We then bacterially expressed the SAM domain fused with maltose-binding protein and confirmed the formation of dimeric and tetrameric structures. Moreover, gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that DGKδ formed homo-oligomeric structures in intact cells and that the SAM domain was critically involved in the oligomerization. Interestingly, phorbol ester stimulation induced dissociation of the oligomeric structures with concomitant phosphorylation of DGKδ. Furthermore, we found that DGKδ was translocated from cytoplasmic vesicles to the plasma membrane upon phorbol ester stimulation. In this case, DGKδ mutants lacking the ability of self-association were localized at the plasma membranes even in the absence of phorbol ester. A protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, blocked all of the effects of phorbol ester,i.e. oligomer dissociation, phosphorylation, and translocation. We confirmed that tumor-promoting phorbol esters did not directly bind to DGKδ. The present studies demonstrated that the formation and dissociation of oligomers serve as the regulatory mechanisms of DGKδ and that DGKδ is a novel downstream effector of phorbol ester/protein kinase C signaling pathway.

Yamada K. Sakane F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 47-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The roles of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid as lipid second messengers have been attracting much attention. Diacylglycerol is known to be an activator of conventional and novel protein kinase Cs (PKC), chimerins, Unc-13, and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar, 3Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y.

Phosphatidic acid has been reported in a number of studies to modulate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kinase, Raf-1 kinase, atypical PKC, and many other important enzymes (5Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid is also known to have mitogenic effects in a variety of cells (7Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Because the cellular concentrations of these signaling lipids must be strictly regulated, DGK is thought to be one of the key enzymes involved in the cellular signal transduction. It is now recognized that DGK represents a large gene family of isozymes differing remarkably in their structures, the modes of tissue expression, and in the enzymological properties (5Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B.

To date, nine mammalian DGK isozymes (α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, and ι) containing in common the zinc finger structures and the catalytic region are classified into five subgroups according to their structural features (5Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B.

In contrast to mammals, only a few DGK isoforms have been identified in organisms such as worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) and flies (Drosophila melanogaster) (5Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, no DGK gene has yet been detected in yeast. It is therefore likely that mammalian DGK isozymes have essential roles in biological processes specific to higher vertebrates, such as development/differentiation, neural networking, the immune system, and tumorigenesis. However, our knowledge of specific functions of the individual DGK isozymes is still limited at present. We previously reported that DGKδ (type II isozyme) contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N terminus and a sterile α-motif (SAM) domain at the C terminus (9Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because another type II isozyme, DGKη, was reported to have no SAM domain (10Klauck T.M., Xu, X. Mousseau B. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19781-19788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), DGKδ has a unique structural feature among the DGK isozymes identified so far. Although the DGKδ PH domain has been reported to bind to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and myosin II (11Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Sakane F.

Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), functions of the SAM domain of DGKδ are still unclear. The SAM domain, which is ∼70 amino acids long, was first described as a module that is present in a small group of yeast sexual differentiation and Drosophila polyhomeotic proteins (13Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The SAM domain was subsequently found to occur in a wide range of proteins. Proteins containing SAM domains include the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases (14Hirai H. Maru Y. Hagiwara K. Nishida J. Takaku F. Science. 1987; 238: 1717-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 15Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1995; 82: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), serine/threonine kinases (16Tu H. Barr M. Dong D.L. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5876-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor proteins (17Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), ETS transcription factors (18Kyba M. Brock H.W. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), p53 (17Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and many other proteins. Such an extended occurrence suggests that SAM is an evolutionally conserved protein-protein interaction domain that is involved in the regulation of numerous developmental processes among diverse eukaryotes. Some SAM domains were reported to form homo- and hetero-oligomers (16Tu H. Barr M. Dong D.L. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5876-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Kyba M. Brock H.W. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, recent studies showed that although SAM domains of EphA4 and B2 receptors formed homo-oligomers, oligomer formation was not detected for EphA2 and B1 receptors (19Thanos C.D. Faham S. Goodwill K.E. Cascio D. Phillips M. Bowie J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37301-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U.

The function of the SAM domain, therefore, does not appear to be limited to oligomer formation, and can be variable depending on different proteins. The present work for the first time shows that the DGK isoform forms oligomeric structures through the SAM domain and that phorbol ester stimulation dynamically regulates the molecular assembly and intracellular localization of DGKδ. cDNAs coding for DGKδ-CTR (amino acid residues 882–1170), DGKδ-CC (amino acid residues 882–1097), DGKδ-SAM (amino acid residues 1098–1170), and DGKδ-ΔSAM (amino acid residues 1–1096) were generated from a human DGKδ cDNA clone (9Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DGKδ-W1101G cDNA clone was generated by replacing the Trp-1101 with Gly using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For subsequent subcloning into expression vectors, primers were designed such that the resulting DGKδ cDNA fragments contained a 5′-EcoRI restriction site and a 3′-stop codon followed by a 3′-EcoRI site. The resulting DGKδ fragments were fused in-frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH, Tokyo, Japan) and with the 3xFLAG tag in the p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan). Plasmids encoding the SAM domain of DGKδ fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP, 43 kDa) were obtained by inserting the SAM cDNA fragments into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The full-length DGKα cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame to the p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1 vector. The DGKδ fragments were fused in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain in the pBTM116 vector (kindly provided by Dr. A. Yoshimura, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan) and also fused with the GAL4 activation domain in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH). The yeast two-hybrid screen was done as described by Endo et al. (22Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). In brief, the C-terminal region of DGKδ (amino acid residues 882–1170) used as a bait was fused with the LexA DNA-binding domain in pBTM116 vector (pBTM116/DGKδ-CTR). Transformation of yeast strain L40 was performed by the lithium acetate method. Yeast transformants containing pBTM116/DGKδ-CTR were subsequently transformed with the human skeletal muscle cDNA library in pGAD10 and selected for growth on Trp− Leu−His− plates. Two independent positive colonies (clones 18 and 21) that gave β-galactosidase activity were isolated from 8 × 106 yeast transformants. An 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal) filter assay was employed to measure β-galactosidase activity. Loss of pBTM116/DGKδ-CTR from positive colonies was induced by Leu− selection and positive library plasmids were isolated. To verify the interaction, positive plasmids were purified and retransformed into L40 cells together with or without pBTM116/DGKδ-CTR. Transformants were selected for growth on Trp− Leu− plates and assessed for β-galactosidase activity. Sequencing and data base analyses revealed that clone 18 encoded a DGKδ fragment (residues 889–1170), whereas clone 21 possessed an unidentified sequence. Other sets of two-hybrid analysis were performed to determine self-association of the C-terminal parts of DGKδ, such as wild-type and point-mutated SAM domains. The L40 cells were transformed with various pBTM116- and pGAD10-DGKδ cDNA constructs. Transformants were selected by growth on Trp− Leu− plates and assessed for β-galactosidase activity. COS-7 and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs using Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). After 2 days, cells were used for further analysis. XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene) were transfected with various pMAL-c2X constructs, and MBP-fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (New England BioLabs). In this case, expression of fusion proteins was induced by 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed by freeze-thaw cycles in the column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Fusion proteins were purified using an amylose resin affinity column. Gel filtration was performed on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with the column buffer supplemented with (for Triton X-100 extracts) or without (for MBP fusion proteins) 1% Triton X-100, and run with the fast protein liquid chromatography system equipped with a UV monitor (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. The column was calibrated with gel filtration molecular weight markers (Sigma). For analysis of the MBP fusion proteins, aliquots (100 μl) of the purified samples were loaded onto the column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. For analysis of the Triton X-100 extracts from COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged DGKδ, the cells were harvested in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma). The mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to give the Triton X-100 extracts. Aliquots (100 μl) of the extracts were loaded onto the column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma). In some experiments, the Triton X-100 extracts of HepG2 cells were similarly fractionated, and the fractions were analyzed for endogenous DGKδ using anti-DGKδ antibody as previously described (9Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells (∼1 × 107 cells, 60-mm dish) co-expressing 3xFLAG-tagged DGKδ and GFP-DGKδ were harvested in buffer 1 containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to give cell lysates. Cell lysates (400 μl) were precleared with Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (10 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG (2 μg, M2) or anti-GFP (2 μl, Living Colors full-length A.v. polyclonal antibody, CLONTECH) was added to the precleared lysates to immunoprecipitate 3xFLAG- and GFP-fusion proteins, respectively. After 1 h at 4 °C, Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (5 μl) were added and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The agarose beads were washed five times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6 mKCl), suspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and then processed for SDS-PAGE analysis. Gel filtration fractions, precleared cell lysates, and immunoprecipitates were separated on 7.5 or 16.5% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody or anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (B-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 10% Block Ace for 1 h. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and SuperSignal (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) binding assay was performed as described (23Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar,24Sakane F. Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The binding was determined in duplicated incubation mixtures (250 μl each), containing [3H]PDBu (17.0 Ci/mmol, 40 nm) (Amersham Biosciences), 550 × gsupernatant of COS-7 cells (50 μg of protein), 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and bovine γ-globulin (4 mg/ml). Incubation was carried out in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then chilled for 5 min at 0 °C and added with 187 μl of 35% (w/w) polyethylene glycol 6000 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The mixtures were then incubated for 15 min at 0 °C to permit precipitation of proteins. The precipitates were spun down at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and blotted with filter papers. After the tip of the Eppendorf tube was cut off, the radioactivity in the pellet was measured to determine the bound [3H]PDBu. Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of unlabeled PDBu (40 μm) was subtracted from the data. COS-7 cells expressing 3xFLAG-tagged DGKδ were used at 40 h post-transfection. HepG2 cells (100-mm dish) or transfected COS-7 cells (35-mm dish) were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h in DMEM without sodium phosphate and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) containing 0.1% BSA, and then labeled for 2 h with [32P]orthophosphate (0.3 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free DMEM, 0.1% BSA. The labeled cells were subsequently incubated in phosphate-free DMEM, 0.1% BSA containing 1 μm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or 0.1% Me2SO for 1 h. Cells were then harvested in buffer 1 and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to give the cell lysates. Cell lysates (300 μl) were precleared with Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (10 μl). Anti-FLAG (M2, for COS-7 cells transfected) or anti-DGKδ (against the C-terminal peptide, amino acids 1156–1170, of human DGKδ, for HepG2 cells) antibody (2 μg) was added to precleared lysates to immunoprecipitate 3xFLAG-tagged or endogenous DGKδ proteins. After 1 h, Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (5 μl) was added followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. After washing the agarose beads five times with buffer 1, immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The radioactive signal was visualized by phosphorimaging using a BAS1800 Bio-imaging Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). HEK293 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding various DGKδ constructs N-terminally fused with GFP. After 2 days, HEK293 cells were washed four times with PBS and then cultured in DMEM, 0.1% BSA. After 3 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM, 0.1% BSA containing 1 μm TPA. After 1 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then washed five times with PBS at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). We screened yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries prepared from human skeletal muscle and obtained two positive clones that interacted with a C-terminal portion (amino acid residues 882–1170) of DGKδ containing two sets of coiled-coil structures and a SAM domain (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, sequence analysis revealed that one of the positive clones (clone 18) was DGKδ (residues 889–1170) itself. Because both of the coiled-coil structures and the SAM domain could participate in protein-protein interaction, we next tested which region was responsible for the self-association. The DGKδ SAM domain interacted with each other in a yeast two-hybrid assay as demonstrated by the formation of blue colonies, whereas the DGKδ coiled-coil structures did not interact with the counterpart (Fig. 1, Band C). The result indicates that the SAM domain is sufficient to form a dimeric structure. An aromatic residue, Tyr-912 (corresponding to Trp-1101 in DGKδ), at the 8th position in the SAM domain of the EphB2 receptor was reported to be critical for dimer formation (20Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the SAM domain of the EphA2 receptor, in which the critical Tyr is mutated to Gly, did not form a dimer structure (19Thanos C.D. Faham S. Goodwill K.E. Cascio D. Phillips M. Bowie J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37301-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Trp-1101 in DGKδ was thus substituted by Gly to see whether this Trp was critical for the interaction. As shown in Fig. 1, B and D, the SAM-W1101G mutant did not show a detectable interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assay. This indicates that Trp-1101 is a residue critical for homo-dimer formation, suggesting that the dimer structure of the DGKδ SAM domain has general relevance to other SAM domain-containing proteins. To further study the multimeric nature of the DGKδ SAM domain in vitro, the purified MBP-DGKδ-SAM and MBP-DGKδ-SAM-W1101G were analyzed using a Superose 12 HR column. Although MBP-DGKδ SAM at a low loading concentration (0.6 μm) eluted at the monomer position (not shown), a peak of the fusion protein at 6 μm of loading concentration was at 12.2 ml (∼120 kDa, dimer) (Fig.2 A, top panel). We confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis that the appearance of the fusion protein (52 kDa) was well correlated with the UV peak pattern (Fig.2 A, bottom panel). When the loading concentration was increased to 45 μm, MBP-DGKδ SAM eluted at the tetramer position (∼240 kDa) (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to the wild-type SAM, MBP-DGKδ-SAM-W1101G at 6 μm of loading concentration eluted at the monomer position (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, even if the loading concentration was increased to 45 μm, the mutant did not form a multimeric structure (Fig.2 D). These data, essentially consistent with those of the yeast two-hybrid assay, indicate that the DGKδ SAM domain is capable of forming at least tetrameric structures, and that Trp-1101 in the SAM domain is essential for the interaction. In this respect, MBP-DGKδ-SAM-W1101G eluted at the same retention volume (13.1 ml) as that of the MBP-DGKδ-SAM (wild-type) monomer form, indicating that the mutation (Trp-1101 to Gly) introduced did not significantly affect the folding of this domain. To assess whether intact DGKδ formed the oligomer structure in vivo, we performed gel filtration analysis of DGKδ expressed in COS-7 cells. In this case DGKδ was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and gel filtration was done in the presence of Triton X-100, because more than 90% of wild-type DGKδ and its mutants were recovered in particulate fractions by cell fractionation. It was assumed that monomer (140 kDa plus Triton X-100 micelle size: 90 kDa), homo-dimer (280 plus 90 kDa), and homo-tetramer (560 plus 90 kDa) of DGKδ would elute at retention volumes 10.5–11.5, 9.5–10.0, and 7.5–8.5 ml, respectively. As shown in Fig.3, most of the wild-type enzyme was recovered in the ≥dimer fractions. We also observed that more than 80% of the endogenous DGKδ in HepG2 cells was recovered in the ≥dimer fractions, in particular the tetramer fraction, although the exact quantitation of the immunoreactive bands was hindered by the low concentration of endogenous DGKδ. This finding indicates that the oligomerization is not the artifact of enzyme overexpression. We could not exclude the possibility that the ≥dimer fractions contained hetero-dimer/oligomers of DGKδ with unknown partner(s). However, because the availability to the overexpressed enzyme of the endogenous oligomerization partners, if any, should be limited, the formation of hetero-dimer/oligomer was considered to be negligible. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, most of DGKδ lacking the SAM domain (DGKδ-ΔSAM) eluted at the monomer position. Most of DGKδ having the mutated SAM domain (DGKδ-W1101G) also eluted at the monomer position. These results strongly suggest that DGKδ forms oligomeric structures in vivo and that the SAM domain plays a critical role for the oligomer formation. Notably, small portions of DGKδ-ΔSAM and DGKδ-W1101G proteins were recovered in the ≥dimer fractions, suggesting that in addition to the SAM domain the N-terminal region of the enzyme contributes, albeit to a lesser extent, to the formation of oligomeric structure. To further confirm homo-oligomer formation of DGKδ in vivo, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis using the lysates of COS-7 cells co-expressing GFP-tagged and 3xFLAG-tagged DGKδ proteins. When 3xFLAG-tagged DGKδ was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, GFP-tagged DGKδ was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig.4 A). Reciprocally, when GFP-tagged DGKδ was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, 3xFLAG-tagged DGKδ was co-immunoprecipitated. To confirm the specificity of co-immunoprecipitation, we performed the same experiment using COS-7 cells expressing GFP-tagged DGKδ and another isoform, DGKα, which was tagged with 3xFLAG. As shown in Fig. 4 B, no DGKα band was detected in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitation fraction. Taken together, we concluded that DGKδ specifically formed homo-oligomer structures in vivo. To assess the contribution of the SAM domain toward the oligomer formation, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of the SAM alone or DGKδ mutants lacking the SAM domain or substituted at Trp-1101 by Gly in the SAM domain. As shown in Fig. 4 C, 3xFLAG-SAM was detected in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitation fraction. Moreover, in comparison with wild-type DGKδ, significantly less 3xFLAG-DGKδ-ΔSAM and DGKδ-W1101G were found in the anti-GFP-immunoprecipitated complexes (Fig. 4 D). We confirmed the presence of comparable amounts of the GFP fusion proteins in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates. These results indicate that the SAM domain is sufficient for self-association in vivo, contributing critically to the oligomer formation of the full-length DGKδ. As observed in gel filtration analysis, detectable 3xFLAG-DGKδ-ΔSAM and DGKδ-W1101G bands still remained in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitated complexes (Fig. 4 D). This again suggests that in addition to the SAM domain the N-terminal region of the enzyme is able to weakly contribute to the formation of oligomer structure. After detecting the SAM domain-mediated oligomerization of DGKδ, we tested effects of cell stimulation on the physical state of DGKδ. After serum starvation of COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged enzymes for 3 h, more than 90% DGKδ eluted in ≥dimer fractions in gel filtration (Fig. 5) as already noted for endogenous enzyme (Fig. 3). Interestingly, when the cells were stimulated with T"

Whereas ERα has been predominantly found in the anterior pituitary, uterus, vagina, testis, liver, and kidney, ERβ is predominantly expressed in thyroid, ovary, prostate, skin, bladder, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, cartilage, and bone (13Pelletier G.

The Bcl-2 family proteins serve as critical regulators of mitochondria-dependent pathways. Antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) reside in the mitochondria, whereas proapoptotic proteins (BAX, BAD, and BID) reside in the cytosol. Upon apoptotic stimuli, proapoptotic proteins translocate to the mitochondrial membrane, and mitochondria lose their membrane potential and release cytochrome c (17Nechushtan A. Smith C.L.

Nature. 1997; 390: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The function of BAD is regulated by reversible phosphorylation and binding of 14-3-3 proteins (20Masters S.C. Yang H. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Fu H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Deprivation of survival factors induces BAD dephosphorylation by the specific serine/threonine phosphatase PP1α (21Salomoni P. Condorelli F. Sweeney S.M. Calabretta B. Blood. 2000; 96: 676-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3 proteins and translocation to the mitochondria, where BAD interacts with Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 and antagonizes their antiapoptotic functions. BAD is cleaved by a caspase(s) at its N terminus to generate a 15-kDa truncated protein following IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis in murine myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells. The 15-kDa truncated BAD is a more potent inducer of apoptosis than the wild-type BAD, whereas a mutant BAD, resistant to caspase 3 cleavage, is a weaker inducer of apoptosis (22Condorelli F.

Raloxifene treatment induces apoptosis in these cells and induces caspase-dependent cleavage of BAD. A mutant BAD resistant to caspase 3 cleavage blocked raloxifene-induced apoptosis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, data suggest that the mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist raloxifene induces apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in ERβ-positive TSU-PR1 through the cleavage of BAD. The cleaved products of BAD, in turn, caused cytochrome c release in TSU-PR1 cells. Because TSU-PR1 cells have been demonstrated recently to be a human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell line (23van Bokhoven A. Varella-Garcia M. Korch C. Miller G.J.

ERβ, first cloned in the rat prostate, is expressed in various human tissues. ERα is the predominant isoform in breast and uterine tissue, whereas ERβ is expressed in significant quantities in the urogenital tract, the central nervous system, and endothelial cells.

Proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins consist of multidomain members (Bax and Bak) and BH3 domain-only members (BAD, Bid, Bim, and Noxa). A BH-3 domain-only member interacts with a multidomain member upstream of an adaptor and of caspases. BH-3 domain-only members require multidomain Bax or Bak to initiate cytochrome c, Apaf-1-driven caspase activation, and caspase-independent mitochondrial dysfunction (18Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 29Cheng E.H.-Y.A. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindstein T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol.

BAD is a BH3 only proapoptotic member that shares substantial sequence homology only within the BH3 amphipathic α-helical domain (28Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.M.

It is known that BAD is phosphorylated on one or more of three serine residues, Ser-112, Ser-136, or Ser-155, in response to survival factors, and phosphorylation of these serines sequesters BAD in the cytosol, bound to 14-3-3 proteins (32Zha J.

Recently, it was shown that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or a PP2A-like phosphatase catalyzes BAD dephosphorylation and regulates its proapoptotic activity in IL-3-dependent lymphoid cells by a mechanism requiring dissociation from 14-3-3 (37Chiang C.-W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolokar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Upon increase in calcium influx or growth factor deprivation, phosphorylated BAD is rapidly dephosphorylated by the specific serine-phosphatase calcineurin (38Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M.

Cayla X. Rebollo A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane where, through its BH3 domain, it interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (18Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 28Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Following IL-3 deprivation of 32Dc13 myeloid precursor cells, BAD is cleaved at its N terminus to generate two smaller products, one very similar in size to the full-length protein (26 kDa) and the second ∼15 kDa. Transforming growth factor-β1 also induces caspase-dependent cleavage of BAD at its N terminus to generate a 15-kDa truncated protein (40Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cleavage of BAD in response to various apoptotic stimuli may be one of the major mechanisms in the process of apoptosis. In TSU-PR1 cells, raloxifene generates only the ∼15-kDa cleaved form of BAD. In vitro studies have shown that BAD is cleaved by capases 2, 3, 7, 8, and 10 (22). In this study, generation of the ∼15-kDa truncated form of BAD was blocked by the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that it is the product of caspase activity. Cleavage of BAD enhances sensitivity to apoptosis because raloxifene induces cell death more rapidly in cells expressing truncated BAD than in cells overexpressing wild-type BAD, whereas raloxifene-induced cell death is reduced in cells expressing caspase-resistant mutant BAD.Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including BAD and Bak, induce changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, often accompanied by cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of downstream caspases (28Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 39Ayllon V. Martinez-A C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bcl-XL inhibits cytochrome c release through a physical interaction with components of the voltage-dependent anion channel via a mechanism inhibited by several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (30Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 41Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Ju¨rgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L.A. Preávost M.-C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the transforming growth factor-β-induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release is inhibited by Bcl-XL (34Chipuk J.E. Bhat M. Hsing A.Y., Ma, J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26614-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Truncated BAD has a similar or higher affinity for Bcl-XL than wild-type BAD, and it is a more potent inducer of cytochrome c release than full-length wild-type BAD. It has been suggested that truncated BAD may be poorly phosphorylated at Ser-155 because phosphorylation of Ser-136 seems to be required for Ser-155 phosphorylation (22Condorelli F. Salomoni P. Cotteret S. Cesi V. Srivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3025-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This poor phosphorylation would enhance the interaction of truncated BAD with Bcl-XL. Therefore, increased generation of truncated BAD, induced by raloxifene, may result in enhanced cytochrome c release by antagonizing antiapoptotic Bcl-XL.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that raloxifene, a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist, induces apoptosis in TSU-PR1 cells. Cleavage of BAD, leading to the cytochrome c release, serves as a novel mechanism of raloxifene-induced apoptosis. These results provide valuable insight concerning the role of estrogen/estrogen receptor in bladder cancer cells. Because raloxifene has minimal side effects while effectively preventing osteoporosis and breast cancer, this study suggests raloxifene as a potential treatment in patients with advanced bladder cancer. Raloxifene is the prototypical selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)1 that has been shown to prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer (1Ettinger B. Black D.M. Mitlak B.H. Knickerbocker R.K. Nickelsen T. Genant H.K. Christiansen C. Delmas P.D. Zanchetta J.R. Stakkestad J. Gluer C.C. Krueger K. Cohen F.J. Eckert S. Ensrud K.E. Avioli L.V. Lips P. Cummings S.R. J. Am. Med.

Raloxifene binds to both ERα and ERβ with high affinity (3Bryant H.U. Glasebrook A.L. Yang N.N. Sato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1998; 13: 4252-4263Crossref Scopus (3814) Google Scholar); however, the binding affinity to ERα is four times higher than ERβ. Among the SERMs, raloxifene is unique in that it is an estrogen antagonist in the uterus (5Bryant H.U. Wilson P.K. Adrian M.D. Cole H.W. Phillips D.L. Dodge J.A. Grese T.A. Sluka J.P. Glasebrook A.L. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1996; 3: 152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the breast and bone, however, all SERMs act as estrogen antagonists and agonists, respectively (6Kauffman R.F. Bryant H.U. Drug News Perpect. 1995; 8: 531-539Google Scholar). The mechanism for the observed tissue-specific effect of SERMs is currently unknown. Two estrogen receptors (ERs) are known to mediate the physiological responses to estrogen, ERα (7Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar) and ERβ (8Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ERα and ERβ have revealed some overlap of function, but also have significant differences in their ligand-binding and transcriptional properties (11Couse J.F. Lindzey J. Grandien K. Gustafsson J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4613-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar,12Saville B. Wormke M. Wang F. Nguyen T. Enmark E. Kuiper G. Gustafsson J.-A. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5379-5387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). ERα and ERβ exhibit both differential and overlapping tissue distribution. Whereas ERα has been predominantly found in the anterior pituitary, uterus, vagina, testis, liver, and kidney, ERβ is predominantly expressed in thyroid, ovary, prostate, skin, bladder, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, cartilage, and bone (13Pelletier G. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 1261-1270PubMed Google Scholar, 14Taylor A.H. Al-Aawizz F. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In the epithelium of the urinary bladder of adult rat, high levels of ERβ, but not ERα, were detected (15Makela S. Strauss L. Kuiper G. Valve E. Salmi S. Santti R. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that ERβ plays an important role in the bladder. The finding that older ERβ knock-out mice exhibit prostate and bladder hyperplasia (16Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Couse J.F. Enmark E. Warner M. Mahler J.F. Sar M. Korach K.S. Gustafsson J.A. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15677-15682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) also suggests that the estrogen receptor is a reasonable target for therapeutic intervention in prostate and bladder cancer patients. Apoptotic stimuli activate caspases through mitochondria-dependent and mitochondria-independent pathways. The Bcl-2 family proteins serve as critical regulators of mitochondria-dependent pathways. Antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) reside in the mitochondria, whereas proapoptotic proteins (BAX, BAD, and BID) reside in the cytosol. Upon apoptotic stimuli, proapoptotic proteins translocate to the mitochondrial membrane, and mitochondria lose their membrane potential and release cytochrome c (17Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Lamensdorf I. Yoon S.-H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 18Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). In IL-3-dependent lymphoid cells, BAD is a key regulator of apoptosis (19Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The function of BAD is regulated by reversible phosphorylation and binding of 14-3-3 proteins (20Masters S.C. Yang H. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Fu H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Deprivation of survival factors induces BAD dephosphorylation by the specific serine/threonine phosphatase PP1α (21Salomoni P. Condorelli F. Sweeney S.M. Calabretta B. Blood. 2000; 96: 676-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3 proteins and translocation to the mitochondria, where BAD interacts with Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 and antagonizes their antiapoptotic functions. BAD is cleaved by a caspase(s) at its N terminus to generate a 15-kDa truncated protein following IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis in murine myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells. The 15-kDa truncated BAD is a more potent inducer of apoptosis than the wild-type BAD, whereas a mutant BAD, resistant to caspase 3 cleavage, is a weaker inducer of apoptosis (22Condorelli F. Salomoni P. Cotteret S. Cesi V. Srivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3025-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the effect of raloxifene on TSU-PR1, a cell line that was originally reported to be a human prostate cancer cell line but has been shown recently (23van Bokhoven A. Varella-Garcia M. Korch C. Miller G.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6340-6344PubMed Google Scholar) to be a bladder cancer cell line. Raloxifene treatment induces apoptosis in these cells and induces caspase-dependent cleavage of BAD. A mutant BAD resistant to caspase 3 cleavage blocked raloxifene-induced apoptosis. DISCUSSIONIn this study, data suggest that the mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist raloxifene induces apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in ERβ-positive TSU-PR1 through the cleavage of BAD. The cleaved products of BAD, in turn, caused cytochrome c release in TSU-PR1 cells. Because TSU-PR1 cells have been demonstrated recently to be a human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell line (23van Bokhoven A. Varella-Garcia M. Korch C. Miller G.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6340-6344PubMed Google Scholar), these observations provide a new potential therapeutic target for human bladder cancer.Raloxifene, an SERM that binds to both ERα and ERβ with high affinity (3Bryant H.U.

Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1998; 13: 4252-4263Crossref Scopus (3814) Google Scholar), is a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist. Raloxifene is a safe agent for prevention of both osteoporosis and breast cancer (1Ettinger B. Black D.M. Mitlak B.H. Knickerbocker R.K. Nickelsen T. Genant H.K. Christiansen C. Delmas P.D.

ERβ, first cloned in the rat prostate, is expressed in various human tissues. ERα is the predominant isoform in breast and uterine tissue, whereas ERβ is expressed in significant quantities in the urogenital tract, the central nervous system, and endothelial cells. ERα and ERβ exhibit differences in binding affinity and potency and might be differentially regulated in estrogen-sensitive tissues (26Weyant M.J. Carothers A.M. Mahmoud N.N. Bradlow H.L. Romotti H. Bilinski R.T. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2547-2551PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used TSU-PR1 cells to investigate the effect of raloxifene. TSU-PR1 cells were originally isolated as a human prostate cancer cell line, but recently van Bokhoven et al. (23van Bokhoven A. Varella-Garcia M. Korch C. Miller G.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6340-6344PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the cell line to be a human bladder cancer cell line. We observed that TSU-PR1 expresses ERβ, not ERα. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that estrogen/estrogen receptors may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in bladder cancer patients.Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis via heterodimerization between prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (27Oltvai Z.N.

These results suggest that cleavage of BAD in response to various apoptotic stimuli may be one of the major mechanisms in the process of apoptosis. In TSU-PR1 cells, raloxifene generates only the ∼15-kDa cleaved form of BAD. In vitro studies have shown that BAD is cleaved by capases 2, 3, 7, 8, and 10 (22). In this study, generation of the ∼15-kDa truncated form of BAD was blocked by the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that it is the product of caspase activity. Cleavage of BAD enhances sensitivity to apoptosis because raloxifene induces cell death more rapidly in cells expressing truncated BAD than in cells overexpressing wild-type BAD, whereas raloxifene-induced cell death is reduced in cells expressing caspase-resistant mutant BAD.Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including BAD and Bak, induce changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, often accompanied by cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of downstream caspases (28Yang E.

In contrast, Bcl-XL inhibits cytochrome c release through a physical interaction with components of the voltage-dependent anion channel via a mechanism inhibited by several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (30Shimizu S.

This poor phosphorylation would enhance the interaction of truncated BAD with Bcl-XL. Therefore, increased generation of truncated BAD, induced by raloxifene, may result in enhanced cytochrome c release by antagonizing antiapoptotic Bcl-XL.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that raloxifene, a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist, induces apoptosis in TSU-PR1 cells.

In this study, data suggest that the mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist raloxifene induces apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in ERβ-positive TSU-PR1 through the cleavage of BAD. The cleaved products of BAD, in turn, caused cytochrome c release in TSU-PR1 cells. Because TSU-PR1 cells have been demonstrated recently to be a human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell line (23van Bokhoven A. Varella-Garcia M. Korch C. Miller G.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6340-6344PubMed Google Scholar), these observations provide a new potential therapeutic target for human bladder cancer. Raloxifene, an SERM that binds to both ERα and ERβ with high affinity (3Bryant H.U. Glasebrook A.L. Yang N.N. Sato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.-A.

Raloxifene is a safe agent for prevention of both osteoporosis and breast cancer (1Ettinger B. Black D.M. Mitlak B.H. Knickerbocker R.K. Nickelsen T. Genant H.K. Christiansen C. Delmas P.D.

ERβ, first cloned in the rat prostate, is expressed in various human tissues. ERα is the predominant isoform in breast and uterine tissue, whereas ERβ is expressed in significant quantities in the urogenital tract, the central nervous system, and endothelial cells. ERα and ERβ exhibit differences in binding affinity and potency and might be differentially regulated in estrogen-sensitive tissues (26Weyant M.J. Carothers A.M. Mahmoud N.N. Bradlow H.L. Romotti H. Bilinski R.T. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2547-2551PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used TSU-PR1 cells to investigate the effect of raloxifene. TSU-PR1 cells were originally isolated as a human prostate cancer cell line, but recently van Bokhoven et al. (23van Bokhoven A. Varella-Garcia M. Korch C. Miller G.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6340-6344PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the cell line to be a human bladder cancer cell line. We observed that TSU-PR1 expresses ERβ, not ERα. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that estrogen/estrogen receptors may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in bladder cancer patients. Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis via heterodimerization between prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (27Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5837) Google Scholar, 28Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins consist of multidomain members (Bax and Bak) and BH3 domain-only members (BAD, Bid, Bim, and Noxa). A BH-3 domain-only member interacts with a multidomain member upstream of an adaptor and of caspases. BH-3 domain-only members require multidomain Bax or Bak to initiate cytochrome c, Apaf-1-driven caspase activation, and caspase-independent mitochondrial dysfunction (18Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 29Cheng E.H.-Y.A. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindstein T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). BAD is a BH3 only proapoptotic member that shares substantial sequence homology only within the BH3 amphipathic α-helical domain (28Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 31Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel K. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The activity of BAD is regulated by changes in phosphorylation and subcellular localization. It is known that BAD is phosphorylated on one or more of three serine residues, Ser-112, Ser-136, or Ser-155, in response to survival factors, and phosphorylation of these serines sequesters BAD in the cytosol, bound to 14-3-3 proteins (32Zha J.

Recently, it was shown that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or a PP2A-like phosphatase catalyzes BAD dephosphorylation and regulates its proapoptotic activity in IL-3-dependent lymphoid cells by a mechanism requiring dissociation from 14-3-3 (37Chiang C.-W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolokar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Upon increase in calcium influx or growth factor deprivation, phosphorylated BAD is rapidly dephosphorylated by the specific serine-phosphatase calcineurin (38Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. Mckeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) or PP1α (39Ayllon V. Martinez-A C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane where, through its BH3 domain, it interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (18Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 28Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Following IL-3 deprivation of 32Dc13 myeloid precursor cells, BAD is cleaved at its N terminus to generate two smaller products, one very similar in size to the full-length protein (26 kDa) and the second ∼15 kDa. Transforming growth factor-β1 also induces caspase-dependent cleavage of BAD at its N terminus to generate a 15-kDa truncated protein (40Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cleavage of BAD in response to various apoptotic stimuli may be one of the major mechanisms in the process of apoptosis. In TSU-PR1 cells, raloxifene generates only the ∼15-kDa cleaved form of BAD. In vitro studies have shown that BAD is cleaved by capases 2, 3, 7, 8, and 10 (22). In this study, generation of the ∼15-kDa truncated form of BAD was blocked by the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that it is the product of caspase activity. Cleavage of BAD enhances sensitivity to apoptosis because raloxifene induces cell death more rapidly in cells expressing truncated BAD than in cells overexpressing wild-type BAD, whereas raloxifene-induced cell death is reduced in cells expressing caspase-resistant mutant BAD. Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including BAD and Bak, induce changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, often accompanied by cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of downstream caspases (28Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 39Ayllon V. Martinez-A C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bcl-XL inhibits cytochrome c release through a physical interaction with components of the voltage-dependent anion channel via a mechanism inhibited by several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (30Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 41Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Ju¨rgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L.A. Preávost M.-C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the transforming growth factor-β-induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release is inhibited by Bcl-XL (34Chipuk J.E. Bhat M. Hsing A.Y., Ma, J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26614-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Truncated BAD has a similar or higher affinity for Bcl-XL than wild-type BAD, and it is a more potent inducer of cytochrome c release than full-length wild-type BAD. It has been suggested that truncated BAD may be poorly phosphorylated at Ser-155 because phosphorylation of Ser-136 seems to be required for Ser-155 phosphorylation (22Condorelli F. Salomoni P. Cotteret S. Cesi V. Srivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3025-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This poor phosphorylation would enhance the interaction of truncated BAD with Bcl-XL. Therefore, increased generation of truncated BAD, induced by raloxifene, may result in enhanced cytochrome c release by antagonizing antiapoptotic Bcl-XL. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that raloxifene, a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist, induces apoptosis in TSU-PR1 cells. Cleavage of BAD, leading to the cytochrome c release, serves as a novel mechanism of raloxifene-induced apoptosis. These results provide valuable insight concerning the role of estrogen/estrogen receptor in bladder cancer cells. Because raloxifene has minimal side effects while effectively preventing osteoporosis and breast cancer, this study suggests raloxifene as a potential treatment in patients with advanced bladder cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2073059198,"Neuroblastoma is a peripheral nervous system tumor that accounts for 8–10% of all solid childhood tumors. N-Myc is the most reliable prognostic indicator for neuroblastoma. Bcl-2 is detected in 40–60% of primary neuroblastoma tumors and demonstrates anti-apoptotic action by conferring resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. In neuroblastoma cell lines, the coexpression of N-Myc and Bcl-2 leads to increased tumorigenic properties. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases that degrade a wide range of basement membrane components, a process important for tumor invasion. This study investigates the effect of N-Myc and Bcl-2 on MMP expression and activation. MMP-2 expression and secretion are increased in SHEP neuroblastoma cells expressing Bcl-2 alone (SHEP/Bcl-2 cells) or both N-Myc and Bcl-2 (SHEP/N-Myc/Bcl-2 cells). MMP-2 activity is increased in the SHEP/N-Myc/Bcl-2 cells yet remains unchanged in SHEP/Bcl-2 cells. TIMP-2 expression is high in SHEP/Bcl-2 cells, which likely inhibits MMP-2 activity, and absent in SHEP/N-Myc/Bcl-2 cells, allowing MMP-2 activity. Invasion is increased in SHEP/N-Myc/Bcl-2 cells and prevented by the use of a pharmacologic MMP-2 inhibitor. These data imply that N-Myc and Bcl-2 cooperate to increase the expression, secretion, and activation of MMP-2, which likely leads to a more tumorigenic phenotype due to increased MMP-2 mediated invasion."

https://openalex.org/W2082147644,"Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitate uptake of growth-promoting polyamines (Belting, M., Borsig, L., Fuster, M. M., Brown, J. R., Persson, L., Fransson, L.-Å., and Esko, J. D. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 371–376). Increased polyamine uptake correlates with an increased number of positively chargedN-unsubstituted glucosamine units in the otherwise polyanionic heparan sulfate chains of glypican-1. During intracellular recycling of glypican-1, there is an NO-dependent deaminative cleavage of heparan sulfate at these glucosamine units, which would eliminate the positive charges (Ding, K., Sandgren, S., Mani, K., Belting, M., and Fransson, L.-Å. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 46779–46791). Here, using both biochemical and microscopic techniques, we have identified and isolatedS-nitrosylated forms of glypican-1 as well as slightly charged glypican-1 glycoforms containing heparan sulfate chains rich in N-unsubstituted glucosamines. These glycoforms were converted to highly charged species upon treatment of cells with 1 mml-ascorbate, which releases NO from nitrosothiols, resulting in deaminative cleavage of heparan sulfate at the N-unsubstituted glucosamines.S-Nitrosylation and subsequent deaminative cleavage were abrogated by inhibition of a Cu2+/Cu+ redox cycle. Under cell-free conditions, purified S-nitrosylated glypican-1 was able to autocleave its heparan sulfate chains when NO release was triggered by l-ascorbate. The heparan sulfate fragments generated in cells during this autocatalytic process contained terminal anhydromannose residues. We conclude that the core protein of glypican-1 can slowly accumulate NO as nitrosothiols, whereas Cu2+ is reduced to Cu+. Subsequent release of NO results in efficient deaminative cleavage of the heparan sulfate chains attached to the same core protein, whereas Cu+ is oxidized to Cu2+.

Gpc-type PG contain exclusively the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) attached to sites located close to the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor. The central part of the protein consists of a cysteine-rich globular domain that contains information that ensures a high level of HS substitution (8Chen R.L. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7507-7517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Many of the functions of Gpc are dependent on the polyanionic HS side chains, which are capable of binding and activating a variety of cationic growth factors and cytokines (5Filmus J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 19R-23RCrossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Filmus J. Selleck S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cationic polyamines are natural constituents of all cells and essential for growth and differentiation (for review see Ref. 9Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University, Oxford, UK1998Google Scholar). Inhibition of endogenous polyamine synthesis, e.g. by inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase with α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), results in increased polyamine uptake from the environment. We have shown that HS binds the polyamine spermine with an affinity that is 10 times greater than that of DNA (10Belting M. Havsmark B. Jo¨nsson M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that HS-containing cell surface PG facilitate uptake of spermine in DFMO-treated cells (11Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in PG synthesis are hypersensitive to growth inhibition by DFMO and have reduced polyamine uptake (12Belting M. Borsig L. Fuster M.M. Brown J.R. Persson L. Fransson L.-Å. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated recycling of Gpc-1 in normal fibroblasts and in transformed cells (for review see Ref. 13Fransson L.-Å. Belting M. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Moses J. Oldberg Å. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). During recycling the HS side chains are degraded, and new chains are synthesized on the stubs remaining on the core protein. Biosynthesis of a HS chain is a complex process that involves many enzymes, including several glycosyl- and sulfotransferases (for review see Ref. 14Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar).De novo HS assembly is initiated by a unique αGlcNAc transferase that adds the first GlcNAc to the common glycosaminoglycan-to-protein linkage region, glucuronic acid-Gal-Gal-Xyl (15Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By the alternating addition of glucuronic acid and GlcNAc, catalyzed by HS copolymerases, an extended, linear heparan backbone is formed. This backbone is extensively modified by the addition of sulfate groups in various positions and by C-5 uronosyl epimerization. The initial step in HS modification is the regional exchange of an uncharged N-acetyl for a negatively chargedN-sulfate on GlcN catalyzed by various isoforms ofN-deacetylase/sulfotransferase (NDST). The GlcN residue can also be N-unsubstituted and thereby positively charged (GlcNH 3+). NDST-1, -2, and -4 have an NDST ratio well below 1, whereas NDST-3 has a 10-fold higher deacetylase activity (16Aikawa J.-i. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression and participation of this isoform during HS biosynthesis could yield a significant proportion of GlcNH 3+. Alternatively, free amino groups could be generated when biosynthesis is completed,e.g. by N-desulfation catalyzed by sulfamidase or by further N-deacetylation when the sulfate donor is no longer available. We have found that brefeldin A (BFA)-treated cells accumulate a large size Gpc-1 glycoform with long HS chains containing clusters of GlcNH 3+ residues (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These clusters are concentrated to the reducing side of heparanase cleavage sites, especially near the linkage region to the core protein (18Ding K. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During recycling, the large Gpc-1 glycoform is degraded by pericellular and intracellular heparanase, generating HS oligosaccharides and a glycoform with truncated HS chains, still containing GlcNH 3+ residues (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Ding K. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These stubs are further eroded by NO-dependent deaminative cleavage at the GlcNH 3+ residues (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On this glycoform full size HS chains can then be resynthesized using the remaining HexUA-terminating stubs as primers. Resynthesis is inhibited by nitrite deprivation and restored when an NO donor is supplied (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). More recently, we have analyzed the effect of intracellular polyamine depletion on the structure of the HS chains in recycling Gpc-1. Cells with up-regulated polyamine uptake synthesize HS chains with an increased number of both GlcNH 3+residues and sulfated HexUA, often in close proximity to one another (19Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A summary of earlier findings is shown in SchemeFS1. In the present study, we have examined the NO-dependent degradation of HS in more detail. We have focused on a possible relationship between copper-dependentS-nitrosylation of the Gpc-1 core protein, subsequent NO release, and the deaminative cleavage of HS at GlcNH 3+. We have identified and isolated subpopulations containing S-nitroso groups (SNO) as well as Gpc-1 glycoforms carrying HS with a high content of GlcNH 3+ and studied their processing.

As secondary antibodies we used either fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled or Texas Red-labeled goat antirabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit antimouse Ig from Sigma.

The pretreatments with 5 mm DFMO and 1 μm spermine were carried out as described (11Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling was carried out using 20 μCi/mld-[6-3H]glucosamine and/or 50 μCi/ml of [35S]sulfate in sulfate-poor medium (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å.

The cells were extracted with radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA) followed by immunoisolation of all Gpc-1 glycoforms using anti-glypican-1 antiserum as described previously (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were also extracted with Triton X-100, and the PG were recovered by passage over DEAE-cellulose or by desalting on PD-10 (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å.

Separation of PG glycoforms and various degradation products was performed by gel permeation chromatography on Superose 6 or by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G.

HS chains and chain stubs were released from the core protein by treatment with alkaline borohydride (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å.

Enzymatic degradations of HS were performed with HS lyase and deaminative cleavage at GlcNH 3+ with HNO2 at pH 3.9 as described previously (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å.

Radioactivity measurements, buffer changes, concentrations, and recovery procedures as well as carriers were the same as described previously (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylated glypican was detected by adapting the method of Jaffrey et al. (22Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Temps P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). The cells were metabolically labeled withd-[6-3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm sodium nitroprusside and 0.01 mmCuCl2. After extraction of the cells with 2.5% SDS in neocuproine-containing buffer, blocking of free thiols with 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and desalting, the samples were biotinylated with biotin-BMCC in the absence or presence of 1 mml-ascorbate according to the description of the manufacturers. Biotinylated material was recovered on streptavidine-agarose and eluted with 4 m guanidine HCl. After dialysis against RIPA buffer, Gpc-1 was immunoisolated (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).S-Nitrosylated glycoforms were also isolated using anti-SNO-cysteine antiserum using the same method as for Gpc-1 (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at a concentration of 20,000 cells/well in chamber slides with covers (LabTek) and cultured in minimum essential medium overnight to obtain sparse cultures. The cells were left untreated or treated with 1 mml-ascorbate for 1 h and then washed with PBS three times, fixed, and permeabilized by treatments with acetone for 2–4 min followed by incubation with 1 ml of 2% (v/v) H2O2 in 60% (v/v) methanol for 15 min. After three 1-min washes with water, the cells were incubated with nonimmune serum (1:100 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibodies were applied: anti-SNO as described by the manufacturer, JM-403 at 1:1000 dilution, and anMan-specific antibody at 1:100 dilution and kept for 3 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and exposed to secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 2 h. Before microscopy the slides were washed again with PBS and air-dried. The controls with preimmune serum or with omission of either primary or secondary antibody were always run. Fluorescence images were obtained by using confocal laser scanning equipment (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad) attached to a Nikon Eclipse E800 upright microscope using the oil immersion objective. Excitation was obtained with an argon laser at 488 nm for fluorescein isothiocyanate and at 560 nm for Texas Red, and the emitted light was filtered with an appropriate long pass filter (cut-off levels were 540 and 605 nm, respectively). The images shown were obtained at a focal plane that was at the center of the cell and of 0.3–0.5 μm thickness. The images were digitized and transferred to Adobe PhotoShop for merging, annotation, and printing. We have previously demonstrated that Gpc-1 can contain HS chains with clusters of GlcNH 3+ residues, especially near the linkage region to the core protein (Ref. 18Ding K. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; see also Scheme FS1). In Gpc-1 synthesized by polyamine-depleted cells, GlcNH 3+ residues were found also in more distal regions of the HS chains (19Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An increased number of GlcNH 3+ units reduces the net negative charge of a HS chain and provides an increased number of cleavage sites for endogenously generated NO/nitrite. NO-dependent deaminative cleavage converts the positively charged GlcNH 3+ to a neutral anMan residue located at the reducing terminus of the released HS fragment. Thus, the remaining protein-bound HS chains become shorter and will have a greater net negative charge density than the undegraded chains. To search for Gpc-1 glycoforms with different net charge densities, we immunoisolated metabolically radiolabeled Gpc-1 produced by subconfluent untreated cells and by subconfluent cells exposed to DFMO to up-regulate spermine uptake and GlcNH 3+ formation (19Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NO, which induces the deaminative degradation of HS at GlcNH 3+, can be stored in proteins bound to cysteines as SNO groups (23Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Because NO can be released from SNO groups by treatment with l-ascorbate (22Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Temps P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar), we also isolated Gpc-1 produced by subconfluent cells that were exposed tol-ascorbate during up-regulation of GlcNH 3+ formation by DFMO. Total Gpc-1 from untreated cells afforded two major radiosulfated PG pools of either slightly negative charge density (I) or highly negative charge density (III) and one minor pool of intermediate charge density material (II) upon ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography on MonoQ (Fig.1A). Total Gpc-1 from cells treated with DFMO yielded larger amounts of the low and intermediate negatively charged glycoforms (pools I and II in Fig. 1B) than of the highly negatively charged form (pool III in Fig. 1B). In contrast, when ascorbate was included, the low and intermediate negatively charged forms (pools I and II) were much reduced, and the highly negatively charged glycoform (pool III) was the major one (Fig. 1C). To examine the size and the GlcNH 3+content of the HS chains in the Gpc-1 charge variants (Fig. 1,A–C), chains were released by alkali treatment and chromatographed on Superose 6 before and after deaminative cleavage (Fig. 2). HS chains from pool I in Fig. 1A comprised both large and small chains (Fig. 2A), whereas chains from pool III in Fig.1C were only small (Fig. 2C). Corresponding results were obtained with chains from the other pools I andIII in Fig. 1 (A–C); chains from poolsII gave intermediate patterns (data not shown). To estimate the content of GlcNH 3+, the alkali released HS chains were treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9 and rechromatographed. The long HS chains from a slightly negatively charged Gpc-1 (pool I in Fig. 1A) were extensively degraded (Fig. 2B; cf. Fig. 2A), whereas chains from a highly negatively charged glycoform (pool III in Fig. 1C) were only marginally degraded (Fig.2D; cf. Fig. 2C). Corresponding results were obtained with chains from the other pools I andIII in Fig. 1 (A–C) (data not shown). These results confirm that slightly negatively charged Gpc-1 glycoforms carry HS chains with a large number of GlcNH 3+residues. We also examined the Gpc-1 precursor to the recycling, partially degraded forms. The precursor was obtained after treatment with BFA (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Ding K. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), either from confluent cells with ongoing polyamine synthesis or from cells with inhibited endogenous synthesis, and chromatographed on MonoQ (Fig. 3). Both of them yielded broad elution profiles with no distinct separation into differently charged glycoforms. This is because their long side chains have not been subject to degradation by heparanase or by NO/nitrite (17Mani K. Jo¨nsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Ding K. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, as expected, the BFA-PG from DFMO-treated cells, which has a higher content of GlcNH 3+ than the PG from cells with undisturbed polyamine synthesis, yielded an elution profile that was displaced toward a lower ionic strength (Fig.3B). Formation of Gpc-1 glycoforms containing HS chains with very high GlcNH 3+ content was thus promoted by inhibition of endogenous polyamine synthesis (Figs. 1B and3B). Furthermore, subsequent conversion to glycoforms with a low content of GlcNH 3+ (Fig.1C) appeared to be generated by NO released from SNO groups by ascorbate. The SNO groups could either be situated in the Gpc-1 core protein or in other proteins. However, the central domain of Gpc core proteins contains 14 conserved cysteines, some of which could be potential sites for S-nitrosylation (1Bernfield M. Go¨tte M. Park P.-W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar, 8Chen R.L. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7507-7517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test whetherde novo synthesis of NO from arginine and generation of free nitrite were required for cleavage at the GlcNH 3+ residues in HS of Gpc-1, the NOS inhibitor nitroarginine and the nitrite quencher sulfamate were added to cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, ascorbate-generated conversion of the slightly charged glycoforms into the highly charged ones was abrogated neither by the NOS inhibitor nor by sulfamate, indicating that de novo formation of NO was not required and suggesting that NO acted directly on HS without a nitrite intermediate. The content of SNO groups in proteins is dependent on the Cu+/Cu2+ ratio, which controls the relative formation and decomposition kinetics (24Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18596-18603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 25Stubauer G. Giuffrè A. Sarti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28128-28133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because the copper ions may participate in a redox cycle, we used neocuproine to selectively chelate Cu+ and inhibit redox cycling. The cells treated in this manner synthesized mainly a slightly charged glycoform (pool I in Fig. 1E), whereas the intermediate and highly charged glycoforms were much reduced (pools II andIII in Fig. 1E), indicating that NO-dependent deaminative cleavage of HS was prohibited by chelation of Cu+. To test whether conversion of the slightly charged to the highly charged glycoform could be stimulated by supplementation with the copper ion, the cells were treated with Cu2+. The result showed that conversion of slightly charged to highly charged forms was increased (Fig. 1F), confirming that an endogenous Cu+/Cu2+ redox cycle supportedS-nitrosylation and NO release, resulting in subsequent deaminative cleavage of HS. However, ascorbate-generated release of NO appeared to be independent of copper ions, because conversion of slightly charged to highly charged Gpc-1 was not inhibited by neocuproine (Fig. 1G). Ascorbate was probably oxidized to dehydroascorbate. To search for the presence of intrinsic nitrosothiols in the Gpc-1 core protein, we subjected [35S]sulfate-labeled material from untreated cells to thiol-specific biotinylation in the absence or presence of ascorbate. Biotinylated material was isolated and checked for the presence of immunoreactive, radiolabeled Gpc-1. Significant yields of such material could only be recovered when ascorbate was included during the biotinylation procedure. Conversely, we also used anti-S-nitrosocysteine to isolate S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 from the total immunoisolated Gpc-1 pool. In the case of Gpc-1 produced by subconfluent untreated cells (Fig. 1A), SNO-containing Gpc-1 amounted to approximately one-third of the total population. In the case of DFMO-treated cells (Fig.1B), SNO-positive material amounted to approximately one-fifth. When SNO-containing Gpc-1 from polyamine synthesis-inhibited cells was subjected to ion exchange FPLC on MonoQ, it eluted in pool III (Fig. 1H), indicating that it contained HS chains that had already been processed by deaminative cleavage at the GlcNH 3+ residues. Thus, the results obtained so far suggested that formation of free amino groups precededS-nitrosylation and that S-nitrosylation of newly made Gpc-1 was slow, whereas NO release and subsequent deaminative cleavage were rapid. The BFA-arrested Gpc-1 precursor with long GlcNH 3+-containing HS chains (18Ding K. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) is poorlyS-nitrosylated. 2F. Cheng, K. Mani, J. van den Born, K. Ding, M. Belting, and L.-Å. Fransson, unpublished observations. Furthermore, in polyamine-deprived cells, the GlcNH 3+ content of the HS chains in this Gpc-1 glycoform can be further increased (Fig. 3B and Ref.19Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To examine whether purified, BFA-arrested Gpc-1 PG isolated from DFMO-treated cells could support autocleavage of its HS chains, we treated this PG with NO donor and Cu2+ in the absence or presence of ascorbate under cell-free conditions. The PG, which was purified on MonoQ and eluted in the void volume of Superose 6 (results not shown), remained undegraded after S-nitrosylation by using NO donor and Cu2+ (Fig.4A). When NO was subsequently released from the SNO groups by ascorbate, it was degraded into HS oligosaccharides and a PG with truncated HS chains (Fig.4B). Further treatment with alkali to release the HS stubs revealed the full extent of HS chain depolymerization (Fig.4C). When the covalent connection between the HS chains and the core protein of Gpc-1 were severed by alkali treatment prior toS-nitrosylation, HS was insensitive to degradation, even by repeated additions of NO donor, Cu2+, and ascorbate (Fig.4D). As a control, the released HS chains were treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (Fig. 4E). It is seen that the extent of depolymerization caused by autocleavage of HS attached to the core protein (Fig. 4C) and that obtained by the conventional deaminative cleavage (Fig. 4E) was similar. These results thus supported the notion that NO stored as nitrosothiols in the Gpc-1 core protein was released by ascorbate and was catalyzing the cleavage of the HS chains. If the agent (NO) and the substrate (HS) were part of the same molecule (Gpc-1), the reaction should be concentration-independent. It is unlikely that NO was derived from a contaminating NO donor, because this component would have to be strongly bound to Gpc-1 and resist dissociation by both urea and guanidine during purification of Gpc-1 by ion exchange and gel chromatography. It is remarkable that theS-nitrosylation/denitrosylation capacity could be restored after this treatment. We can conclude that Cu2+ ions, NO donor, and ascorbate are all needed to sustain efficient depolymerization of HS in Gpc-1 (Fig. 4). When copper ions were chelated (Fig. 1, E and F) or when ascorbate (Fig. 4A) or NO donor (cf. Fig.5, A and B) were omitted, the reaction was abolished or greatly impeded. The partial reaction in Fig. 5B could be due to the presence of some SNO groups in the starting material or to the generation of free radicals by copper ion and ascorbate. Preloading of purified Gpc-1 with Cu2+ prior to S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation and denitrosylation of preformed S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 resulted in a similar extensive depolymerization of HS (Fig. 5,C and D). Ascorbate treatment ofS-nitrosylated Gpc-1 recovered by using anti-SNO antiserum resulted in an incomplete degradation (Fig. 5E), probably because the reaction was initiated when immunoisolated Gpc-1 was bound to the protein A-Sepharose beads. These results thus suggest that there may be Cu2+-binding sites in the Gpc-1 core protein and lend further support to the notion that NO released from intrinsic nitrosothiols can catalyze deaminative cleavage of HS chains in the same Gpc-1 molecule. To visualize the autocatalytic processing of HS in cells, we used confocal scanning immunofluorescence microscopy. SNO groups detected by a polyclonal antiserum (Fig.6A, SNO-Cys) and HS chains containing GlcNH 3+ residues (Fig.6B, JM-403) colocalized distinctly, especially in compartments closely encircling the nucleus (Fig. 6C, Merged), indicating that a substantial portion of resident, intracellular Gpc-1 both is S-nitrosylated and carries HS chains with GlcNH 3+ residues. Total Gpc-1 had the same intracellular distribution (Fig. 6D, GPC, red). The SNO-containing epitope was almost completely obliterated upon ascorbate treatment (Fig. 6A, SNO-Cys + Ascorbate). When NO donor and Cu2+ were provided after ascorbate treatment, the SNO-containing epitope was partially restored (Fig. 6A, SNO-Cys + Ascorbate + SNP + CuCl2). The GlcNH 3+-containing epitope, which was prominent in untreated, subconfluent cells (Fig. 6B, JM-403), disappeared upon exposure to ascorbate (Fig.6B, JM-403 + Ascorbate). Concomitantly, HS oligosaccharides terminating with anMan appeared (Fig. 6B, AM + Ascorbate). The latter were localized to vesicles closely encircling the nuclei. No anMan-containing HS oligosaccharides were detected in untreated, subconfluent cultures (Fig. 6D, AM, no green). These results demonstrated intracellular cleavage of HS at GlcNH 3+, generated by NO that was released from SNO groups by ascorbate and concomitant production of HS oligosaccharides terminating with anMan. The present results show that Gpc-1 is another member of the constantly expanding class of proteins that can be functionally modified by S-nitrosylation (26Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Nudelman R. Stamler J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E46-E49Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The Gpc-1 core protein contains, in addition to 14 conserved Cys, several Asp and His residues in the central domain (27David G. Lories V. De cock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that could form the appropriate acid-base motifs in the tertiary structure (26Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Nudelman R. Stamler J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E46-E49Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The Gpc-1 core protein also contains several separate His residues that could form Cu2+-binding sites. The presence ofS-nitrosylated Gpc-1 was also demonstrated by confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy, which showed strong colocalization between S-nitrosothiols, Gpc-1, and HS epitopes comprising GlcNH 3+residues. We conclude that NO release from intrinsic nitrosothiols in the Gpc-1 protein initiates deaminative cleavage at the GlcNH 3+ residues of the HS chains, generating chain fragments or oligosaccharides terminating with anMan. Because blocking of Cu+/Cu2+ redox cycles inhibits S-nitrosylation and indirectly abrogates deaminative cleavage of HS, we propose that Gpc-1 undergoesS-nitrosylation/denitrosylation as shown in SchemeFS2. Cys residues in the globular part of the Gpc-1 core protein become S-nitrosylated with NO in a Cu2+-dependent reaction. It is possible that SNO groups form a noncovalent dipol-ion interaction with GlcNH 3+ residues in the HS chains. It is noteworthy that Gpc-1 glycoforms with long GlcNH 3+-rich HS chains cannot be quantitatively immunoprecipitated with anti-Gpc antiserum (18Ding K. Jo¨nsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recovery by immunoprecipitation is improved severalfold if the HS chains are removed, e.g. by treatment with HS lyase, or if NO is released by treatment with ascorbate. 3F. Cheng and K. Ding, unpublished observations. Although NO was released from SNO groups by ascorbate in these studies, the natural triggering mechanism remains unknown. Released NO may act directly on the GlcNH 3+ residues, particularly if nitroxyl anion (NO−) is the major species generated, which could be supported by oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ completing the redox cycle (Scheme FS2). The Gpc-1 core protein can thus store NO in a way that is reminiscent of that of hemoglobin, which can also take up and store NO as SNO. NO is later released when hemoglobin is deoxygenated (28Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The HS chains of Gpc-1 are subject to extensive degradation and remodelling during intracellular recycling (11Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When cells are treated with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor DFMO, endogenous polyamine synthesis diminishes and uptake from the environment is increased. This is correlated with an increase in the number of GlcNH 3+ residues, i.e.NO-sensitive cleavage sites (Scheme FS1). Polyamine deficiency may somehow affect HS metabolism by signaling to the biosynthetic machinery (up-regulation of NDST-3 and 2- O-sulfotransferase) or to the degradative pathway (induction/activation of sulfamidase). In either case, there will be more GlcN residues with a free, positively charged amino group. The results obtained in the present study show that, under such conditions, HS chains in Gpc-1 can become so extensively modified that the affinity for the anion exchanger MonoQ is markedly diminished, permitting the isolation of separate and distinct charge glycoforms. Presumably, all three HS chains need to display a substantial, simultaneous increase in their GlcNH 3+ content to generate charge glycoforms that can be separated from other Gpc-1 glycoforms. Self-processing of glypican, induced by NO release from intrinsic SNO groups, may be a critical step in the uptake and targeting of many different types of polyelectrolytes, including polyamines (11Belting M.

Hence, knowledge obtained by studying polyamine uptake may be useful as a model for the design of synthetic DNA delivery systems (30Luo D. Saltzman W.M. Nat.

In most eukaryotes Cdk7 is the catalytic subunit of a heterotrimeric CAK (Cdk7-cyclin H-Mat1) that is also involved in transcription as part of the transcription factor IIH complex. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CAK, Cak1p, is a monomeric protein kinase with an atypical sequence and unusual biochemical properties compared with trimeric CAKs and other protein kinases. We sought to determine whether these properties were shared by a small group of monomeric CAKs that can function in place of CAK1 in S. cerevisiae. We found that Schizosaccharomyces pombe Csk1, Candida albicans Cak1, and Arabidopsis thaliana Cak1At, like Cak1p, all displayed a preference for cyclin-free cdk substrates, were insensitive to the protein kinase inhibitor 5′-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA), and were insensitive to mutation of a highly conserved lysine residue found in the nucleotide binding pocket of all protein kinases. The S. pombe andC. albicans kinases also resembled Cak1p in their kinetics of nucleotide and protein substrate utilization. Conservation of these unusual properties in fungi and plants points to shared evolutionary requirements not met by Cdk7 and raises the possibility of developing antifungal agents targeting CAKs.

Input from numerous cellular processes must be integrated into each cell cycle decision, creating the requirement for multiple mechanisms of cdk control (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). cdk activity is modulated by the association of regulatory subunits (cyclins, cdk inhibitors, assembly factors) and by reversible phosphorylation events, both activating and inhibitory, at critical cdk residues (2Solomon M.J. Kaldis P. Pagano M. Cell Cycle Control: Regulation of CDKs by Phosphorylation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 79-109Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a threonine within the cdk “T-loop” (activation segment) is essential for maximal activity of the cell cycle cdks and is catalyzed by a cdk-activating kinase (CAK) (3Solomon M.J.

Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) as a portion of yeast TFIIH. Surprisingly, Kin28p possesses no CAK activity (21Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for CAK activity in budding yeast is an essential cytoplasmic protein, Cak1p (22Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O. Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cak1p has no CTD kinase activity (23Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), indicating that the roles of Cdk7 in cell cycle control and transcription are separated in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeinto Cak1p and Kin28p, respectively. Although Cak1p bears sequence similarity to cdks, it is active as a monomer (requiring neither cyclin binding nor an assembly factor) and is not phosphorylated in vivo (24Kaldis P. Pitluk Z.W. Bany I.A. Enke D.A. Wagner M. Winter E. Solomon M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3585-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Cak1p is an unconventional protein kinase in that its primary amino acid sequence lacks a number of conserved features. In particular, Cak1p lacks a canonical “glycine loop” in the nucleotide-binding fold and has substitutions in highly conserved core residues (23Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although it contains the “invariant lysine” essential for activity in all other protein kinases tested, this residue is completely dispensable for Cak1p activity both in vitro and in vivo (17Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cak1p is insensitive to 5′-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) (25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which covalently modifies the invariant lysine, leading to loss of activity in nearly all protein kinases, including Cdk2 (25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Cdk7 (5Solomon M.J. Harper J.W. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Both the glycine loop and the invariant lysine serve to position the ATP phosphates in protein kinases (26Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). Kinetic and mutagenic analysis demonstrated that Cak1p maintains high affinity for ATP despite its unusual sequence (25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, the substrate specificity of Cak1p is different from that of Cdk7. Whereas Cdk7 prefers cyclin-cdk complexes, Cak1p prefers monomeric cdk substrates (27Kaldis P. Russo A.A. Chou H.S. Pavletich N.P. Solomon M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This difference in substrate preference translates to different cdk activation pathwaysin vivo: Cdc28p, the yeast cell cycle cdk, is phosphorylated by Cak1p prior to cyclin binding (28Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1597-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) whereas vertebrate cdks bind cyclin prior to phosphorylation by Cdk7 (29Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although Cdk7 is found in all eukaryotes and, in most cases, acts as a cdk-activating kinase, a number of CAK variants have been found. Budding yeast Kin28p is the only known Cdk7 ortholog that does not possess CAK activity (21Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cak1p appears to have a homolog inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, Csk1. csk1(cyclin suppressing kinase) was first isolated as a high copy suppressor of an mcs2 mutant; Mcs2 is the cyclin partner of the S. pombe Cdk7 homolog Mcs6 (30Molz L. Beach D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which functions both as a CAK and as a subunit of TFIIH (31Buck V. Russell P.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is synthetically lethal with an mcs6 mutant (33Lee K.M. Saiz J.E. Barton W.A. Fisher R.P. Curr.

Vanderhaute J. Cottarel G. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7230-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Csk1 is active as a monomeric protein kinase and phosphorylates Mcs6 in vitro within the Mcs6 T-loop, leading to its activation (34Hermand D. Pihlak A. Westerling T. Damagnez V. Vanderhaute J. Cottarel G. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7230-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results point to a role for Csk1 as a CAK-activating kinase (34Hermand D. Pihlak A. Westerling T. Damagnez V. Vanderhaute J. Cottarel G. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7230-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). csk1 can rescue acak1 mutant in S. cerevisiae (35Hermand D. Westerling T. Pihlak A. Thuret J.-Y. Vallenius T. Tiainen M. Vandenhaute J. Cottarel G. Mann C. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and both Csk1 and Mcs6/Mcs2 may activate the S. pombe cdk Cdc2 in vitro, opening the possibility of redundant CAK functions (33Lee K.M. Saiz J.E. Barton W.A. Fisher R.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 441-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans also has a protein that resembles Cak1p. 2Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology Center, www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida. This C. albicans gene product can complement acak1 mutation in budding yeast (37Faye, G., Valay, J. G., Mann, C., and Thuret, J.-Y. (1999) Patent Application WO 99/07836, PCT/FR 98/01788Google Scholar). A screen for Arabidopsis thaliana cDNAs able to complement a budding yeast cak1 mutant yieldedCak1At, which was also able to complement a fission yeast CAK (mcs6) mutant (38Umeda M. Bhalerao R.P. Schell J. Uchimiya H. Koncz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5021-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cak1At resembles Cdk7 in sequence, phosphorylates Cdk2 within the T-loop in vitro, and exhibits no CTD kinase activity (38Umeda M. Bhalerao R.P. Schell J. Uchimiya H. Koncz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5021-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The complementation of a cak1mutant suggested that Cak1At functioned as a monomer. We have characterized the biochemical behaviors of thecak1-complementing protein kinases from S. pombe(Csk1), C. albicans (Cak1Ca), and A. thaliana(Cak1At). We were especially interested in establishing whether the properties that set Cak1p apart from the prevalent Cdk7-like CAKs were conserved in these proteins. Yeast media and protocols were from Ausubel et al. (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Boston1995Google Scholar). All yeast strains are based on W303-1A (MATa ade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 can1-100 ura3-1 trp1-1 ssd1-d) (40Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) with the specified alterations. The Cak1At gene was amplified by PCR from pYX112Cak1At (kind gift of M. Umeda) (38Umeda M. Bhalerao R.P. Schell J. Uchimiya H. Koncz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5021-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A silent mutation was introduced to create an NcoI site at the start codon. The C. albicans Cak1 gene, henceforth referred to asCak1Ca, was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA from strain CA14 (kindly provided by M. Hostetter). Primers were designed based on the sequence derived by Faye et al. (37Faye, G., Valay, J. G., Mann, C., and Thuret, J.-Y. (1999) Patent Application WO 99/07836, PCT/FR 98/01788Google Scholar) except that the second amino acid was mutated from lysine to alanine in order to introduce an NcoI site for cloning purposes. The genes were subcloned into pVT4 (41Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2381-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), in frame with the GST gene at the amino terminus (Cak1At was inserted intoNcoI-SalI; Cak1Ca was inserted intoNcoI-XbaI). Clones in pVT4 were used to produce recombinant baculoviruses with the Bac to Bac baculovirus expression kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cak1Ca, Cak1At, and csk1 (from a plasmid, kind gift of D. Hermand (34Hermand D. Pihlak A. Westerling T. Damagnez V. Vanderhaute J. Cottarel G. Ma¨kela¨ T.P.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) in frame with an amino-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag and under the transcriptional control of the ADHpromoter. S. cerevisiae CAK1 plasmids and baculoviruses have been described previously (25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The GSTCsk1 baculovirus was a kind gift of D. Hermand (34Hermand D. Pihlak A. Westerling T. Damagnez V. Vanderhaute J. Cottarel G. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7230-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lysine to alanine mutants at the positions marked by anasterisk in Fig. 1 were constructed by QuikChange site-directed PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the YEplac112 constructs as templates. All PCR products were sequenced. The C. albicans Cak1sequence agreed with one previously reported (37Faye, G., Valay, J. G., Mann, C., and Thuret, J.-Y. (1999) Patent Application WO 99/07836, PCT/FR 98/01788Google Scholar) and differed slightly from a sequence in the genomic data base produced and maintained by the Stanford Genome Technology Center (based on strain SC5314).2 In addition, a phenylalanine to leucine mutation was inadvertently introduced at the second to last residue in the GSTCak1At protein used in our in vitro studies. Because the protein was active in vitro and able to complementcak1Δ in S. cerevisiae (data not shown), the change was deemed of little significance. 1.5 × 109 Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the appropriate baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of ∼5. 48 h postinfection the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and GST-tagged proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA))). 10× high salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 900 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) was added to a final concentration of 1×. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 8,500 rpm in a Sorvall SA600 rotor for 10 min followed by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman type 60Ti rotor for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with a 0.5-ml bed volume of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), with rotation for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with PBS, and protein was eluted in elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). The elution product was supplemented with ovalbumin to 0.5 mg/ml, glycerol to 10%, and protease inhibitors (see above) and stored at −80 °C. The protein kinase activities of the purified GST-CAKs were assayed using human CDK2 produced in insect cells as a substrate (kind gift of A. Russo) (43Russo A.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each GST-CAK was incubated with 88 ng of CDK2 in the presence of 10 μm ATP and 5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP in CAK buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 10 mm DTT, 0.5% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors as above) in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, stopped with the addition of 5× sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The effect of cyclin on protein kinase activity was determined by carrying out kinase reactions as above except that CDK2 was preincubated with a 5-fold molar excess of a human cyclin A fragment (cyclin A173–432) (44Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagueá J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar)). The results were quantitated using a Fuji Phosphorimager. The Km(CDK2) of each protein was determined as follows: 5 μl of an enzyme and nucleotide mixture (appropriate amount of GST-CAK, 200 μm ATP, 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP in CAK buffer containing 150 mmNaCl) was mixed with 5 μl of substrate (CDK2 varying in concentration from 15 to 0.0586 μm or from 3.75 to 0.007 μm in the case of Cak1Ca). After 10 min at room temperature the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× sample buffer. The reaction products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and quantitated with a Fuji Phosphorimager, and data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph (Version 2.1.3, Abelbeck Software, Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Michigan). TheKm(ATP) was determined as follows: 5 μl of an enzyme and protein substrate mixture (appropriate amount of GST-CAK and amount of CDK2 equal to 5 times theKm(CDK2), except for Cak1At, in which case 47 μm CDK2 was used) was mixed with 5 μl of nucleotide (ATP varying in concentration from 180 to 0.08 μm at 0.06 μCi/pmol in CAK buffer containing 150 mm NaCl). Reactions were carried out and analyzed as for the Km(CDK2) determination. FSBA assays were carried out by incubating each GST-CAK with 1 mm FSBA or CDK2 with 20 μm FSBA in FSBA buffer (50 mm K+-Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, and protease inhibitors). As a control parallel reactions were performed in which the enzyme and FSBA mixture contained 20 mm DTT to preinactivate the FSBA. 5-μl aliquots were removed prior to and at various time points subsequent to FSBA addition. These were mixed with 5 μl of CAK buffer containing 20 mm DTT. To each reaction was added a 5-μl substrate mixture to assay for activity. For GST-CAKs this mixture contained 88 ng of CDK2, 10 μm ATP, and 0.5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP in CAK buffer. In the case of CDK2 the substrate mixture contained 267 μg/ml histone H1, 300 μm ATP, and 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, stopped with the addition of 5× sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. To establish whether the unusual properties of Cak1p are conserved in CAKs from other species, we examined a group of protein kinases that can complement cak1Δ in S. cerevisiae (Fig.1). The coding regions for S. pombe csk1, C. albicans Cak1, and A. thaliana Cak1At were subcloned into yeast expression vectors and also transposed onto bacmids from which recombinant baculoviruses were generated and used for protein expression in insect cells. The ability of each of these genes to complement cak1Δsuggested that the encoded proteins might function in the absence of regulatory subunits. To test this possibility, N-terminally GST-tagged fusions of the three protein kinases as well as budding yeast Cak1p were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using glutathione-agarose. Purification products were tested for their ability to phosphorylate CDK2 in vitro. All four proteins were active whereas no kinase activity was observed in a mock product from control uninfected insect cells (Fig.2). We titrated the amount of each enzyme used in our assays so that product yield versus enzyme concentration was in the linear range. Given the ability of these protein kinases to complement cak1Δ we wanted to determine whether their kinetic parameters resembled those of Cak1p. We were especially interested in determining whether the yeast CAKs bind ATP efficiently in the absence of a well conserved protein kinase motif at the amino terminus of the nucleotide binding fold, the glycine loop (Fig. 1). This motif, usually GXGXXG, is typically required for effective anchoring of the ATP phosphates (reviewed in Ref. 26Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). Cak1p can function efficiently in the absence of this motif (25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TheS. pombe and C. albicans proteins also lack a canonical glycine loop sequence (Fig. 1) (45Liu J. Kipreos E.T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using human CDK2 as a substrate we performed protein kinase assays at variable nucleotide and protein substrate concentrations to derive the Kmvalues for each kinase. Experiments were performed five times. Representative plots for each condition are shown in Figs.3(Km(CDK2)) and 4 (Km(ATP)), and the averages calculated in each case are summarized in TableI.Table IKinetic constantsCAKKm(CDK2)Km(ATP)μmμmCak1p0.805.0Csk14.68.5Cak1Ca0.041.8Cak1AtNDa60The Km(CDK2) andKm(ATP) of each CAK were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values shown are the averages of five independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The Km(CDK2) andKm(ATP) of each CAK were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values shown are the averages of five independent experiments. The values obtained for Cak1p agree with others previously derived in our laboratory: Km(ATP) = 5.0 μm and Km(CDK2) = 0.8 μm compared with 4.8 μm and 0.7 μm, respectively (25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The S. pombe andC. albicans enzymes also exhibited lowKm(ATP) values of 8.5 μmand 1.8 μm, respectively, demonstrating efficient nucleotide binding in the absence of a recognizable glycine loop. Because Cak1At had an immeasurably highKm(CDK2) (greater than 15 μm) it was not possible to achieve saturating protein substrate concentrations in our experimental setup for theKm(ATP) determination. The value of ∼60 μm is thus the apparent Km for ATP of Cak1At at the subsaturating CDK2 concentration of 47 μm. Km(CDK2) values for Csk1 and Cak1Ca were 4.6 μm and 0.04 μm, respectively. All the enzymes under study here, including S. cerevisiae Cak1p, possess an invariant lysine residue, equivalent to Lys-72 in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (26Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). This residue is conserved and required for activity in all tested protein kinases but is dispensable in Cak1p. To test the importance of this lysine in Csk1, Cak1Ca, and Cak1At, we treated these enzymes with FSBA, a nucleotide analog that covalently modifies the invariant lysine and inhibits the activity of all tested protein kinases other than Cak1p. After various durations of drug treatment, FSBA was inactivated with DTT, and the remaining protein kinase activities were determined. CDK2 is known to be FSBA-sensitive and was used as a positive control. The H1 kinase activity of CDK2 was completely inhibited after 30 min of treatment with FSBA (Fig. 5a, lanes 1–7, see also Ref. 25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When FSBA was inactivated by preincubation with DTT, CDK2 retained activity even after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 5a, lanes 8–14). The immediate reduction in activity in the presence of inactivated FSBA (Fig.5a, lane 9) was due to the ability of FSBA to compete with ATP for the nucleotide binding pocket of CDK2 (25Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This effect did not increase with incubation time. As previously shown, budding yeast Cak1p is relatively insensitive to treatment with FSBA at a concentration 50 times higher (1 mm) than was sufficient for complete inhibition of CDK2 (20 μm) (compare Fig. 5, a and b). Some Cak1p activity remained at 120 min of incubation with FSBA, whereas CDK2 was completely inactivated by 30 min in the presence of much less FSBA. Like Cak1p, Csk1, Cak1Ca, and Cak1At were also insensitive to FSBA and retained ∼50% activity through 2 h of drug treatment. The insensitivity to FSBA suggested that the position and role of the invariant lysine in the ATP-binding pocket of these CAKs was unusual. To determine whether this lysine is dispensable, as in Cak1p, we mutated the corresponding lysine in each protein (Fig. 1) to alanine and introduced the mutant gene into a yeast strain to evaluate its ability to complementcak1Δ. Briefly, aCAK1/cak1::HIS3diploid strain was transformed with the lysine mutant genes (denoted by the superscript KA in Fig. 6) or their wild-type versions on plasmids, and the cells were induced to sporulate. Tetrads were dissected, and the resulting colonies containing the CAK1 deletion and the plasmid were identified. A"
https://openalex.org/W2321475098,"Chromosomal deletions are a common feature of epithelial tumours and when further defined by homozygous deletions, are often the location of tumour suppressor genes. Deletions within the short arm of chromosome 3 occur very frequently in human carcinomas: a minimal region of loss at 3p21.3 (the Luca) region has been defined by overlapping homozygous deletions in lung and breast cancer cell lines. Using a rapid strategy for Cre-loxP chromosome engineering, a deletion of approximately 370 kb was created in the mouse germline corresponding to the deleted region at 3p21.3. The deletion when homozygous is embryonic lethal. Heterozygotes develop normally despite being haplo-insufficient for twelve genes including the candidate tumour suppressor gene Rassf1. Because damage to 3p21.3 often occurs very early in the sequence of genetic changes that lead to malignancy, particularly in lung and breast cancer, further genetic damage to these mice will provide the opportunity to model multi-step tumorigenesis of these tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2039344584,"The small basic protein p14ARF, encoded by one of the alternative transcripts from the human INK4A/ARF locus, interferes with MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of the p53 tumour suppressor protein. The resultant stabilization of p53 leads to increased expression of p53-regulated genes, such as MDM2 itself and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1). Here we relate physical interactions between p14ARF and MDM2, as determined using synthetic peptides and systematic deletions of p14ARF, with consequential effects on p53 stabilization and transcriptional activity. The data imply that the amino terminal half of p14ARF, encoded by the alternative first exon (exon 1beta) contacts MDM2 through multiple domains that can independently impede MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, provided that they are localized in the cell nucleus. As well as identifying previously unrecognized functional domains, our findings offer an explanation for the relative paucity of missense mutations in exon 1beta in human tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2085000906,"Androgen is involved in both normal development and malignant transformation of prostate cells. The signal transduction pathways associated with these processes are not well understood. Using a novel kinase display approach, we have identified a protein kinase, human male germ cell-associated kinase (hMAK), which is transcriptionally induced by the androgenic hormone 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The kinetics of induction is rapid and dose-dependent, and the induction is not blocked by cycloheximide treatment. Real time reverse transcription-PCR studies demonstrated a 9-fold induction of hMAK by 10 nm DHT at 24 h post-stimulation. The expression levels of hMAK in prostate cancer cell lines are in general higher than those of normal prostate epithelial cells. A reverse transcription-PCR product encompassing the entire hMAK open reading frame was isolated. The results from sequencing analysis showed that the hMAK protein is 623 amino acids in length and contains a kinase catalytic domain at its N terminus, followed by a proline/glutamine-rich domain. The catalytic domain of this kinase contains sequence motifs related to both the cyclin-dependent kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase families. When expressed in COS1 cells, hMAK is kinase-active as demonstrated by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of exogenous substrate and is localized in the nucleus. A 3.7-kilobase pair promoter of the hMAK locus was isolated from a human genomic DNA bacterial artificial chromosome clone and was shown to be activated by DHT. This activation can be blocked by an anti-androgen drug bicalutamide (Casodex), implicating the involvement of androgen receptor in this process.

Normal prostate epithelial cells depend on androgen for growth and differentiation (2Kokontis J.M. Liao S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 219-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Craft N. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Prostate cancer cells begin with androgen-dependent growth but later undergo a transition to an androgen-independent state (4Sadar M.D. Hussain M. Bruchovsky N. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 1999; 6: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Pilat M.J. Kamradt J.M. Pienta K.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Anti-androgen therapy helps control the early phase of the disease but is not curative, because of the emergence of androgen-independent tumor cells (6Klotz L. Cancer. 2000; 88: 3009-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms of androgen action and the development of androgen insensitivity is key to the improvement of current therapies for prostate cancer. Interestingly, even at the androgen-independent state, a significant fraction of prostate cancer cells express AR, raising the possibility that androgen independence, at least in part, is caused by constitutive activation of AR in the absence of ligand (7Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is conceivable that signals downstream from androgen are constitutively activated, bypassing the need for androgen and AR. In either case, it is important to understand the fundamentals of AR-mediated signaling. The detailed mechanism whereby AR transmits growth signals is a subject of intensive investigation. As a transcription factor, AR can participate in the direct activation or repression of key regulators involved in growth and cell cycle progression (8Culig Z. Hobisch A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Urol.5 Res. 2000; 28: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has been shown that androgen can induce the expression level of cell cycle promoting genes such as CDK2 and CDK4 and can down-regulate the cell cycle inhibitor p16, thus allowing prostate cells to enter the S phase (9Lu S. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4511-4516PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 can be modulated by androgenic hormone, and androgen independence is found to correlate with the sustained repression of these CDK inhibitors (10Chen Y. Robles A.I. Martinez L.A. Liu F. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Conti C.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1571-1578PubMed Google Scholar). A number of androgen-induced genes have been reported, including AIbZIP (11Qi H. Fillion C. Labrie Y. Grenier J. Fournier A. Berger L., El- Alfy M. Labrie C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Some of these genes contain androgen response elements (AREs) in their promoter sequences and are direct transcriptional targets of AR (12Lu S. Liu M. Epner D.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Mol.

The relationship of these direct targets to growth is less clear, and some of them may be involved in differentiation, a physiological function of androgen in the development of the prostate. How activated AR mediates proliferative signals remains largely unclear. It was reported that androgen treatment results in the activation of Src and MAPK activity, as well as their associated signaling pathways (21Migliaccio A. Castoria G., Di Domenico M. de Falco A. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Barone M.V. Ametrano D. Zannini M.S. Abbondanza C. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5406-5417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Peterziel H. Mink S. Schonert A. Becker M. Klocker H. Cato A.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The search for the direct target genes of AR, which may participate in these kinase signal cascades, should advance our understanding of how androgen induces cell growth. It will also help to uncover potential targets for the therapeutic intervention of prostate cancer during the transition from the androgen-dependent state to the androgen-independent state. With this in mind, we began to look for protein kinases that are direct transcriptional targets of AR. We took advantage of a kinase display approach previously developed in our lab, which allows the profiling of tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases by a single RT-PCR reaction (23Robinson D., He, F. Pretlow T. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5958-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). When this approach was applied to the study of prostate cancer cells, we uncovered a novel human serine/threonine kinase, hMAK (23Robinson D., He, F. Pretlow T. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5958-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This kinase shares significant homology with rat MAK, a rat serine/threonine kinase originally discovered as a male germ cell-associated kinase (24Matsushime H. Jinno A. Takagi N. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). One intriguing feature of rat MAK is its highly restricted expression pattern in testis and at specific stages of spermatogenesis. Together with its closely related kinases MRK (MAK-related kinase) and MAPK/MAK/MRK-overlapping kinase (MOK), MAK forms a new subfamily of serine/threonine kinases with closest homology to CDK and MAPK family of kinases (25Miyata Y. Nishida E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Other than the structural and expression properties of these kinases, very little is known about their roles in cellular processes. In this study, we reported the cloning of the hMAK gene in its entirety. Structurally, hMAK carries a kinase domain at its N terminus, followed by a proline/glutamine-rich domain. It also contains a canonical sequence for nuclear transport or nuclear localization signal (NLS). Significantly, we have shown by kinase display and real time RT-PCR approaches that hMAK is transcriptionally activated by treating human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with DHT. The promoter for hMAK was then isolated and shown to be transactivated by androgen treatment, confirming the in vivo induction results, and the induction is blocked by the anti-androgen bicalutamide (BI or Casodex), implicating the involvement of AR in this process. We also showed that hMAK has a basal kinase activity and is localized in the nucleus. We suggest that hMAK might play a role in the AR-mediated signaling pathway. DHT (Sigma) was dissolved in highly refined ethanol (Gold Shield Chemical Co., Hayward, CA) at 1 mm(10−3m) concentration as stock solution. Serial 10-fold dilutions were made from this stock solution to prepare DHT solutions of different concentrations, which were diluted 1:1000 to make the final concentrations of DHT needed to treat cells. BI was a gift from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (Plankstadt, Germany) and was dissolved in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 10 mm and stored at −20 °C. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was prepared as a 10 mg/ml solution in ethanol. Primary cultures of normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in serum-free prostate epithelial cell growth medium following the vendor's directions. The prostate carcinoma cell lines LNCaP-FGC (LNCaP), DU145, and PC-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LNCaP is an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line expressing AR and prostate-specific antigen and was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Invitrogen. 22Rv1 is an AR-positive prostate cancer cell line derived from a relapsed xenograft, kindly provided by Dr. Thomas G. Pretlow and Dr. James W. Jacobberger (26Sramkoski R.M. Pretlow II, T.G. Giaconia J.M. Pretlow T.P. Schwartz S., Sy, M.S. Marengo S.R. Rhim J.S. Zhang D. Jacobberger J.W. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Although its growth no longer requires androgen, the 22Rv1 cell line is still androgen-responsive. DU145 and PC-3 are androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines that do not express AR or prostate-specific antigen and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. DU145 is from a brain metastasis, and PC-3 is from a bone metastasis. Total RNA samples were isolated from human prostate cell lines by Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen). These samples were used to study the kinase expression profile using a kinase display approach developed earlier in our lab (23Robinson D., He, F. Pretlow T. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5958-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Following reverse transcription using kinase family RT primers, PCR amplification was performed using the highly redundant degenerate primers recognizing the invariable motifs of subdomains VII–XI of kinase catalytic domains. As a modification of this approach, the 5′-ends of the sense primers were radioactively labeled with [γ-33P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) by polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (27Robinson D. Chen H.C., Li, D. Yustein J.T., He, F. Lin W.C. Hayman M.J. Kung H.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kung H.J. Chen H.C. Robinson D. J. Biomed.

PCR amplicons were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, quantitated for radioactivity, and then divided into aliquots of equal counts. Aliquots of the radioactive RT-PCR products were digested with different restriction endonucleases and separated on a DNA sequencing gel. The resolved 5′-end-labeled restriction fragments were analyzed by comparison with our kinase restriction fragment data base and quantitated using the Molecular Imager FX phosphor image detection system (Bio-Rad). The 144-bp RT-PCR amplicon that encodes a portion of the kinase catalytic domain of hMAK was initially recovered from the kinase profile study of human prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 (23Robinson D., He, F. Pretlow T. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5958-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-termini of hMAK sequences, obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach, were used to amplify the hMAK coding sequences from reverse transcribed pooled human testis RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with the High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR products containing the full-length hMAK coding region were then cloned into pCR® 2.1-TOPO using the TOPOTM TA Cloning® kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using an ABI cycle sequencing system. The full-length coding region of hMAK was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF-1 (Invitrogen), which utilizes an EF1-α promoter to drive the expression of the inserted gene. A 12-amino acid HA epitope tag (MGYPYDVPDYAS) or an 11-amino acid T7 epitope tag (MASMTGGQQMG) was introduced in-frame at the N terminus of hMAK, and the reading frames were verified by automated DNA sequencing. To make a kinase-dead hMAK (hMAK-KR) expression construct, a nucleotide point mutation was introduced into the pEF-1 mammalian expression vectors containing the epitope-tagged hMAK using the QuikChange® kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). This substitution mutation will result in the replacement of the invariant lysine located in the ATP-binding pocket of hMAK kinase domain with an arginine residue and make hMAK catalytically inactive (dead). The primer sequences used in making the hMAK-KR mutant are as follows: sense, 5′-GTGGCCATCAGAAGGATGAAGAGAAAGTTCTATTC-3′; and antisense, 5′-CTCTTCATCCTTCTGATGGCCACCAGCTCCCCGGATTC-3′. The mutated nucleotide is underlined. The resultant point mutation was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Total RNA samples (20 μg each) from human prostate cell lines were reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)20 primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's protocol. 2.5% of the RT reaction volume (1 μl, corresponding to 250 ng of the original input RNA) was used for each subsequent 50-μl PCR reaction. Primer sequences used to amplify hMAK fragment are listed as follow: sense 5′-TCCAAGATGAACCGATACACAACC-3′, and antisense 5′-CAGCAATTTTCACAAGCTCTGGAC-3′. The PCR reactions were conducted at 95 °C for 1 min; 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles; and 72 °C for 2 min. RT-PCR was also performed for human β-actin as a control to check the amount and integrity of the total RNA samples. β-Actin primer sequences are: sense, 5′-GAAACTACCTTCAACTCCATC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGAC-3′. PCR amplification parameters for β-actin are the same as those for hMAK, except that 25 cycles of amplification were performed to ensure that the reaction remained in the log phase. To study the kinetics of hMAK expression following androgen treatment, the androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS (CDS) from HyClone (Logan, UT) for 48 h. The LNCaP cells were then cultured in the absence or presence of different concentration of DHT for 24 h. The cells were harvested, and the total RNA samples were isolated. Reverse transcription reactions were carried out using oligo(dT)20primers, and the cDNA was amplified separately by PCR either for hMAK or for β-actin as described above. Forty cycles were programmed for real time quantitative RT-PCR to analyze these samples on an iCycler iQ Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). A highly sensitive fluorescent dye SYBR Green I (FMC, Rockland, ME) was used for double strand DNA detection. The iCycler iQ system allows kinetic measurements of a PCR process and reports data in real time. Easy-to-ScreenTM DNA pools (Incyte Genomics, St. Louis, MO) were used to quickly identify hMAK positive clones from a human genomic DNA BAC library. The primer set used for PCR screening is unique to the 5′-untranslated region of hMAK mRNA. The primer sequences are as follows: sense, 5′-GTTGTTTCCTTGCCCGATTCCTTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TACTCTTGCCCATAAGCACACTCC-3′. Once positive clones were identified, individual BAC clones were purchased from Incyte Genomics and then amplified. Using one of the BAC clones containing the hMAK gene (described above) as a template, a 3.7-kbp DNA fragment containing the hMAK promoter was obtained by PCR amplification. Sequences of the primers used in PCR amplification are: sense, 5′-TTAAGGTGGAGGTTGGGGTAGGTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TAGCATGAAGGAATCGGGCAAG-3′. The PCR product containing the hMAK promoter was cloned into the pCR® 2.1-TOPO vector as described above and was then subcloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) between the KpnI andXhoI sites. This 3.7-kbp fragment of the hMAK promoter region encompasses the transcription start site. The 5′- and 3′-ends of this fragment are 3919 and 179 bp upstream of the hMAK translation initiation codon, respectively. COS1 cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids containing T7-tagged hMAK using FuGENE 6TM reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine the expression of hMAK by Western blotting, cell lysates containing 25 μg of total protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% Tris-glycine gel. For immunodetection, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, San Jose, CA) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated in mouse monoclonal antibody to T7 epitope tag (Novagene, Madison, WI) at 1 μg/ml in TBST plus 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:10,000 (50 ng/ml). Detection was performed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent system (Pierce) according to the vendor's directions. LNCaP cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105/well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and the pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) were transfected into LNCaP cells using the Lipofectin® reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The next day, the cells were fed with fresh medium containing 1% CDS plus DHT and/or BI at different concentrations. The cells were lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) 24 h after hormone treatment. To measure the reporter activity, a dual luciferase assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol using an EG & G Berthold LB96V MicrolumatPlus microplate luminometer (PerkinElmer-Wallac, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). At least three independent experiments were performed in each setting. In vitro kinase assay was conducted on COS1 cells cultivated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected either with empty expression vector as a control or with expression plasmid containing T7 epitope-tagged full-length wild type or KR mutant hMAK, respectively. T7-tagged hMAK proteins were immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell lysate aliquots by incubation with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody and capture with protein A-coupled Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times in RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and then rinsed twice with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Kinases captured in the immune complex were incubated with 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm ATP, 1 μg of exogenous substrates such as myelin basic protein and supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP. After incubating at room temperature for 30 min, the reactions were terminated by adding 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. The gel was exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. COS1 cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). After overnight culture, the cells were transfected with mammalian expression vector pEF-1 with or without HA-tagged hMAK. Two days after transfection, the cells on the coverslips were fixed with cold acetone/methanol (1:1) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST. Following incubation with 5 μg/ml anti-HA monoclonal primary antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA), the cells were washed three times with TBST and incubated with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA). After three more washes in TBST, the coverslips were mounted on slides by inverting on a small drop of aqueous mounting media (Vector). Immunofluorescence stained cells were examined under the Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). AR is known to be a transcription factor, and its action is mediated through the activation of target genes. There is considerable evidence indicating that androgen treatment activates various kinase-signaling pathways (21Migliaccio A. Castoria G., Di Domenico M. de Falco A. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Barone M.V. Ametrano D. Zannini M.S. Abbondanza C. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5406-5417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Peterziel H. Mink S. Schonert A. Becker M. Klocker H. Cato A.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that there exist kinases that are transcriptionally activated by AR. In an attempt to identify such kinases, we took advantage of the kinase profile approach developed earlier in our lab, based on the use of a set of degenerate primers that recognize nearly all tyrosine kinases and a subset of serine/threonine kinases (23Robinson D., He, F. Pretlow T. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5958-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have now modified this approach by radioactively labeling the 5′-end of the sense primer, followed by restriction endonuclease digestions of the radioactive RT-PCR products and subsequent gel analysis of the 5′-end-labeled fragments. Based upon the sizes of the labeled fragments, individual kinases can be “read” directly from the electropherogram. By digesting with multiple enzymes and displaying all of the radioactive labeled bands in a single gel, the expression profiles of kinases can be effectively identified (27Robinson D.

This approach, based on direct radioactive labeling, does not depend on hybridizations and is highly sensitive. It is also highly quantitative for low abundance genes such as certain protein kinases. This kinase display approach has been fruitfully used by us and by other labs to obtain the tyrosine kinase expression profiles of tumor samples, to identify overexpressed kinases, and to discover novel kinases (23Robinson D., He, F.

Relying on its high sensitivity, we have applied this approach for the detection of androgen-inducible kinases. Human androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells were chosen for this study. Total RNA samples were collected from LNCaP cells with or without DHT treatment. RT-PCR was conducted u"

A variety of other proteins are prone to aggregation when mutated, indicating that this process is a common pathologic mechanism for inherited disorders. However, little is known about the relationship between the sequence of aggregating peptides and the specificity of intracellular accumulation. Here we demonstrate that substitution of two residues eliminates aggregation of a 111-amino acid peptide derived from the C-terminal portion of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). We also show that fusion to a reporter protein considerably alters the subcellular distribution of aggregating peptide. When fused to green fluorescent protein, the peptide containing amino acids 1370–1480 of CFTR accumulates in large perinuclear or nuclear aggregates. The same CFTR fragment devoid of green fluorescent protein localizes predominantly to discrete accumulations associated with mitochondria. Importantly, both types of accumulation are dependent on the presence of the same two amino acids within the CFTR sequence. Co-expression studies show that both CFTR-derived proteins can co-localize in large cytoplasmic/nuclear aggregates. However, neither CFTR construct accumulates in intracellular inclusions formed by N-terminal fragment of huntingtin. In addition to unique accumulation patterns, each aggregating peptide shows differences in association with chaperone proteins. Thus, our results indicate that the process of intracellular aggregation can be a selective process determined by the composition of the aggregating peptides.

The first is loss of protein function, which is often accompanied by improper localization and rapid degradation of defective product (1Gregersen N. Bross P. Jorgensen M.M. Corydon T.J. Andresen B.S. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Many genetic disorders, including familial hypercholesterolemia, Tay-Sachs disease, and maple syrup urine disease, are caused by mutations that affect the folding of an essential protein, leading to the loss of its function (reviewed in Ref. 2Thomas P.J., Qu, B.H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). A different mechanism of pathogenesis is associated with so-called conformational diseases (3Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 4Carrell R.W. Gooptu B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In this case, the disease is associated with toxic properties of aggregation-prone folding intermediates. However, it is not clear whether observed aggregation of misfolded proteins is a primary cause or merely a consequence of disease. The most intensively studied examples of conformational diseases are Alzheimer's disease (7Selkoe D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 924: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), Parkinson's disease (8Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Cell. 1997; 89: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Abnormal protein folding is also a cause of most cases of cystic fibrosis (CF)1 (11Qu B.H. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Riordan J.R. Am. J. Hum.

The most common CF-causing mutation, ΔPhe-508, a deletion of a single phenylalanine, affects the folding of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (15Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souzo D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Protein bearing this mutation does not fold properly during an early step of biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Consequently, the misfolded CFTR cannot be efficiently transported to the Golgi compartment, where wild type protein undergoes further maturation before being exported to the plasma membrane. As a result of a processing defect, the mutant protein is retained in ER and subsequently degraded by the proteasome complex. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that the ΔPhe-508 CFTR, when overexpressed in cell culture, is able to aggregate and form large microtubule-dependent cytoplasmic inclusion bodies called aggresomes (16Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). Since this discovery, the formation of aggresomes has been described for a number of other proteins, including a GFP-p115 chimera (17Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J.

Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Although it has not been proven that aggregation of CFTR contributes to the pathogenesis of CF, the process of intracellular accumulation of this protein is often regarded as a suitable model for regulated deposition of misfolded polypeptides (25Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Our studies of CFTR biogenesis and trafficking have been focused on its carboxyl-terminal sequence. We have recently demonstrated that the C terminus of CFTR alone, or when fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP), is able to localize to the correct apical domain of the plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells (26Milewski M.I. Mickle J.E. Forrest J.K. Stafford D.M. Moyer B.D. Cheng J. Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Cutting G.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, localization to the apical membrane is observed only after a region of nine amino acids (ag region) is removed from the C-terminal CFTR sequence. Presence of the ag region in the C-terminal sequence fused to GFP results in accumulation of the fusion protein in large perinuclear or nuclear aggregates. This suggests that the ag region is a part of larger folding domain and that disruption of this domain causes protein misfolding and aggregation. To characterize the sequence responsible for aggregation of CFTR C-terminal peptides and to elucidate the relationship between amino acid sequence and the corresponding protein accumulation pattern, we have analyzed the cellular distribution and composition of aggregates formed by different CFTR-derived constructs. We have also compared the process of accumulation of CFTR-derived peptides with aggregation of the N-terminal portion of huntingtin, a protein mutated in Huntington's disease. Here we report that two conserved amino acids within the ag region are critical for the aggregation of the CFTR C terminus, and that different aggregating peptides show remarkable specificity with regard to their intracellular distribution and association with other proteins. All constructs utilized the pRK5-SK mammalian expression plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus promoter. Construction of GFP-CFTR 1370–1480 hybrid and its Δag version has been described previously (26Milewski M.I. Mickle J.E. Forrest J.K. Stafford D.M. Moyer B.D. Cheng J. Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Cutting G.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other mutant versions of the GFP-tagged CFTR C-terminal construct were created using the site-directed mutagenesis system Transformer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The Transformer mutagenesis system was also used to create the untagged and the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged C-terminal constructs and their derivatives. The sequences of selection primers and mutagenic primers used to create point mutations, deletions, and insertions in the CFTR-derived constructs are available upon request. The N63-Q75-Myc-His construct containing the 63 N-terminal amino acids of huntingtin with 75 glutamine repeats has been described elsewhere (27Cooper J.K. Schilling G. Peters M.F. Herring W.J. Sharp A.H. Kaminsky Z. Masone J. Khan F.A. Delanoy M. Borchelt D.R. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). IB3–1 bronchial epithelial cells derived from a CF patient were cultured as described (28Zeitlin P.L., Lu, L. Hwang T.C. Rhim J. Craig R. Cutting G.R. Stetton G. Kieffer K.A. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For protein localization analysis, cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected using the Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In the co-transfection experiments, a 1:1 DNA ratio was used for plasmids encoding different peptides. At 36–48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and, if not immunostained, mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) containing 0.1 mg/ml DAPI (Sigma). To disrupt microtubules, cells were incubated for 3 h or overnight in fresh media containing 33 μm nocodazole (Sigma) and fixed as described above. The overnight treatment with nocodazole was started 24 h after transfection. The disruptive effect of nocodazole treatment on the structure of microtubular network was tested in parallel experiments by immunostaining microtubules with anti-β-tubulin antibody. Monoclonal antibodies against HA and c-Myc epitopes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-HA antibody and monoclonal anti-CFTR C-terminal antibody were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against β-tubulin and Golgi marker γ-adaptin were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against mitochondrial marker GRP75, ER marker protein disulfide isomerase, heat shock proteins HSP90 and HSP27, as well as polyclonal antibodies against mitochondrial marker HSP60, ER marker calnexin, and molecular chaperones HSP70, HSC70, HSP40, and α-B-crystallin were from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from CLONTECH. Prior to immunostaining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and washed with PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2.5% goat serum in PBS. Staining was performed by two sequential incubation steps. Cells were first incubated with the primary antibody for 1.5 h, and then with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) or Cy3 (red) fluorescent dye (Sigma) for 30 min. The antibodies were used in dilutions recommended by the manufacturer. After staining, the coverslips with cells were washed in PBS and mounted in SlowFade with DAPI. For analysis of protein distribution, at least 100 transfected cells were examined in two separate experiments (150 cells in the case of co-expression analysis). The results were considered conclusive only if statistically significant number of cells showed characteristic pattern of distribution (p < 0.05). The IB3–1 cells, transiently transfected with DNA constructs encoding different GFP fusion proteins, were lysed overnight in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. The lysates were spun at 20,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the insoluble material. Both soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by the SDS-PAGE (12%) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The probing with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody and subsequent detection with ECL+plus system (Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After luminographic detection step, the films were scanned and the intensity of bands was measured, based on pixel count, using Adobe Photoshop. The fluorescence label was examined with laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM Carl Zeiss). Images were generated using 16-fold line averaging. Contrast and brightness settings were chosen to ensure that all pixels were within the linear range. Images were prepared for publication with LSM Carl Zeiss Software and Adobe Photoshop. While searching for localization signals in CFTR, we discovered that the GFP fusion protein containing the C-terminal portion of human CFTR formed aggregates (26Milewski M.I. Mickle J.E. Forrest J.K. Stafford D.M. Moyer B.D. Cheng J. Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Cutting G.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This aggregation was abolished by deletion of the ag region (Δag) encompassing amino acids 1395–1403 of CFTR (Fig. 1, Aand B). To characterize the sequence responsible for protein accumulation, we examined the effect of single amino acid substitutions on the aggregation ability of the GFP-tagged C terminus of CFTR. Residues that were either associated with CF-causing mutations or highly conserved in related proteins were selected for study. The only reported CF-causing mutation in the ag region was a substitution of valine at codon 1397 by glutamic acid (V1397E) (29Petreska L. Koceva S. Gordova-Muratovska A. Nestorov R. Efremov G.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 999-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the aggregation of GFP CFTR 1370–1480 was not affected by introduction of this mutation into the fusion protein (Fig. 1C). Three of nine amino acids in the ag region, Thr-1396, His-1402, and Arg-1403, were conserved in corresponding C-terminal segments of several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins closely related to CFTR (Fig.1A). The replacement of Thr-1396 with alanine had no effect on aggregation of the GFP-tagged protein (Fig. 1D). However, the single amino acid substitutions of histidine at position 1402 or arginine at position 1403 significantly reduced the number of transfected cells showing intracellular protein aggregation. Only 25% (52/208) of cells expressing GFP fusion protein bearing single H1402A substitution and 27% (41/153) of R1403A mutants showed intracellular protein accumulation, whereas the corresponding number for the wild type sequence was 91% (132/145). Also, the size of aggregates formed by fusion proteins was reduced when single alanine substitutions at position 1402 or 1403 were introduced. The effect of double substitution of these two amino acids on protein aggregation was even more profound (Fig. 1E). Cells expressing the double mutant H1402A,R1403A showed no aggregation at all (0/108). Thus, these two conserved amino acids seemed to be critical for the aggregation process of CFTR-derived C-terminal peptides. The role of His-1402 and Arg-1403 in the aggregation of CFTR-derived peptides was further confirmed by the SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, in which a relative amount of protein in soluble and insoluble fractions was assessed (Fig. 1F). In contrast to GFP alone that was found primarily (96%) in the soluble fraction, the GFP CFTR 1370–1480 fusion protein was detected mainly (74%) in the insoluble material. However, the introduction of the Δag deletion or the H1402A,R1403A double mutation significantly decreased the amount of the fusion protein in the insoluble fraction to approximately 31 and 36%, respectively. The remaining portion of insoluble protein could correspond to micro-aggregates that were not detectable by fluorescence analysis. However, it is worth noting that only in the case of GFP CFTR 1370–1480 were SDS-insoluble complexes of high molecular weight observed (Fig. 1F), which suggested that amino acids His-1402 and Arg-1403 were responsible for induction of massive protein accumulation. The ability of GFP to dimerize (30Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips G.N., Jr. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) suggested that GFP might contribute to the intracellular aggregation of the GFP fusion proteins. To test whether the aggregation of the GFP-CFTR 1370–1480 fusion protein could be attributed to the C-terminal sequence of CFTR, or was a phenomenon associated with the GFP molecule, we removed the GFP tag attached to the CFTR-derived peptide. The CFTR 1370–1480 construct was transiently expressed, and the subcellular distribution of this peptide was analyzed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Most of the transfected cells (83%, 99/120) showed a discrete pattern of accumulation (Fig.2A). This pattern of distribution was distinct from the giant perinuclear or nuclear aggregates characteristic for the GFP-tagged C terminus, although large aggregates were also seen in 8% (9/120) of cells transfected with CFTR 1370–1480 (Fig. 2B). Attaching an HA epitope to the N terminus of CFTR 1370–1480 did not alter its intracellular distribution (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that the C terminus of CFTR was responsible for the aggregation process, and that fusion to GFP either facilitated formation of giant aggregates or prevented the formation of small discrete accumulations. To explore whether the different intracellular accumulation patterns of the different CFTR C-terminal constructs had a common molecular basis, we examined the role of the amino acids within the ag region in the aggregation process of HA-CFTR 1370–1480. The Δag version of this construct showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in all transfected cells (Fig. 2D). Additionally, the double mutation H1402A,R1403A prevented aggregation of HA-tagged CFTR C terminus (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrated that the same amino acids of the C terminus were responsible for the two patterns of aggregation. The aggregating HA-CFTR 1370–1480 and non-aggregating HA-CFTR 1370–1480 Δag constructs were both detected by antibodies directed against their N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 2,C and D). This indicated that the aggregation process was not associated with post-translational truncation of the N-terminal or C-terminal sequences in CFTR-derived peptides. The very C-terminal sequence of CFTR contained a PDZ-binding motif required for the apical membrane localization in polarized epithelial cells (26Milewski M.I. Mickle J.E. Forrest J.K. Stafford D.M.

To examine whether this C-terminal region contributed to the unusual accumulation pattern of HA-CFTR 1370–1480, we deleted the last 26 amino acids in this construct by introducing the naturally occurring CFTR mutation S1455X (33Mickle J. Macek M., Jr. Fulmer-Smentek S.B. Egan M. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W. Moss R. Cutting G.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), associated with abnormal localization of the full-length protein (31Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B., Li, M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This deletion did not affect the distribution of the HA-tagged construct (Fig.2F), indicating that the very C-terminal amino acids of CFTR were not involved in the aggregation process. We next determined whether the distribution of the small accumulations formed by the CFTR C-terminal peptides was a result of their association with the cytoskeleton or organelles. The discrete accumulations formed by these peptides occasionally appeared to be distributed in a linear fashion, which suggested their association with elements of the cytoskeleton (Fig.3A). Formation of large perinuclear aggresomes was previously reported to be associated with the microtubule-dependent movement of small aggregates toward the center of the cell (16Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). To test whether discrete accumulations of HA-CFTR 1370–1480 were associated with the microtubular network, we examined the co-localization of both structures in the cell. Indeed, the position of small protein accumulations seemed to correspond with the orientation of microtubules (Fig. 3B). However, overnight exposure of cells transfected with HA- or GFP-tagged CFTR C-terminal constructs to microtubule-disrupter nocodazole caused minimal redistribution of both small and giant cytoplasmic aggregates from the perinuclear region to the periphery of the cell, and the formation of giant aggregates was not inhibited (data not shown). Microtubules govern the localization of many membrane-bound organelles and other cellular components (34Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 35Rappaport L. Oliviero P. Samuel J.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 184: 101-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Thyberg J. Moskalewski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Hence, the association of protein aggregates with the microtubular network could simply be a secondary effect, reflecting a primary relationship between the aggregating peptide and an unknown microtubule-associated component. Therefore, we tested whether the small accumulations formed by CFTR-derived peptides co-localized with organelles associated with microtubules. The intracellular distribution of HA-CFTR 1370–1480 did not match the distribution of Golgi and ER markers (data not shown). However, the co-localization analysis between the HA-CFTR 1370–1480 and mitochondrial marker GRP75 showed that aggregating protein was closely associated with mitochondria (Fig. 3C). Cellular distribution of mitochondria corresponded with the localization of microtubules (Fig. 3D) and showed sensitivity to nocodazole treatment. Importantly, the aggregates in cells treated with nocodazole retained a close association with mitochondria, indicating that the observed co-localization was not just a secondary effect related to the microtubular association of both mitochondria and aggregates (Fig.3E). The mitochondrial association of CFTR C-terminal peptides was also observed when the co-localization between the untagged CFTR 1370–1480 peptide and another mitochondrial marker HSP60 was examined. However, no apparent association with mitochondria was seen in the case of giant aggregates formed by GFP-CFTR 1370–1480 or another aggregating peptide N63-Q75-Myc-His, containing the N-terminal portion of huntingtin (Fig. 3F). Because the aggregation of all CFTR-derived C-terminal constructs was dependent on the presence of the same CFTR sequence, we explored whether two related peptides showing distinct accumulation patterns were able to form common aggregates. Therefore, we co-expressed the GFP- and HA-tagged CFTR C-terminal peptides. Although the majority of cells (68%, 95/140), expressing both aggregating proteins, showed separate distribution (Fig.4A), the remaining 32% of cells contained giant perinuclear or nuclear aggregates composed of both constructs (Fig. 4B). This suggested that, although the accumulation pattern of CFTR-derived peptides could be modified by fusion to reporter proteins, the misfolded proteins sharing the C-terminal sequences of CFTR could form common aggregates. On the other hand, the ability of HA-CFTR 1370–1480 to form the small accumulations seemed to partially prevent this peptide from forming giant aggregates and joining the aggregating GFP-tagged counterpart. Importantly, the non-aggregating derivatives of those proteins were also included in giant aggregates formed by their aggregating counterparts co-expressed in the same cell. The HA-tagged peptide devoid of the HR motif co-aggregated with the self-aggregating GFP-CFTR 1370–1480 construct (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the non-aggregating GFP-CFTR 1370–1480 H1402A,R1403A construct was included in giant aggregates formed by HA-CFTR 1370–1480 (Fig. 4D). The non-aggregating proteins were always included in giant aggregates, although their presence did not significantly alter the frequency of formation of giant aggregates by the self-aggregating GFP-tagged (87%, 131/150) or HA-tagged (11%, 16/150) CFTR C-terminal peptides. It is also worth noting that the GFP-tagged CFTR C-terminal constructs were always excluded from small accumulations formed by the HA-tagged CFTR-derived peptides, which confirmed our previous observation that the presence of GFP excludes the GFP-CFTR C-terminal peptides from this type of accumulation. Together, these results indicated that although the critical amino acids within the ag region were responsible for initiation of massive accumulation, the HR motif was not required for inclusion of related peptides into already existing protein aggregates. To further explore the specificity of protein aggregation, we co-expressed the CFTR-derived peptides with N63-Q75-Myc-His, a huntingtin-derived construct containing an elongated polyglutamine sequence composed of 75 repeats. When expressed alone, N63-Q75-Myc-His accumulated in giant cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions that resembled those fo"

At heat shock temperatures, the DnaK/J-mediated degradation of sigma 32 is largely abolished by a mechanism, which is not yet fully understood. In this article we have shown that interaction of DnaK with sigma 32 is highly temperature-dependent. This interaction is completely abolished at 42 °C. To investigate the origin of such strong temperature dependence, we have monitored the structural changes that occur in the sigma 32 protein upon upshift of temperature and attempted to elucidate its functional roles.

It is clear that upon elevation of temperature, there is increased synthesis of sigma 32, the heat shock sigma factor, caused by lifting of translational control (5Morita M. Kanemori M. Yanagi H.

The increased concentration of sigma 32 in heat-shocked cells increases the concentration of sigma 32 holoenzyme leading to transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (7Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The increased transient stability of sigma 32 after temperature upshift is a result of down-regulation of DnaK/J-mediated degradation (4Arsene F. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Interestingly, at elevated temperatures, increased susceptibility of sigma 32 to DnaK/J independent proteolysis is seen, which ultimately leads to a decrease in sigma 32 levels in the long run and down-regulation of the heat shock response (8Morita M.T.

Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism is that at higher temperatures, DnaK binds to other misfolded proteins, thus lowering the DnaK-sigma 32 complex concentration and consequently its degradation rate. However, it has been also suggested that this indirect mechanism may not be the only mechanism for lowering degradation rate at higher temperature (20Tatsuta T. Joob D.M. Calendar R. Akiyama Y. Ogura T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have shown that the DnaK-sigma 32 interaction at elevated temperatures is abolished and that a small domain or structural element in sigma 32 undergoes structural transition at elevated temperatures. The abolition may contribute significantly to the lowering of the degradation rate and the initiation of the heat shock response. The structural transition may have a causal relationship with the abolition of interaction between DnaK and sigma 32 reported here, leading to transient stabilization of sigma 32.

https://openalex.org/W2007075234,"Abstract NIH3T3 cells transformed by mouse FGF3-cDNA (DMI cells) selected for their ability to grow as anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar and in defined medium lacking growth factors exhibit a highly transformed phenotype. We have used dominant negative (DN) fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 2 (FGFR2) isoforms to block the FGF response in DMI cells. When the DN-FGFR was expressed in DMI cells, their transformed phenotype can be reverted. The truncated FGFR2(IIIb), the high affinity FGFR for FGF3, is significantly more efficient at reverting the transformed phenotype as the IIIc isoform, reaffirming the notion that the affinity of the ligand to the DN-FGFR2 isoform determines the effect. Heparin or heparan sulfate displaces FGF3 from binding sites on the cell surface inhibiting the growth of DMI cells and reverts the transformed phenotype (1). However, the presence of heparin is necessary to induce a mitogenic response in NIH3T3 cells when stimulated with soluble purified mouse FGF3. We have investigated the importance of cell surface binding of FGF3 for its ability to transform NIH3T3 cells by creating an FGF3 mutant anchored to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). The GPI anchor renders the cell surface association of FGF3 independent from binding to heparan sulfate-proteoglycan of the cell surface membrane. Attachment of a GPI anchor to FGF3 also confers a much higher transforming potential to the growth factor. Even more, the purified GPI-attached FGF3 is as much transforming as the secreted protein acting in an autocrine mode. Because NIH3T3 cells do not express the high affinity tyrosine kinase FGF receptors for FGF3, these findings suggest that FGF3 attached to GPI-linked heparan sulfate-proteoglycan may have a broader biological activity as when bound to transmembrane or soluble heparan sulfate-proteoglycan."
