Relevant models are required to downselect the most promising vaccines entering clinical efficacy testing and to identify correlates of protection. Methods and Findings Here, we evaluated immunogenicity and protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in rhesus monkeys with two novel strategies: BCG boosted by modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA.85A), and attenuated M. tuberculosis with a disrupted phoP gene (SO2) as a single-dose vaccine. Both strategies were well tolerated, and immunogenic as evidenced by induction of specific IFNγ responses. Antigen 85A-specific IFNγ secretion was specifically increased by MVA.85A boosting. Importantly, both MVA.85A and SO2 treatment significantly reduced pathology and chest X-ray scores upon infectious challenge with M. tuberculosis Erdman strain. MVA.85A and SO2 treatment also showed reduced average lung bacterial counts (1.0 and 1.2 log respectively, compared with 0.4 log for BCG) and significant protective effect by reduction in C-reactive protein levels, body weight loss, and decrease of erythrocyte-associated hematologic parameters (MCV, MCH, Hb, Ht) as markers of inflammatory infection, all relative to non-vaccinated controls. Lymphocyte stimulation revealed Ag85A-induced IFNγ levels post-infection as the strongest immunocorrelate for protection (spearman's rho: −0.60). Conclusions Both the BCG/MVA.85A prime-boost regime and the novel live attenuated, phoP deficient TB vaccine candidate SO2 showed significant protective efficacy by various parameters in rhesus macaques. Considering the phylogenetic relationship between macaque and man and the similarity in manifestations of TB disease, these data support further development of these primary and combination TB vaccine candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2027182484,"Aspartate 1-decarboxylase (ADC) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase (DDC) provide beta-alanine and dopamine used in insect cuticle tanning. beta-Alanine is conjugated with dopamine to yield N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD), a substrate for the phenol oxidase laccase that catalyzes the synthesis of cuticle protein cross-linking agents and pigment precursors. We identified ADC and DDC genes in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Tc), and investigated their functions. TcADC mRNA was most abundant prior to the pupal-adult molt. Injection of TcADC double-stranded (ds) RNA (dsTcADC) into mature larvae resulted in depletion of NBAD in pharate adults, accumulation of dopamine, and abnormally dark pigmentation of the adult cuticle. Injection of beta-alanine, the expected product of ADC, into dsTcADC-treated pupae rescued the pigmentation phenotype, resulting in normal rust-red color. A similar pattern of catechol content consisting of elevated dopamine and depressed NBAD was observed in the genetic black mutants of Tribolium, in which levels of TcADC mRNA were drastically reduced. Furthermore, from the Tribolium black mutant and dsTcADC-injected insects both exhibited similar changes in material properties. Dynamic mechanical analysis of elytral cuticle from beetles with depleted TcADC transcripts revealed diminished cross-linking of cuticular components, further confirming the important role of oxidation products of NBAD as cross-linking agents during cuticle tanning. Injection of dsTcDDC into larvae produced a lethal pupal phenotype, and the resulting grayish pupal cuticle exhibited many small patches of black pigmentation. When dsTcDDC was injected into young pupae, the resulting adults had abnormally dark brown body color, but there was little mortality. Injection of dsTcDDC resulted in more than a 5-fold increase in levels of DOPA, indicating that lack of TcDDC led to accumulation of its substrate, DOPA."
https://openalex.org/W2022247298,"Mutations in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor superfamily members underlie conditions characterized by vascular dysplasia. Mutations in endoglin and activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1) cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, whereas bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR-II) mutations underlie familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. To understand the functional roles of these receptors, we examined their relative contributions to BMP signaling in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). BMP9 potently and selectively induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation and Id gene expression in HPAECs. Contrary to expectations, BMP9 also stimulated Smad2 activation. Furthermore, BMP9 induced the expression of interleukin 8 and E-selectin. Using small interfering RNA, we demonstrate that the type I receptor, ALK1, is essential for these responses. However, small interfering RNA and inhibitor studies showed no involvement of ALK5 or endoglin. We further demonstrate that, of the candidate type II receptors, BMPR-II predominantly mediated IL-8 and E-selectin induction and mitogenic inhibition by BMP9. Conversely, activin receptor type II (ActR-II) contributed more to BMP9-mediated Smad2 activation. Only abolition of both type II receptors significantly reduced the Smad1/5 and Id responses. Both ALK1 and BMPR-II contributed to growth inhibition of HPAECs, whereas ActR-II was not involved. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the critical role of type II receptors in balancing BMP9 signaling via ALK1 and emphasize the essential role for BMPR-II in a subset of BMP9 responses (interleukin 8, E-selectin, and proliferation). This differential signaling may contribute to the contrasting pathologies of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2039537470,"Vesicular zinc transporters (ZnTs) play a critical role in regulating Zn2+ homeostasis in various cellular compartments and are linked to major diseases ranging from Alzheimer disease to diabetes. Despite their importance, the intracellular localization of ZnTs poses a major challenge for establishing the mechanisms by which they function and the identity of their ion binding sites. Here, we combine fluorescence-based functional analysis and structural modeling aimed at elucidating these functional aspects. Expression of ZnT5 was followed by both accelerated removal of Zn2+ from the cytoplasm and its increased vesicular sequestration. Further, activity of this zinc transport was coupled to alkalinization of the trans-Golgi network. Finally, structural modeling of ZnT5, based on the x-ray structure of the bacterial metal transporter YiiP, identified four residues that can potentially form the zinc binding site on ZnT5. Consistent with this model, replacement of these residues, Asp599 and His451, with alanine was sufficient to block Zn2+ transport. These findings indicate, for the first time, that Zn2+ transport mediated by a mammalian ZnT is catalyzed by H+/Zn2+ exchange and identify the zinc binding site of ZnT proteins essential for zinc transport."
https://openalex.org/W2034951882,"The mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a central role in many cell signaling pathways, but debate still surrounds its regulation by factors, such as substrate availability, [O2] and metabolic state. Previously, we showed that in isolated mitochondria respiring on succinate, ROS generation was a hyperbolic function of [O2]. In the current study, we used a wide variety of substrates and inhibitors to probe the O2 sensitivity of mitochondrial ROS generation under different metabolic conditions. From such data, the apparent Km for O2 of putative ROS-generating sites within mitochondria was estimated as follows: 0.2, 0.9, 2.0, and 5.0 μm O2 for the complex I flavin site, complex I electron backflow, complex III QO site, and electron transfer flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase of β-oxidation, respectively. Differential effects of respiratory inhibitors on ROS generation were also observed at varying [O2]. Based on these data, we hypothesize that at physiological [O2], complex I is a significant source of ROS, whereas the electron transfer flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase may only contribute to ROS generation at very high [O2]. Furthermore, we suggest that previous discrepancies in the assignment of effects of inhibitors on ROS may be due to differences in experimental [O2].

Kagan V.E. Crit. Care. 2008; 12: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) play key roles in cell signaling (reviewed in Refs. 2Acker H. Philos. Trans.

There exist within mitochondria several sites for the generation of ROS, with the most widely studied being complexes I and III of the electron transport chain (ETC). However, there is currently some debate regarding the relative contribution of these complexes to overall ROS production (4Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol.

Estimates of physiological [O2] within tissues (i.e. interstitial [O2]) range from 37 down to 6 μm at 5–40 μm away from a blood vessel (10Tsai A.G. Johnson P.C. Intaglietta M. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 933-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). More recently, EPR oximetry has estimated tissue [O2] to be in the 12–60 μm range (11Matsumoto A. Matsumoto S. Sowers A.L. Koscielniak J.W. Trigg N.J. Kuppusamy P. Mitchell J.B. Subramanian S. Krishna M.C. Matsumoto K. Magn. Reson. Med. 2005; 54: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, elegant studies with hepatocytes have shown that O2 gradients exist within cells, such that an extracellular [O2] of 6–10 μm yields an [O2] of ∼5 μm close to the plasma membrane, dropping to 1–2 μm close to mitochondria deep within the cell (12Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1986; 250: C663-C675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes, at an extracellular [O2] of 29 μm, intracellular [O2] varied in the range 6–25 μm (13Takahashi E. Sato K. Endoh H. Xu Z.L. Doi K. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1998; 275: H225-H233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, different tissues consume O2 at different rates, so these gradients can vary considerably between tissue and cell types. reactive oxygen species mitochondrial ROS electron transport chain electron transfer flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase. By definition, the generation of reactive oxygen species by any mechanism, is an O2-dependent process. However, measurements in intact cells have indicated that mtROS generation increases at lower O2 levels (1–5% O2) (14Guzy R.D. Schumacker P.T. Exp. Physiol. 2006; 91: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Proponents of an increase in mtROS in response to hypoxia suggest that under such conditions, reduction of the ETC results in increased leakage of electrons to O2 at the QO site of complex III (14Guzy R.D. Schumacker P.T. Exp. Physiol. 2006; 91: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Such a model posits that increased hypoxic ROS is a mitochondria-autonomous signaling mechanism (i.e. it is an inherent property of the mitochondrial ETC). Therefore, mtROS generation should increase in hypoxia regardless of the experimental system being studied, including isolated mitochondria. In contrast to this hypothesis, we and others have demonstrated that ROS generation by mitochondria is a positive function of [O2] across a wide range of values (0.1–1000 μm O2) (15Hoffman D.L.

One limitation of our previous work (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was that only a single respiratory condition was studied, namely succinate as respiratory substrate (feeding electrons into complex II) plus rotenone to inhibit backflow of electrons through complex I (5St-Pierre J.

The possibility exists that under different metabolic conditions, which may lead to differential redox states between the cytochromes in the ETC (19Campian J.L. Qian M. Gao X. Eaton J.W. J. Biol.

Thus, in the current study, we examined the response of mtROS generation to [O2] under 11 different conditions, using a variety of respiratory substrates and inhibitors (for a thorough review of electron entry points to the ETC under various substrate/inhibitor combinations, see Ref. 21Gnaiger E. Mitochondrial Pathways and Respiratory Control. 2nd Ed. MiPNet Publications, Innsbruck, Austria2007Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the mitochondrial ETC, highlighting sites of electron entry resulting from various substrates, binding sites of inhibitors, and major sites of ROS generation.

The legend to Fig. 2 provides an explanation of each condition.FIGURE 2Pathways of electron flow for the substrate/inhibitor combinations used in conditions A–L. Each panel includes the respective maximal respiration rate (VO2 max; nmol of O2/min/mg of protein) measured under each condition. A, glutamate/malate/malonate. Electrons enter through complex I, whereas electron entry at complex II is inhibited by malonate. ROS generation occurs at the FMN site of complex I as well as the QO site of complex III. B, glutamate/malate/malonate/rotenone. Electrons enter through complex I. Electron passage through complex I is inhibited by rotenone binding at the downstream Q site, resulting in maximal ROS production at the FMN site of complex I. ROS production at the QO site of complex III is prevented due to no electrons reaching the complex from either complexes I or II, both of which are inhibited. C, glutamate/malate/malonate/antimycin A. Electrons enter through complex I only, since complex II is blocked. Flow of electrons is inhibited by the complex III inhibitor antimycin A, resulting in ROS production at the QO site of complex III, as well as the FMN site of complex I. D, succinate. Electrons enter at complex II. ROS is generated by the flow of electrons though the QO site of complex III as well as the backflow of electrons through complex I. E, succinate/rotenone. Electrons enter at complex II, and ROS is generated at the QO site of complex III, because rotenone is present to inhibit backflow of electrons through complex I. F, succinate/antimycin A. Electrons enter through complex II. ROS is generated at both complex I via backflow and complex III QO, with an increased rate at the latter due to inhibition by antimycin A. G, succinate/rotenone/antimycin A. Electrons enter through complex II. Backflow of electrons through complex I is inhibited by rotenone, whereas ROS generation at complex III QO is augmented due to the presence of antimycin A. H, glutamate/malate/succinate. Electrons enter at both complexes I and II. ROS is generated from the complex I FMN site and the complex III QO site. J, glutamate/malate/succinate/antimycin A. Electrons enter at complexes I and II. ROS generation occurs at the complex I FMN and is augmented at the complex III QO site by antimycin A. K, palmitoyl-carnitine. Electrons enter at the ETFQOR. ROS is generated at the ETFQOR as well as complex I via backflow and at the complex III QO site. L, palmitoyl-carnitine/rotenone. Electron entry is at the ETFQOR.

All procedures were approved by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources (protocol number 2007-087). Liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, as described previously (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial incubations were performed using an open flow respirometry cell, as described previously (15Hoffman D.L.

Briefly, mitochondria were suspended in the liquid phase in a stirred chamber with a head space gas of tightly controlled pO2 flowing above. Such a system, in which the liquid phase [O2] is measured with an O2 electrode, permits prolonged mitochondrial incubation at tightly controlled steady-state [O2] and the calculation of mitochondrial O2 consumption by a simplified Fick equation (15Hoffman D.L.

The O2 electrode was calibrated daily with air-saturated deionized H2O, with or without sodium dithionite. The impact of additions to mitochondrial incubations (e.g. substrates or inhibitors) on O2 solubility was no more than 0.4% of the total. A fiber optic fluorimeter was built into the chamber, permitting measurement of mitochondrial ROS generation using the H2O2-sensitive dye Amplex red (23Cole R.P. Sukanek P.C. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 53: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Authentic H2O2 was added at the end of each experimental run to internally calibrate the fluorescent signal. Such a method ensures that the obtained signal truly reflects the net H2O2 production and is not affected by scavenging due to enzymes, such as catalase. Incubations were carried out in mitochondrial respiration buffer (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), with oligomycin (1 μg/ml) present to enforce state 4 respiration. Where indicated, mitochondrial substrates and inhibitors were used at the following concentrations: glutamate (10 mm), malate (5 mm), succinate (10 mm), palmitoyl-carnitine (1 μm), rotenone (1 μm), antimycin A (10 μm), malonate (2 mm). They were present from the beginning of incubations before mitochondrial addition. Superoxide dismutase (80 units/ml) was present in all incubations to ensure rapid dismutation of O⨪2 to H2O2 and to avoid scavenging of the former by reaction with nitric oxide (NO·). This was a precaution, despite our previous observations that additional superoxide dismutase was not necessary in this regard and that NO· scavenging of O⨪2 (which would lead to peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration) was not occurring in hypoxia (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The latter is also unlikely because the Km for O2 of all NOS isoforms is very high (6–24 μm) (24Rengasamy A. Johns R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 30-33PubMed Google Scholar), so NO· generation actually decreases in hypoxia. Full details on each combination of substrates/inhibitors and the putative sites of ROS generation resulting from each are given under “Results” and in the legends to FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2. The steady-state [O2] reached in open flow respirometry is not an independent variable but a result of the individual characteristics of each mitochondrial incubation. Therefore, it is not possible to use the raw data to calculate average rates of ROS generation at a single [O2]. Thus, for each metabolic condition, the empirical values of ROS generation across a range of steady-state [O2] (typically 7–10 points/curve) were fitted to a single-substrate binding curve, employing Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), as described previously (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The curve fit parameters (Vmax, Km) were then used to extrapolate ROS generation rates at common values of [O2], and these data then averaged between individual experiments (n ≥ 5). State 4 respiration rates (VO2; nmol of O2/min/mg of protein) under each metabolic condition were calculated across the range of [O2] values studied, as previously described (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Brookes P.S. Kraus D.W. Shiva S. Doeller J.E. Barone M.C. Patel R.P.

The maximal VO2 (at high [O2]) for each condition is listed in each panel of Fig. 2, whereas the full response curves of VO2 to [O2] are in Table S1. VO2 varied considerably between metabolic substrates. For example, a higher VO2 was observed with complex II substrates (condition E) than with complex I substrates (condition A). The consensus view is that because fewer H+ are pumped across the inner membrane when electrons enter at complex II, the ETC has to work faster in condition E (and thus consume more O2) to maintain the same H+ gradient as in condition A. The generation of ROS as a function of [O2] for metabolic conditions A–L (Fig. 2) is illustrated in Fig. 3. Respiring on complex I-linked substrates (glutamate plus malate in the presence of malonate to inhibit complex II), ROS generation was maximal at 250 pmol/min/mg mitochondrial protein, whereas Km was 0.25 μm O2 (Fig. 3A). As expected, the addition of rotenone, which inhibits at the downstream Q site of complex I, increased maximal ROS slightly (Vmax 295) while causing a right shift in the curve (Km = 2.0 μm O2; Fig. 3B). Similarly, inhibition at complex III by antimycin A also increased ROS (Vmax 460) and further right-shifted the curve (Km = 5.0 μm O2; Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3O2 response of ROS generation rate for different substrate inhibitor combinations.

(n ≥ 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With succinate as the respiratory substrate, feeding electrons into complex II (Fig. 3D), maximal ROS generation was 330 pmol/min/mg mitochondrial protein with a Km of 1.8 μm O2. Some of this ROS was due to backflow of electrons through complex I, since the addition of rotenone (Fig. 3E) brought the Vmax value down to 105 and the Km to 0.7 μm O2. Similarly to the situation with complex I-linked substrates (see above), the addition of antimycin A to succinate-respiring mitochondria (Fig. 3F) raised maximal ROS generation to 420 pmol/min/mg mitochondrial protein and strongly right-shifted the curve (Km = 12 μm O2). Adding both rotenone and antimycin A together (Fig. 3G) gave a Vmax of 380 and a Km of 4 μm O2. Thus, in both complex I- and II-linked respiration, antimycin A-induced ROS generation is heavily O2-dependent, having a much greater Km than base-line ROS generation (Fig. 3, C versus A, G versus E, and F versus D). Under conditions of dual electron entry at complexes I and II (i.e. respiration on glutamate, malate, and succinate together) (Fig. 3H), maximal ROS generation was 330 pmol/min/mg mitochondrial protein, and Km was 0.5 μm O2. As seen for complex I- or complex II-linked substrates alone, the addition of antimycin A to the dual electron entry condition (Fig. 3J) resulted in the highest ROS generation measured under any condition (Vmax = 490) and a strongly right-shifted curve (Km = 9 μm O2). In mitochondria respiring on palmitoyl-carnitine, maximal ROS was 290 pmol/min/mg mitochondrial protein, with a Km of 1.0 μm O2. Similar to the situation with complex II, some of this ROS may result from complex I backflow, since the addition of rotenone resulted in a decrease in ROS (Vmax = 250) and a right shift in the curve (Km = 4 μm O2). In the current study, we examined the response of mtROS generation to [O2] under 11 different conditions, using a variety of respiratory substrates and inhibitors (Fig. 2, A–L). Fig. 3 shows mtROS generation as a function of [O2] for each of the 11 conditions A–L. In conditions A–C, electrons entered the ETC at complex I, with complex II blocked by malonate (25Wojtovich A.P. Brookes P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Pardee A.B. Potter V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 178: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conditions D–G, electrons entered at complex II. In conditions H and J, electrons entered at both complexes I and II, and in conditions K and L, electrons entered at the β-oxidation electron transfer flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase (ETFQOR). Despite the different sites of electron entry, all conditions exhibited the same overall pattern of ROS generation in response to [O2], namely a hyperbolic function with lower ROS generation rate at lower [O2]. Thus, it appears that our previous data set showing decreased mtROS at low [O2] (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was not an artifact of the metabolic conditions chosen (succinate plus rotenone). Although information on ROS generation under different substrate/inhibitor conditions is useful in the field of isolated mitochondrial bioenergetics, it would be more useful to know the O2 sensitivity of ROS generation from putative sites within the ETC. Thus, a series of calculations was devised to estimate ROS generation from each of four putative sites, at varying [O2] (Fig. 4). Below, the rationale behind each calculation is discussed along with the results. The rate of ROS generation from the QO site of complex III was estimated by two methods. First, it was estimated by using the rate of ROS generation obtained in the presence of succinate as substrate (complex II) plus rotenone to inhibit electron backflow through complex I (i.e. condition E) (5St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 9Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol.

Under this condition, ROS generation occurs primarily at the complex III QO site (6Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Muller F.L. Liu Y. Abdul-Ghani M.A. Lustgarten M.S. Bhattacharya A. Jang Y.C. Van Remmen H. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Sun J. Trumpower B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Second, the rate of ROS generation due to backflow of electrons through complex I (calculated below) was subtracted from the rate of ROS with succinate alone in which electrons flow both forward through complex III and backward through complex I (condition D). The two values for complex III QO site ROS generation were then averaged (Fig. 4A), resulting in a Vmax of 150 and apparent Km of 2.0. To estimate ROS generation by the complex I FMN site, we used mitochondria respiring on complex I-linked substrates alone (i.e. glutamate plus malate) in the presence of a complex II inhibitor to prevent electron entry due to passage of substrates through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The inhibitor chosen was malonate, since 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (29Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su D. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) exhibited an absorbance spectrum that interfered with Amplex Red (not shown) and may also stimulate ROS generation at complex II (30Byun H.O. Kim H.Y. Lim J.J. Seo Y.H. Yoon G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 104: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Chen Y. McMillan-Ward E. Kong J. Israels S.J. Gibson S.B. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4155-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Under condition A (glutamate, malate, and malonate), some electron flux proceeds via the Q pool to complex III. Thus, it is necessary to subtract ROS generation by the complex III QO site. Furthermore, it is insufficient to merely subtract ROS as calculated above, since that flux was calculated from mitochondria respiring on succinate, and the flux through the respiratory chain (i.e. VO2) was lower with glutamate plus malate. This lower electron flux has two opposing effects on ROS generation by complex III QO. First, fewer electrons reach complex III, as shown by the VO2 in condition A (Fig. 2A), which was 39.3% of that in condition E (Fig. 2E). Second, this slower electron flux through complex III results in an increased dwell time for the ubisemiquinone radical at the QO site, which enhances ROS generation (32Forquer I. Covian R. Bowman M.K. Trumpower B.L. Kramer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38459-38465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To correct for this second effect, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the percentage of electrons diverted to ROS and the total electron flux (VO2). Fig. 5 shows this relationship for mitochondria respiring in condition E (succinate plus rotenone), indicating that a VO2 of 19.5 nmol of O2/min/mg results in 1.065% of electrons going to ROS. Lowering the VO2 to 7.7 (i.e. the VO2 in condition A) increases this value to 1.817%. Thus, the percentage of electrons diverted to ROS is 1.71-fold greater in condition A versus condition E. Combining these two correction factors (39.3% × 1.71) indicates that it is necessary to subtract 67.2% of the ROS from the complex III QO site (Fig. 4A) to reveal the residual ROS from the complex I FMN site. The result is shown in Fig. 4B, and interestingly, the shape of the curve is not a classical hyperbolic function but instead indicates a Vmax of 170 at 5 μm O2, with ROS declining very slightly at higher [O2]. The apparent Km from this curve was estimated as 0.19 μm O2. These data therefore suggest that the complex I FMN site is able to generate ROS at O2 levels far below that at which the complex III QO site is already O2-limited (Km = 2.0 μm O2; see Fig. 4A). Notably, Fig. 5, which shows that the percentage of electron flux diverted to ROS increases as respiration slows down, might be misconstrued as demonstrating that mitochondrial ROS generation increases at low respiration rates (such as those caused by low [O2]). However, as we previously discussed (15Hoffman D.L. Salter J.D. Brookes P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H101-H108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although a greater percentage of electrons m"
https://openalex.org/W2053504505,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a ligand for LPA(1-3) of the endothelial differentiation gene family G-protein-coupled receptors, and LPA(4-8) is related to the purinergic family G-protein-coupled receptor. Because the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of GPR92/LPA(5) is limited and whether LPA is its preferred endogenous ligand has been questioned in the literature, in this study we applied a combination of computational and experimental site-directed mutagenesis of LPA(5) residues predicted to interact with the headgroup of LPA. Four residues involved in ligand recognition in LPA(5) were identified as follows: R2.60N mutant abolished receptor activation, whereas H4.64E, R6.62A, and R7.32A greatly reduced receptor activation. We also investigated the SAR of LPA(5) using LPA analogs and other non-lysophospholipid ligands. SAR revealed that the rank order of agonists is alkyl glycerol phosphate > LPA > farnesyl phosphates >> N-arachidonoylglycine. These results confirm LPA(5) to be a bona fide lysophospholipid receptor. We also evaluated several compounds with previously established selectivity for the endothelial differentiation gene receptors and found several that are LPA(5) agonists. A pharmacophore model of LPA(5) binding requirements was developed for in silico screening, which identified two non-lipid LPA(5) antagonists. Because LPA(5) transcripts are abundant in human platelets, we tested its antagonists on platelet activation and found that these non-lipid LPA(5) antagonists inhibit platelet activation. The present results suggest that selective inhibition of LPA(5) may provide a basis for future anti-thrombotic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2026134662,"The Neanderthals are a well-distinguished Middle Pleistocene population which inhabited a vast geographical area extending from Europe to western Asia and the Middle East. Since the 1950s paleoanthropological studies have suggested variability in this group. Different sub-groups have been identified in western Europe, in southern Europe and in the Middle East. On the other hand, since 1997, research has been published in paleogenetics, carried out on 15 mtDNA sequences from 12 Neanderthals. In this paper we used a new methodology derived from different bioinformatic models based on data from genetics, demography and paleoanthropology. The adequacy of each model was measured by comparisons between simulated results (obtained by BayesianSSC software) and those estimated from nucleotide sequences (obtained by DNAsp4 software). The conclusions of this study are consistent with existing paleoanthropological research and show that Neanderthals can be divided into at least three groups: one in western Europe, a second in the Southern area and a third in western Asia. Moreover, it seems from our results that the size of the Neanderthal population was not constant and that some migration occurred among the demes."

Indeed, autophagy-dependent activation of alkaline phosphatase and the presence of hallmarks of non-selective microautophagy were not altered by N-acetyl-l-cysteine. The effect of N-acetyl-l-cysteine was not related to its scavenging properties, but rather to its fueling effect of the glutathione pool.

Conversely, the addition of a cell-permeable form of glutathione inhibited mitophagy.

Autophagy is a major pathway for the lysosomal/vacuolar delivery of long-lived proteins and organelles, where they are degraded and recycled. Autophagy plays a crucial role in differentiation and cellular response to stress and is conserved in eukaryotic cells from yeast to mammals (1Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The main form of autophagy, macroautophagy, involves the non-selective sequestration of large portions of the cytoplasm into double-membrane structures termed autophagosomes, and their delivery to the vacuole/lysosome for degradation. Another process, microautophagy, involves the direct sequestration of parts of the cytoplasm by vacuole/lysosomes. The two processes coexist in yeast cells but their extent may depend on different factors including metabolic state: for example, we have observed that nitrogen-starved lactate-grown yeast cells develop microautophagy, whereas nitrogen-starved glucose-grown cells preferentially develop macroautophagy (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both macroautophagy and microautophagy are essentially non-selective, in the way that autophagosomes and vacuole invaginations do not appear to discriminate the sequestered material. However, selective forms of autophagy have been observed (4Nair U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Although non-selective autophagy plays an essential role in survival by nitrogen starvation, by providing amino acids to the cell, selective autophagy is more likely to have a function in the maintenance of cellular structures, both under normal conditions as a “housecleaning” process, and under stress conditions by eliminating altered organelles and macromolecular structures (14Tolkovsky A.M.

Selective autophagy targeting mitochondria, termed mitophagy, may be particularly relevant to stress conditions. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is both the main site and target of ROS 4The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; EA, ethacrynic acid; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mtGFP, mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent protein; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. production (17Turrens J.F. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3657) Google Scholar). Consequently, the maintenance of a pool of healthy mitochondria is a crucial challenge for the cells. The progressive accumulation of altered mitochondria (18Lenaz G. Bovina C. D'Aurelio M. Fato R. Formiggini G. Genova M.L. Giuliano G. Merlo Pich M. Paolucci U. Parenti Castelli G. Ventura B. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) caused by the loss of efficiency of the maintenance process (degradation/biogenesis de novo) is often considered as a major cause of cellular aging (19Jazwinski S.M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Terman A. Gustafsson B. Brunk U.T. Mol.

Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 180-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, autophagic removal of mitochondria has been shown to be triggered following induction/blockade of apoptosis (23Xue L. Fletcher G.C. Tolkovsky A.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 180-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), suggesting that autophagy of mitochondria was required for cell survival following mitochondria injury (14Tolkovsky A.M. Xue L. Fletcher G.C. Borutaite V.M. Biochimie. 2002; 84: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, a direct alteration of mitochondrial permeability properties has been shown to induce mitochondrial autophagy (13Kim I. Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Lemasters J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 462: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 24Rodriguez-Enriquez S. He L. Lemasters J.J. Int. J. Biochem.

Autophagy. 2006; 2: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of catalase induced the autophagic elimination of altered mitochondria (26Yu L. Wan F. Dutta S. Welsh S. Liu Z. Freundt E. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4952-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the alteration of F0F1-ATPase biogenesis in a conditional mutant has been shown to trigger autophagy (27Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Vallette F.M. Di Rago J.P. Martinou J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Alterations of mitochondrial ion homeostasis caused by the inactivation of the K+/H+ exchanger was shown to cause both autophagy and mitophagy (28Nowikovsky K. Reipert S. Devenish R.J. Schweyen R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have reported that treatment of cells with rapamycin induced early ROS production and mitochondrial lipid oxidation that could be inhibited by the hydrophobic antioxidant resveratrol (29Kissová I. Deffieu M. Samokhvalov V. Velours G. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Camougrand N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, resveratrol treatment impaired autophagic degradation of both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and delayed rapamycin-induced cell death, suggesting that mitochondrial oxidation events may play a crucial role in the regulation of autophagy. This existence of regulation of autophagy by ROS has received molecular support in HeLa cells (30Scherz-Shouval R. Shvets E. Fass E. Shorer H. Gil L. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar): these authors showed that starvation stimulated ROS production, namely H2O2, which was essential for autophagy. Furthermore, they identified the cysteine protease hsAtg4 as a direct target for oxidation by H2O2. This provided a possible connection between the mitochondrial status and regulation of autophagy. Investigations of mitochondrial autophagy in nitrogen-starved lactate-grown yeast cells have established the existence of two distinct processes: the first one occurring very early, is selective for mitochondria and is dependent on the presence of the mitochondrial protein Uth1p; the second one occurring later, is not selective for mitochondria, is not dependent on Uth1p, and is a form of bulk microautophagy (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The absence of the selective process in the Δuth1 mutant strongly delays and decreases mitochondrial protein degradation (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Kissová I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol.

The putative protein phosphatase Aup1p has been also shown to be essential in inducing mitophagy (31Tal R. Winter G. Ecker N. Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Additionally several Atg proteins were shown to be involved in vacuolar sequestration of mitochondrial GFP (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N.

Recently, the protein Atg11p, which had been already identified as an essential protein for selective autophagy has also been reported as being essential for mitophagy (33Kanki T. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32386-32393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The question remains as to identify of the signals that trigger selective mitophagy. It is particularly intriguing that selective mitophagy is activated very early after the shift to a nitrogen-deprived medium (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, selective mitophagy is very active on lactate-grown cells (with fully differentiated mitochondria) but is nearly absent in glucose-grown cells (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we investigated the relationships between the redox status of the cells and selective mitophagy, namely by manipulating glutathione. Our results support the view that redox imbalance is a trigger for the selective elimination of mitochondria. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—W303-1B (MAT α, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3) was used as the parental strain of the mutant Δuth1 (MAT α, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, uth1::TRP1) (34Camougrand N.

For measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity, the PHO8 locus was replaced with PHO8Δ60 by transformation with an HindIII fragment of plasmid pTN9 (a gift from Y. Ohsumi, NIBB Okazaki, Japan) bearing PHO8Δ60 as described previously (35Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For fluorescent microscopy experiments, cells were transformed with plasmid pGAL-CLbGFP containing the presequence of the mitochondrial citrate synthase fused to GFP, under the control of a GAL1/10 promoter (36Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The strain Δgsh2 carrying the deletion gsh2::kanMX4 and its parent BY4742 (MATα, his3, leu2, lys2, ura3) were from the Euroscarf collection. Yeast cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in a minimal medium containing 0.175% YNB (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.2% Drop-Mix, 0.01% auxotrophic requirements (pH 5.5) supplemented with 2% dl-lactate as a carbon source. Nitrogen starvation medium (SD-N) contained 0.175% YNB without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, supplemented with 2% lactate as a carbon source. Western Blot Analyses—Protein sample preparations, SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were previously described (34Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-yeast Atp6p (1/10,000), mouse monoclonal anti-yeast porin (Molecular Probes; 1/5,000), mouse monoclonal anti-yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (Molecular Probes, 1/5,000), and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Roche, 1/5,000). Peroxidase-coupled secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) were used at 1/5,000. ECL+ (GE Healthcare) was used for detection. Scanning of non-saturated Western blots were quantified with ImageJ software. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—The alkaline phosphatase activity assay using α-naphtyl phosphate as a substrate was performed as described previously (12Kissová I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39068-39074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was measured at 472 nm (excitation at 345 nm) in a Safas Xenius spectrofluorimeter. Protein concentration was measured with the Lowry method. Activities were expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units per minute per mg of proteins. Epifluorescence Microscopy—To induce mtGFP expression, cells carrying the pGAL-CLbGFP plasmid were grown overnight in the appropriate medium supplemented with 0.5% galactose. GFP was visualized on an epifluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems DM-LB). The images were acquired with a SIS camera and processed with Corel Draw 9.0 suite software. Transmission Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy experiments, cells were grown and starved in the presence of 1 mm PMSF to prevent the rapid proteolytic degradation of autophagic bodies. Harvested cells were placed on the surface of Formvar-coated copper grids (400 mesh). Each loop was quickly submersed in liquid propane (–180 °C) and then transferred to a precooled solution of 4% osmium tetroxide in dry acetone at –82 °C for 48 h for substitution/fixation. Samples were gradually warmed to room temperature, and washed in dry acetone. Specimens were stained for 1 h with 1% uranyl acetate in acetone at 4 °C, rinsed, and infiltrated with araldite (epoxy resin, Fluka). Ultrathin sections were stained with lead citrate. Observations were performed on a Philips Tecnai 12 Biotwin (120 kV) electron microscope. Glutathione Measurement—6 × 107 cells were harvested and the pellet was resuspended in 350 μl of 3.4% metaphosphoric acid. Glass beads (0.4 mm diameter) were added and cells were vortexed (4 × 30 s) and then centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were used to measure reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) by reversephase high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (37Melnyk S. Pogribna M. Pogribny I. Hine R.J. James S.J. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1999; 10: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cell Respiration—Oxygen consumption by growing or nitrogen-starved cells was measured polarographically at 28 °C using a Clark oxygen electrode in a 1-ml thermostatically controlled chamber. Respiratory rates (JO2) were determined from the slope of a plot of O2 concentration versus time. NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+ Measurements (38Klingenberg M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis VII. VCH, Weinheim1985: 251-271Google Scholar)—NAD(P)H was measured in neutralized methanolic KOH extracts. NAD(P)H disappearance was fluorometrically monitored after the addition of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenease (EC 1.1.1.8) for NADH or α-cetoglutarate and glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) for NADPH. NAD(P)+ was measured in neutralized HClO4 extracts. NAD+ and NADP+ were fluorometrically monitored as the formation of NADH or NADPH following the addition of ethanol and alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) for NAD+ or glucose 6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) for NADP+. All the measurements were done on a Safas Xenius fluorimeter (excitation at 365 nm, emission at 460 nm). ROS Measurements—Growing or nitrogen-starved cells were diluted in a fresh medium (2 × 106 cells/ml) and incubated for 15 min in the presence of 20 μm dihydroethidium, in the dark, under agitation. The fluorescence of ethidium resulting from dihydroethidium oxidation was measured in a Partec Galaxy flow cytometer (FL3 channel). N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) Inhibits Nitrogen Starvation-induced Mitophagy—We have previously reported that hydrophobic antioxidants resveratrol and α-tocopherol inhibited pharmacologically induced mitochondrial autophagy by the TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase inhibitor rapamycin (29Kissová I. Deffieu M. Samokhvalov V. Velours G. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Camougrand N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of oxidative events in the regulation of mitochondrial autophagy under physiological conditions, lactate-grown cells were submitted to nitrogen starvation, in the presence of various known antioxidants, namely NAC, Tiron, l-ascorbic acid, and resveratrol. Mitochondrial morphology and vacuolar delivery were followed by fluorescence microscopy of mtGFP (Fig. 1). Under growth conditions, lactate-grown cells exhibited a well differentiated mitochondrial network. Under conditions of physiologically induced autophagy by nitrogen starvation, the appearance of patches of mtGFP at the periphery of the cells, and the simultaneous disappearance of the mitochondrial network were observed. These changes in mitochondrial morphology were followed by extensive delivery of mtGFP into vacuoles: pictures taken after 24 h nitrogen starvation revealed that about 95% of cells had mtGFP in the vacuoles. Tiron, l-ascorbic acid, and resveratrol had no effect on this process. On the contrary, in the presence of NAC, the mitochondrial network was still disrupted but only 4% of cells had mtGFP in the vacuoles. No increase in vacuolar delivery of mtGFP was observed even after 72 h of nitrogen starvation (data not shown). To examine the possibility that NAC could be a source of nitrogen for starved cells, each of 20 amino acids was individually assayed for a possible effect on vacuolar delivery of mitochondria induced by nitrogen starvation. Results showed that cysteine had the same effect as NAC, whereas none of the other amino acids had any effect, as exemplified in Fig. 2 for glutamine, asparagine (which are efficient sources of nitrogen for yeast), and proline (which is poorly utilized as source of nitrogen) (39Watson T.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 96: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This showed that the protective effects of NAC and cysteine on mitophagy are not related to nitrogen supply. Furthermore, to confirm that NAC actually impaired mitophagy, the hallmarks of this process were investigated. The amounts of two mitochondrial proteins localized in the outer membrane (porin, Por1p) and inner membrane (subunit 6 of ATP synthase, Atp6p) were followed by Western blot analysis, in comparison to a cytosolic protein, phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p) (Fig. 3, A and B). After 24 h of nitrogen starvation, the content of both mitochondrial proteins was depressed, whereas the amount the cytosolic protein was only marginally affected. The degradation of the two mitochondrial proteins was largely impaired when cells were starved in the presence of NAC. In the presence of the hydrophobic antioxidant resveratrol, mitochondrial proteins were still degraded, in accordance with results from fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). We also followed the degradation of the cit1-GFP fusion protein by Western blot during nitrogen starvation. GFP is resistant to proteolysis and the vacuolar delivery of fusion proteins with GFP was shown to be associated to a size reduction corresponding to the degradation of the fused fragment (33Kanki T. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32386-32393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We observed cleavage of fusion protein cit1-GFP to GFP during nitrogen starvation, which was inhibited both by PMSF (inhibitor of vacuolar proteases) and NAC (Fig. 3C). This further confirmed the protective effect of NAC on autophagic mitochondrial proteins degradation. Electron microscopy of nitrogen-starved lactate-grown cells has previously revealed the existence of two distinct processes for mitochondrial autophagy (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The first process was characterized by the early and transient appearance of vacuoles/mitochondria contacts and the later appearance of mitochondria-containing vesicles inside the vacuoles. The second process involved a late and non-exclusive engulfment of mitochondria with a significant proportion of surrounding cytosol (non-selective microautophagy). After 2 h of nitrogen starvation under lactate as the carbon source, a maximum of 85% of cells displayed vacuole/mitochondria contacts (Figs. 4 and supplemental S1). As previously reported (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), this proportion decreased to 35% after 3 h and completely disappeared after 4 h. These vacuole/mitochondria contacts were early and transient events. After 3 h of nitrogen starvation, the presence of mitochondria within vacuoles was visualized in 75% of the cells. However, in the presence of NAC, 13% of cells exhibited mitochondria/vacuoles contacts after 2 h of starvation and 13% of cells showed mitochondria sequestration in vacuoles after 3 h of starvation. These observations suggested that in the presence of NAC both processes (mitochondria/vacuoles contacts and mitochondria sequestration in vacuoles) were strongly impaired, although not completely abolished. Moreover, after 3 h of starvation, the average number of mitochondria sequestered in vacuoles was 1–2 units/slice in the presence of NAC compared with 5–7 units/slice in the absence of NAC (data not shown). These data confirmed that autophagic mitochondrial degradation was inhibited by NAC. NAC Does Not Inhibit Nonselective Autophagy—We investigated if the non-selective autophagic process was altered by NAC. A well established biochemical method to measure non-selective autophagy is to follow vacuolar delivery and the further activation of Pho8Δ60p, a cytosolic variant of alkaline phosphatase Pho8p. The full-length protein Pho8p is exported to the vacuoles via the normal secretory pathway, where proteinase B-dependent cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide leads to the activation of the alkaline phosphatase activity. The N-terminal truncated mutant Pho8Δ60p cannot be exported and remains inactive in the cytosol. Upon induction of autophagy, it is sequestered by autophagosomes (macroautophagy) or vacuole invaginations (microautophagy) and delivered to the vacuole where activation takes place. The level of alkaline phosphatase activity in yeast cells where Pho8Δ60p has been substituted for Pho8p is therefore a quantitative measurement of non-selective autophagy. The alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in lactate-grown Pho8Δ60p-bearing cells submitted to nitrogen starvation, in the absence or presence of NAC (Fig. 5A). Alkaline phosphatase activity increased, independently of the presence of NAC, showing that this molecule did not inhibit non-selective autophagy. To confirm this observation, electron micrographs were traced for the presence of hallmarks of non-selective autophagy. We have previously reported that macroautophagy is nearly absent from lactate-grown cells submitted to nitrogen starvation and that only hallmarks of microautophagy (direct sequestration of surrounding cytoplasm by the vacuole and appearance of autophagic vesicles) could be observed under these conditions (3Kissová I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The characteristics of non-selective microautophagy have still been observed in the presence of NAC, further supporting the hypothesis that non-selective autophagy remained active in the presence of the molecule (Fig. 5B). The Role of Glutathione Metabolism—NAC has been shown to act as an antioxidant through at least two different processes: (i) it scavenges ROS through the reaction with its thiol group (40Aruoma O.I. Halliwell B. Hoey B.M. Butler J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar) and (ii) it stimulates glutathione synthesis after being converted to cysteine. To discriminate between these two effects, different experiments were carried out. ROS production during nitrogen starvation was measured as the conversion of non-fluorescent dihydroethidium to fluorescent ethidium. Because cellular respiration strongly decreased when cells were submitted to starvation (Table 1, W303), ROS production was normalized to the rate of oxygen consumption (Fig. 6): this ratio markedly increased after 6 and 24 h of starvation. Moreover, NAC did not affect this increase. This result suggested that the effect of NAC on mitophagy did not occur through its ROS scavenging properties. This observation was confirmed by comparing the effects of the d- and l-stereoisomers of N-acetylcysteine. N-Acetyl-d-cysteine has the same scavenging properties as the N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), but cannot enter the glutathione metabolic pathway (41Sjödin K. Nilsson E. Hallberg A. Tunek A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3981-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Contrary to the l-stereoisomer, the d-stereoisomer was without effect on sequestration of the mitochondrial GFP in the vacuoles following nitrogen starvation, because 96% of cells had mtGFP in the vacuoles after 24 h of starvation. This further suggested that the action of N-acetyl-l-cysteine on mitophagy involved its effect on glutathione metabolism but not its scavenging properties.TABLE 1Effect of NAC on cellular metabolic parameters"
https://openalex.org/W1965505615,"Human CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor expressed in a variety of cell types such as macrophage and adipocytes. This plasma membrane glycoprotein has a wide range of ligands including oxidized low density lipoprotein and long chain fatty acids which involves the receptor in diseases such as atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. CD36 is heavily modified post-translationally by N-linked glycosylation, and 10 putative glycosylation sites situated in the large extracellular loop of the protein have been identified; however, their utilization and role in the folding and function of the protein have not been characterized. Using mass spectrometry on purified and peptide N-glycosidase F-deglycosylated CD36 and also by comparing the electrophoretic mobility of different glycosylation site mutants, we have determined that 9 of the 10 sites can be modified by glycosylation. Flow cytometric analysis of the different glycosylation mutants expressed in mammalian cells established that glycosylation is necessary for trafficking to the plasma membrane. Minimally glycosylated mutants that supported trafficking were identified and indicated the importance of carboxyl-terminal sites Asn-247, Asn-321, and Asn-417. However, unlike SRBI, no individual site was found to be essential for proper trafficking of CD36. Surprisingly, these minimally glycosylated mutants appear to be predominantly core-glycosylated, indicating that mature glycosylation is not necessary for surface expression in mammalian cells. The data also show that neither the nature nor the pattern of glycosylation is relevant to binding of modified low density lipoprotein."

Here, we have examined the role of the proposed lateral gate of the translocon in translocation. A dual cysteine cross-linking approach allowed the introduction of cross-linker arms of various lengths between adjoining aminoacyl positions of transmembrane segments 2b and 7 of the lateral gate. Oxidation and short spacer linkers that fix the gate in the closed state abolished preprotein translocation, whereas long spacer linkers support translocation. The cross-linking data further suggests that SecYEG lateral gate opening and activation of the SecA ATPase are coupled processes. It is concluded that lateral gate opening is a critical step during SecA-dependent protein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2102004717,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) initiates multiple signal pathways and activates many downstream kinases. Here, we determined that TGF-beta1 bound cell surface hyaluronidase Hyal-2 on microvilli in type II TGF-beta receptor-deficient HCT116 cells, as determined by immunoelectron microscopy. This binding resulted in recruitment of proapoptotic WOX1 (also named WWOX or FOR) and formation of Hyal-2.WOX1 complexes for relocation to the nuclei. TGF-beta1 strengthened the binding of the catalytic domain of Hyal-2 with the N-terminal Tyr-33-phosphorylated WW domain of WOX1, as determined by time lapse fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis in live cells, co-immunoprecipitation, and yeast two-hybrid domain/domain mapping. In promoter activation assay, ectopic WOX1 or Hyal-2 alone increased the promoter activity driven by Smad. In combination, WOX1 and Hyal-2 dramatically enhanced the promoter activation (8-9-fold increases), which subsequently led to cell death (>95% of promoter-activated cells). TGF-beta1 supports L929 fibroblast growth. In contrast, transiently overexpressed WOX1 and Hyal-2 sensitized L929 to TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis. Together, TGF-beta1 invokes a novel signaling by engaging cell surface Hyal-2 and recruiting WOX1 for regulating the activation of Smad-driven promoter, thereby controlling cell growth and death."
https://openalex.org/W2073249718,"Liver glucokinase (LGK) plays an essential role in controlling blood glucose levels and maintaining cellular metabolic functions. Expression of LGK is induced mainly regulated by insulin through sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) as a mediator. Since LGK expression is known to be decreased in the liver of liver X receptor (LXR) knockout mice, we have investigated whether LGK might be directly activated by LXRalpha. Furthermore, we have studied interrelationship between transcription factors that control gene expression of LGK. In the current studies, we demonstrated that LXRalpha increased LGK expression in primary hepatocytes and that there is a functional LXR response element in the LGK gene promoter as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin precipitation assay. In addition, our studies demonstrate that LXRalpha and insulin activation of the LGK gene promoter occurs through a multifaceted indirect mechanism. LXRalpha increases SREBP-1c expression and then insulin stimulates the processing of the membrane-bound precursor SREBP-1c protein, and it activates LGK expression through SREBP sites in its promoter. LXRalpha also activates the LGK promoter by increasing the transcriptional activity and induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, which also stimulates LGK expression through a peroxisome proliferator-responsive element. This activation is tempered through a negative mechanism, where a small heterodimer partner (SHP) decreases LGK gene expression by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of LXRalpha and PPARgamma by directly interacting with their common heterodimer partner RXRalpha. From these data, we propose a mechanism for LXRalpha in controlling the gene expression of LGK that involves activation through SREBP-1c and PPARgamma and inhibition through SHP."
https://openalex.org/W2035626450,"Patients with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) suffer from defective T-cell Ca2+ signaling. A loss of Ca2+ entry has been linked at the molecular level to single missense mutation R91W in the store-operated Ca2+ channel ORAI1. However, the mechanistic impact of this mutation on ORAI1 function remains unclear. Confocal Förster resonance energy transfer microscopy revealed that dynamic store-operated coupling of STIM1 to ORAI1 R91W was largely sustained similar to wild-type ORAI1. Characterization of various point mutants at position 91 by whole cell patch clamp recordings displayed that neutral or even negatively charged amino acids did not abolish ORAI1 function. However, substitution by hydrophobic leucine, valine, or phenylalanine resulted in non-functional ORAI1 channels, despite preserved STIM1 coupling. Besides conformational constraints at the N terminus/membrane interface predicted for the hydrophobic mutants, additional key factor(s) were suggested to determine ORAI1 functionality. Calculation of the probability for the 1st transmembrane domain and its hydrophobicity revealed a substantial increase for all hydrophobic substitutions that lead to non-functional ORAI1 R91X mutants in contrast to those with hydrophilic residues. Hence, increased hydrophobicity might lead to disrupted permeation/gating, as an ORAI1 channel with increased pore size and R91W mutation failed to recover activity. In conclusion, the increase in hydrophobicity at the N terminus/membrane interface represents the major cause for yielding non-functional ORAI1 channels."

With serious doubts about the efficacy and safety of many treatments, the industry remains steeped in controversy. Little is known about factors affecting the prevalence of efficacious and non-efficacious self-medicative treatments. Here we develop mathematical models which reveal that the most efficacious treatments are not necessarily those most likely to spread. Indeed, purely superstitious remedies, or even maladaptive practices, spread more readily than efficacious treatments under specified circumstances. Low-efficacy practices sometimes spread because their very ineffectiveness results in longer, more salient demonstration and a larger number of converts, which more than compensates for greater rates of abandonment. These models also illuminate a broader range of phenomena, including the spread of innovations, medical treatment of animals, foraging behaviour, and self-medication in non-human primates."

Here we demonstrate that PLD-dependent generation of phosphatidic acid is critical for Rac1/IQGAP1 signal transduction, translocation of p47phox to cell periphery, and ROS production. Exposure of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) to hyperoxia (95% O2 and 5% CO2) in the presence of 0.05% 1-butanol, but not tertiary-butanol, stimulated PLD as evidenced by accumulation of [32P]phosphatidylbutanol. Infection of HPAECs with adenoviral constructs of PLD1 and PLD2 wild-type potentiated hyperoxia-induced PLD activation and accumulation of O2⋅−/reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, overexpression of catalytically inactive mutants of PLD (hPLD1-K898R or mPLD2-K758R) or down-regulation of expression of PLD with PLD1 or PLD2 siRNA did not augment hyperoxia-induced [32P]phosphatidylbutanol accumulation and ROS generation. Hyperoxia caused rapid activation and redistribution of Rac1, and IQGAP1 to cell periphery, and down-regulation of Rac1, and IQGAP1 attenuated hyperoxia-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and cortactin and ROS generation. Further, hyperoxia-mediated redistribution of Rac1, and IQGAP1 to membrane ruffles, was attenuated by PLD1 or PLD2 small interference RNA, suggesting that PLD is upstream of the Rac1/IQGAP1 signaling cascade. Finally, small interference RNA for PLD1 or PLD2 attenuated hyperoxia-induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and abolished Src, cortactin, and p47phox redistribution to cell periphery.

Phagocytic NADPH oxidase is activated when cytosolic p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 translocate to the phagosomes and plasma membrane and form a complex with integral membrane cytochrome b558, which, in turn, is a Nox2 (gp91phox)/p22phox heterodimer (5Clark R.A.

The interaction between p47phox and p22phox seems to be an essential requirement for the translocation of other cytosolic components of the oxidase.

Activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe enhanced the oxidative burst that correlated with PA accumulation, and inclusion of short-chain primary alcohols attenuated the NADPH oxidase mediated O2⋅−/ROS generation, suggesting a potential role for PLD in the regulation of NADPH oxidase (12Pendyala S.

However, the downstream targets of PLD that signal NADPH oxidase activation have not been fully characterized.Here, we identify for the first time that activation of IQGAP1 by Rac1 is downstream of PLD in hyperoxia-induced ROS generation. In addition, we show that activation of Rac1/IQGAP1 by PLD also regulates Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and p47phox translocation to cell periphery. Thus, our results define a novel molecular mechanism for hyperoxia-induced NADPH oxidase activation by PLD/PA-mediated p47phox membrane translocation via Rac1/IQGAP1/Src/cortactin signaling cascade.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), endothelial basal media (EBM-2), and a bullet kit were obtained from Lonza (San Diego, CA).

Cells were detached from T-75 flasks with 0.05% trypsin and resuspended in fresh complete medium, then cultured in 35-mm, 60-mm, or 100-mm dishes or on slide chambers for immunofluorescence studies. All cells were starved overnight in EGM-2 medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum prior to exposure to normoxia or hyperoxia.Exposure of Cells to Hyperoxia—HPAECs were placed in a humidity-controlled airtight modulator incubator chamber and flushed continuously with 95% O2-5% CO2 for 30 min until the oxygen level inside the chamber reached ∼95%. Chamber was then placed in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for the desired length of time. The concentration of O2 inside the chamber was monitored with a digital oxygen monitor. The buffering capacity of the cell culture medium did not change significantly during the period of hyperoxic exposure and was maintained at pH ∼ 7.4.RNA Isolation and Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HPAECs grown on 35-mm dishes using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. iQ SYBR Green Supermix was used to do the real-time measurements using iCycler by Bio-Rad. 18 S (sense, 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′) was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize expression. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.3 μg of total RNA (target gene) or 0.03 μg of total RNA (18 S rRNA), 12.5 μl of iQ SYBR Green, 2 μl of cDNA, 1.5 μm target primers, or 1 μm 18 S rRNA primers, in a total volume of 25 μl. For all samples, reverse transcription was carried out at 25 °C for 5 min, followed by cycling to 42 °C for 30 min and 85 °C for 5 min with iScript cDNA synthesis kit. Amplicon expression in each sample was normalized to its 18 S rRNA content. The relative abundance of target mRNA in each sample was calculated as 2 raised to the negative of its threshold cycle value times 106 after being normalized to the abundance of its corresponding 18 S rRNA (housekeeping gene), (2-(primer Threshold Cycle)/2-(18 S Threshold Cycle) × 106). All primers were designed by inspection of the genes of interest using Primer 3 software. Negative controls, consisting of reaction mixtures containing all components except target RNA, were included with each of the reverse transcription-PCR runs. To verify that amplified products were derived from mRNA and did not represent genomic DNA contamination, representative PCR mixtures for each gene were run in the absence of the reverse transcription enzyme after first being cycled to 95 °C for 15 min. In the absence of reverse transcription, no PCR products were observed.Transfection and Infection of HPAECs—For siRNA experiments HPAECs were transfected with Fl-luciferase GL2 duplex siRNA (target sequence: 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′, Dharmacon, CO) as a positive control (scrambled RNA). HPAECs grown to ∼60-70% confluence were transfected with Gene Silencer transfection agent plus scrambled RNA or PLD1, PLD2, Tiam1, Rac1, or IQGAP1 siRNA (50 nm) in serum-free EBM-2 medium according to the manufacturer's recommendations. At 3 h post-transfection, fresh complete EGM-2 medium was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 72 h prior to experiments.For cDNA experiments HPAECs grown to ∼50% confluence were transfected with 1 μg/ml Vector-control or plasmids DNA of IQGAP1-Myc (Wt and Mn) or p47phox-GFP using FuGene HD (3 μg/ml) transfection reagent in serum-free EGM-2 medium according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After 3 h the medium was replaced by complete EGM-2, and the cells were incubated for 72 h post-transfection.For transient infection adenoviral constructs (5 plaqueforming units/cell) of Vector-control, PLD1 Wt, PLD1 Mn, PLD2 Wt, PLD2 Mn, or Rac1 dominant-negative were added to HPAECs grown to ∼80% confluence in complete EGM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After overnight culture, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh complete medium, exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia, and treated as indicated.Determination of Hyperoxia-induced ROS Formation—ROS production in HPAECs exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia was determined by the DCFDA fluorescence measured by spectrofluorometer or fluorescence microscopy (14Parinandi N.L.

HPAECs were loaded with 10 μm DCFDA for 30 min in serum-free medium at 37 °C in a 95% air-5% CO2 environment. At the end of incubation, the medium containing DCFDA was aspirated, cells were washed once with complete medium, complete medium was added, and cells were exposed to normoxia and hyperoxia. For spectrofluorometer measurements cells were scraped, and the medium containing cells was transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The medium was aspirated, and the cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold PBS and sonicated on ice with a probe sonicator for 15 s in 500 μl of ice-cold PBS to prepare cell lysates. Fluorescence of oxidized DCFDA in cell lysates, an index of formation of ROS, was measured on an Aminco Bowman series 2 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission set at 490 and 530 nm, respectively, using appropriate blanks. All above steps were performed in the dark. The extent of ROS formation was expressed as a percentage of normoxic control. For fluorescent microscopy measurements cells were washed twice with Phenol Red-free basal EBM-2, and fluorescence of oxidized DCFDA was examined under a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S fluorescence microscopy with a Hamamatsu digital charge-coupled device camera (Japan) using a 20× objective lens. Statistics of entire images were calculated using MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp., PA) and expressed as % of Control.PLD Activation in Intact ECs—HPAECs were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 18-24 h (29Parinandi N.L.

Cells were washed in minimal essential medium and exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia for varying time periods in the presence of 0.05% 1-butanol or tertiary butanol as indicated in the figures. The incubations were terminated by addition of methanol-concentrated HCl (100:1, v/v). [32P]PBt formed as a result of PLD activation and trans-phosphatidylation reaction, an index of in vivo PLD stimulation (31Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was separated by TLC in 1% potassium oxalate-impregnated silica gel H plates using the upper phase of ethyl acetate-2,2,4-trimethyl pentane-glacial acetic acid-water (65:10:15:50, v/v) as the developing solvent system (31Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unlabeled PBt was added as a carrier during the lipid separation by TLC and was visualized under iodine vapors. Radioactivity associated with PBt was quantified by liquid scintillation counting, and data are expressed as dpm normalized to 106 counts in total lipid extract or as a percentage of control.Rac1 Activation Assay—HPAECs were cultured in 100-mm dishes, exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia and Rac1 activation was evaluated using the Rac1 Activation Assay Kit as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after exposure to hyperoxia, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with lyses buffer. Cell lysates (0.5-1 mg/ml) were loaded with 10 μg of PAK-1 p21-binding domain fusion-protein conjugated to agarose for 1 h to bind Rac1-GTP, centrifuged, and washed three times with lyses buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies as indicated. Quantification of the bands was performed by ImageJ software (NIH) and expressed in pixels (% Control). Total cell lysates were also probed separately with anti-actin antibody to confirm equal loading.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HPAECs grown on slide chambers were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia then immediately fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized for 4 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde containing 0.25% Triton X-100. In some experiments for Rac1, Tiam1, IQGAP1, and p-Src staining, permeabilization was performed by methanol treatment for 4 min at -20 °C. Then cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in TBST blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with primary antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, 1 h). Thoroughly rinsed with TBST, cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, 1 h). After washing slides were prepared with maintain media and examined with a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S fluorescence microscope and Hamamatsu digital camera (Japan) using a 60× oil immersion objective lens. Protein redistribution to cell periphery was estimated by statistics of equivalent square of cell periphery from normoxic and hyperoxic samples and MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp.).Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—HPAECs were serum-deprived for ∼18 h in EBM-2 containing 1% fetal bovine serum. After exposure to normoxia or hyperoxia, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm vanadate, scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm Na3VO4; 1 mm NaF; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 1% phosphatases inhibitor mixture, sonicated on ice with a probe sonicator (15 s), and centrifuged at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C) for 5 min. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using a Pierce protein assay kit. Equal volumes of the supernatants, adjusted to 1 mg of protein/ml, were denatured by boiling in 6× SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (0.5-1 mg of protein) were incubated overnight with 2 μg/ml appropriate antibodies, conjugated to protein A/G PLUS-agarose (50 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were washed in lyses buffer, dissociated by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min and separated on SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were transferred overnight (25 V, 4 °C) on polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes, probed with primary and secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol, and detected by the ECL kit. The blots were scanned (UMAX Power Lock II) and quantified by an ImageJ software (NIH). To verify unspecific protein co-immunoprecipitation cell lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated overnight with 2 μg of rabbit IgG and IQGAP1 or Cortactin, conjugated to protein A/G PLUS-agarose (50 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C and Western blotted as described above.Statistics—Analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keul's test were used to compare means of two or more different treatment groups.

https://openalex.org/W2157784490,"Activation of p53 is an important mechanism in apoptosis. However, whether the presence of p53 in mitochondria plays an important role in p53-mediated apoptosis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of NPM (nucleophosmin) significantly suppresses 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-mediated apoptosis, in part, by blocking the mitochondrial localization of p53. Within 1 h following TPA treatment of skin epithelial (JB6) cells, p53 accumulated in mitochondria. Expression of NPM enhances p53 levels in the nucleus but reduces p53 levels in mitochondria, as detected by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. The suppressive effect of NPM on p53 mitochondrial localization is also observed in TPA-treated primary epithelial cells and in JB6 cells treated with doxorubicin. NPM enhances the expression of p53 target gene p21 and bax. However, the increase in Bax level in the absence of p53 in mitochondria did not lead to an increase in TPA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the presence of p53 in mitochondria is important. Suppression of NPM by NPM small interfering RNA leads to an increase of p53 levels in mitochondria and apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression of NPM in tumor cells with a high constitutive level of NPM results in p53 translocation to mitochondria and enhances TPA-mediated apoptosis. The results demonstrate the effect of NPM on p53 localization in mitochondria and apoptosis. Together, the data indicate that the presence of p53 in mitochondria plays an important role in stress-induced apoptosis and suggest that NPM may protect cells from apoptosis by reducing the mitochondrial level of p53.

The tumor suppressor functions of p53 are mediated by inhibiting the growth of defective cells through activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 2Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 3Bates S.

Vousden K.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). p53 level is increased upon exposure to various stimuli, including DNA damage, oncogenic stimuli, hypoxia (4Lohrum M.A. Vousden K.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and oxidative stress (5Dhar S.K. Xu Y. Chen Y. St. Clair D.K. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recently, the linkage between mitochondrial oxidative stress and p53-induced apoptosis has attracted considerable attention for the following reasons. First, p53-mediated apoptosis is preceded by activation of various oxidoreductases and reactive oxygen species generation before mitochondrial perturbation (7Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Second, p53 transactivates several mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins, including Bax, a member of the bcl2 family (8Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar); Noxa, a BH3-only member of the bcl2 family (9Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T.

Third, a fraction of p53 is localized in the mitochondria at the onset of p53-dependent apoptosis preceding changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation (11Erster S. Mihara M. Kim R.H. Petrenko O. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6728-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Li P.F. Dietz R. Von Harsdorf R.

Therefore, it has been suggested that p53 may mediate apoptosis by mechanisms that are both dependent on and independent of its transcriptional activity, thus amplifying its apoptotic function. p53 is considered to be the guardian of the genome. To enhance the efficiency of p53-dependent transcription of target genes as well as to protect the genome from damage, p53 stabilization is required. It has been reported that NPM (nucleophosmin), a nucleolar phosphoprotein implicated in ribosome biogenesis (14Wu M.H. Yung B.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48234-48240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), stabilizes and regulates the transcriptional activity of p53 (15Colombo E. Marine J.C. Danovi D. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). NPM acts as a molecular chaperone and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (16Bertwistle D. Sugimoto M. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The enhancement of p53 stability and transcriptional ability of NPM may occur through several mechanisms, including inhibition of Mdm2 ubiquitin-ligase activity, competition with p53-Mdm2 bindings, and NPM chaperonage of p53 (15Colombo E. Marine J.C. Danovi D. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 17Kurki S. Peltonen K. Latonen L. Kiviharju T.M. Ojala P.M. Meek D. Laiho M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The stability of p53 proteins is primarily regulated by Mdm2, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and Arf, a nucleolar protein that binds with p53 and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 for p53 (18Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Colombo et al. (19Colombo E. Bonetti P. Lazzerni E.D. Martinelli P. Zamponi R. Marine J.C. Helin K. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8874-8886Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have reported that lack of NPM expression in NPM−/− embryonic fibroblast cells resulted in widespread apoptosis in wild type p53-expressing cells. However, no significant apoptosis was observed in double knock-out (p53−/−) cells (19Colombo E. Bonetti P. Lazzerni E.D. Martinelli P. Zamponi R. Marine J.C. Helin K. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8874-8886Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that NPM suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis. Thus, it remains unclear how the interaction of NPM with p53 affects p53-mediated apoptosis. NPM is overexpressed in many types of human cancer, including colon (20Nozawa Y. Van Belzen N. Van der Made A.C. Dinjens W.N. Bosman F.T. J. Pathol. 1996; 178: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), ovarian (21Shields L.B. Gercel-Taylor C. Yashar C.M. Wan T.C. Katsanis W.A.

It has been proposed that NPM has both antiapoptotic and apoptotic capabilities, depending on its level and subcellular localization (15Colombo E. Marine J.C. Danovi D. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Nat.

Similar to other proto-oncogenes, NPM overexpression is primarily associated with cell proliferation (27Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), suggesting that NPM may act as a proto-oncogene by promoting cell survival. It has been demonstrated that NPM may also act as a co-activator for the transcription of survival genes, including bcl2, a member of the Bcl2 protein family identified as an oncogene from human follicular lymphoma of B cell origin (28Bakhshi A.

It has been well documented that Bcl2 prevents most forms of apoptotic cell death; however, whether the antiapoptotic role of NPM is mediated via bcl2 is not known. Our study shows that bcl2 does not play a major role in NPM-mediated protection from TPA 2The abbreviations used are: TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labelingHMEhuman mammary epithelialsiRNAsmall interfering RNAPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenVDACvoltage-dependent anion channel. -induced apoptosis and that the antiapoptotic function of NPM is associated with its ability to suppress p53 localization to mitochondria.

The mouse skin epithelial cell line (JB6 P+, clone 41, promotable by TPA treatment) was originally provided by Dr. Nancy H. Colburn (NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health), maintained as described previously (30Colburn N.H. Former B.F. Nelson K.A. Yuspa S.H. Nature. 1979; 281: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and cultured in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Inc., Logan, UT), 200 μml-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic (Invitrogen). The primary human mammary epithelial cells were purchased from Clonetics and cultured for three passages in primary culture medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was cultured in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Inc., Logan, UT), 200 μml-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% PSN antibiotic (Invitrogen). All cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Unless otherwise stated, all antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody and wild- type anti-p53 (Ab-11) antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Oncogene (Boston, MA), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal Mn-SOD antibody and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Nucleophosmin expression vector (pcDNA3.1/ NPM) was purchased from Invitrogen. Both control siRNA and NPM siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Doxorubicin and TPA were purchased from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH) and Sigma, respectively. Cells were grown for 24 h with no antibiotics to obtain 70–80% confluence. The cells were then transfected with plasmids following a Lipofectamine® transfection protocol, as directed by the manufacturer. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of NPM cDNA construct in pcDNA3.1 plasmid vector or pcDNA3.1 (−NPM) vector alone as control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh medium. Cells were grown for another 24 h prior to TPA treatment. One hour post-treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and processed for mitochondrial isolation, nuclear extract preparation, or whole cell lysate preparation. siRNAs (20 nm) were transfected using Transfectin® for 48 h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The siRNA sequence targeting NPM gene silencing is as follows: antisense, 5′-UUCUUAAUGACAACUGGUGtt-3′; sense, 5′-CACCAGUUGUCAUUAAGAAtt-3′. The 2-bp mismatch siRNA (used to verify the specificity of NPM silencing) sequence is as follows: antisense, 5′-GGCUUAAUGACAACUGGUGtt-3′; sense, 5′-CACCAGUUGUCAUUAAGCCtt-3′. Nuclei were isolated from JB6 cells. A subconfluent monolayer of cells was collected and centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to obtain cell pellets. Cell pellets were then resuspended in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with the inclusion of protease inhibitors (pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Additionally, the phosphatase inhibitors NaF (5 mm) and Na3VO4 (1 mm) were included. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min. 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 s. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 s. Subsequently, the nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 35% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor (pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclear proteins in the supernatant fraction were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Approximately 10 million cells were suspended in 1 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with a dropwise addition of 500 mm Tris) in a 15-ml plastic tube and homogenized using a Wheaton homogenizer three times with 30-s strokes on ice. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 576 × g (2200 rpm) for 5 min in a Sorval SS34 rotor. The supernatant was filtered through a nylon screen cloth (Small Parts Inc., Miami Lakes, FL) and centrifuged at 9000 × g (8700 rpm) for 10 min. The pellet was washed by adding 0.5 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 5 min. The washing step was repeated to remove cytosolic contamination. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of mitochondrial isolation buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fresh mitochondrial suspension was used for all of the experiments. Total cell lysate, mitochondria, and nuclear proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Samples were boiled with 1× Laemmli buffer and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The transfer efficiency was assessed by incubation with 0.1% Ponceau solution. The membrane was washed with distilled water until the dye disappeared completely. The membranes were then blocked by 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) buffer, pH 7.8, for at least 1 h at room temperature. After a short wash with TBS-T buffer, the membranes were incubated in the primary antibody for at least 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk at a dilution range of 1000–5000. The membranes were then washed three times each for 10 min with TBS-T. The membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody at a dilution range of 2000–10,000 for 1–2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed twice with TBS-T buffer for 10 min and once with PBS for 5 min. Proteins were detected using the ECL® system (Amersham Biosciences). The Quantity One® Image Analyzer software program (Bio-Rad) was used for quantitative densitometric analysis. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed on JB6 cells with radioimmune precipitation buffer (9.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were mouse anti-p53 (DO-1). One mg of cellular protein was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 2 μg of corresponding antibodies. After incubation with the antibody, 20 μl of protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixture of the antibody and nuclear extract and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min, followed by washing four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Following the final wash, all of the adhering liquids with the protein A/G beads were removed. Samples were then resuspended in the 1× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were then detected by Western blotting. Mouse epithelial (JB6) cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/NPM expression vector. Twenty-four h post transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded (104 cells/400 μl/well) into 8-well poly-l-lysine-coated glass chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and grown for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with 200 nmol/liter MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in culture medium for 30 min, after which the dye was removed, and cells were treated with TPA (100 nmol/liter) for 1 h. Cells were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After two washes with cold PBS (pH 7.4), cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Three percent donkey serum was used to block the nonspecific antibody binding. Anti-p53 antibody (Ab-11) or anti-NPM-v5 antibody (catalogue number 46-0705; Invitrogen) was added at a dilution of 1:100 with 3% donkey serum and incubated at 37 °C, followed by incubation with either anti-mouse IgG-FITC or anti-mouse IgG-Cy2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h. Antibodies were then removed and washed three times with 1× PBS (pH 7.4). 100 μl of 1:10,000 diluted Hoechst 33342 dye was added in each well, and after 10 min, cells were washed with 1× PBS (pH 7.4) to visualize the nucleus. Slides were partially dried and mounted with glycerol. Fluorescence was immediately detected using a Leica (Benheim, Germany) laser-scanning confocal microscope with a magnification of ×40. Cells were plated (1 × 104) in an 8-chambered polystyrene vessel tissue culture-treated glass slide (BD Biosciences) in 400 μl of medium, and the cells were grown for 24 h. Cells were treated with TPA for 24 h and washed with PBS, and apoptotic cells were detected by using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, fluorescein; Roche Applied Science) assay kit, which catalyzes polymerization of labeled nucleotides to free 3′-OH ends of DNA in a template-dependent manner (TUNEL reaction). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, followed by the permeabilization of cells with 0.1% Triton X and 0.1% sodium citrate solution. After twice washing the cells with 1× PBS (pH 7.4), TUNEL reaction mixture was added, and the slide was then incubated for 60 min in the dark in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. TUNEL-positive cells were counted using fluorescence microscopy. The apoptotic cell numbers were scored by counting 3 × 300 cells for each group in a random manner. The experiment was repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Caspase 3 activity assay was performed colorimetrically using a substrate Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide in accordance with the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Sigma). Briefly, JB6 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/NPM for 48 h. After treatment with TPA for 1 h, the cells were washed with 1× PBS and then lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 nm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol in addition to 1 μg/ml aprotinin and pepstatin. The cell lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford method, and the caspase 3 activity in the supernatant was measured immediately. Fifty-microgram protein samples or the appropriate amount of standard was added to 980 ml of assay buffer. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 20 mm caspase 3 substrate Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide. The tubes were covered and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cleavage of the chemophore from the substrate was detected spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 nm. Caspase 3 activity was calculated by comparing it with the standard caspase 3 activities from the same experiment and was expressed as nmol of p-nitroanilide/μg of protein/min. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance for comparison. Bonferroni's post-test multiple comparisons procedure was used to determine the statistical significance. Data shown represent mean ± S.D. Previously, we demonstrated that the total cellular level of p53 was increased after TPA treatment. Consistent with the earlier study, we now have found that p53 was increased as early as 30 min with a significant increase at 1 and 3 h and a decline by 24 h after TPA treatment (Fig. 1A). We have also reported that a fraction of p53 translocated to mitochondria during TPA-induced apoptosis (6Zhao Y. Chaiswing L. Velez J.M. Batinic-Haberle I. Colburn N.H. Oberley T.D. St. Clair D.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The finding that the p53 level in mitochondria was increased after TPA treatment supports our previous findings (Fig. 1B). The purity of isolated mitochondria was monitored by the presence of minimal nucleus-specific protein PCNA after prolonged exposures (Fig. 1B). Mitochondrial marker, VDAC, and Mn-SOD were detected in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1B). These data confirm that p53 is present in mitochondria and is increased after TPA treatment. NPM is a nucleolar protein that can stabilize p53; we therefore investigated how NPM affects the level of p53 in the mitochondria by transfecting NPM expression vector in JB6 cells. Cells were then treated with TPA for 1 h, the mitochondrial fraction was isolated, and the presence of p53 was confirmed by Western blotting. The result shows that cells overexpressing NPM lack p53 in mitochondria (Fig. 2A). To monitor whether the absence of p53 in the mitochondria was due to unknown alteration of p53 resulting in the loss of antibody recognition, we used antibodies from two different sources (Ab-11 and DO-1). The results indicate that mitochondrial p53 was detectable in pcDNA3.1-transfected cells but was undetectable in the mitochondria of NPM-transfected cells. In vector only-transfected cells, p53 was present in the mitochondria, and its level was further increased after TPA treatment. The presence of p53 in mitochondria was not due to nuclear contamination, as verified by Western blotting with antibody specific to PCNA (Fig. 2A). To further verify the suppressive effects of NPM on mitochondrial p53 level, we performed immunocytochemistry staining using antibodies to NPM or p53. The overexpressed NPM was localized mainly in the nucleus with and without TPA treatment (Fig. 2B). In vector-transfected control cells, the p53 level was clearly visible in the cytosol. In contrast, the presence of p53 in NPM-overexpressed cells was largely co-localized with NPM in the nucleus (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the co-localization of NPM and p53 is associated with the physical interaction between these two proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using antibody to p53 followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D). The results show that p53 antibody is able to immunoprecipitate NPM, which is confirmed by Western blot analysis. Overexpression of NPM increased the immunoprecipitated proteins as compared with vector-transfected control. These results suggest that p53 interacts with both endogenously and ectopically expressed NPM. To probe whether the effect of NPM on p53 translocation was specific for TPA, we treated JB6 cells with doxorubicin (0.34 μm). Consistent with a more general effect of NPM on mitochondrial p53, treatment with doxorubicin enhanced p53 localization to mitochondria, which was prevented by overexpression of NPM (Fig. 2E). Because co-localization and subcellular fractionation experiments suggest that NPM overexpression may retain p53 in the nucleus, we determined p53 levels in isolated nuclear fractions by Western blotting. TPA treatment for 1 h increased nuclear p53 levels both in pcDNA3.1 (−NPM) and pcDNA3.1/NPM (+NPM) expression vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3). Interestingly, overexpression of NPM alone had a positive effect on the nuclear level of p53 (Fig. 3). The increased nuclear level of p53 in NPM-overexpressed cells was supported by the enhanced level of its target protein p21 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 3). This possibility was further supported by the enhanced level of phosphorylated p53 in NPM-overexpressed cells. These results suggest that the enhanced p53 level is trascriptionally active in JB6 cells. It has been shown that NPM stabilizes p53. To determine whether the lack of mitochondrial p53 in NPM-overexpressed cells is associated with an alteration of p53 stability, we determined the level of p53 in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. Transiently transfected cells were treated with TPA for 1 h, and then cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) was added to the medium, and nuclear extracts were collected as a function of time after treatment. The kinetics of p53 degradation in the presence of cycloheximide with or without an NPM-overexpressed condition were monitored by Western analysis (supplemental Fig. 1). The results demonstrate that the rate of decline in p53 levels in NPM-overexpressed cells is slower than the rate of decline of p53 levels in pcDNA3.1 vector-transfected cells. Densitometric quantification of the intensity of p53 bands indicates that the estimated half-life of p53 in NPM-overexpressed cells is longer than the control vector-transfected cells (supplemental Table 1). This result demonstrates that NPM stabilizes p53 in TPA-treated cells. Because overexpression of NPM reduces the level of p53 in the mitochondria, we investigated the effect of NPM in TPA-induced apoptosis. Treatment with TPA significantly increased apoptosis in JB6 cells, as determined by the presence of TUNEL-positive cells. Overexpression of NPM significantly reduced"

The Hh signaling pathway is essential for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis in metazoans. Hh ligands function through three main components: a 12-transmembrane protein receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), a seven-transmembrane protein co-receptor Smo, and the transcription factors of Gli family (1Rohatgi R. Scott M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Binding of secreted Hh proteins to Ptch1 results in subcellular relocation and conformation changes of Smo that in turn promote the expression of Hh target genes through the Gli transcription factors (1Rohatgi R. Scott M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hh signaling regulates both cell proliferation and differentiation during normal embryogenesis. Recent studies indicate that Hh pathway activation is also essential for postembryonic tissue repair and stem cell regulation (2Karhadkar S.S. Bova G.S. Abdallah N. Dhara S. Gardner D. Maitra A.

Mutations in both Ptch1 and Smo have been identified in human medulloblastoma (10Hahn H. Wojnowski L. Miller G. Zimmer A. J. Mol.

In addition to its roles in embryonic patterning and cancer, the Hh signaling pathway is required for organogenesis such as pancreas formation and angiogenesis. Studies in zebrafish and mice indicate that Hh pathway deficiencies result in deceased vascular structures. Shh-deficient mice have abnormal pulmonary vasculature formation and diminished airway branching in lungs (12Pepicelli C.V. Lewis P.M. McMahon A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1083-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Zebrafish embryos lacking Hh signaling display defects of the primary intersegmental vessel sprouting (13Gering M. Patient R. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Shh appears to promote the maturation of blood vessels by regulating the mRNA levels of angiopoietin-1 and -2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (14Pola R. Ling L.E. Silver M. Corbley M.J. Kearney M. Blake Pepinsky R. Shapiro R. Taylor F.R. Baker D.P. Asahara T. Isner J.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Hh signaling also plays an important role in tumor-associated angiogenesis. When treated with cyclopamine, a plant-derived steroidal alkaloid antagonist of Hh signaling pathway, tumorgenic vascular structures become dramatically reduced (15Nagase M. Nagase T. Koshima I. Fujita T. Microvasc. Res. 2006; 71: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Geng L. Cuneo K.C. Cooper M.K. Wang H. Sekhar K. Fu A. Hallahan D.E. Angiogenesis. 2007; 10: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because mutated Ptch1 or Smo proteins are mostly responsible for the abnormal activation of Hh related to human diseases, intense efforts have been invested to identify therapeutic inhibitors acting on or downstream of Smo. Cyclopamine is one of the compounds that specifically block Hh signaling pathway through direct interaction with Smo (17Chen J.K. Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Beachy P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 18Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The effect of oncogenic mutations in Smo and Patched appears reversible by cyclopamine (19Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A.

Using cell-based screening platforms with a luciferase reporter under the control of multiple Gli1-binding sites, several additional synthetic Hh inhibitors with Smo binding affinity have been identified (23Frank-Kamenetsky M.

Some of these Hh inhibitors are able to suppress basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastomas in animal models (25Williams J.A. Guicherit O.M. Zaharian B.I. Xu Y. Chai L. Wichterle H. Kon C.

With such a broad implication of Hh activity in normal biological processes and cancers, it is highly desirable to develop efficient screen platforms for identifying potent and specific inhibitors. To this end, we developed a Gli-GFP 4The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinhpfhours post-fertilizationDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferISVintersegmental blood vessel(s). 4The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinhpfhours post-fertilizationDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferISVintersegmental blood vessel(s). transgenic zebrafish model that allows in vivo detection of Hh activity in whole living embryos. Because genetic Hh-deficient zebrafish embryos have defined phenotypes, they can be used to characterize the efficiency and specificity of the inhibitors. For instance, treatment of zebrafish embryos with cyclopamine will induce phenotypes identical to those associated with Smo mutations in zebrafish, including U-shaped somites, shorter intersegmental blood vessels, and fewer pancreatic β cells. green fluorescent protein hours post-fertilization Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fluorescence resonance energy transfer intersegmental blood vessel(s). green fluorescent protein hours post-fertilization Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fluorescence resonance energy transfer intersegmental blood vessel(s). Using zebrafish embryos, we screened a chemical library based on the structure of SAG, a synthetic Hh pathway agonist that directly targets Smo in a manner that antagonizes cyclopamine action (23Frank-Kamenetsky M. Zhang X.M. Bottega S. Guicherit O. Wichterle H. Dudek H. Bumcrot D. Wang F.Y. Jones S. Shulok J. Rubin L.L. Porter J.A. J. Biol. 2002; 1: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 24Chen J.K.

Of the small molecule modulators of Smo that have been reported, SAG is particularly potent with efficacy in the low nanomolar range, and its effects on murine embryogenesis also suggest that this agonist is highly specific for the Hh pathway (23Frank-Kamenetsky M. Zhang X.M. Bottega S. Guicherit O. Wichterle H. Dudek H. Bumcrot D. Wang F.Y. Jones S. Shulok J. Rubin L.L. Porter J.A. J. Biol. 2002; 1: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Because agonists and antagonists of several transmembrane proteins are often structurally related (28Fischer J. Ganellin C.R. International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.Analogue-based Drug Discovery. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2006: xxxi-x575Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we reasoned that modification of SAG structure could generate additional inhibitors targeting Smo with high potency and specificity. Here we report two lead compounds identified from our studies and demonstrate their ability to inhibit Hh pathway activation in cultured cells and whole organisms through binding to Smo. Furthermore, we provide evidence that SAG and our compounds regulate Smo activity through conformation changes. These new inhibitors should be useful as reagents for interrogating Hh pathway-dependent physiology and as drug candidates for targeting dysregulated Hh pathway activity in pathological conditions. The details are described in the supplemental materials and Ref. 29Wang N. Xiang J. Ma Z. Quan J. Chen J. Yang Z. J. Comb. Chem. 2008; 10: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. supplemental Fig. S1 illustrates our new synthetic route of SAG, and supplemental Fig. S2 demonstrates parallel syntheses of the initial SANT library. Accordingly, the scaffold of SANT could be constructed by combining five distinct modules. The design elements for SANT library included varying the substitution pattern of the biaryl fragment, replacing the cyclohexane-1,4-diamine with benzene-1,4-diamine, changing chloride on the benzo[b]thiophene ring to hydrogen, and displacing the methyl group with other alkyl groups. Synthetically, the biaryl subunit C1–4 was achieved by palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction of the commercially available aryl boronic acids A1–2 and aryl bromides B1–2 (see supplemental Fig. S2); C1–4 then underwent the reductive amination with amine D1–2 to form the secondary amines E1–8. After coupling with two types of acyl chloride F1–2, the formed products were then reacted with alkyl iodide, followed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid to give a 48-membered SANT library in overall good yields (29Wang N. Xiang J. Ma Z. Quan J. Chen J. Yang Z. J. Comb. Chem. 2008; 10: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. A DNA fragment containing the 8 Gli-binding sites with a minimal promoter was generated by PCR from Gli-dependent firefly luciferase plasmids (30Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using primer 8gli (forward, CGAGCTAGCGGATCCCCGGGAACAGATTC, and reverse, GCGACGCGTTTTACCAACAGTACCGG). The PCR product digested with NheI and MluI was ligated to GFP and used to generate transgenic zebrafish by microinjection. We identified eight founder lines expressing GFP that reflect the pattern of Hh signaling activity in developing embryos. Four lines exhibiting stronger expression throughout development were maintained and used in this study. The primary screen was carried out in 96-well plates. 2 μl of each compound (8 mm in Me2SO) was diluted to a total volume of 200 μl with Holtfreter's buffer. The average concentration of each small molecule was ∼80 μm. The embryos were distributed to 96-well plates with three embryos placed in each well. Then diluted solution of each compound was added. The embryos were exposed to compound solution and incubated at 28.5 °C from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) until 48 hpf. Phenotypes were observed for two times at 36 and 48 hpf, separately. Once active compounds were identified, each one was analyzed at 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 0.5 μm to determine its lowest effective concentration. GFP-positive embryos or larvae were viewed under an Axioimager Z1 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss), equipped with 5, 10, and 20× lenses and filter set 10 for detection of GFP (excitation, 450–490 nm; barrier, 510 nm; emission, 515–565 nm). The larvae were exposed to different concentrations of small molecules from 2 hpf. Total RNA was extracted from the embryos at 36 hpf using the TRIzol kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Three groups/treatment, each composed of 20 embryos, were assayed using SYBRGreen qPCR kit by real time PCR (ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector system). The primer sequences used were as follows: zgli1, forward, GGGGAACATCTACAGTCATC, and reverse, GTGGCAGTTCGTCTCATAAA; zptc1, forward, TGATTGTGACTCCTTTGG, and reverse, TCCTTATTAGGGGCACTG; and zbactin1, forward, CTATGAGCTGCCTGACGG, and reverse, TGGTGGAAGGAGCAAGAG. Shh-LIGHT2 cells (ATCC CRL-2795), a NIH-3T3 cell line stably incorporating Gli-dependent firefly luciferase and thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase reporters (19Taipale J. Chen J.K.

Nature. 2000; 406: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), were cultured to confluency in 96-well plates using DMEM containing 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were then treated with various concentrations of the compounds in DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum and a 1:20 dilution of Shh-N-conditioned medium (24Chen J.K. Taipale J. Young K.E. Maiti T. Beachy P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14071-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for an additional 30 h under standard conditions. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured on a Veritas luminometer (Turner Biosystems) using a dual luciferase kit (Promega) according to the manufacturers' protocols. HEK 293T cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin to 50% confluency in 96-well plates and then transfected with a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven mouse Smoothened-Myc3 expression construct (100 ng of cDNA/well) with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols. After 12 h the cells were incubated with DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 10 μm Hoechst 33342, 5 nm BODIPY-labeled cyclopamine (17Chen J.K. Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Beachy P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), and various concentrations of SANT 75 for 1 h. The cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then imaged in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum using an ImageXpress 5000A microscopy system (Molecular Devices). To construct mSmo-CFPC/YFPC, CFP, or YFP was fused in frame to mSmo C terminus in pGE vector between NheI and SalI, respectively, with the following primer sequences: 5′-GTACGCTAGCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-GTACGTCGACTCACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′. To construct mSmo-CFPN/YFPN, CFP or YFP was inserted in frame into mSmo by SpeI site after signal peptide site (amino acid 31). The primer sequences are as follows: 5′-GTACACTAGTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGCTG-3′, and 5′-GTACACTAGTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′. To construct mSmo-CFPL2YFPC, CFP was inserted into mSmoYFP construction by NotI after mSmo amino acid 355. The primer sequences are as follows: 5′-GTACGCGGCCGCTGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-GTACGCGGCCGCACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′. The effect of SAG, SANT74, and SANT75 on mSmo conformation change was tested by FRET in NIH-3T3 cells that were co-transfected with mouse Smo CFP and Smo YFP reporter constructs. NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum and antibiotics PS at 5%CO2 in a humidified incubator. Transfection was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For FRET analysis of cultured cells, CFP- and YFP-tagged constructs were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells. Transfected cells were treated in the presence of compounds with or without Shh-conditioned medium. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min, and mounted on slides in 80% glycerol. Fluorescence signals were acquired with the 100× objective of a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. CFP was excited by 458-nm light, and the emission was collected through a BP 480–520-nm filter. YFP was excited by 514-nm light, and the emission was collected through a BP 535–590-nm filter. CFP signal was obtained once before and once after photobleaching YFP using the full power of the 514-nm laser line for 1–2 min at the top half of each cell, leaving the bottom half unbleached that serves as an internal control. The intensity of CFP was analyzed using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp). Energy transfer efficiency was calculated using the formula: FRET% = (CFP signal after photobleaching − CFP signal before photobleaching/CFP signal after photobleaching) × 100. Each data set was based on 10–15 individual cells. In each cell, four to five regions of interest in photobleached area were selected for analysis. Our initial syntheses produced 48 compounds that were designed to survey the functional importance of the following structural elements in SAG: 1) position of nitrogen atom on pyridine, 2) direction of the two aryl rings, 3) chloro-substituent on benzo[b]thiophene, 4) the conformation and electric effect of the six-member ring connecting the amine and amide, and 5) size of the substituted group on the amine (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). In zebrafish, Shh is expressed primarily in notochord during embryogenesis (Fig. 1A). We produced stable transgenic zebrafish carrying reporter constructs with eight Gli-binding sites linked to a minimal promoter and GFP. We obtained several lines in which the transgenic embryos exhibited the strongest GFP expression in the somite tissues immediately adjacent to the midline structure that has the highest Shh expression (Fig. 1, B and C). The GFP expression pattern is consistent with the expression of Gli1 and Ptc1 in zebrafish embryos at the stages analyzed. More importantly, this expression was abolished upon the treatment with 20 μm cyclopamine (Fig. 1D). These findings suggested that Gli-GFP expression in these transgenic fish was reflective of the endogenous activity pattern of Shh and was sensitive to Hh signaling level changes induced by chemical inhibitors. Using these embryos as a tool, we screened the library mentioned above and identified one compound that could block Gli-GFP expression at ∼80 μm (Fig. 1E), producing a phenotype visually identical to that of 20 μm cyclopamine treatment. We named this compound SANT19 for Smoothened antagonist (Fig. 1I), which has a structure very similar to SAG but with an ethyl group on the terminal nitrogen. Under the same condition, embryos treated by SAG had no effect on Gli-GFP expression (Fig. 1H). This finding suggests that SAG derivatives with N-alkyl substituents larger than a methyl group might exhibit significant inhibitory activity. Based on this speculation, a second library containing 13 compounds was synthesized to explore the size and electric effect of the substituted group (supplemental Fig. S3). Further screening of this new library identified two additional compounds that were able to abolish Gli-GFP expression in the zebrafish embryo assays at 20 μm (Fig. 1, F and G). We named these two compounds SANT74 and SANT75, respectively (Fig. 1I). In this transgenic zebrafish assay, action of SANT74 and SANT75 is dose-dependent, with an observable inhibition of Gli-GFP at 5 μm (supplemental Fig. S4) and induction of strong embryonic structural abnormality at 40 μm or above (data not shown). All three substitutions (allyl, propyl, and methyl) are hydrophobic; propyl and allyl groups are larger in size than methyl groups. (Fig. 1I). Genetic studies have demonstrated that characteristic phenotypes of zebrafish embryos with deficient Hh signaling activity include U-shaped somites, fewer pancreatic insulin positive β cells, and shorter intersegmental blood vessels (ISV). If SANT74 and SANT75 are specific inhibitors of Hh treating, zebrafish embryos should specifically produce these well characterized phenotypes. Other developmental defects such as general necrosis and abnormalities in unrelated organs would suggest off target effects of these compounds. We therefore selected these criteria to evaluate the specificity of SANT74 and SANT75 in zebrafish, using cyclopamine as an established control. To reveal changes in pancreas and blood vessels, transgenic zebrafish that have β cells labeled by insulin-GFP and vascular endothelial cells labeled by Flk-GFP were treated with either SANT74, SANT75, or cyclopamine. Similar to cyclopamine, treatment with 20 μm SANT74 and SANT75 from 2 to 36 hpf significantly reduced insulin-GFP cells and produced U-shaped somites (Fig. 2, A–J). The embryos treated with 40 μm SANT74, SANT75, and cyclopamine from 17 to 36 hpf completely lacked ISV (Fig. 2, L–N). These phenotypes were not observed in embryos treated with the same concentration of SAG (Fig. 2, E, J, and O), indicating that this inhibitory activity is specific to SANT74 and SANT75. We also treated transgenic zebrafish embryos expressing gata1-GFP, which labels the erythroid cell lineage that is in close contact with vascular endothelial cells and did not observe any changes (Fig. 2, P–T). This transgenic fish also showed some motor neurons labeled by GFP. The embryos treated with SANT74 SANT75 and cyclopamine lacked this expression in marked motor neurons compared with embryos treated with Me2SO and SAG (Fig. 2, P–T), which is consistent with the fact that Hh signaling is required for motor neuron development (31Roelink H. Augsburger A. Heemskerk J. Korzh V. Norlin S. Ruiz i Altaba A. Tanabe Y. Placzek M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Dodd J. Cell. 1994; 76: 761-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The expression of Axin2, a Wnt signaling protein and target gene, is further detected by real time PCR, and the data showed no changes between embryos treated with 20 μm SANT74 and Me2SO (supplemental Fig. S5 C). These studies suggest that SANT74 and SANT75 have no obvious off target effects. In zebrafish assay, combining 10 μm of SANT74 or SANT75 and 10 μm of cyclopamine produced an inhibitory effect similar to 20 μm of each compound alone, suggesting additive action on the same protein target of Smo (data not shown). As a small molecule, SANT74 or SANT75 offers the temporal control of Hh activity. We tested the timing requirement of Hh for normal somite formation and sprouting of ISV by adding and washing away SANT74 at various developmental stages, followed by phenotypic analysis. Before 17 hpf, addition of SANT74 will induce U-shaped somites formation. When SANT74 was added to the embryos upon fertilization but washed away before 17 hpf, the sprouting of ISV could occur normally (supplemental Fig. S6). To affect ISV specifically without inducing U-shaped somites, SANT74 or SANT75 can be added between 17 and 24 hpf (Fig. 2, L and M). After 24 hpf, adding SANT74 or SANT75 no longer had any effect on the sprouting of ISV. These studies demonstrated that a critical stage for the sprouting of ISV is between 17 and 24 hpf and that development of ISV is independent of somites. Ptc1 and Gli1 are two target genes of Hh signal pathway, and treatment of SANT74 or SANT75 should inhibit their expression. As measured by real time, quantitative PCR mRNA levels of Ptc1 and Gli1 in zebrafish embryos were reduced by SANT74 and SANT75 in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S5; only SANT74 is shown). The data listed above demonstrated that SANT74 and SANT75 are potent and specific inhibitors of Hh in zebrafish. To address whether these compounds also inhibit Hh signaling in mammalian cells, Shh-LIGHT2 cells cultured in Shh-N-conditioned medium were treated with various concentrations of SANT19, SANT74, and SANT75, and luciferase reporter activity was measured as previously reported (1Rohatgi R. Scott M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Chen J.K. Taipale J. Young K.E. Maiti T. Beachy P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14071-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Under this condition, SANT19, SANT74, and SANT75 had an IC50 of 200, 70, and 20 nm, respectively (Fig. 3, A–C), all exhibiting inhibitory potency greater than that of cyclopamine (IC50 = 250 nm) (Fig. 3D). SAG has been shown as an agonist that competes with cyclopamine in binding to Smo protein at its heptahelical bundle (17Chen J.K. Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Beachy P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 24Chen J.K. Taipale J. Young K.E. Maiti T. Beachy P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14071-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). To determine whether SANTs compete with cyclopamine in a similar fashion, Smo-overexpressing HEK 293T cells counterstained with Hoescht 33342 (blue) were incubated with 5 nm BODIPY-cyclopamine (green) and different concentrations of SANT75. As shown in Fig. 3 (E–G) and supplemental Fig. S7, SANT75 could effectively abrogate BODIPY-cyclopamine/Smo binding in a dose-dependent manner, and the concentrations of SANT75 correlated with its IC50 in the Shh-LIGHT2 cell assay. These findings confirmed that SANT75 is an inhibitor of cyclopamine that binds to Smo protein in mammalian cells. A recent study has suggested that Hh regulates Smo activity by inducing a conformational switch and resulting in increased proximity of its C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (C-tail) (32Zhao Y. Tong C. Jiang J. Nature. 2007; 450: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SAG and SANT have very similar structures but modulate Smo activity in opposite directions. These two molecules therefore"

An overview of FN domain structure and nomenclature is presented in Fig. 1a.

Two IGD tripeptides of domains 7FnI and 9FnI were shown to be essential through residue substitutions and reconstitution of partial motogenic activity in synthetic peptides (10.Schor S.L. Ellis I.R.

Grey A.M. Mould A.P. Sottile J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2581-2590PubMed Google Scholar); thus motogenic activity sites are presumed to be masked in the conformation adopted by soluble FN, although they could be exposed by molecular rearrangement. Here we show that a recombinant fragment, closely matching a truncated form of FN identified in zebrafish (26.Zhao Q. Liu X. Collodi P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as amphibians, birds, and mammals (27.Liu X. Zhao Q. Collodi P. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), does not stimulate cell migration. This fragment is similar to MSF but includes the first three FnIII domains (1–3FnIII), suggesting that these domains are responsible for a conformational transition that masks the activity sites in this construct and probably in full-length FN. To identify the mechanism behind this transition, we performed structural studies by solution NMR spectroscopy and identified a specific long range interaction between domains 4–5FnI and 3FnIII as essential for this masking effect. Interestingly, this interaction does not involve direct contacts with the GBD but possibly represses motogenic activity through chain compaction, evident in analytical size exclusion assays. Intramolecular interactions thus provide a mechanism by which conformational rearrangement induced, for example, by tension or splicing variation can result in cellular activity differences. Expression and purification of type I domain pairs of FN (2–3FnI, FN residues 93–182; 4–5FnI, residues 183–275; and 8–9FnI, residues 516–608) were described previously (24.Millard C.J. Ellis I.R.

Expression and purification of 1FnIII and 2FnIII have been described previously (5.Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Domain 3FnIII (residues 810–900) and 2–3FnIII were produced in a similar manner. In all cases, protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and NMR as being in excess of 95%. 2–5FnI was integrated in Pichia pastoris in a manner analogous to that described previously (30.Vakonakis I. Langenhan T. Prömel S. Russ A. Campbell I.D. Structure. 2008; 16: 944-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression in media buffered at pH 3.5 at 25 °C produced small amounts of protein and a number of proteolytic degradation products. 2–5FnI was concentrated from the media by retention in a cation exchange column, and protein-containing fractions were pooled and purified by size exclusion chromatography. SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions produced the expected protein band essentially free of degradation by-products (supplemental Fig. 6). 1H-15N HSQC spectra of this protein showed substantial heterogeneity and significant presence of an unfolded population of molecules (supplemental Fig. 6). The different species were separated using a shallow NaCl gradient in a high resolution anion exchange column (MonoQ, GE Healthcare) at pH 10.6 (supplemental Fig. 6). Approximately 0.2 mg of correctly folded purified protein could be obtained from 0.5 liters of P. pastoris culture under high density fermentation conditions. Recombinant MSF was produced in Escherichia coli, as described previously (10.Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar), from a transcript that included the complete N-terminal FN sequence to the middle of 1FnIII (residue 647) and a unique C-terminal amino acid tail. FN fragments consisting of residues 48–608 (Fn70kDa) or 48–900 (Fn100kDa, wild-type or with residue substitutions) were cloned into vector pHLsec resulting in final proteins with three vector-derived residues at the N terminus (ETG) and nine, including a His tag, at the C terminus (GTKHHHHHH). These proteins were produced in human cell line HEK293T by transient expression as described previously (31.Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed for 4 days and then purified directly from the media by metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion in phosphate-buffered saline. A typical yield of purified Fn100kDa was 20 mg per liter of conditioned media. Protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE as 85–90%. The proteolytic Fn30kDa fragment was purchased from Sigma. The molecular mass of Fn100kDa was determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis using an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Fn100kDa samples (5 and 11 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline were centrifuged in double sector 12-mm centerpieces at 10,000, 12,000, and 16,000 rpm at 20 °C. Protein sedimentation was monitored at 280 nm. Although expected to be glycosylated at three separate sites, Fn100kDa gave a molecular mass of ∼95 kDa suggesting little glycosylation of the final protein. Small (0.1 ml) samples of FN fragments were passed through an analytical Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. An Äkta FPLC system with 0.5-cm path length (GE Healthcare) was used for data recording of UV absorption at 280 nm. Type I collagen was extracted from rat tail tendons and used to make 2-ml collagen gels in 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes as described previously (32.Schor S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1980; 41: 159-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen gels were overlaid with 1 ml of either serum-free minimum Eagle's medium or serum-free minimum Eagle's medium containing four times the final concentration of recombinant proteins. Confluent stock cultures of fibroblasts were trypsinized, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in growth medium containing 4% donor calf serum at 2 × 105 cells/ml, and 1-ml aliquots were added to the overlaid gels for a final concentration of 1% serum in both control and recombinant proteins containing cultures. The assay cultures were incubated for 4 days, and the percentage of fibroblasts found within the three-dimensional gel matrix was then ascertained by microscopic observation of 10 randomly selected fields in each of two duplicate cultures, as described previously (10.Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 35530-35535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated a minimum of two times. All experiments were performed at 30 °C using home-built spectrometers with 11.7–22.3 tesla field strengths in a 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid, 0.02% NaN3, and 5% v/v D2O sample buffer unless otherwise noted. Sequential chemical shift assignments were performed using standard triple-resonance experiments. Analysis of spectral perturbations upon protein interactions and determination of equilibrium parameters were performed as described (30.Vakonakis I. Langenhan T. Prömel S. Russ A. Campbell I.D. Structure. 2008; 16: 944-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The chemical shift assignments of 2–3FnI, 4–5FnI, and 3FnIII have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession numbers 15756, 15758, and 15759, respectively. The amino acid sequences and numbering schemes used here correspond to the human FN UniProt accession number P02751. The 2–5FnI model was constructed from the 2–3FnI and 4–5FnI crystal structures (4.Bingham R.J. Rudiño-Piñera E. Meenan N.A. Schwarz-Linek U. Turkenburg J.P. Höök M. Garman E.F. Potts J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 12254-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) assuming that the 3–4FnI interface is similar to that of other FnI domain pairs. The 2–3FnIII model was constructed by threading the amino acid sequence through the 9–10FnIII structure (Protein Data Bank code 2MFN) using the Phyre web service (33.Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and then substituting 2FnIII with the high resolution NMR structure of that domain excluding the flexible N terminus (5.Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A previously identified alternatively spliced mRNA variant of FN (26.Zhao Q. Liu X. Collodi P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27.Liu X. Zhao Q. Collodi P. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) encodes the FN N terminus up to the complete domain 3FnIII and a highly variable C-terminal amino acid tail. We produced a recombinant version of this fragment excluding the tail (Fig. 1a) using transient expression in HEK293T cell line; we refer to this fragment as Fn100kDa, based on its apparent mobility in denaturing gels. Fn100kDa is highly soluble, and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that it is monomeric at ∼11 μm (1.0 mg/ml) concentration (supplemental Fig. 1). This construct includes domains 7FnI and 9FnI that harbor the two IGD tripeptides necessary for stimulation of cell migration; however, assays using adult skin fibroblasts showed no effect on cell motility (Fig. 1a), a result similar that obtained with full-length FN (10.Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Schor S.L. Ellis I. Dolman C. Banyard J. Humphries M.J. Mosher D.F. Grey A.M. Mould A.P. Sottile J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2581-2590PubMed Google Scholar). Inclusion of the C-terminal amino acid tail in this construct did not alter this result (data not shown). In contrast, a recombinant fragment that lacks the first three FnIII domains (Fn70kDa) displays full activity in the same assays, in agreement with previous results (10.Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that domains 1–3FnIII are responsible for a structural rearrangement in Fn100kDa that masks the sites of motogenic activity. A likely cause of this rearrangement would be long range interactions between the FnIII domains and the remainder of Fn100kDa. We therefore sought to identify any such interactions using NMR. We performed assays for interdomain interactions using solution NMR spectroscopy by monitoring chemical shift perturbations in 1H-15N HSQC spectra during titrations of FN fragments. Domains 1FnIII, 2FnIII, and 3FnIII were tested against fragments 1–2FnI, 2–3FnI, 4–5FnI, 6FnI1–2FnII7FnI, and 8–9FnI in all pairwise combinations at 30 °C and 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate pH 6.0 buffer; the choice of buffer pH reflects a compromise between solubility of FnI domains (high at lower pH), and solubility and stability of FnIII domains (high at physiological pH). Under these conditions FnIII domains remained folded and soluble to at least 1 mm concentration, whereas FnI domains are less soluble (∼0.2 mm for 4–5FnI). As shown in Table 1, a total of four specific interactions were detected between 2–3FnI or 4–5FnI and 2FnIII or 3FnIII (Fig. 2); the interaction between 4–5FnI and 3FnIII has an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 146 ± 9 μm under these conditions, whereas others are weaker (Kd of 700–1200 μm). FN conformation is sensitive to ionic strength (11.Ugarova T.P. Zamarron C. Veklich Y. Bowditch R.D. Ginsberg M.H. Weisel J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 34.Alexander Jr., S.S. Colonna G. Edelhoch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1501-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus we tested for the persistence of these four interactions under physiological conditions (150 mm NaCl). Chemical shift perturbations were still observed, although we were unable to estimate dissociation constants accurately in some cases because of low fractional saturation in the respective titrations. The 4–5FnI-3FnIII titration yielded a Kd of 800 ± 46 μm (data not shown); the 5-fold reduction in affinity is consistent with the increase in ionic strength, assuming a linear anticorrelation between these phenomena (35.Schreiber G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Combined analysis of 1H and 15N perturbations shows good correlation between low and physiological NaCl concentrations (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that the domains interact in a similar fashion over this range of ionic strength.TABLE 1Dissociation constants from inter-domain interactions (Kd, mm)FN fragments1FnIII2FnIII3FnIII1–2FnINo interaction detectedaBased on the extent of perturbations observed in other titrations, and the stoichiometric ratios used, we estimate a lower limit for these interactions as in excess of 7.5–10 mm.–bSmall perturbations were detected on2FnI resonances but not on1FnI; hence we consider these interactions in the context of2–3FnI.–bSmall perturbations were detected on2FnI resonances but not on1FnI; hence we consider these interactions in the context of2–3FnI.2–3FnI0.71 ± 0.020.82 ± 0.074–5FnI1.2 ± 0.20.146 ± 0.0096FnI1–2FnII7FnINo interaction detectedaBased on the extent of perturbations observed in other titrations, and the stoichiometric ratios used, we estimate a lower limit for these interactions as in excess of 7.5–10 mm.8–9FnIa Based on the extent of perturbations observed in other titrations, and the stoichiometric ratios used, we estimate a lower limit for these interactions as in excess of 7.5–10 mm.b Small perturbations were detected on2FnI resonances but not on1FnI; hence we consider these interactions in the context of2–3FnI. Open table in a new tab Previously, we reported an interaction Kd under physiological ionic strength conditions of ∼85 μm between wild-type 1–2FnIII and 1–5FnI (Fn30kDa), determined by surface plasmon resonance (5.Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is substantially tighter than the interactions reported here between isolated FnIII domains and FnI pairs under similar conditions. However, the nature of the two techniques used, especially the difference of limited diffusion in surface plasmon resonance versus three-dimensional diffusion in NMR, makes comparisons across techniques difficult. The 4–5FnI-3FnIII interaction did not prove amenable to surface plasmon resonance analysis (supplemental Fig. 3); thus, we tested the 1–2FnIII-Fn30kDa interaction by NMR (supplemental Fig. 4). As shown, only few and very small perturbations are detected in the NMR spectra under physiological conditions, compared with similar spectra of 4–5FnI-3FnIII. Similarly, a recent study of wild-type 1–2FnIII and Fn70kDa did not show substantial interactions between these components using fluorescence (36.Karuri N.W. Lin Z. Rye H.S. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, we infer that 4–5FnI-3FnIII is the strongest among these interactions of wild-type proteins. Mapping the chemical shift perturbations on the amino acid sequence (supplemental Fig. 5) and protein structure highlights the surfaces involved in the 2–5FnI and 2–3FnIII contacts (Fig. 3). 2FnIII perturbs both FnI fragments along the domain-domain (2FnI/3FnI, 4FnI/5FnI) interfaces, which probably reflects a small change in the preferred orientation within the domain pairs; similar changes in FnI pairs have been noted earlier as a result of changing local contacts (28.Rudiño-Piñera E. Ravelli R.B. Sheldrick G.M. Nanao M.H. Korostelev V.V. Werner J.M. Schwarz-Linek U. Potts J.R. Garman E.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, 5FnI is perturbed along the β-strand A/E interface and 2FnI along strand E. The pattern of perturbations by 3FnIII is similar to that of 2FnIII; however, the perturbation on 2FnI is more pronounced, and an additional interaction surface is present on 4FnI along the β-strand D/E loop. It is likely that this additional interaction surface accounts for the higher affinity of 3FnIII for 4–5FnI compared with 2FnIII (146 ± 9 μm versus 820 ± 70 μm Kd). Neither 2FnIII nor 3FnIII significantly affect domain 3FnI. Large scale mapping of the 2FnIII and 3FnIII interactions to a 2–5FnI model shows that the vast majority of perturbed areas localize on a single side of the model (Fig. 3, a and b). Similar interface mapping of the 2–3FnI and 4–5FnI titrations on FnIII domains (Fig. 3, c and d) shows strong perturbations along 3FnIII β-strand D and the C-terminal end of strand E for both interactions, although this effect is more highly pronounced in the 4–5FnI titration. In contrast, perturbations on 2FnIII differ for the two interactions as 2–3FnI primarily affects the C terminus of β-strand G and the strand C/D loop (the part of the molecule proximal to 3FnIII), whereas 4–5FnI affects the N terminus of strand G and the strand F/G loop (the distal part of the molecule compared with 3FnIII). Inspection of the modeled 2–3FnIII indicates that, in both cases, the perturbed interfaces of 2FnIII and 3FnIII orient in opposite directions (Fig. 3, c and d); however, chains of FnIII domains are known to be prone to domain reorientation in solution (37.Copié V. Tomita Y. Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Venable R.M. Pastor R.W. Krueger S. Torchia D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The flexibility inherent in these multiple module fragments suggested that the observed interactions between adjacent domains could act cooperatively to enhance the binding affinity. 2–3FnIII can be easily produced, but we were initially unable to express 2–5FnI. Optimization of expression and purification procedures yielded only small amounts of this fragment (supplemental Fig. 6); these were, however, sufficient to test the effects of increasing fragment size. 15N-enriched 2–3FnI at low concentrations (20 μm) was titrated with 50 μm unenriched 2–3FnIII (su"
https://openalex.org/W1981218708,"Dbs is a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) that regulates neurotrophin-3-induced cell migration in Schwann cells. Here we report that Dbs regulates cell motility in tumor-derived, human breast epithelial cells through activation of Cdc42 and Rac1. Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated in T47D cells that stably express onco- or proto-Dbs, and activation is dependent upon growth of the cells on collagen I. Transient suppression of expression of Cdc42 or Rac1 by small interfering RNAs attenuates Dbs-enhanced motility. Both onco- and proto-Dbs-enhanced motility correlates with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase on Tyr-397 and p130(Cas) on Tyr-410 and an increase in the abundance of the Crk.p130(Cas) complex. Suppression of expression of Cdc42 or its effector, Ack1, reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and p130(Cas) and disrupts the Crk.p130(Cas) complex. We further determined that suppression of expression of Cdc42, Ack1, p130(Cas), or Crk reduces Rac1 activation and cell motility in Dbs-expressing cells to a level comparable with that in vector cells. Therefore, a cascade of activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 by Dbs through the Cdc42 effector Ack1 and the Crk.p130(Cas) complex is established. Suppression of the expression of endogenous Dbs reduces cell motility in both T47D cells and MDA-MB-231 cells, which correlates with the down-regulation of Cdc42 activity. This suggests that Dbs activates Cdc42 in these two human breast cancer cell lines and that the normal function of Dbs may be required to support cell movement."
https://openalex.org/W1984930425,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by senile plaques, which are mainly composed of β amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Aβ is cleaved off from amyloid precursor protein (APP) with consecutive proteolytic processing: β-secretase, followed by γ-secretase. Here, we show that BRI3, a member of the BRI gene family that includes the familial British and Danish dementia gene BRI2, interacts with APP and serves as an endogenous negative regulator of Aβ production. BRI3 colocalizes with APP along neuritis in differentiated N2a cells; endogenous BRI3-APP complexes are readily detectable in mouse brain extract; reducing endogenous BRI3 levels by RNA interference results in increased Aβ secretion. BRI3 resembles BRI2, because BRI3 overexpression reduces both α- and β-APP cleavage. We propose that BRI3 inhibits the various processing of APP by blocking the access of α- and β-secretases to APP. However, unlike BRI2, the binding of BRI3 to the β-secretase cleaved APP C-terminal fragment is negligible and BRI3 does not cause the massive accumulation of this APP fragment, suggesting that, unlike BRI2, BRI3 is a poor γ-cleavage inhibitor. Competitive inhibition of APP processing by BRI3 may provide a new approach to AD therapy and prevention.

AD progressively leads to a severely impaired state and complete social dependence. At autopsy, cerebral atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid plaques are observed in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and other areas. Tangles consist of intraneuronal masses of helically wound filaments of the hyperphosphorylated protein, Tau. Plaques are extracellular deposits of Aβ, a peptide derived from cleavage of APP, surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Most AD cases present Aβ deposits in cortical and/or meningeal microvessels. In a minority of cases, this vascular cerebral amyloid angiopathy is rather severe (2.Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

C99 is cleaved by the γ-secretase, which consists of a multicomponent complex composed of presenilins (PS1 and PS2), Nicastrin, PEN2, and APH1 (4.Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The γ-cleavage releases two peptides: Aβ peptide, consisting of 2 major species of 40 and 42 amino acids (Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively) and an intracellular product APP intracellular domain (AID)/AICD. Several findings point to the short AID/AICD as a biologically active intracellular peptide, which may modulate cell death, Notch signaling, gene transcription, and Ca2+ homeostasis (5.Hamid R.

In an alternative pathway, APP is processed by α-secretase within the Aβ sequence, leading to the production of the soluble sAPPα ectodomain and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids (C83). For aged patients, a family history of dementia is a major risk factor for AD, and 10–15% of all AD subjects have a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant trait. These familial cases are due to mutations in APP and in presenilins, because they alter the rate of APP processing and Aβ42 generation. Given the role of APP processing by secretases to AD pathology and APP-mediated functions, identifying the molecules that regulate APP cleavage is physiologically relevant and of therapeutic interest. A genetic screen aimed to the identification of regulators of APP processing led to the identification of BRI2 as an APP ligand that inhibits Aβ formation both in vitro (20.Matsuda S. Giliberto L.

BRI2 is a type II membrane protein of 266 amino acids of unknown function that is mutated in AD-like familial British dementia (22.Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G.

BRI3 from the two-hybrid screening and BRI1 cDNA purchased from Open Biosystems (GenBankTM accession number BC040437) were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal FLAG tag. London and Swedish mutations were introduced into APP by QuikChange XL (Stratagene). FLAG-BRI3-Myc has an Myc tag and a glycine insertion (GEQKLISEEDL) just before the stop codon of FLAG-BRI3. Human APLP2 were cloned in pcDNA3.1/Hygro. A mammalian expression construct of Fas ligand was kindly provided by Dr. Lenardo. To make shRNA vectors, oligonucleotides pairs were annealed and cloned into a modified pSUPER (26.Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Alvarez K. Melis T. Bubici C. Majewski N. Hay N. De Smaele E. Peter M.E. Franzoso G. Blood. 2003; 102: 3270-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which is driven by an H1 promoter.

GFP-BRI3 was created by cloning BamHI/XhoI fragment from FLAG-BRI3 into BglII/SalI of pEGFP-C1, which adds GFP to the N terminus of BRI3. The following antibodies and antibody beads were used: αFLAG (M2, Sigma F1804); α Myc (Cell Signaling, 2276); αAPP (22C11, Chemicon MAB348); αsAPPα (IBL 11088); αsAPPβ (IBL 18957); αAPP C-terminal fragments (CTF) (αAPPct, Invitrogen/Zymed Laboratories Inc. 36-6900); αAPLP2 (EMD/Calbiochem 171616); αsAPLP2 (R&D Systems MAB4945); α Fas ligand (BD Pharmingen 556387); FLAG M2 beads (Sigma A2220). Rabbit αBRI2 was described before (21.Matsuda S. Giliberto L. Matsuda Y. McGowan E.M. D'Adamio L. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8668-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against BRI3 (αBRI3) was raised against the peptide LTPAREERPPRHRS (corresponding to amino acids 36–49) and purified using the peptide. Rabbit polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotechnology. HeLa cells were transfected with indicated combinations of plasmids. The transfected cells were lysed in the Hepes-Triton buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X 100) on ice. The lysates were cleared by spinning at 20 kg for 10 min. To precipitate the immune complex, the cleared lysates were mixed with FLAG beads or with indicated antibodies and protein A beads (Pierce). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was used as a negative control of αAPPct precipitation. After being washed three times with the same buffer, the precipitated beads were boiled in 2× SDS Buffer and analyzed by Western blot. N2A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator. N2A cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly l-lysine (Sigma) and were transfected with indicated plasmids. The differentiation of N2A cells was induced by 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 2 μm retinoic acid for 24–36 h (27.Stamer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The cells on coverslips were fixed, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, stained as described (28.Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Yamamoto T. Kyriakis J.M. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6597-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad Radiance 2000). The images shown are representative of the phenotypes observed in at least three independent experiments. A whole mouse brain was homogenized in 2 ml of the Hepes-sucrose buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor without EDTA (Roche Applied Science). Unbroken tissues and nuclei were cleared by spinning at 1000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was homogenized in the same buffer and cleared again. This procedure was repeated three times in total. All the supernatants were combined, and the brain membrane was collected by spinning at 100 kg for 45 min. The membrane pellets were extracted with Hepes-Triton buffer at 2 mg/ml and were cleared by spinning at 100 kg for 45 min. The cleared extracts were then pre-cleared by mixing with protein A beads. The protein A beads were removed, and the extracts were mixed with αBRI3 or a control antibody and fresh protein A beads. After the incubation, beads were washed three times with the Hepes-Triton buffer, boiled in 2× SDS buffer, and subjected to Western blot. HEK293APP cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or with FLAG-BRI3. One day after the transfection, the cells were conditioned for 24 h. The conditioned media were collected and cleared by spinning at 20 kg for 10 min. Aβ in the media was measured using the ELISA kit for Aβ40 and Aβ42 (IBL 17713 and 17711, respectively). Cells were lysed in the Hepes-Triton buffer, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of total lysates and the cleared media were analyzed by Western blot. The cloned shRNA vectors were transfected into HEK293APP cells. Two days after the transfection, total mRNA was prepared from the transfected cells and untransfected cells by using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen) with random hexamers, and quantitative PCR analysis were performed with pairs of primers (β-actin, 5′-aaggccaaccgcgagaagat-3′ and 5′-tatccctgtacgcctctgg-3′; BRI3, 5′-gcatggtcgtgctgctcat-3′ and 5′-gcacaccacagcggaagaa-3′) using a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Two days after the transfection, the cells were conditioned for 24 h, and Aβ in the media or the cells were processed as above. A comparable amount was loaded and analyzed by Western blot. HEK293APP cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of dsRed (Clontech), GFP-BRI3, m1, and sh12. Two days after the transfection, the cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum and analyzed with FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Live cells were gated and dsRed and GFP-BRI3 were detected in FL2 and FL1 channels with appropriate compensation to separate singly or dually transfected cells. The geometric average of dsRed-positive cells was calculated with the cells gated as dsRed-positive and cotransfected. HEK293APP cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or FLAG-BRI3. One day after the transfection, the cells were starved for 90 min by incubating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine. The cells were labeled at 500 μCi/ml of [35S]cysteine and methionine in the same media and chased in the complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the indicated times. After the chase, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with αAPPct as in HeLa cells. The precipitants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The metabolic labeling of HeLa cells was performed similarly except the cells were transfected also with APP, and a longer chase time was used. Gal4-driven luciferase assay was described elsewhere (20.Matsuda S. Giliberto L. Matsuda Y. Davies P. McGowan E. Pickford F. Ghiso J. Frangione B. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28912-28916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with or without BRI3, together with APP fused to Gal4 (APP-Gal4), pG5E1b-luc, and β-galactosidase. When AID is produced from the APP-Gal4 fusion protein, Gal4 is released from membrane-bound APP and increases the transcription under the Gal4-dependent G5E1b promoter. Luciferase activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. The γ30 cells (generously provided by Dr. Dennis Selkoe) are Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing APP, PS1, AphI, and Pen2 (29.Chyung J.H. Raper D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4383-4392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The γ30 cells were transfected with pcDNA6-Myc-BRI1 or pcDNA6- Myc-BRI3, and the transfectants were selected in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 μg/ml G418, 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, 250 μg/ml Zeocin, and 250 μg/ml hygromycin. After limiting dilution, each clone was analyzed for the expression of BRI proteins by α-Myc Western blot. The immunoprecipitation was performed as in transfected HeLa cells. APP fragments were analyzed as in HEK293APP cells except that conditioning started 1 day after plating without further transfection. The sequence alignment was done using CLUSTAL 2.0.10 multiple sequence alignment (available on the web). The BRICHOS and the transmembrane domains were determined using SMART (available on the web). To identify APP ligands, we screened human brain cDNA library with split-ubiquitin system using APP as bait (20.Matsuda S. Giliberto L. Matsuda Y. Davies P. McGowan E. Pickford F. Ghiso J. Frangione B. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28912-28916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One of the clones isolated contained the entire BRI3 cDNA. BRI3 was originally cloned as a type II transmembrane protein of 267 amino acids (30.Vidal R. Calero M. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Gene. 2001; 266: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31.Deleersnijder W. Hong G. Cortvrindt R. Poirier C. Tylzanowski P. Pittois K. Van Marck E. Merregaert J. J. Biol.

Similar to BRI2, BRI3 is also cleaved by furin or furin-like convertases, and the C-terminal peptide is secreted (32.Wickham L. Benjannet S. Marcinkiewicz E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The BRI3 cDNA obtained in the two-hybrid screening was cloned into a FLAG-tagged mammalian expression vector, and cotransfected into HeLa cells together with APP. Immunoprecipitation with FLAG beads indicated that BRI3 indeed binds APP (Fig. 1, B and C). This binding of BRI3 to APP is similar to that of BRI2 (20.Matsuda S. Giliberto L. Matsuda Y. Davies P. McGowan E. Pickford F. Ghiso J. Frangione B. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28912-28916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a dementia gene mutated in familial British and familial Danish dementia (22.Vidal R. Frangione B.

Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Just like BRI2, BRI3 does not bind C83 (the 83-amino acid APP CTF produced by the α-secretase cleavage). However, in contrast to BRI2, BRI3 shows minimal or no binding to C99 (the 99-amino acid APP CTF) (Fig. 1B). To confirm the interaction, FLAG-BRI3 was cotransfected with APP into HeLa cells, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the APP CTF antibody (αAPPct) or a control rabbit polyclonal antibody (RP). The APP antibody specifically precipitated BRI3, confirming that BRI3 binds APP (Fig. 1C). The results that two members of BRI family bind APP prompted us to test whether this is also true for the other member of the family, BRI1. BRI1 is also a type II transmembrane protein of 264 amino acids, which is primarily expressed in chondrocytes (31.Deleersnijder W. Hong G. Cortvrindt R. Poirier C. Tylzanowski P. Pittois K. Van Marck E. Merregaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19475-19482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). FLAG-BRI1 shares overall topology with FLAG-BRI3 as depicted in Fig. 1A. Each member of the BRI family was transfected into HeLa cells together with APP, and BRIs were precipitated from the prepared lysates with FLAG beads. As shown in Fig. 1B, BRI1 did not bind APP, whereas BRI2 and BRI3 did. As described above, BRI2 and BRI3 share similar binding characteristics, because they both bind to APP but not to C83 (Fig. 1B). However, there two clear distinctions: the increase of C99 in total lysates was undetectable in BRI3-transfected cells, and C99 bound to BRI3 was minimal when compared with that bound to BRI2. To determine the domain responsible for the BRI3-APP interaction, a BRI3 construct lacking the C-terminal peptide released by furin cleavage (FLAG-BRI3-(1–242)), another lacking the entire BRICHOS domain (33.Sanchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Valencia A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (FLAG-BRI3-(1–130)), and another BRI3 tagged with both FLAG and Myc were tested for their interaction. As shown in Fig. 1D, all tested BRI3 constructs bound similarly to APP. Expression of BRI3 results in the appearance of a shorter N-terminal fragment (BRI3-NTF, Fig. 1C). This fragment, which may perhaps derive by ADAMs cleavage of BRI3 in the ectodomain like for BRI2 (34.Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), does not interact with APP (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that the BRICHOS domain and the secreted peptide are dispensable for this interaction. These data, together with the evidence that BRI3-NTF does not bind APP (Fig. 1C), suggest that the APP-interacting domain of BRI3 is NH2-terminal to amino acid 130 and in the extracellular/lumen region of BRI3 juxtaposed to the membrane. However, it is also possible that BRI3-NTF is generated in different subcellular compartments where it cannot access APP. To investigate the specificity of BRI3-APP binding, a GFP fusion construct of APP intracellular domain (GFP-AID), an APP construct lacking intracellular C-terminal 31 amino acids (APP-Ncas), two familial AD mutants of APP (APP London and APP Swedish), an APP homolog (APLP2), or unrelated type II transmembrane protein (Fas ligand) was cotransfected to HeLa cells with or without FLAG-BRI3. Isolated FLAG immunocomplex showed that BRI3 binds APP, APP-Ncas, and London and Swedish mutants of APP but does not bind GFP-AID (Fig. 2A). This indicates that deleting 31 amino acids of APP-CTF or the two Alzheimer mutations around the Aβ region does not affect BRI3-APP binding, and that the intracellular domain of APP is not sufficient for the binding. Although we cannot exclude that C83 and BRI3 do not interact, because they are segregated in distinct subcellular compartments, these data suggest that the domain of APP required for the interaction should be at least N-terminal to α-cleavage site, and probably N-terminal to β-cleavage site. The lack of interaction with APLP2 or Fas ligand further attests the specificity of the BRI3-APP interaction. FLAG-tagged BRI3 and GFP-APP were cotransfected into N2A cells. The transfected cells were differentiated with retinoic acid, and the location of BRI3 and APP were visualized with αFLAG antibody and GFP fluorescence, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, BRI3 and APP colocalize nicely as a dotted structure along the neurites, further supporting the idea that BRI3 and APP form a complex in vivo. Next, we asked if BRI3 changes the production of Aβ. HEK293APP cells, which stably express APP, were transfected with pcDNA3 or with FLAG-BRI3. The transfectants were conditioned, and the secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured with Aβ ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4A, exogenous expression of BRI3 decreased both the secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42. We next investigated whether BRI3 is involved in AID production. The rationales of the luciferase assay used here are 1) that APP fused to entire Gal4 releases AID fused to Gal4 upon cleavage by γ-secretase and 2) then the released Gal4 fusion translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of luciferase (20.Matsuda S. Giliberto L. Matsuda Y. Davies P. McGowan E. Pickford F. Ghiso J. Frangione B. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28912-28916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or FLAG-BRI3, together with APP-Gal4, pG5E1b-luc, and β-galactosidase. One day after the transfection, the cells were lysed and the luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 4B, overexpression of BRI3 dramatically reduced AID release. Next, we tested how other APP metabolites were affected by the overexpression of BRI3. HeLa cells were transfected with APP together with pcDNA3 or FLAG-BRI3, and 1 day later, the cells were conditioned for 24 h. APP fragments in the media and in the cell were analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4C, BRI3 overexpression decreased the secretion of both sAPPα and sAPPβ. Full-length APP is slightly increased, and there is no noticeable change in APP CTFs. Intracellular transport and localization of APP are critical components of Aβ production. In fact, α-secretase cleaves mAPP en route to or on the plasma membrane. β-Secretase predominantly cleaves mAPP in early endosomes (35.Kaether C. Schmitt S. Willem M. Haass C.

In mammals and yeast, PLMT activities are required for the de novo synthesis of the choline headgroup found in PtdCho. PLMT enzyme activities have also been reported in plants, yet their roles in PtdCho biosynthesis are less clear because most plants can produce the choline headgroup entirely via soluble substrates, initiated by the methylation of free ethanolamine-phosphate. To gain further insights into the function of PLMT enzymes in plants, we isolated PLMT cDNAs from Arabidopsis and soybean (Glycine max) based upon primary amino acid sequence homology to the rat PLMT, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. Using a heterologous yeast expression system, it was shown that plant PLMTs methylate phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine but cannot utilize phosphatidylethanolamine as a substrate. Identification of an Arabidopsis line containing a knock-out dissociator transposon insertion within the single copy AtPLMT gene allowed us to investigate the consequences of loss of PLMT function. Although the accumulation of the PLMT substrates phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine was considerably elevated in the atplmt knock-out line, PtdCho levels remained normal, and no obvious differences were observed in plant morphology or development under standard growth conditions. However, because the metabolic routes through which PtdCho is synthesized in plants vary greatly among differing species, it is predicted that the degree with which PtdCho synthesis is dependent upon PLMT activities will also vary widely throughout the plant kingdom.

PtdCho biosynthesis has been studied intensively in plants not only because of its importance as a structural membrane lipid, but also because of its role as a precursor to important lipid-based signaling molecules, such as phosphatidic acid, and phospholipase A2-derived free fatty acids (1.Meijer H.J. Munnik T. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The choline headgroup of PtdCho serves multiple functions as well. In addition to being an essential human nutrient (2.Zeisel S.H. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in many plant species choline can be oxidized to produce the potent osmoprotectant glycine betaine (3.Hitz W.D. Rhodes D.

For over 2 decades it has been apparent that there are fundamental differences between the manner in which PtdCho is produced in plants versus how it is synthesized in mammals and fungi. In the latter two systems, PtdCho can be formed through two distinct pathways as follows: (a) the “nucleotide pathway” in which free choline is incorporated in PtdCho using CDP-choline as an intermediate, and (b) the “methylation pathway” whereby PtdCho is produced directly from phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) via three sequential methylation reactions using S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor (5.Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Vance D.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes.in: Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1996: 153-180Google Scholar). In contrast, PtdCho biosynthesis in plants occurs through a branched pathway that utilizes components of both the nucleotide and methylation pathways (7.Kinney A.J. Lipid Metabolism in Plants.in: Moore T.S. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 259-284Google Scholar). The greatest distinction between the contrasting mechanisms of PtdCho biosynthesis can be attributed to the presence of plant enzymes that are capable of converting ethanolamine headgroups to choline at the phospho-base level, activities that are absent in mammals and yeast. Conversely, mammals and fungi possess methylation enzymes that act directly on PtdEtn, a reaction that cannot be detected in most plant systems investigated (reviewed in Ref. 7.Kinney A.J. Lipid Metabolism in Plants.in: Moore T.S. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 259-284Google Scholar). A diagram of the most widely accepted model of phosphoamino alcohol biosynthesis in plants is shown in Fig. 1. Similar to animals and yeast, free choline can be directly incorporated into PtdCho via nucleotide pathway enzymes in plants. In the absence of choline, however, the methylation of Etn-phosphate represents the first committed step in PtdCho biosynthesis. The resulting monomethylethanolamine-phosphate (MMEtn-P) metabolite can be further methylated at the phospho-base level to produce Cho-P. Alternatively, MMEtn-P can be incorporated into phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PtdMMEtn) via the cytidylyltransferase and amino alcohol phosphotransferase activities of the nucleotide pathway and then methylated at the phosphatidyl-base level to complete the synthesis of PtdCho (Fig. 1). The extent with which PtdCho is formed by the flow of metabolites through phospho-bases as opposed to phosphatidyl-bases varies greatly among different plant species. In most higher plants, it is likely that the methylation of the phosphoamino alcohol headgroups involves the flow of metabolites through both branches of the pathway, as has been shown in species such as barley, carrot, and tobacco (3.Hitz W.D. Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 814-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.McNeil S.D. Nuccio M.L. Rhodes D. Shachar-Hill Y. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, examples have also been reported where only one of the branches appears to be utilized. In Lemna paucicostata, for example, the methylation steps in PtdCho biosynthesis were shown to occur almost exclusively at the phospho-base level (10.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 126-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the other end of the spectrum is soybean, where all methylations beyond the initial formation of MMEtn-P were reported to occur on phosphatidyl-bases (8.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 854-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tremendous variability observed among plants with regard to PtdCho formation is also exemplified by a study conducted by Williams and Harwood (12.Williams M. Harwood J.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) where it was shown that the predominant route of PtdCho synthesis in olive culture cells involved the first two methylation reactions taking place at the phospho-base level (producing dimethylethanolamine phosphate) and the final methylation occurring on a phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PtdDMEtn) substrate. Our understanding on the mechanisms by which plants synthesize PtdCho and regulate its accumulation has been further enhanced as the genes encoding the various steps of the phosphoamino alcohol pathway have been isolated and characterized. For example, molecular characterizations led to the conclusion that all of the amino alcohol phosphotransferase reactions depicted in Fig. 1 can be mediated by the product of a single gene (designated AAPT1) that displays a broad substrate specificity (13.Dewey R.E. Wilson R.F. Novitzky W.P. Goode J.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1495-1507PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Goode J.H. Dewey R.E. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 445-457Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was the isolation of the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (PEAMT) genes from Arabidopsis and spinach that led to the discovery that all three phospho-base methylation reactions could be catalyzed by a single enzyme (15.Bolognese C.P. McGraw P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1800-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PEAMT gene function in Arabidopsis through T-DNA insertion or co-suppression revealed unexpected associations between the phosphoamino alcohol pathway and root development, salt hypersensitivity, and male sterility (17.Mou Z. Wang X. Fu Z. Dai Y. Han C. Ouyang J. Bao F. Hu Y. Li J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18.Cruz-Ramírez A. López-Bucio J. Ramírez-Pimentel G.

Although most of the reactions depicted in Fig. 1 have been characterized at the molecular genetic level, conspicuously absent is information on the plant genes/enzymes responsible for the methylation reactions conducted at the phosphatidyl-base level. In contrast, these reactions are among the most well characterized in animals and yeast, catalyzed by enzymes commonly referred to as phospholipid N-methyltransferases (PLMTs). In mammals, the 18-kDa integral membrane protein phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is a PLMT that is expressed primarily in the liver (19.Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17231-17239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PEMT catalyzes all three of the methylation reactions needed to convert PtdEtn to PtdCho. Yeast uses two distinct PLMT enzymes to catalyze the three methylation reactions as follows: Cho2p/Pem1p that mediates the direct methylation of PtdEtn to produce PtdMMEtn (20.Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Opi3p/Pem2p, an enzyme homologous to the mammalian PEMT, that primarily catalyzes the methylation of PtdMMEtn to PtdDMEtn and PtdDMEtn to PtdCho, the final two steps of the methylation pathway (20.Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 317-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLMT activities are critical in both of these systems. Mice possessing pemt knock-out mutations are completely dependent on dietary choline for survival, and they display abnormal levels of choline metabolites within the liver and develop hepatic steatosis even when fed diets supplemented with choline (23.Zhu X. Song J. Mar M.H. Edwards L.J. Zeisel S.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking PLMT activities (cho2/opi3 double mutants) are obligate choline auxotrophs, unable to synthesize PtdCho de novo in the absence of exogenous choline. To gain a greater understanding of the specific function of PLMT reactions in higher plants, and their contribution toward PtdCho biosynthesis, we cloned and characterized PLMT homologs from Arabidopsis and soybean. By expressing the candidate cDNAs in yeast, we were able to confirm that they encoded functional PLMT activities as well as to establish their substrate specificities. We also identified a mutant Arabidopsis line containing a knock-out allele in the single copy PLMT gene found in the Arabidopsis genome, allowing us to characterize the consequences of loss of gene function in this model species. Yeast were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) (w/v) media for complex media or yeast nitrogen base without amino acids for defined media (supplemented as needed with amino acids). Yeast strain CDS100 was grown on minimal media with 1 mm choline unless otherwise stated. Yeast strains used included CTY182 (MAT a, ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801), CTY410 (MAT a his3-200, leu2Δ9, cho2::LEU2), CTY411 (MATα, ade2-101, his3-200, leu2, trp1, can1, opi3::URA3), and CSD100 (his3-200, opi3::URA3, cho2::LEU2). Strain CSD100 was obtained by crossing strains CTY410 and CTY411 using the procedure described by Guthrie and Fink (24.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). To place the plant PLMT cDNAs under the regulatory control of a strong constitutive yeast promoter, HindIII restriction sites were initially engineered into both the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the AtPLMT and GmPLMT cDNAs via PCR. Subsequent digestion with HindIII enabled the insertion of the plant cDNAs between the promoter and terminator regions of the yeast ADH1 gene in yeast expression vector pDB20 (25.Becker D.M. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A BamHI digest of the resulting plasmids yielded a 3-kb band containing the yeast ADH promoter/plant PLMT/ADH terminator (partial digests were required for AtPLMT to avoid an internal BamHI site), which was gel-extracted and ligated into BamHI-digested yeast expression vector pRS313 (26.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pRS313 contains a HIS3 selectable marker that facilitated the subsequent transformation of the expression constructs into strains CTY411 (Δhis3-200) and CSD100 (Δhis3-200). Yeast transformation was conducted using the PEG/lithium acetate transformation protocol described by Gietz and Schiestl (27.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown overnight to stationary phase, and microsomes were isolated as described by Tang et al. (28.Tang G.Q. Novitzky W.P. Carol Griffin H. Huber S.C. Dewey R.E. Plant J. 2005; 44: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In vitro methylation assays were performed following the protocol of Kodaki and Yamashita (20.Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions included 50 μg of microsomal protein, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 3 mm MgSO4, and 4 μCi of [methyl- 3H]AdoMet (0.72 μm) (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.). A total reaction volume of 400 μl was achieved by the addition of dH2O. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 400 μl of 2:1 chloroform/methanol. The bottom phase was transferred to a new tube, and the remaining aqueous phase was extracted again using 400 μl of 2:1 chloroform/methanol. The pooled organic phases were washed using dH2O (40% final volume), and the extracted organic phase was evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 100 μl of 2:1 chloroform/methanol. Reaction products were spotted on silica gel 60 plates (Whatman) and resolved using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:35:5, v/v/v). Labeled compounds corresponding to PtdMMEtn, PtdDMEtn, and PtdCho were identified by co-migration with authentic standards (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in adjacent lanes and quantitated using scintillation spectroscopy. All plants used in this study were grown under 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle at 22 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves according to Edwards et al. (29.Edwards K. Johnstone C. Thompson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). Plants were genotyped by PCR using the following three primers: forward (5′-CGTAATAAGTCCCAGCTTCACCTAACA-3′) and reverse (5′-AAACAGAACTTTAAGGAGCGATTGC-3′ corresponding to genomic AtPLMT sequences flanking the predicted insertion site, and a primer specific to the Ds element (5′-GAAACGGTCGGGAAACTAGCTCTAC-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C incubation for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min and a final 7-min extension at 72 °C. For transcript analysis of line GT9763, total RNA was isolated with TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the First Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The primers used to determine AtPLMT expression were 5′-CATCGACGGTAATGGCACGTGTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCAAGAGGCATGCCAATAGA-3′ (reverse). To amplify transcripts corresponding to the actin-8 gene control, 5′-CTTTCCGGTTACAGCGTTTG-3′ and 5′-GAAACGCGGATTAGTGCCT-3′ were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C incubation for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final 7-min extension at 72 °C. Genomic DNA was isolated from young leaf tissue according to Murray and Thompson (30.Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9497) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzolTM reagent as described above. Nucleic acid blot hybridizations were conducted using either the protocols described by Sambrook and Russell (31.Sambrook J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) or using the Perfect-Hyb Plus hybridization buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). 32P-Labeled hybridization probes were generated using the Random Prime Labeling kit according the method provided by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). After overnight incubation with labeled probe, blots were washed as follows: two washes with 2× SSPE 0.1% SDS (1× SSPE = 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaHPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 15 min, two washes using 1× SSPE 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, two washes with 0.5× SSPE 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and a final wash using 0.1× SSPE 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. Autoradiograms were generated by exposing the washed blots to Kodak Biomax XAR film. The protocol for labeling whole Arabidopsis plantlets with [14C]formate was adapted from Hanson and Wyse (32.Hanson A.D. Wyse R. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arabidopsis seeds were germinated on 1% phytoagar plates with Murashige and Skoog (MS) media and 1% sucrose. Eight to 10 days after germination, plantlets were transferred aseptically to 1 ml of liquid medium containing MS salts, 1% sucrose, and 10 mm MES, pH 5.6. After equilibration in the liquid medium by growth for 24 h on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) using a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle, 20 μCi of [14C]formate (56 mCi/mmol; Sigma) was added to the 1-ml volumes, and the seedlings were shaken in the dark for up to 24 h. Labeling was terminated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), followed by a 20-min incubation on ice. Seedlings were rinsed with dH2O, then ground with a micropestal in 200 μl of extraction solvent (dH2O/ethanol/diethyl ether/pyridine at 15:15:5:1, v/v), followed by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min. One ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added to each sample, vortexed thoroughly, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. To promote phase separation, 400 μl of dH2O was added, vortexed, and centrifuged at 2 min at 13,000 × g. The bottom phase was extracted, dried under a vacuum, and resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Twenty five microliters of each extract were separated on a LK5D silica gel 60- Å TLC plate and developed in a tank containing chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (65:35:5, v/v/v). Regions corresponding to unlabeled standards (visualized with iodine vapor) were scraped from the plate, and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on 1% phytoagar plates containing MS salts and 1% sucrose. Phospholipids were extracted from 10-day-old plants as described previously (33.Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Plant tissue remaining after lipid extraction was placed in a drying oven for 18 h at 80 °C and then weighed to allow for normalization according to dry weight. Lipidomics analysis was conducted using ESI/MS/MS by the Kansas State Lipidomics Research group. Using the rat PEMT protein and yeast Opi3p as a query sequences, tblastn searches of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases of GenBankTM revealed an Arabidopsis EST whose predicted protein product shared homology with the rat and yeast sequences. No Arabidopsis sequences with homology to the yeast Cho2p sequence were observed. A partial cDNA lacking part of its 5′ sequence was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, and a full-length clone was obtained using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. A homologous sequence from soybean was obtained by screening a soybean cDNA library using the Arabidopsis cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 2, the predicted Arabidopsis and soybean proteins are 164 and 167 amino acids in size, respectively. The plant proteins share 74% sequence identity to each other, but only about 25% identity to either the yeast Opi3p or rat PEMT enzymes. The presence of three predicted membrane-spanning domains suggests that the plant proteins function as integral membrane proteins. Analysis of the complete Arabidopsis genome sequence showed that the PLMT-like sequence exists as a single copy within the genome (GenBankTM accession number At1g80860). Investigation of the soybean genome revealed two distinct chromosomal segments possessing PLMT-like genes (data not shown). Chromosome 8 contains the gene that corresponds to the soybean cDNA isolated from the library screen. The other soybean PLMT-like sequence (found on chromosome 7) is likely to be a pseudogene, as described below. DNA blotting results were consistent with the interpretation that soybean possesses two loci with homology to this sequence (supplemental Fig. 1). The genomic structures of the Arabidopsis and soybean (chromosome 8) PLMT-like genes are shown in Fig. 2B. Both genes contain a single intron midway between two protein-encoding exons. Comparison of Arabidopsis EST sequences with the At1g80860 genomic sequence reveals that two transcript variants originate from this gene. A 73-bp intron within the 3′-untranslated region of the gene is excised in about half of the Arabidopsis ESTs corresponding to At1g80860 (data not shown). Comparison of the soybean PLMT-like gene on chromosome 8 with that on chromosome 7, together with their corresponding ESTs, showed that a series of small deletions and a splice junction mutation in the intron results in incomplete, frame-shifted transcripts from the latter gene that would not be likely to produce a functional protein (data not shown). It is therefore probable that the gene residing on chromosome 8 is the only viable copy within the soybean genome. Because of the low primary sequence identity shared between the rat and yeast PLMT protein sequences and the predicted products of the Arabidopsis and soybean PLMT-like sequences (∼25%), it was incumbent to test whether the putative plant proteins were indeed functional homologs of the animal and yeast enzymes. According to the most widely accepted model of PtdCho biosynthesis in plants (Fig. 1), PtdMMEthn and PtdDMEtn would be the most likely substrates for a plant PLMT enzyme. Because of the integral membrane nature of PLMTs, we took advantage of mutant yeast strains to test the function and substrate specificities of the candidate plant PLMTs. Yeast strains possessing an opi3 knock-out allele display negligible PtdMMEtn and PtdDMEtn methylation activities and have been shown to accumulate high levels of the Cho2p product PtdMMEtn (22.McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 317-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length cDNAs of both the Arabidopsis and soybean PLMT-like sequences were cloned into a yeast transformation vector and introduced into the opi3 knock-out strain CTY411. Microsomal preparations were incubated with [3H]AdoMet and assayed for their ability to methylate the endogenous phospholipids within this membrane fraction. The results of the in vitro methylation assays are shown in Fig. 3. All possible PtdEtn derivatives (PtdMMEtn, PtdDMEtn, and PtdCho) were readily observed using microsomal membranes from a wild-type control yeast strain (CTY182). As expected, PtdMMEtn was the only product observed from microsomes of CTY411 transformed with the control vector alone. In CTY411 cells expressing either the Arabidopsis or soybean cDNAs, however, radiolabeled PtdDMEtn and PtdCho species were observed in addition to PtdMMEtn (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that the plant enzymes were capable of catalyzing the final two steps in the methylation pathway of PtdCho synthesis in yeast. Because of their abilities to N-methylate phosphatidylamino alcohol substrates in vitro, the Arabidopsis and soybean genes were designated AtPLMT and GmPLMT, respectively. Although both plant enzymes gave the same reaction products, under our assay conditions, microsomal fractions recovered from yeast expressing AtPLMT consistently displayed greater activity than those observed from yeast expressing GmPLMT. Classical biochemical studies have suggested that plants are fundamentally different from animals or yeast by not being able to produce PtdCho directly via methylation of PtdEtn (7.Kinney A.J. Lipid Metabolism in Plants.in: Moore T.S. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 259-284Google Scholar, 8.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Marshall M.O. Kates M. FEBS Lett. 1973; 31: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This concept is further supported by the fact that previous efforts using Arabidopsis and spinach cDNA libraries to complement yeast strains defective in the PtdCho methylation pathway only recovered genes encoding enzymes capable of methylating phospho-base substrates (15.Bolognese C.P. McGraw P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1800-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). If the hypothesis is true that plant cells cannot synthesize PtdCho directly from PtdEtn, then plant PLMT enzymes, unlike their animal and yeast counterparts, should be incapable of utilizing PtdEtn as a substrate. We tested this by determining whether the Arabidopsis or soybean PLMT genes could complement a yeast strain with knock-out mutations in both the cho2 and opi3 loci. In yeast, choline auxotrophy is not mediated by the cho2 mutation alone because the Opi3p enzyme is capable of a catalyzing a low level of PtdEtn methylation (35.Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56)"
https://openalex.org/W2034002639,"Background The growth of sequencing-based Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation studies call for a more in-depth understanding of the nature of the technology and of the resultant data to reduce false positives and false negatives. Control libraries are typically constructed to complement such studies in order to mitigate the effect of systematic biases that might be present in the data. In this study, we explored multiple control libraries to obtain better understanding of what they truly represent. Methodology First, we analyzed the genome-wide profiles of various sequencing-based libraries at a low resolution of 1 Mbp, and compared them with each other as well as against aCGH data. We found that copy number plays a major influence in both ChIP-enriched as well as control libraries. Following that, we inspected the repeat regions to assess the extent of mapping bias. Next, significantly tag-rich 5 kbp regions were identified and they were associated with various genomic landmarks. For instance, we discovered that gene boundaries were surprisingly enriched with sequenced tags. Further, profiles between different cell types were noticeably distinct although the cell types were somewhat related and similar. Conclusions We found that control libraries bear traces of systematic biases. The biases can be attributed to genomic copy number, inherent sequencing bias, plausible mapping ambiguity, and cell-type specific chromatin structure. Our results suggest careful analysis of control libraries can reveal promising biological insights."
https://openalex.org/W2084108486,"Background Detection of single cell epitopes has been a mainstay of immunophenotyping for over three decades, primarily using fluorescence techniques for quantitation. Fluorescence has broad overlapping spectra, limiting multiplexing abilities. Methodology/Principal Findings To expand upon current detection systems, we developed a novel method for multi-color immuno-detection in single cells using “Composite Organic-Inorganic Nanoparticles” (COINs) Raman nanoparticles. COINs are Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) nanoparticles, with unique Raman spectra. To measure Raman spectra in single cells, we constructed an automated, compact, low noise and sensitive Raman microscopy device (Integrated Raman BioAnalyzer). Using this technology, we detected proteins expressed on the surface in single cells that distinguish T-cells among human blood cells. Finally, we measured intracellular phosphorylation of Stat1 (Y701) and Stat6 (Y641), with results comparable to flow cytometry. Conclusions/Significance Thus, we have demonstrated the practicality of applying COIN nanoparticles for measuring intracellular phosphorylation, offering new possibilities to expand on the current fluorescent technology used for immunoassays in single cells."

The expressed enzyme cleaved β-carotene at its central double bond (15,15′) to yield two molecules of all-trans-retinal. The molecular mass of the native purified enzyme was ∼64 kDa as a dimer of 32-kDa subunits. The Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values for β-carotene as substrate were 37 μm, 3.6 min−1, and 97 mm−1 min−1, respectively. The enzyme exhibited the highest activity for β-carotene, followed by β-cryptoxanthin, β-apo-4′-carotenal, α-carotene, and γ-carotene in decreasing order, but not for β-apo-8′-carotenal, β-apo-12′-carotenal, lutein, zeaxanthin, or lycopene, suggesting that the presence of one unsubstituted β-ionone ring in a substrate with a molecular weight greater than C35 seems to be essential for enzyme activity.

This is the first report of in vitro characterization of a bacterial β-carotene-cleaving enzyme. Vitamin A (retinol) is a fat-soluble vitamin and important for human health. In vivo, the cleavage of β-carotene to retinal is an important step of vitamin A synthesis. The cleavage can proceed via two different biochemical pathways (1.Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 2613-2617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.During A. Harrison E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The major pathway is a central cleavage catalyzed by mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases (EC 1.14.99.36). β-Carotene is cleaved by the enzyme symmetrically into two molecules of all-trans-retinal, and retinal is then converted to vitamin A in vivo (3.von Lintig J. Wyss A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4.Goodman D.S. Huang H.S. Kanai M. Shiratori T. J. Biol.

The second pathway is an eccentric cleavage that occurs at double bonds other than the central 15,15′-double bond of β-carotene to produce β-apo-carotenals with different chain lengths, which are catalyzed by carotenoid oxygenases from mammals, plants, and cyanobacteria (6.Scherzinger D. Al-Babili S. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These β-apo-carotenals are degraded to one molecule of retinal, which is subsequently converted to vitamin A in vivo (2.During A. Harrison E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).β-Carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase was first isolated as a cytosolic enzyme by identifying the product of β-carotene cleavage as retinal (7.Olson J.A. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1364-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The characterization of the enzyme and the reaction pathway from β-carotene to retinal were also investigated (4.Goodman D.S. Huang H.S. Kanai M. Shiratori T. J. Biol.

In addition, the properties of the enzyme were compared with those of mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases.DISCUSSIONAlthough most recent critical debates about β-carotene-cleaving enzymes have tended to center around mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases, we became interested in β-carotene-cleaving enzymes from other sources, especially bacteria. Hence, we used codon optimization to synthesize the blh gene from the uncultured marine bacterium 66A03 for expression in E. coli. The expressed enzyme converts β-carotene into all-trans-retinal. Characterization of the bacterial Blh protein as a new member of the β-carotene cleavage enzymes is a worthwhile undertaking.The Blh protein is a putative membrane protein closely related to bacteriorhodopsin (40.Yang C.F. Kim J.M. Molinari E. DasSarma S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bacteriorhodopsin is a membrane protein containing seven transmembrane α-helices and a covalently bound molecule of retinal. The Blh protein is predicted by the TMHMM program to have seven transmembrane segments, whereas human β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase has no transmembrane segments. These results suggest that the Blh protein is a membrane protein The theoretical pI values of the Blh proteins from marine bacteria (8.89–9.56) were much higher than those of the mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases (5.49–6.30), indicating that the two proteins are different (Table 2). There were 48–56% hydrophobic amino acids in the bacterial Blh proteins and 33–34% in mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases. Thus, the Blh proteins are more hydrophobic than mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases.TABLE 2Theoretical pI values and hydrophobic amino acid contents of Blh and Brp-like proteins and β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenasesProteinSourcepIHydrophobic amino acidsaThe hydrophobic amino acids are alanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and methionine.%Blh proteinUncultured marine bacterium 66A039.5652.4Uncultured marine bacterium HF10 49E089.3048.4Halobacterium sp.

The native protein has a total molecular mass of about 64 kDa as a dimer (Fig. 2). β-Carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases from humans, mice, chickens, and rats consisted of 547, 566, 526, and 566 amino acid residues, respectively, and their molecular masses were ∼60–64 kDa (Table 3).

Phenanthroline behaves as an iron-chelating agent and strongly inhibited the conversion of β-carotene into retinal by the Blh protein. Furthermore, among the metal ions tested, Fe2+ had the strongest effect on the activity of the Blh protein. Fe2+ is bound by four conserved histidine residues in the active sites of mammalian β-carotene monooxygenase and apocarotenoid oxygenase (43.Poliakov E. Gentleman S. Cunningham Jr., F.X.

In the Blh protein, Fe2+ is coordinated with His-21, His-78, His-188, and His-192, which are absolutely conserved across all Blh and Brp-like proteins (Fig. 1). The four conserved histidine residues were replaced with alanine to produce alanine-substituted mutants. Enzyme activities were determined for the mutants and were compared with that of wild-type enzyme. The relative activities of the H21A, H78A, H188A, and H192A mutants were 3, 0, 0, and 5%, respectively. Thus, we can propose that the four histidine residues in the Blh protein are metal-binding residues. The enzyme activity in the presence of 10 μm Fe2+ before dialysis was almost the same as after dialysis. These results imply that Fe2+ is tightly bound to the Blh protein.The maximum activity of the Blh protein was observed at pH 8.0 and 40 °C (Fig. 5). The maximum activities of β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases from mammalian sources occurred at pH 7.5–8.5, except for the mouse enzyme that had a maximum activity at pH 9.0 (45.Kim Y.S. Kim N.H.

The thermostability of the human β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase was investigated, and the half-lives of the human enzyme at 35, 40, 45, and 50 °C were 4.5, 3.4, 2.4, and 1.4 h, respectively. The half-lives of the Blh protein were approximately 4–5-fold higher at these temperatures than those of the human β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase.The Blh protein from the uncultured marine bacterium converted the substrate β-carotene into two molecules of retinal, and it converted β-apo-4′-carotenal into one molecule of retinal. The enzyme cleaved the central double bonds (15,15′) of α-carotene, γ-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin to yield not only one molecule of retinal but also one molecule of each α-retinal, acycloretinal, and (3R)-3-hydroxy-retinal. β-Carotene has two β-ionone rings; α-carotene has β-ionone and ϵ-ionone rings, and γ-carotene and β-apo-carotenals have one β-ionone ring. β-Cryptoxanthin has β-ionone and hydroxyl β-ionone rings; zeaxanthin has hydroxyl ϵ-ionone and hydroxyl β-ionone rings, and lutein has two hydroxyl β-ionone rings. However, lycopene does not have a β-ionone ring. The Blh protein exhibited activity for β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, β-apo-4′-carotenal (C35), α-carotene, and γ-carotene in decreasing order, but not for β-apo-8′-carotenal (C30), β-apo-12′-carotenal (C25), lutein, zeaxanthin, or lycopene. Based on the chemical structures of the carotenoid substrates, enzyme activity was found only for substrates containing one unsubstituted β-ionone ring with a molecular weight greater than C35. The mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases from humans and rats had activity for β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and β-apo-8′-carotenal (C30) but not lycopene (41.Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 50.Grolier P. Duszka C. Borel P. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Azais-Braesco V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that human β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase had activity for β-apo-4′-carotenal (C35). Although the kcat/Km values of the Blh protein and the human β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase for β-carotene were similar, the kcat/Km value of the Blh protein for β-cryptoxanthin (28 mm−1 min−1) as a substrate was 14-fold higher than that of the human enzyme (1.9 mm−1 min−1) (41.Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).To interpret the substrate specificity of the Blh protein on carotenoid substrates, a simulated backbone of the enzyme structure was constructed, and side chains were added based on averaged similar secondary structures in the protein data base. Simulated molecular docking was performed with β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lutein substrates using the Surflex X docking program. When β-carotene was bound in the active site, the para position of one β-ionone ring of β-carotene, located in the interior of the active site, and the para position of the other unhydroxylated β-ionone ring interacted with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Thr-179, at a distance of 3.01 Å (Fig. 7B). When β-cryptoxanthin was bound in the active site, the distance between the hydroxyl group of the (3R)-3-hydroxy-β-ionone ring of β-cryptoxanthin and the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Thr-179 decreased to 2.31 Å (Fig. 7C). The shorter distance may explain the observed higher affinity of the Blh protein for β-cryptoxanthin than for β-carotene. When lutein (or zeaxanthin) was bound in the active site, two hydroxyl groups of two (3R)-3-hydroxy β-ionone rings of lutein (or zeaxanthin) were noneffective in anchoring to the active site because the distance to the oxygen atom of Thr-179 was too long (Fig. 7D). As a result, the Blh protein exhibited no activity for lutein or zeaxanthin. The Blh protein showed activity for β-apo-4′-carotenal but not for β-apo-8′-carotenal. In the molecular modeling studies, β-apo-4′-carotenal was large enough to interact with Thr-179, but β-apo-8′-carotenal was too small to interact (data not shown). However, it is necessary to obtain the actual structure of the enzyme complexed with these substrates to provide further evidence for this conclusion. To confirm our molecular modeling and structural analyses, determination of the crystal structure of the Blh protein and mutational analysis of the active site residues must be performed.Carotenoid oxygenases can be divided into mono- and di-oxygenases based on two different reaction mechanisms (Fig. 8). The oxygen atom of the product from the monooxygenase is provided by molecular oxygen and water via an epoxide intermediate, whereas that from the dioxygenase is provided by molecular oxygen rather than from water via a dioxetane intermediate (51.Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. 2001; 113: 2683-2687Crossref Google Scholar, 52.Borowski T. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. Chem. Eur. J. 2008; 14: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The oxygenation mechanism of chicken β-carotene 15,15′-oxygenase was investigated with isotopic molecular oxygen and water. The oxygen atom in the terminal aldehyde group of retinal as a product was provided by molecular oxygen and water (51.Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. 2001; 113: 2683-2687Crossref Google Scholar), indicating that the enzyme catalyzes the oxidative cleavage using a monooxygenase rather than a dioxygenase mechanism. The other mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-oxygenases were postulated to use the same mechanism. However, some controversies on the reaction mechanism was suggested because oxygen between retinal and water was exchanged within 5% (51.Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. 2001; 113: 2683-2687Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, the oxygen atom of the retinal formed by the reaction of the Blh protein originated from molecular oxygen rather than from water without oxygen exchange between retinal and water, indicating that the Blh protein used a dioxygenase mechanism unlike the mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases. The Blh protein cleaved β-carotenoid substrates at its central double bond (15,15′) and showed the highest activity for β-carotene among the substrates tested. Thus, the Blh protein can be identified as a β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase.FIGURE 8Two different mechanisms for β-carotene central cleavage. A, dioxygenase mechanism. The oxygen atom of the product is provided by molecular oxygen rather than water via dioxetane intermediate (7.Olson J.A. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The oxygen atom of the product is provided by molecular oxygen and water via an epoxide intermediate (51.Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew.

According to the cleaving mechanism of apocarotenoid oxygenase (52.Borowski T. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. Chem. Eur. J. 2008; 14: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the O2 molecule in the active site of the Blh protein binds to the coordination shell of Fe2+ in a side-on fashion. The side-on complex of Fe-O2 then attacks and cleaves between the C-15 and C-15′ atoms when bound to the Blh protein.Most enzymes that catalyze the same reaction sequence are structurally similar. However, structurally and mechanistically unrelated enzymes that catalyze the same biochemical reactions do occur. In many cases, one of these analogous enzymes is found in the bacteria and the other in eukaryotes (53.Galperin M.Y. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although the bacterial Blh protein and the mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases could both convert β-carotene into retinal, the properties of the bacterial Blh protein such as DNA and amino acid sequences, molecular weight, form of association, reaction mechanism, kinetic properties, and substrate specificity were different from the mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases. Thus, the Blh protein is a bacterial analog to the mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenases.This is the first report of in vitro characterization of a bacterial β-carotene-cleaving enzyme. This study contributes to the understanding of bacterial β-carotene-cleaving enzymes and provides a stepping stone for further studies. Moreover, this study will be useful in evolutionary studies investigating the relationships between bacterial and mammalian enzymes and industrial applications of retinal biosynthesis.

The monomeric precursor to these oligomers exhibits many of the characteristics of a molten globule intermediate with some helical character in regions that form helices I and III in the PrPC conformation, whereas helix II exhibits little evidence for adopting a helical conformation, suggesting that this region is a likely source of interaction within the initial phases of the transformation to a β-rich conformation.

According to the protein-only hypothesis (15Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), the infectious agent is composed of a conformational isomer of PrP (16Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar) that is able to convert other isoforms to the infectious isomer in an autocatalytic manner. Despite numerous studies, little is known about the mechanism of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. The most coherent and general model proposed thus far is that PrPC fluctuates between the dominant native state and minor conformations, one or a set of which can self-associate in an ordered manner to produce a stable supramolecular structure composed of misfolded PrP monomers (3Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 17Collinge J. Clarke A.R. Science. 2007; 318: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This stable, oligomeric species can then bind to, and stabilize, rare non-native monomer conformations that are structurally complementary. In this manner, new monomeric chains are recruited and the system can propagate. In view of the above model, considerable effort has been devoted to generating and characterizing alternative, possibly PrPSc-like, conformations in the hope of identifying common properties or features that facilitate the formation of amyloid oligomers. This has been accomplished either through PrPSc-dependent conversion reactions (18Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B.

One such PrP folding intermediate, termed β-PrP, differs from the majority of studied PrP intermediate states in that it is formed by refolding the PrP molecule from the native α-helical conformation (here termed α-PrP), at acidic pH in a reduced state, with the disulfide bond broken (22Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 35Sasaki K. Gaikwad J.

The β-PrP species previously characterized, spanning residues 91–231 of PrP, was soluble at low ionic strength buffers and monomeric, according to elution volume on gel filtration (22Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). NMR analysis showed that it displayed radically different spectra to those of α-PrP, with considerably fewer observable peaks and markedly reduced chemical shift dispersion. Data from circular dichroism experiments showed that fixed side chain (tertiary) interactions were lost, in contrast to the well defined β-sheet secondary structure, and thus in conjunction with the NMR data, indicated that β-PrP possessed a number of characteristics associated with a “molten globule” folding intermediate (22Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Such states have been proposed to be important in amyloid and fibril formation (41Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Indeed, antibodies raised against β-PrP (e.g. ICSM33) are capable of recognizing native PrPSc (but not PrPC) (42Khalili-Shirazi A. Quaratino S. Londei M. Summers L. Tayebi M. Clarke A.R. Hawke S.H.

Subsequently, a related study examining the role of the disulfide bond in PrP folding confirmed that a monomeric molten globule-like form of PrP was formed on refolding the disulfide-reduced protein at acidic pH, but reported that, under their conditions, the circular dichroism response interpreted as β-sheet structure was associated with protein oligomerization (45Maiti N.R.

Indeed, atomic force microscopy on oligomeric full-length β-PrP (residues 23–231) shows small, round particles, showing that it is capable of formation of oligomers without forming fibrils (35Sasaki K.

Notably, however, salt-induced oligomeric β-PrP has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, in a similar manner to PrPSc (46Kristiansen M. Deriziotis P. Dimcheff D.E. Jackson G.S.

Their conformational properties are considered important, as the elucidation of the chain conformation may provide information on the way in which these chains pack in the assembly process, and also potentially provide clues on the mechanism of amyloid assembly and the phenomenon of prion strains. As the conformational fluctuations and heterogeneity of molten globule states give rise to broad NMR spectra that preclude direct observation of their conformational properties by NMR (47Redfield C.

In addition, we use circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation to examine the global structural properties, and the distribution of multimeric species that are formed from β-PrP. The protein construct used in this study comprised residues 91–231 of human prion protein (huPrP91–231). Expression and purification of 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled protein for NMR study was carried out as described previously (6Hosszu L.L. Jackson G.S. Trevitt C.R. Jones S. Batchelor M. Bhelt D.

Samples were stored in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 at −20 °C, prior to use. Protein samples were converted from the normal α-helical (α-PrP) conformation to the β-sheet conformation (β-PrP), by reducing the protein disulfide bond and refolding at acidic pH as previously described (22Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified α-PrP was denatured by the addition of guanidinium hydrochloride to 6 m in the presence of 100 mm DTT, refolded under reducing conditions by dialysis against 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm DTT, pH 4, and subject to ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 4 h. The yield for conversion to β-PrP was 88%, calculated prior to ultracentrifugation, and 27% after. 13C/15N-labeled protein samples for the backbone assignment of the urea-denatured unfolded state of PrP were buffer exchanged by repeated concentration/dilution in Amicon 50 pressure cells into 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm sodium azide, pH 4.0, 2 mm DTT (10% D2O (v/v)) containing 5 m urea. Sample protein concentrations were 1.1 mm. NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Bruker DRX-600 and DRX-800 spectrometers equipped with 5-mm 13C/15N/1H triple-resonance probes. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to 1 mm TSP added to the samples. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were calculated relative to TSP, using the gyromagnetic ratios of 15N, 13C, and 1H (15N/1H = 0.101329118, 13C/1H = 0.25144953). NMR data were processed and analyzed on Linux Workstations using Felix 2004 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) software. Backbone resonance assignments were achieved using the standard suite of triple resonance experiments (HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH) (51Bax A. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 52Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1993; 101: 201-205Crossref Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 53Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E.

Peak picking was performed semimanually. The backbone assignment methodology used the “asstools” set of assignment programs (55Reed M.A. Hounslow A.M. Sze K.H. Barsukov I.G. Hosszu L.L. Clarke A.R. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The default option and values within the program were used, with the standard table of Cα and C′ chemical shifts replaced with a table containing ranges of 0.5 ppm from random coil values. The long 13C′ and 15N T2 relaxation times allowed long 13C′ (180 ms) and 15N (69 ms) acquisition times, giving good resolution in these dimensions in the HNCO and HN(CA)CO spectra. Cα and Cβ matches were used mainly for residue-type and preceding residue-type identification. All peaks were assigned apart from residues 146–148, 207–208, and 211–212. For the measurement of backbone 13C chemical shifts at varying urea concentrations, 500 μm samples of 13C/15N-labeled β-PrP in 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm sodium azide, 1 mm TSP, 2 mm DTT, pH 4.0 (10% D2O (v/v)), were titrated with aliquots of freshly prepared 9 m urea in the same buffer. Following each addition of denaturant, samples were equilibrated for 60 min at 298 K, before being placed in the magnet. Cα and C′ chemical shifts were determined through HN(CO)CA and HNCO experiments, respectively (51Bax A. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 53Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 54Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar), acquired at 298 K. As urea hydrolyzes, resulting in the production of ammonia, the pH of samples was found to increase over the course of the acquisition of triple resonance spectra (2 to 4 days). (It was not possible to significantly increase the buffering capacity of the sample as β-PrP is prone to aggregation at high ionic strength.) Consequently, to minimize the change in sample pH over the range of urea concentrations monitored, the titration was carried out in three separate titrations, with Cα and C′ chemical shifts were determined at the following urea concentrations: 0.61, 0.79, 1.10, and 1.51 m; 1.53, 2.00, 2.50, 3.01, and 3.50 m; and 3.48, 3.98, 4.53, and 5.23 m. As the acquisition of 1H-15N HSQC spectra is considerably faster than that of triple resonance spectra it was possible to acquire HN and 15N chemical shifts independently in single 1H-15N HSQC titrations. For these, samples of 50 μm and 500 μm15N-labeled β-PrP in the same buffer described above were titrated in an analogous manner to the 13C/15N titrations. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired using sensitivity enhanced pulsed field gradient coherence selection (54Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 56Schleucher J. Schwendinger M. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O. Glaser S.J. Sørensen O.W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) with acquisition times of 273 and 128 ms in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. The intensities of resolved HSQC resonances were measured and normalized to the intensity of the backbone resonance of residue Gly-94, which is unstructured in α-PrP and β-PrP, and whose intensity remained approximately constant throughout the titration. The modulus of the 1H/15N chemical shift differences (Dmod) was calculated in the following way; Dmod = sqrt ((Ddhn)2 + (Ddn/10)2), where Ddhn and Ddn are the chemical shift differences in 1H and 15N, respectively. β-PrP samples for simultaneous CD and AUC analysis were prepared in various concentrations of urea (0.0–5.0 m) in 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm sodium azide, pH 4.0, by dilution of the PrP stock solution with buffer A (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm sodium azide) and buffer B (9 m urea in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm sodium azide) as appropriate. Samples were then concentrated to 50 μm PrP using Vivaspin 6 spin concentrators (Sartorius), and the flow-through used as the matched buffer reference for CD and AUC experiments. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter using 0.1-mm path length cuvettes and typically 10 accumulations, with a bandwidth of 1 nm and integration 1 s−1. CD spectra were acquired both before and after the ultracentrifugation, and at 50 μm protein concentration in various concentrations of urea, as described below. The amide CD absorption of 50 μm β-PrP in 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm sodium azide, 2 mm DTT, pH 4.0, was recorded in varying concentrations of urea as previously described (6Hosszu L.L. Jackson G.S. Trevitt C.R. Jones S. Batchelor M. Bhelt D. Prodromidou K. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Collinge J. J. Biol.

The mean residue ellipticity signal ([θ]r) at 215 nm was converted to the proportion of molecules in the unfolded state, αU, according to the relationship, αυ=1-[(([θ]ri-[θ]r5M)/([θ]r0M-[θ]r5M))×100]Eq. 1 where [θ]r0M and [θ]r5M are the mean residue ellipticity values for the beginning and end of the urea denaturation transition (i.e. 0 and 100%, respectively). The normalized data were then fitted to a two-state unfolding equation, αU=(K(N/U).exp(m.D))/(1+K(N/U).exp(m.D))Eq. 2 where m represents the sensitivity of the unfolding transition to denaturant, K(N/U) represents the equilibrium constant between the native and unfolded states, and D is the denaturant concentration. The two-state unfolding model is not formally correct for the observed β-PrP CD unfolding transition (see “Results”), as the data represent a transition between monomeric species at high urea concentration and multimeric species at lower urea concentrations. The form of the CD transition does nevertheless follow that for two-state unfolding and therefore the data are fitted to the two-state unfolding model to derive minimum and maximum values for [θ]r, representing the signal of folded and unfolded species, regardless of association state. These values were then used to derive the proportion of folded species at each urea concentration. Sedimentation velocity AUC experiments were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples prepared for parallel CD and sedimentation velocity analysis were loaded into Beckman AUC sample cells with 12-mm optical path two-channel centerpieces, with the matched buffer in the reference sector. Cells were loaded into a AnTi-50 ro"
https://openalex.org/W1968069499,"Complexes involved in the gamma/epsilon-secretase-regulated intramembranous proteolysis of substrates such as the amyloid-beta precursor protein are composed primarily of presenilin (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin, anterior pharynx defective-1 (APH1), and PEN2. The presenilin aspartyl residues form the catalytic site, and similar potentially functional polar transmembrane residues in APH1 have been identified. Substitution of charged (E84A, R87A) or polar (Q83A) residues in TM3 had no effect on complex assembly or activity. In contrast, changes to either of two highly conserved histidines (H171A, H197A) located in TM5 and TM6 negatively affected PS1 cleavage and altered binding to other secretase components, resulting in decreased amyloid generating activity. Charge replacement with His-to-Lys substitutions rescued nicastrin maturation and PS1 endoproteolysis leading to assembly of the formation of structurally normal but proteolytically inactive gamma-secretase complexes. Substitution with a negatively charged side chain (His-to-Asp) or altering the structural location of the histidines also disrupted gamma-secretase binding and abolished functionality of APH1. These results suggest that the conserved transmembrane histidine residues contribute to APH1 function and can affect presenilin catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1984698452,"Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is a sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin (Siglec) which has been characterized as potent myelin-derived inhibitor of neurite outgrowth. Two members of the Nogo-receptor (NgR) family, NgR1 and NgR2, have been identified as neuronal binding proteins of MAG. In addition, gangliosides have been proposed to bind to and confer the inhibitory activity of MAG on neurons. In this study, we investigated the individual contribution of NgRs and gangliosides to MAG-mediated inhibition of sensory neurons derived from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of ngr1, ngr2 or ngr1/ngr2 deletion mutants. We found no disinhibition of neurite growth in the absence of either NgR1 or NgR2. Sensory neurons deficient for both NgR proteins displayed only a moderate reduction of MAG-mediated inhibition of neurite growth. If treated with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VCN), inhibition by MAG is further attenuated but still not annulled. Thus, disrupting all known protein and ganglioside receptors for MAG in sensory neurons does not fully abolish its inhibitory activity pointing to the existence of as yet unidentified receptors for MAG. Moreover, by employing a variety of protein mutants, we identified the Ig-like domains 4 or 5 of MAG as necessary and sufficient for growth arrest, whereas abolishing MAG's ability to bind to sialic acid did not interfere with its inhibitory activity. These findings provide new insights into the inhibitory function of MAG and suggest similarities but also major differences in MAG inhibition between sensory and central nervous system (CNS) neurons."

Methodology/Principal Findings Here we examined the expression and post-translational processing of the protein product of the pmpD gene during the life cycle of C. trachomatis serovars A, D, and L2. Each of these three serovars targets different human organs and tissues and encodes a different pmpD gene nucleotide sequence. Our quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results demonstrate that the pmpD gene is up-regulated at 12–24 hours after infection regardless of the Chlamydia serovar. This up-regulation is coincidental with the period of exponential growth and replication of reticulate bodies (RB) of Chlamydia and indicates a probable similarity in function of pmpD in serovars A, D, and L2 of Chlamydia. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified the protein products of post-translational processing of PmpD of C. trachomatis serovar L2 and propose a double pathway model for PmpD processing, with one cleavage site between the passenger and autotransporter domains and the other site in the middle of the passenger domain. Notably, when Chlamydia infected culture cells were subjected to low (28°C) temperature, PmpD post-translational processing and secretion was found to be uninhibited in the resulting persistent infection. In addition, confocal microscopy of cells infected with Chlamydia confirms our earlier hypothesis that PmpD is secreted outside Chlamydia and its secretion increases with growth of the chlamydial inclusion. Conclusion/Significance The results of this current study involving multiple Chlamydia serovars support the general consensus that the pmpD gene is maximally expressed at mid infection and provide new information about PmpD as an autotransporter protein which is post-translationally processed and secreted outside Chlamydia during normal and low temperature induced persistent chlamydial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2029021197,"Carbon-phosphorus lyase is a multienzyme system encoded by the phn operon that enables bacteria to metabolize organophosphonates when the preferred nutrient, inorganic phosphate, is scarce. One of the enzymes encoded by this operon, PhnP, is predicted by sequence homology to be a metal-dependent hydrolase of the β-lactamase superfamily. Screening with a wide array of hydrolytically sensitive substrates indicated that PhnP is an enzyme with phosphodiesterase activity, having the greatest specificity toward bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate and 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides. No activity was observed toward RNA. The metal ion dependence of PhnP with bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate as substrate revealed a distinct preference for Mn2+ and Ni2+ for catalysis, whereas Zn2+ afforded poor activity. The three-dimensional structure of PhnP was solved by x-ray crystallography to 1.4 resolution. The overall fold of PhnP is very similar to that of the tRNase Z endonucleases but lacks the long exosite module used by these enzymes to bind their tRNA substrates. The active site of PhnP contains what are probably two Mn2+ ions surrounded by an array of active site residues that are identical to those observed in the tRNase Z enzymes. A second, remote Zn2+ binding site is also observed, composed of a set of cysteine and histidine residues that are strictly conserved in the PhnP family.

This second metal ion site appears to stabilize a structural motif. In many environments inorganic phosphate, an essential nutrient, can fall to extremely low concentrations, forcing microorganisms to utilize other forms of phosphorus to survive. In such cases, organophosphonates can comprise a major fraction of the total phosphorus available to biological systems (e.g. 2-aminoethylphosphonate is a widespread natural product). However, cleavage of the highly stable carbon-phosphorus (CP) 5The abbreviations used are: CPcarbon-phosphorusCHES2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acidbpNPPbis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphateICPinductively coupled plasmaMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationMSmass spectrometryppGppguanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphatepppGppguanosine 3′-diphosphate-5′-triphosphateRFUrelative fluorescence unitsWTwild type enzymeTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ppG2′,3′ppNP-TMPthymidine-5′-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester. bond to release inorganic phosphate requires specialized enzymes. One such enzyme activity found widely in bacteria is CP-lyase (1Quinn J.P. Kulakova A.N. Cooley N.A. McGrath J.W. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2392-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the CP bond of organophosphonates by CP-lyase yields inorganic phosphate and, remarkably, a hydrocarbon. CP-lyase is actually a multienzyme system, encoded by the phn operon (phnCDEFGHIJKLMNOP), which is induced by low concentrations of phosphate as part of the pho regulon. Gene deletion studies in Escherichia coli have shown that phnGHIJKLM are essential for catalysis of CP bond cleavage, whereas the remaining genes probably encode transport, regulatory, or accessory functions (2Yakovleva G.M. Kim S.K. Wanner B.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Only a handful of the proteins encoded by the phn operon have been characterized to date. PhnD was shown to be a periplasmic binding protein with high affinity for organophosphonates (3Rizk S.S. Cuneo M.J. Hellinga H.W. Protein. Sci. 2006; 15: 1745-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); the three-dimensional structure of PhnH, one of the proteins essential for CP-lyase catalysis, was recently solved, but a function has yet to be determined (4Adams M.A. Luo Y. Hove-Jensen B. He S.M. van Staalduinen L.M. Zechel D.L. Jia Z. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1072-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); PhnN was shown to be an ATP-dependent kinase that provides a redundant pathway to 5-phospho-d-ribofuranosyl-α-1-diphosphate (5Hove-Jensen B. Rosenkrantz T.J. Haldimann A. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and PhnO was demonstrated to be an acetyl-CoA-dependent N-acyltransferase with activity toward a wide range of aminoalkylphosphonates (6Errey J.C. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3033-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). carbon-phosphorus 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate inductively coupled plasma matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry guanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate guanosine 3′-diphosphate-5′-triphosphate relative fluorescence units wild type enzyme N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ppG2′,3′p thymidine-5′-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester. Although the phnP gene is not essential for CP bond cleavage by cells in liquid culture (2Yakovleva G.M. Kim S.K. Wanner B.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), cell growth on solid media supplemented with methylphosphonate or phosphite as the sole phosphorus source is prevented by phnP mutations (7Metcalf W.W. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3430-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical regulatory or accessory role for PhnP. Accordingly, phnP appears frequently in the phn operon in various species of bacteria, typically following the phnN gene (8Huang J. Su Z. Xu Y. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PhnP is predicted based on its sequence to be a member of the β-lactamase family of metal-dependent hydrolases with greatest homology to enzymes from the tRNase Z (ProDom family PD352433) and ElaC families (9Späth B. Canino G. Marchfelder A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2404-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the latter erroneously annotated as composed of arylsulfatases but later determined to also belong to the tRNase Z family (10Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Kostelecky B. Pohl E. Vogel A. Schilling O. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The tRNase Z enzymes are endonucleases used by prokaryotes and eukaryotes to cleave a specific phosphodiester bond near the 3′-end of pre-tRNA, yielding a 3′-end that can be coupled to an amino acid. These enzymes typically use two active site bound Zn2+ ions to simultaneously lower the pKa of a nucleophilic water molecule and stabilize negative charge development on the phosphodiester linkage undergoing nucleophilic attack (12Redko Y. Li de Lasierra-Gallay I. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since it is not clear how a tRNase activity would support cell growth with an organophosphonate as a sole phosphorus source, we set out to characterize the substrate specificity and three-dimensional structure of PhnP to learn more about this critical CP-lyase enzyme. All buffers, substrates, and chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Canada). DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys Canada (Oakville, Canada). Microbiology media were purchased from Thermo-Fisher Scientific Canada Ltd. (Ottawa, Canada). DNA sequencing was performed at the Robarts Research Institute (London, Canada). Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was obtained from New England Biolabs. RNase A was from Ambion. J. T. Baker, Inc. brand polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were obtained from Mallinckrodt Baker. The cloning and expression of phnP as well as the purification and crystallization of wild type PhnP were described previously (13Podzelinska K. He S. Soares A. Zechel D. Hove-Jensen B. Jia Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild type PhnP with a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed from the plasmid pHO520-phnP in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) co-transformed with pLacI (Novagen). The plasmid pHO520-phnP is a derivative of pUHE 23–2 which contains T7 promoter and lac operator sites (14Andersen P.S. Frees D. Fast R. Mygind B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with amplicillin and chloramphenicol at 30 °C and induced at A600 ∼ 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were then grown at 15 °C for 24 h and collected by centrifugation. After cell lysis and centrifugation, PhnP was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and size exclusion chromatography. MALDI-MS confirmed the predicted molecular mass of His6-tagged PhnP as 28,670 Da (data not shown). PhnP mutants were created using the QuikChangeTM protocol (Stratagene). For the D80A mutant, the primer 5′-ACGCATTATCATATGGCTCACGTCCAGGGGCTG-3′ and its complementary sequence were used. For the C21S/C23S/C26S triple mutant, the primer 5′-CGGCATGGGGCTCCGAGTCTGCGGCCTCCGCCAGAGCGCG-3′ and its complimentary sequence were used. Mutagenic codons are underlined. The mutant genes were verified by sequencing both DNA strands. The mutant alleles were expressed and the mutant proteins were purified in the same fashion as wild type PhnP, with the exception of the triple mutant (C21S/C23S/C26S), which yielded insoluble protein (see below). The oligomeric state of PhnP was determined by size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), as described previously (4Adams M.A. Luo Y. Hove-Jensen B. He S.M. van Staalduinen L.M. Zechel D.L. Jia Z. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1072-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PhnP activity was assayed against a panel of naturally occurring phosphodiesters and phosphoanhydrides (all obtained from Sigma), as described previously (15Kuznetsova E. Proudfoot M. Sanders S.A. Reinking J. Savchenko A. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Yakunin A.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 263-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each reaction (80 μl), containing 50 mm Tricine hydrochloride (pH 8.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm each MnCl2, NiCl2, and CoCl2, 0.25 mm substrate, and 2 μg of PhnP, was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and then stopped by the addition of 80 μl of 0.2 m CHES, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 9.0. The reactions were then incubated with 1 unit of shrimp alkaline phosphatase for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 40 μl of malachite green reagent (16Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and measurement of the absorbance at 630 nm to determine production of orthophosphate. Reactions of PhnP with bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (bpNPP), thymidine-5′-monophosphate-p-nitrophenyl ester (pNP-TMP), or 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, divalent metal (0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, or 1 mm NiCl2) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 25 °C. Release of p-nitrophenolate was monitored at 405 nm (Δϵ405 = 11,500 m−1 cm−1) on a Cary Bio-300 spectrophotometer (Varian). Phosphodiesterase activity toward 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides was measured as follows. A 400-μl solution of substrate, 1 mm MnCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), and 150 mm NaCl was reacted with 1.5 μm PhnP for 20 min and then stopped with 400 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 9.0. One unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Finally, 200 μl of malachite green reagent (16Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) was added, and free phosphate was determined colorimetrically at 630 nm using an extinction coefficient of Δϵ630 = 90,000 m−1 cm−1. Duplicate reactions containing no PhnP were performed to measure residual inorganic phosphate. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were determined by fitting the dependence of the initial reaction velocities on the substrate concentration with the Michaelis-Menten or Hill (17Vogel A. Schilling O. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10379-10386Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) equations using GraFit 6 (Erithacus Software Ltd.). The activity of PhnP and the D80A mutant was assayed with the RNaseAlert Lab Test Kit from Ambion (catalogue number 1964). RNase-free pipette tips, plasticware, and water were used for the assay. A 50-μl reaction containing 10 ng of PhnP, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm MnCl2, and RNA substrate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Control reactions contained 0.2 pg of RNase A or buffer only. Cleavage of the RNA oligonucleotide was monitored by fluorescence at λex = 490 nm and λem = 520 nm using a SpectraMax Gemini XS spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The metal content of wild type PhnP was analyzed using a Varian ICP-MS (Ultra Mass). PhnP was dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and diluted to 10 μm for analysis. Metal content was determined by comparison with standard curves of Mn2+ and Zn2+ ranging from 0 to 1000 ppm. Measurements were performed in triplicate and corrected for residual metal content by analyzing buffer alone. Metal-free “apo-PhnP” was obtained by incubation with 10 mm EDTA for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by dialysis into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Apo-PhnP was then incubated with different metal ions by the addition of 0.2 mm ZnCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, FeCl2, FeCl3, or MgCl2. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, an aliquot of each PhnP sample was added to a reaction containing 2 mm bpNPP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2, equilibrated at 25 °C (the final concentration of PhnP was 2 μm). Initial rates were measured by monitoring p-nitrophenolate production as before. PhnP reconstituted with Zn2+ was “rescued” by incubation with 10 mm EDTA a second time followed by dialysis. After incubation with 0.2 mm Mn2+ as before, PhnP (2 μm) was assayed with bpNPP. The apparent Km values (Km(app)) for Mn2+ and Ni2+ were obtained by an assay of wild type apo-PhnP or the D80A mutant with 1 mm bpNPP and various concentrations of the metal ion. The resulting curve of initial rates versus metal ion concentration was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraFit 6.0. A reaction containing 700 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm 2′,3′-cAMP, and 26 μm wild type PhnP was incubated for 7 h at 21 °C. A control reaction lacking PhnP was incubated under the same conditions. Aliquots (5 μl) of these reactions along with standards of 3′-AMP and 2′-AMP (10 mm each in the above reaction buffer lacking PhnP) were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate (5 × 20 cm, polyester-backed, with a fluorescent indicator). Once the aliquots had dried, the TLC plate was washed in MeOH, dried, and then developed in saturated ammonium sulfate (pH. 3.5), as described by Bochner (18Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing the plate again in MeOH, the dried plate was visualized under UV light (254 nm) and photographed with a standard digital camera. Diffraction data were collected as previously described (19Yakunin A.F. Proudfoot M. Kuznetsova E. Savchenko A. Brown G. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36819-36827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Initial phases were determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion at the selenium peak energy using the program autoSHARP (21Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 364: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar), and 10 of the 12 expected selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit were located. The initial model was built automatically using autoSHARP and completed manually in XFIT/XTALVEIW (22Cheary R.W. Coelho A.A. Programs XFIT and FOURYA. Engineering and Physical Research Council, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1996Google Scholar). Structure refinement was performed using REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Cryst. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar). The final model contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit, 882 water molecules, four manganese ions, two zinc ions, and two (S)-malate molecules. The amino acid sequence of E. coli PhnP shows significant homology to metal ion-dependent enzymes that comprise the β-lactamase superfamily (Fig. 1). Best homology is found with enzymes that hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds, particularly the tRNase Z endonucleases (21 and 24% sequence identity, respectively, with E. coli ZipD and B. subtilis tRNaseZ), where all residues involved in active site metal ion binding are strictly conserved (Fig. 1). Accordingly, E. coli PhnP showed high activity against the generic phosphodiesterase substrate bpNPP. The pH optimum for this reaction was 7.2 (data not shown). PhnP was inactive against the corresponding monoester, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. To identify a potential in vivo substrate, PhnP was screened for hydrolytic activity against a wide array of naturally occurring phosphodiesters and phosphoanhydrides in the presence of a mixture of metal ions (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+) (Fig. 2). Highest activity was observed with 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides, whereas virtually no activity was observed with the corresponding 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotides. The reaction with 2′,3′-nucleotides is regiospecific, with only the 3′-nucleotide product being observed by TLC (Fig. 3). The low apparent activity observed in the screen with FAD, 3′,5′-cIMP, and UDP-GlcA could not be detected by direct initial rate kinetics and is probably due to free phosphate in the substrate preparations. PhnP also did not display activity against single-stranded RNA beyond background hydrolysis (specific activity of 2.8 × 103 RFU min−1 mg−1). This was confirmed when the D80A mutant of PhnP, which is virtually inactive against bpNPP (see Table 3), afforded essentially the same low specific activity against the RNA substrate (4.2 × 103 RFU min−1 mg−1) as the wild type enzyme. This is consistent with the background hydrolysis arising from another enzyme, probably a constant, trace level of RNase in our PhnP preparations. In contrast, a positive control with RNase A showed specific activity of 2.2 × 1013 RFU min−1 mg−1 toward this single-stranded RNA substrate.FIGURE 2Screening PhnP hydrolytic activity against a series of phosphate diesters and phosphoanhydrides. PhnP (2 μg) was incubated with each substrate (0.25 mm) in the presence of a mixture of Mg2+ (5 mm), Mn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ (0.5 mm each) in pH 8.5 buffer for 20 min at 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab ICP-MS analysis of PhnP revealed nearly stoichiometric amounts of Zn2+ (1.38/monomer) and low levels of Mn2+ (0.13/monomer; Table 1). To determine which of these metals was essential for catalysis, PhnP was treated with EDTA and then dialyzed against metal free buffer. Although it was possible to reduce the Mn2+ content to background levels (as measured by ICP-MS), nearly stoichiometric amounts of Zn2+ (0.78/monomer) remained (Table 1), suggesting the presence of a high affinity Zn2+ binding site on the enzyme. The Mn2+-free form of PhnP was essentially inactive against bpNPP (Table 2), whereas incubation of PhnP with 200 μm Mn2+ or Ni2+ restored substantial activity (5000–13,000-fold). Zinc ion restored considerably less activity (∼200-fold) and in fact appeared to be inhibitory, since equimolar mixtures of Zn2+ and Mn2+ or Ni2+ likewise only restored ∼140–190-fold activity. However, substantial activity (1500-fold greater than apo-PhnP) could be restored by treating the Zn2+-reconstituted PhnP with EDTA and then reincubating with Mn2+ (Table 2). The reaction rate of apo-PhnP with bpNPP as a function of metal ion concentration affords an apparent Km value (Km(app)) of 0.13 ± 0.02 mm for Mn2+ and 0.090 ± 0.02 mm for Ni2+ (Table 3), indicating that at least one metal ion occupies a site of relatively low affinity. Further evidence for Mn2+ bound in the active site was obtained by mutating Asp80, one of the conserved metal ion ligands. The PhnP D80A mutant, in addition to being largely inactive, experienced a 100-fold increase in Km(app) for Mn2+ (13 ± 2 mm; Table 3). Consistent with this dramatically reduced affinity for the metal ion, the D80A mutant no longer co-purified with Mn2+, as indicated by ICP-MS (Table 1), whereas the amount of Zn2+ bound did not change significantly. More detailed kinetic analysis of PhnP using bpNPP as substrate and saturating metal ion concentrations confirmed that considerably greater kcat and kcat/Km values are achieved with Ni2+ and Mn2+ than with Zn2+ (Table 3). Overall, these data suggest that the binuclear active site of PhnP has greater activity with Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions and that a single Zn2+ ion is bound at a separate, high affinity site.TABLE 1ICP-MS analysis of PhnPPhnP sample[Mn2+][Zn2+]Mn2+/PhnP monomerZn2+/PhnP monomerμmμmWT as purified1.3 ± 0.1aS.D. values based on the average of three samples.13.8 ± 1.10.131.38WT EDTA-treated0.06 ± 0.017.8 ± 0.030.010.78D80ANDbNot detectable; value indistinguishable from that obtained with buffer alone.10.5 ± 0.201.05a S.D. values based on the average of three samples.b Not detectable; value indistinguishable from that obtained with buffer alone.

Open table in a new tab The initial substrate screening results were confirmed by more detailed kinetic analysis (Table 3). In the presence of saturating Mn2+ (1 mm), PhnP has greatest kcat/Km values with 2′,3′-cAMP, 2′,3′-cCMP and 2′,3′-cGMP followed by bpNPP. Analysis of the activity at low bpNPP concentrations followed by fitting of the data to the Hill equation revealed modest cooperativity (nH = 1.55 ± 0.04), similar to that observed with E. coli ZipD (nH = 1.6) (10Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This cooperativity was not observed with the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides. Very low activity was also observed with pNP-TMP (kcat/Km = 5.3 m−1 s−1), another general phosphodiesterase substrate (15Kuznetsova E. Proudfoot M. Sanders S.A. Reinking J. Savchenko A. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Yakunin A.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 263-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The greater specificity of PhnP toward the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides is manifested almost entirely by a drop in the value of Km (110–310 μm) relative to bpNPP (Km = 2.9 ± 0.5 mm), suggesting greater recognition for these substrates in the ground state (in the absence of kinetically significant enzyme-substrate intermediates). The three-dimensional structure of PhnP from E. coli K12 was determined to 1.4 Å resolution using a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The asymmetric unit of the PhnP crystal contained a dimer (see Fig. 5A). This is probably representative of the oligomeric state of PhnP in solution, as opposed to crystal packing. The PhnP monomer has a predicted molecular mass of 28.67 kDa (confirmed by MALDI-MS; data not shown), whereas PhnP eluted from a size exclusion column with an apparent molecular mass of 44.5 kDa (Fig. 4), suggesting the formation of a compact dimer in solution. Of 258 residues, molecule A contains residues 2–250, including all of the side chains, whereas molecule B contains residues 3–250. Since only the peptide backbone density was visible for residues 2 and 251 in molecule B, they were refined as alanine and glycine, respectively. There was no clear density present for the C-terminal hexahistidine tag in either of the subunits (residues 253–258). The model was refined to an R-factor of 18.6% and an Rfree value of 21.0%, with 882 molecules of water (Table 4). The model possesses excellent geometry, where 87.2% of the residues fall in the most favored regions of Ramachandran plot, 10.9% in additional allowed regions, and 1.9% in generously allowed regions. The PhnP fold belongs to the α/β class of proteins and falls into the metallo-hydrolase superfamily. The monomer core consists of two mixed β-sheets that are sandwiched between two layers of α-helices. The smaller sheet contains six strands, the first three parallel (β5–β3) and the next three antiparallel (β2, β1, and β13). The larger sheet contains seven strands, the first four of which are parallel (β12–β9); the remaining three sheets are antiparallel (β8–β6). Strands 6 and 7 are joined by a two-residue Type I′ β-hairpin, whereas strands 2 and 3 are connected by a Type II′ β-hairpin. The dimerization interface has a buried su"

Rhodocetin, a constituent of the venom of the hemorrhagic Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma), is a specific alpha2beta1 integrin antagonist. To understand its molecular mode of action, its structure was studied by crystallography. Its quaternary structure in solution was also analyzed biochemically. Two novel subunits of rhodocetin were sequenced by mass spectrometry. Their integrin binding was measured by protein interaction ELISAs. Rhodocetin is a C-type lectin-like protein (CLP) consisting of four homologous, yet distinct, subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, the latter two of which have been unknown to date. With their CLP folds and loop-swapping motifs, the subunits alpha, beta and gamma, delta form two heterodimeric pairs. Uniquely, they arrange orthogonally and shape a cruciform molecule. Bearing a single unpaired cysteine residue, rhodocetin can only form covalent supramolecular complexes with a maximum aggregation number of 2, unlike many heterodimeric CLPs. Being the first heterotetrameric CLP to be crystallized, rhodocetin provides not only the prototypic molecular structure for heterotetrameric CLPs, but also a lead structure for pharmaceutical alpha2beta1 integrin antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2035526647,"Parasitic protozoa are unable to synthesize purines de novo and must import preformed purine nucleobases or nucleosides from their hosts. Leishmania major expresses two purine nucleobase transporters, LmaNT3 and LmaNT4. Previous studies revealed that at neutral pH, LmaNT3 is a broad specificity, high affinity nucleobase transporter, whereas LmaNT4 mediates the uptake of only adenine. Because LmaNT4 is required for optimal viability of the amastigote stage of the parasite that lives within acidified phagolysomal vesicles of mammalian macrophages, the function of this permease was examined under acidic pH conditions. At acidic pH, LmaNT4 acquires the ability to transport adenine, hypoxanthine, guanine, and xanthine with Km values in the micromolar range, indicating that this transporter is activated at low pH. Thus, LmaNT4 is an acid-activated purine nucleobase transporter that functions optimally under the physiological conditions the parasite is exposed to in the macrophage phagolysosome. In contrast, LmaNT3 functions optimally at neutral pH. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments performed on LmaNT3 and LmaNT4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed substrate-induced inward directed currents at acidic pH, and application of substrates induced acidification of the oocyte cytosol. These observations imply that LmaNT3 and LmaNT4 are nucleobase/proton symporters."
https://openalex.org/W1974232675,"Processing of the 3′ terminus of tRNA in many organisms is carried out by an endoribonuclease termed RNase Z or 3′-tRNase, which cleaves after the discriminator nucleotide to allow addition of the universal -CCA sequence. In some eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the -CCA sequence is encoded in all known tRNA genes. Nevertheless, an RNase Z homologue (RNase BN) is still present, even though its action is not needed for tRNA maturation. To help identify which RNA molecules might be potential substrates for RNase BN, we carried out a detailed examination of its specificity and catalytic potential using a variety of synthetic substrates. We show here that RNase BN is active on both double- and single-stranded RNA but that duplex RNA is preferred. The enzyme displays a profound base specificity, showing no activity on runs of C residues. RNase BN is strongly inhibited by the presence of a 3′-CCA sequence or a 3′-phosphoryl group. Digestion by RNase BN leads to 3-mers as the limit products, but the rate slows on molecules shorter than 10 nucleotides in length. Most interestingly, RNase BN acts as a distributive exoribonuclease on some substrates, releasing mononucleotides and a ladder of digestion products. However, RNase BN also cleaves endonucleolytically, releasing 3′ fragments as short as 4 nucleotides. Although the presence of a 3′-phosphoryl group abolishes exoribonuclease action, it has no effect on the endoribonucleolytic cleavages. These data suggest that RNase BN may differ from other members of the RNase Z family, and they provide important information to be considered in identifying a physiological role for this enzyme.

Maturation of tRNA precursors requires the removal of 5′ and 3′ precursor-specific sequences to generate the mature, functional tRNA (1.Deutscher M.P. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.in: Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C1995: 51-65Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, archaea, and certain eubacteria, the 3′-processing step is carried out by an endoribonuclease termed RNase Z or 3′-tRNase (2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

However, in some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, removal of 3′ extra residues is catalyzed by any of a number of exoribonucleases (7.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8.Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The major determinant for which mode of 3′-processing is utilized appears to be whether or not the universal 3′-terminal CCA sequence is encoded (2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9.Schiffer S. Rösch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, for those tRNA precursors in which the CCA sequence is absent, endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase Z right after the discriminator nucleotide generates a substrate for subsequent CCA addition by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (1.Deutscher M.P. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.in: Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C1995: 51-65Google Scholar, 2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

In view of this role for RNase Z in 3′-tRNA maturation, it is surprising that E. coli, an organism in which the CCA sequence is encoded in all tRNA genes (2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), nevertheless contains an RNase Z homologue (11.Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), because its action would appear not to be necessary. In fact, the physiological function of this enzyme in E. coli remains unclear, because mutants lacking this protein have no obvious growth phenotype (12.Schilling O. Rüggeberg S. Vogel A. Rittner N. Weichert S. Schmidt S. Doig S. Franz T. Benes V. Andrews S.C. Baum M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hence, there is considerable interest in understanding the enzymatic capabilities of this enzyme.The E. coli RNase Z homologue initially was identified as a zinc phosphodiesterase (11.Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) encoded by the elaC gene (now called rbn) (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequent work showed that the protein also displayed endoribonuclease activity on certain tRNA precursors in vitro (6.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14.Schilling O. Späth B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies revealed that this protein actually is RNase BN, an enzyme originally discovered in 1983 and shown to be essential for maturation of those bacteriophage T4 tRNA precursors that lack a CCA sequence (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16.Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using synthetic mimics of these T4 tRNA precursors, RNase BN was found to remove their 3′-terminal residue as a mononucleotide to generate a substrate for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. Based on these reactions RNase BN was originally thought to be an exoribonuclease (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, subsequent work by us and others showed that it can act as an endoribonuclease on tRNA precursors (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18.Elbarbary R.A. Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). RNase BN is required for maturation of tRNA precursors in E. coli mutant strains devoid of all other 3′-tRNA maturation exoribonucleases, although it is the least efficient RNase in this regard (7.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, under normal circumstances, it is unlikely that RNase BN functions in maturation of tRNA in vivo except in phage T4-infected cells (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16.Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).To obtain additional information on what types of RNA molecules might be substrates for RNase BN and to clarify whether it is an exo- or endoribonuclease, we have carried out a detailed examination of its catalytic properties and substrate specificity. We show here that RNase BN has both exo- and endoribonuclease activity and that it can act on a wide variety of RNA substrates. These findings suggest that E. coli RNase BN may differ from other members of the RNase Z family of enzymes.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here provide important insights into the catalytic potential of the E. coli member of the RNase Z family, RNase BN. Using a variety of synthetic RNA or chromogenic substrates, we have been able to systematically analyze factors and structural determinants that affect RNase BN activity. Based on this analysis, the E. coli enzyme was found to differ in certain respects from RNase Z homologues in other organisms. Thus, Co2+ is the preferred cation, both for phosphodiesterase activity and for action on RNA. RNase BN also displays a marked base specificity, is more active on double-stranded than single-stranded RNA, and is relatively inactive on short RNAs, and its activity is severely reduced by a 3′-phosphoryl group or a 3′-CCA sequence. Most interestingly, RNase BN is both a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease, even on the same substrate. These data expand upon and clarify observations made by us and others over the years regarding the E. coli enzyme.In early work, our laboratory showed that RNase BN efficiently removed the 3′-terminal residue from tRNA-CA and tRNA-CU but was essentially inactive on tRNA-CC (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This high degree of specificity on the tRNA substrates can now be understood in the context of the inability of the enzyme to remove even a single C residue from a C17 substrate. Based on the tRNA data, just two C residues at the 3′ end apparently are sufficient to block RNase BN action. Interestingly, the removal of the terminal AMP residue from tRNA-CCA also was inefficient (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Likewise, as shown here, removal of the A residue from CCA-terminated, single- and double-stranded 17-mers was inefficient compared with trimming of the A residues following the -CCA sequence. This led to a pronounced pause at the CCA triplet and suggests that the presence of two C residues also impairs removal of the adjacent nucleotide.Exactly how two C residues or the CCA sequence act to prevent RNase Z action is not well understood. Based on the structure of Bacillus subtilis RNase Z, it was suggested that the amino group of C-74 in tRNA clashes with the loop between strands β1 and β2 (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Thermotoga maritima enzyme, which is not affected by the CCA sequence (6.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), has a much shorter loop suggesting that it may be involved in the CCA effect. Studies with the Drosophila RNase Z showed that the presence of the CCA sequence in mature tRNA reduced kcat ∼80-fold with little effect on Km compared with a tRNA precursor lacking the CCA residues (25.Zareen N. Hopkinson A. Levinger L. RNA. 2006; 12: 1104-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, other examples have been reported in which the CCA sequence can be removed by RNase Z enzymes (28.Schiffer S. Rösch S. Marchfelder A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, further studies are required to unravel the anti-determinant effect of the CCA sequence observed with certain RNase Zs.The finding that RNase BN can act on A17, A10, and U17, as well as usRNA1 of Shibata et al. (20.Shibata H.S. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5486-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), confirms and extends those authors' conclusion that the E. coli enzyme can act on unstructured RNA. Our data show that a molecule as short as A4 is a substrate for RNase BN but that the rate of digestion of molecules shorter than 10 nt slows markedly. This suggests either that short oligomers bind weakly and dissociate before catalysis can occur or that their size precludes proper placement or orientation at the catalytic site. RNase BN is a dimer, and its crystal structure (26.Kostelecky B. Pohl E. Vogel A. Schilling O. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and that of the B. subtilis enzyme (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), have indicated that an RNA substrate binds primarily to one subunit, whereas catalysis is carried out by the active site of the other subunit (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The proteins also contain an exosite or flexible arm, which is thought to bind and clamp the RNA substrate across the top surface of the protein dimer (14.Schilling O. Späth B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We speculate that shorter oligonucleotides may not be of sufficient length to be stabilized on the enzyme by the RNA binding site and the flexible arm. On the other hand, because other small molecules such as bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate and thymidine-5′-nitrophenyl phosphate are substrates for RNase BN, they must be bound with sufficient stability at the catalytic site to be acted upon. Most likely, this occurs because these substrates typically are present in the millimolar range, whereas RNA substrates are used in the micromolar range for in vitro assays. Thus, even weak binding within the catalytic site may be sufficient to allow action on the chromogenic substrates.An interesting feature of RNase BN action is its increased activity on a double-stranded substrate compared with its single-stranded counterpart. Of the model substrates examined, the most active was one with a 4-nt single-stranded 3′-overhang, although a completely double-stranded molecule also served as a substrate. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that binding to the basic patch/flexible arm favors duplex RNA but that access to the catalytic site requires a stretch of single-stranded nucleotides. This latter point is also suggested by the crystal structure of the enzyme (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consequently, the fact that a completely duplex RNA is a substrate argues that it must partially open to allow as many as 4 nt to become single-stranded. Further work will be needed to understand why duplex RNA is a preferred substrate and how RNAs interact with the flexible arm.The most important finding of our studies is that RNase BN is both a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease. Early work from our laboratory had shown that RNase BN could remove a single 3′-nucleotide from a variety of tRNA substrates (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and on that basis the enzyme was deemed to be an exoribonuclease. Subsequent work by us and others (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20.Shibata H.S. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5486-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicated that RNase BN has endoribonuclease activity, in keeping with other members of the RNase Z family. In fact, it has been suggested that the apparent exoribonuclease activity on tRNA substrates is simply a manifestation of its endoribonuclease activity cleaving after a C nucleotide (5.Redko Y. de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The data presented here clearly show that this cannot be the case and that RNase BN is also an exoribonuclease. Given its phosphodiesterase activity, its action as an exoribonuclease is not surprising. It is not yet known whether RNase BN is an atypical member of the RNase Z family or whether additional studies of other RNase Zs may unearth exoribonuclease activity among them as well. Nevertheless, it is extremely interesting to ask how an RNase can act as both an exo- and endoribonuclease.RNase BN, as all RNase Z members, belongs to the β-lactamase family of metallo-hydrolases (5.Redko Y. de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two other RNases of this family have also been shown to act as both exo- and endoribonucleases. These are RNase J from B. subtilis (31.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig. L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and CPSF-73 from mammalian cells (32.Yang X.C. Sullivan K.D. Marzluff W.F. Dominski Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), an RNase that functions in histone mRNA processing. Interestingly, each of these enzymes is a 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease, in contrast to RNase BN, which acts 3′ to 5′.Although RNase BN can act on tRNA precursors in vivo under very special conditions (absence of other tRNA processing enzymes or phage infection), the true physiological role of this enzyme in E. coli remains unclear. It has been shown that the absence of RNase BN can slightly lengthen mRNA half-life and that this effect is much more pronounced when RNase E is also missing (30.Perwez T. Kushner S.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests a role for RNase BN in mRNA decay. On the other hand, the E. coli enzyme has also been suggested to remove amino acids and the CCA terminus from aminoacyl-tRNAs (29.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar), a very unusual reaction. Clearly, much more work will be needed to determine the role(s) of RNase BN in E. coli. The studies presented here will aid in this analysis because they provide insights into the catalytic potential of RNase BN to be considered in evaluating its physiological role. These include preference for duplex RNA, inability to digest through adjacent C residues, and exoribonuclease activity. Knowledge of these catalytic properties should prove useful for identifying its in vivo substrates. Maturation of tRNA precursors requires the removal of 5′ and 3′ precursor-specific sequences to generate the mature, functional tRNA (1.Deutscher M.P. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.in: Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C1995: 51-65Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, archaea, and certain eubacteria, the 3′-processing step is carried out by an endoribonuclease termed RNase Z or 3′-tRNase (2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3.Vogel A. Schilling O. Späth B. Marchfelder A. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, removal of 3′ extra residues is catalyzed by any of a number of exoribonucleases (7.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8.Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The major determinant for which mode of 3′-processing is utilized appears to be whether or not the universal 3′-terminal CCA sequence is encoded (2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9.Schiffer S. Rösch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, for those tRNA precursors in which the CCA sequence is absent, endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase Z right after the discriminator nucleotide generates a substrate for subsequent CCA addition by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (1.Deutscher M.P. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.in: Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C1995: 51-65Google Scholar, 2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

In view of this role for RNase Z in 3′-tRNA maturation, it is surprising that E. coli, an organism in which the CCA sequence is encoded in all tRNA genes (2.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), nevertheless contains an RNase Z homologue (11.Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), because its action would appear not to be necessary. In fact, the physiological function of this enzyme in E. coli remains unclear, because mutants lacking this protein have no obvious growth phenotype (12.Schilling O. Rüggeberg S. Vogel A. Rittner N. Weichert S. Schmidt S. Doig S. Franz T. Benes V. Andrews S.C. Baum M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hence, there is considerable interest in understanding the enzymatic capabilities of this enzyme. The E. coli RNase Z homologue initially was identified as a zinc phosphodiesterase (11.Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) encoded by the elaC gene (now called rbn) (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequent work showed that the protein also displayed endoribonuclease activity on certain tRNA precursors in vitro (6.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14.Schilling O. Späth B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies revealed that this protein actually is RNase BN, an enzyme originally discovered in 1983 and shown to be essential for maturation of those bacteriophage T4 tRNA precursors that lack a CCA sequence (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16.Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using synthetic mimics of these T4 tRNA precursors, RNase BN was found to remove their 3′-terminal residue as a mononucleotide to generate a substrate for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. Based on these reactions RNase BN was originally thought to be an exoribonuclease (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, subsequent work by us and others showed that it can act as an endoribonuclease on tRNA precursors (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18.Elbarbary R.A. Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). RNase BN is required for maturation of tRNA precursors in E. coli mutant strains devoid of all other 3′-tRNA maturation exoribonucleases, although it is the least efficient RNase in this regard (7.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, under normal circumstances, it is unlikely that RNase BN functions in maturation of tRNA in vivo except in phage T4-infected cells (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16.Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To obtain additional information on what types of RNA molecules might be substrates for RNase BN and to clarify whether it is an exo- or endoribonuclease, we have carried out a detailed examination of its catalytic properties and substrate specificity. We show here that RNase BN has both exo- and endoribonuclease activity and that it can act on a wide variety of RNA substrates. These findings suggest that E. coli RNase BN may differ from other members of the RNase Z family of enzymes. DISCUSSIONThe data presented here provide important insights into the catalytic potential of the E. coli member of the RNase Z family, RNase BN. Using a variety of synthetic RNA or chromogenic substrates, we have been able to systematically analyze factors and structural determinants that affect RNase BN activity. Based on this analysis, the E. coli enzyme was found to differ in certain respects from RNase Z homologues in other organisms. Thus, Co2+ is the preferred cation, both for phosphodiesterase activity and for action on RNA. RNase BN also displays a marked base specificity, is more active on double-stranded than single-stranded RNA, and is relatively inactive on short RNAs, and its activity is severely reduced by a 3′-phosphoryl group or a 3′-CCA sequence. Most interestingly, RNase BN is both a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease, even on the same substrate. These data expand upon and clarify observations made by us and others over the years regarding the E. coli enzyme.In early work, our laboratory showed that RNase BN efficiently removed the 3′-terminal residue from tRNA-CA and tRNA-CU but was essentially inactive on tRNA-CC (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This high degree of specificity on the tRNA substrates can now be understood in the context of the inability of the enzyme to remove even a single C residue from a C17 substrate. Based on the tRNA data, just two C residues at the 3′ end apparently are sufficient to block RNase BN action. Interestingly, the removal of the terminal AMP residue from tRNA-CCA also was inefficient (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Likewise, as shown here, removal of the A residue from CCA-terminated, single- and double-stranded 17-mers was inefficient compared with trimming of the A residues following the -CCA sequence. This led to a pronounced pause at the CCA triplet and suggests that the presence of two C residues also impairs removal of the adjacent nucleotide.Exactly how two C residues or the CCA sequence act to prevent RNase Z action is not well understood. Based on the structure of Bacillus subtilis RNase Z, it was suggested that the amino group of C-74 in tRNA clashes with the loop between strands β1 and β2 (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Thermotoga maritima enzyme, which is not affected by the CCA sequence (6.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), has a much shorter loop suggesting that it may be involved in the CCA effect. Studies with the Drosophila RNase Z showed that the presence of the CCA sequence in mature tRNA reduced kcat ∼80-fold with little effect on Km compared with a tRNA precursor lacking the CCA residues (25.Zareen N. Hopkinson A. Levinger L. RNA. 2006; 12: 1104-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, other examples have been reported in which the CCA sequence can be removed by RNase Z enzymes (28.Schiffer S. Rösch S. Marchfelder A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, further studies are required to unravel the anti-determinant effect of the CCA sequence observed with certain RNase Zs.The finding that RNase BN can act on A17, A10, and U17, as well as usRNA1 of Shibata et al. (20.Shibata H.S. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5486-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), confirms and extends those authors' conclusion that the E. coli enzyme can act on unstructured RNA. Our data show that a molecule as short as A4 is a substrate for RNase BN but that the rate of digestion of molecules shorter than 10 nt slows markedly. This suggests either that short oligomers bind weakly and dissociate before catalysis can occur or that their size precludes proper placement or orientation at the catalytic site. RNase BN is a dimer, and its crystal structure (26.Kostelecky B. Pohl E. Vogel A. Schilling O. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and that of the B. subtilis enzyme (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), have indicated that an RNA substrate binds primarily to one subunit, whereas catalysis is carried out by the active site of the other subunit (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Mathy N. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The proteins also contain an exosite or flexible arm, which is thought to bind and clamp the RNA substrate across the top surface of the protein dimer (14.Schilling O. Späth B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We speculate that shorter oligonucleotides may not be of sufficient length to be stabilized on the enzyme by the RNA binding site and the flexible arm. On the other hand, because other small molecules such as bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate and thymidine-5′-nitrophenyl phosphate are substrates for RNase BN, they must be bound with sufficient stability at the catalytic site to be acted upon. Most likely, this occurs because these substrates typically are present in the millimolar range, whereas RNA substrates are used in the micromolar range for in vitro assays. Thus, even weak binding within the catalytic site may be sufficient to allow action on the chromogenic substrates.An interesting feature of RNase BN action is its increased activity on a double-stranded substrate compared with its single-stranded counterpart. Of the model substrates examined, the most active was one with a 4-nt single-stranded 3′-overhang, although a completely double-stranded molecule also served as a substrate. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that binding to the basic patch/flexible arm favors duplex RNA but that access to the catalytic site requires a stretch of single-stranded nucleotides. This latter point is also suggested by the crystal structure of the enzyme (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consequently, the fact that a completely duplex RNA is a substrate argues that it must partially open to allow as many as 4 nt to become single-stranded. Further work will be needed to understand why duplex RNA is a preferred substrate and how RNAs interact with the flexible arm.The most important finding of our studies is that RNase BN is both a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease. Early work from our laboratory had shown that RNase BN could remove a single 3′-nucleotide from a variety of tRNA substrates (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and on that basis the enzyme was deemed to be an exoribonuclease. Subsequent work by us and others (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20.Shibata H.S. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5486-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicated that RNase BN has endoribonuclease activity, in keeping with other members of the RNase Z family. In fact, it has been suggested that the apparent exoribonuclease activity on tRNA substrates is simply a manifestation of its endoribonuclease activity cleaving after a C nucleotide (5.Redko Y. de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The data presented here clearly show that this cannot be the case and that RNase BN is also an exoribonuclease. Given its phosphodiesterase activity, its action as an exoribonuclease is not surprising. It is not yet known whether RNase BN is an atypical member of the RNase Z family or whether additional studies of other RNase Zs may unearth exoribonuclease activity among them as well. Nevertheless, it is extremely interesting to ask how an RNase can act as both an exo- and endoribonuclease.RNase BN, as all RNase Z members, belongs to the β-lactamase family of metallo-hydrolases (5.Redko Y. de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two other RNases of this family have also been shown to act as both exo- and endoribonucleases. These are RNase J from B. subtilis (31.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig. L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and CPSF-73 from mammalian cells (32.Yang X.C. Sullivan K.D. Marzluff W.F. Dominski Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), an RNase that functions in histone mRNA processing. Interestingly, each of these enzymes is a 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease, in contrast to RNase BN, which acts 3′ to 5′.Although RNase BN can act on tRNA precursors in vivo under very special conditions (absence of other tRNA processing enzymes or phage infection), the true physiological role of this enzyme in E. coli remains unclear.

On the other hand, the E. coli enzyme has also been suggested to remove amino acids and the CCA terminus from aminoacyl-tRNAs (29.Takaku H. Nashimoto M.

Of the model substrates examined, the most active was one with a 4-nt single-stranded 3′-overhang, although a completely double-stranded molecule also served as a substrate. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that binding to the basic patch/flexible arm favors duplex RNA but that access to the catalytic site requires a stretch of single-stranded nucleotides. This latter point is also suggested by the crystal structure of the enzyme (24.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consequently, the fact that a completely duplex RNA is a substrate argues that it must partially open to allow as many as 4 nt to become single-stranded. Further work will be needed to understand why duplex RNA is a preferred substrate and how RNAs interact with the flexible arm. The most important finding of our studies is that RNase BN is both a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease. Early work from our laboratory had shown that RNase BN could remove a single 3′-nucleotide from a variety of tRNA substrates (15.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and on that basis the enzyme was deemed to be an exoribonuclease. Subsequent work by us and others (13.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20.Shibata H.S. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5486-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicated that RNase BN has endoribonuclease activity, in keeping with other members of the RNase Z family. In fact, it has been suggested that the apparent exoribonuclease activity on tRNA substrates is simply a manifestation of its endoribonuclease activity cleaving after a C nucleotide (5.Redko Y. de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The data presented here clearly show that this cannot be the case and that RNase BN is also an exoribonuclease. Given its phosphodiesterase activity, its action as an exoribonuclease is not surprising. It is not yet known whether RNase BN is an atypical member of the RNase Z family or whether additional studies of other RNase Zs may unearth exoribonuclease activity among them as well. Nevertheless, it is extremely interesting to ask how an RNase can act as both an exo- and endoribonuclease. RNase BN, as all RNase Z members, belongs to the β-lactamase family of metallo-hydrolases (5.Redko Y. de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two other RNases of this family have also been shown to act as both exo- and endoribonucleases. These are RNase J from B. subtilis (31.de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig. L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and CPSF-73 from mammalian cells (32.Yang X.C. Sullivan K.D. Marzluff W.F. Dominski Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), an RNase that functions in histone mRNA processing. Interestingly, each of these enzymes is a 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease, in contrast to RNase BN, which acts 3′ to 5′. Although RNase BN can act on tRNA precursors in vivo under very special conditions (absence of other tRNA processing enzymes or phage infection), the true physiological role of this enzyme in E. coli remains unclear. It has been shown that the absence of RNase BN can slightly lengthen mRNA half-life and that this effect is much more pronounced when RNase E is also missing (30.Perwez T. Kushner S.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests a role for RNase BN in mRNA decay. On the other hand, the E. coli enzyme has also been suggested to remove amino acids and the CCA terminus from aminoacyl-tRNAs (29.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar), a very unusual reaction. Clearly, much more work will be needed to determine the role(s) of RNase BN in E. coli. The studies presented here will aid in this analysis because they provide insights into the catalytic potential of RNase BN to be considered in evaluating its physiological role. These include preference for duplex RNA, inability to digest through adjacent C residues, and exoribonuclease activity. Knowledge of these catalytic properties should prove useful for identifying its in vivo substrates. We thank Dr. Helen A. Vincent and Dr. Mattias Lovgren for helpful discussions and comments.

https://openalex.org/W2004927941,"CYP4A11 transgenic mice (CYP4A11 Tg) were generated to examine in vivo regulation of the human CYP4A11 gene. Expression of CYP4A11 in mice yields liver and kidney P450 4A11 levels similar to those found in the corresponding human tissues and leads to an increased microsomal capacity for omega-hydroxylation of lauric acid. Fasted CYP4A11 Tg mice exhibit 2-3-fold increases in hepatic CYP4A11 mRNA and protein, and this response is absent in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) null mice. Dietary administration of either of the PPARalpha agonists, fenofibrate or clofibric acid, increases hepatic and renal CYP4A11 levels by 2-3-fold, and these responses were also abrogated in PPARalpha null mice. Basal liver CYP4A11 levels are reduced differentially in PPARalpha-/- females (>95%) and males (<50%) compared with PPARalpha-/+ mice. Quantitative and temporal differences in growth hormone secretion are known to alter hepatic lipid metabolism and to underlie sexually dimorphic gene expression, respectively. Continuous infusion of low levels of growth hormone reduced CYP4A11 expression by 50% in PPARalpha-proficient male and female transgenic mice. A larger decrease was observed for the expression of CYP4A11 in PPARalpha-/- CYP4A11 Tg male mice to levels similar to that of female PPARalpha-deficient mice. These results suggest that PPARalpha contributes to the maintenance of basal CYP4A11 expression and mediates CYP4A11 induction in response to fibrates or fasting. In contrast, increased exposure to growth hormone down-regulates CYP4A11 expression in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2060344007,"The x-ray crystal structure of the thiostrepton resistance RNA methyltransferase (Tsr).S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) complex was determined at 2.45-A resolution. Tsr is definitively confirmed as a Class IV methyltransferase of the SpoU family with an N-terminal ""L30-like"" putative target recognition domain. The structure and our in vitro analysis of the interaction of Tsr with its target domain from 23 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) demonstrate that the active biological unit is a Tsr homodimer. In vitro methylation assays show that Tsr activity is optimal against a 29-nucleotide hairpin rRNA though the full 58-nucleotide L11-binding domain and intact 23 S rRNA are also effective substrates. Molecular docking experiments predict that Tsr.rRNA binding is dictated entirely by the sequence and structure of the rRNA hairpin containing the A1067 target nucleotide and is most likely driven primarily by large complementary electrostatic surfaces. One L30-like domain is predicted to bind the target loop and the other is near an internal loop more distant from the target site where a nucleotide change (U1061 to A) also decreases methylation by Tsr. Furthermore, a predicted interaction with this internal loop by Tsr amino acid Phe-88 was confirmed by mutagenesis and RNA binding experiments. We therefore propose that Tsr achieves its absolute target specificity using the N-terminal domains of each monomer in combination to recognize the two distinct structural elements of the target rRNA hairpin such that both Tsr subunits contribute directly to the positioning of the target nucleotide on the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1967703545,"Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family play a pivotal role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. They are potential therapeutics to induce blood vessel formation in myocardium and skeletal muscle, when normal blood flow is compromised. Most members of the VEGF/platelet derived growth factor protein superfamily exist as covalently bound antiparallel dimers. However, the mature form of VEGF-D (VEGF-DΔNΔC) is predominantly a non-covalent dimer even though the cysteine residues (Cys-44 and Cys-53) forming the intersubunit disulfide bridges in the other members of the VEGF family are also conserved in VEGF-D. Moreover, VEGF-D bears an additional cysteine residue (Cys-25) at the subunit interface. Guided by our model of VEGF-DΔNΔC, the cysteines at the subunit interface were mutated to study the effect of these residues on the structural and functional properties of VEGF-DΔNΔC. The conserved cysteines Cys-44 and Cys-53 were found to be essential for the function of VEGF-DΔNΔC. More importantly, the substitution of the Cys-25 at the dimer interface by various amino acids improved the activity of the recombinant VEGF-DΔNΔC and increased the dimer to monomer ratio. Specifically, substitutions to hydrophobic amino acids Ile, Leu, and Val, equivalent to those found in other VEGFs, most favorably affected the activity of the recombinant VEGF-DΔNΔC. The increased activity of these mutants was mainly due to stabilization of the protein.

Their abnormal expression is found in pathological conditions such as cancer and retinopathies (1.Byrne A.M. Bouchier-Hayes D.J. Harmey J.H. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 777-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five mammalian VEGFs, VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D and placenta growth factor (PlGF), are known (2.Tammela T. Enholm B. Alitalo K. Paavonen K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) as well as Orf virus-derived VEGF-E proteins (3.Lyttle D.J. Fraser K.M. Fleming S.B. Mercer A.A. Robinson A.J. J.

Several members of the VEGF family exist as different isoforms, either as a result of the alternative splicing of their mRNAs or due to proteolytic processing. These forms vary in their specificities and affinities to three main VEGF receptors, co-receptors such as neuropilins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans and other components of the extracellular matrix, translating into different biological effects (5.Holmes D.I.

VEGFR-2 is an important receptor regulating vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It is mainly expressed on endothelial cells, but expression is also found in several other cell types (6.Shibuya M. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Mammalian VEGFR-2 ligands include VEGF-A (7.Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Böhlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar), VEGF-C (8.Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and VEGF-D (9.Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). In addition to VEGFR-2, VEGF-C and VEGF-D are ligands for VEGFR-3, which mainly mediates lymphangiogenesis in adults but also participates in the formation of blood vessels during embryogenesis (2.Tammela T. Enholm B. Alitalo K. Paavonen K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Because of their importance in angiogenesis, VEGFs have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents in different pathological conditions to improve compromised blood flow. Studies aiming at inducing angiogenesis in vivo have been performed by introducing VEGFs to tissues either directly as recombinant proteins (10.Annex B.H. Simons M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or using gene therapy vectors (11.Ylä-Herttuala S. Alitalo K. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Findings from several laboratories have shown that VEGFs have strong angiogenic activity in vivo, and they could be used for the treatment of conditions like lower limb ischemia and ischemic coronary artery disease. The short in vivo half-life of these growth factors and the requirement for sustained angiogenic stimulus makes gene therapy a preferred option. Of the VEGFs, VEGF-A and the mature form of VEGF-D (VEGF-DΔNΔC, see below) are the strongest agents to induce vascular formation (12.Rissanen T.T. Markkanen J.E. Gruchala M. Heikura T. Puranen A. Kettunen M.I. Kholová I. Kauppinen R.A. Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. Alitalo K. Ylä-Herttuala S. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 13.Rutanen J. Rissanen T.T.

Circulation. 2004; 109: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). VEGFs share structural similarity with platelet-derived growth factors. Together they are classified as the VEGF/platelet-derived growth factor family, belonging to a larger family of cystine knot growth factors. The members of this family share a cystine knot motif, which is found in many extracellular proteins and is conserved among numerous species (14.Murray-Rust J. McDonald N.Q. Blundell T.L. Hosang M. Oefner C. Winkler F. Bradshaw R.A. Structure. 1993; 1: 153-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Characteristic of the cystine knot proteins is that they contain a conserved structure of antiparallel β-sheets connected by three disulfide bonds. Typically cystine knot growth factors form dimers, which within the VEGF/platelet-derived growth factor family are often linked by intersubunit disulfide bonds. The crystal structures have been solved for VEGF-A (15.Muller Y.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. de Vos A.M.

They can be divided into their own subfamily based on sequence similarity and several characteristic features; 1) they are the only VEGFs that bind to VEGFR-3, 2) they are expressed as long precursor forms having poor receptor binding affinities, and 3) they require proteolytic processing at their N-terminal and C-terminal ends to become more active. In contrast to other members of the VEGF family, the mature, proteolytically processed ΔNΔC-forms of VEGF-C and VEGF-D exist predominantly as non-covalently bound dimers, even though they have the conserved cysteine residues that form the intersubunit disulfide bonds in other VEGFs (8.Joukov V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32127-32136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, both VEGF-C and VEGF-D also have an additional cysteine residue located at the dimer interface (8.Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N.

Mutation of this residue in VEGF-C only minimally altered the receptor binding affinity (21.Joukov V. Kumar V. Sorsa T. Arighi E. Weich H. Saksela O. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6599-6602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), but it stabilized the dimer structure (56.Anisimov A. Alitalo A. Korpisalo P. Soronen J. Kaijalainen S.

In the current study we investigated the importance of residues at the subunit interface for the function of VEGF-DΔNΔC. We built homology models of VEGF-DΔNΔC and used alanine scanning and site-specific mutagenesis as well as tested the biological activity of various mutated forms of VEGF-DΔNΔC. Our study revealed that the conserved cysteine residues (Cys-44 and Cys-53), which are known to form intersubunit disulfide bridges in other VEGFs, were essential for the activity of the recombinant VEGF-DΔNΔC. Furthermore, the monomer to dimer ratio of VEGF-DΔNΔC could be regulated by mutagenesis. In addition, it was found that replacement of the “extra” cysteine (Cys-25) by various amino acids, preferably Ile, Leu, or Val, actually enhanced the activity of VEGF-DΔNΔC. This was at least partially due to increased stability of the protein. Homology models of VEGF-DΔNΔC, consisting of residues 93–201 of the full-length VEGF-D, were constructed based on the crystal structures of VEGF-A (22.Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1FLT) and the VEGF-F VR-1 (19.Suto K. Yamazaki Y. Morita T. Mizuno H. J.

The numbering of amino acids in the models is based on the VEGF-DΔNΔC sequence (1–109). To obtain a structure-based sequence alignment, the known crystal structures of VEGF-A, VR-1, PlGF (23.Christinger H.W. Fuh G. de Vos A.M. Wiesmann C. J. Biol.

Des. 2004; 18: 401-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The sequences of VEGF-D (NCBI accession number O43915) and VEGF-C (NCBI accession number O43915 P49767) were aligned to the structure-based sequence alignment using the program MALIGN within BODIL. The alignment was manually refined at residues 75–85 (loop 3) based on visual inspection of the known crystal structures. The pairwise alignment of VEGF-DΔNΔC (residues 5–102) with VEGF-A or with VR-1 was extracted from the structure-based sequence alignment and used for homology modeling of VEGF-D. Two different models were constructed based on the VEGF-A structure (22.Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar); that is, a dimeric model of VEGF-D with 2-fold symmetry restraints and the conserved disulfide bonds and a model of VEGF-D monomer with a disulfide bond between Cys-25 and Cys-44, defined as an additional disulfide in MODELLER (25.Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Pieper U. Sali A. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2007; (Chapter 2, Unit 2.9)PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from VEGF-C, VEGF-F has the most similar amino acids at the dimer interface as VEGF-D. Therefore, an additional dimeric model of VEGF-D was constructed based on the VR-1 crystal structure (19.Suto K. Yamazaki Y. Morita T. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2126-2131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For each of the three VEGF-D models to be constructed, ensembles of 10 were generated, and the model with the lowest value of the MODELLER objective function was chosen for further analysis. The models were superimposed on the known crystal structures using the program VERTAA in BODIL. To obtain models of the different VEGF-D mutants, the amino acids in question of the VR-1-based VEGF-D model were mutated in BODIL. All constructs were subcloned into pDonr201 vector (Invitrogen) using the Gateway® Cloning System (Invitrogen) to create Entry clones. The coding sequences were amplified using PCRs that introduced flanking attB sites to the inserts as follows. The coding sequence of N-terminal FLAG-tagged VEGF-DΔNΔC was amplified from pVDApexΔNΔC vector (received as a generous gift from Dr. Marc G. Achen) by PCR using primers that introduced a His tag to the 3′-end and flanking attB sites. The VEGF-A121 insert was cloned using a stepwise elongation of sequence-PCR (26.Majumder K. Gene. 1992; 110: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) strategy from pCMVhVEGF165 plasmid. Briefly, the first PCR amplified the VEGF-A121 coding sequence and introduced a His tag to the 3′-end. This PCR product was used as the template for the second round that introduced the attB sites flanking the coding sequence. The insert encoding soluble VEGFR-2-human IgG Fc fragment fusion protein (sVEGFR2-Fc) was generated using the Gateway chimeragenesis method (27.Suzuki Y. Kagawa N. Fujino T. Sumiya T. Andoh T. Ishikawa K. Kimura R. Kemmochi K. Ohta T. Tanaka S.

Plasmids encoding mutant VEGF-DΔNΔC proteins were generated by QuikChange® (Stratagene) using the VEGF-DΔNΔC Entry clone as a template. All Entry clones were completely sequenced to verify the sequences before cloning into a pBVboostFGII expression vector using the BVboost system LR-reaction (28.Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J.

Human embryonic kidney cells (293T cells) on 6-well plates were transiently transfected using the FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) and vectors encoding the VEGF-DΔNΔC variants. The transfected 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma) at 37 °C and a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, and the culture medium was collected at 72 h. VEGF-D concentrations were measured using a VEGF-D enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems), and the expression of the VEGF-DΔNΔC variants was verified using immunoblotting with an anti-VEGF-D monoclonal antibody (MAB 286, R&D Systems). Alternatively, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce), a chemiluminescent-based detection system (SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate, Pierce) and CL-XPosure films (Thermo Scientific), or an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and NBT/BCIP (Roche Applied Science) were used for detection. Recombinant proteins were produced in recombinant baculovirus (multiplicity of infection 5)-infected High FiveTM cells (Invitrogen) in shaken cultures at 27 °C for 72 h. Proteins were purified from clarified culture media using BD Talon Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech). The resin was agitated in clarified medium for 2 h and packed into chromatography columns for washing and elution. The washing step was done with a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Recombinant proteins were eluted using 50 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Protein concentrations were measured using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), and purified proteins were analyzed both in reducing and non-reducing conditions using SDS-PAGE; the gels were stained with PAGE Blue Protein Staining solution (Fermentas). VEGF-C and sVEGFR3-Fc recombinant proteins were generous gifts from Dr. Kari Alitalo. The media of transiently transfected 293T cells were precleared using Protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Supernatants were collected and supplied with 5 μg/ml sVEGFR2-Fc recombinant protein and 0.1 μg/ml heparin (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Controls were incubated without sVEGFR2-Fc. Protein complexes were precipitated using Protein A-Sepharose and eluted by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated using SDS-PAGE and analyzed using immunoblotting with an anti-VEGF-D monoclonal antibody as above. Ba/F3-VEGFR-2 (9.Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A.

For the assays, cells were plated at 18,000 cells per well on 96-well plates in rmIL-3-free medium. Recombinant proteins or dilutions of the medium from the transfected 293T cells were added to the wells, and cell viability was quantified after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C and a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell Titer Blue Reagent (20 μl; Promega) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for two more hours. Fluorescence was read with Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Biosystems) using an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The measured fluorescence values were normalized by defining the measured maximum response as 100 and the minimum response as 0. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The relative VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 binding affinities were determined using solid phase competition assays. For the VEGFR-2 assay, 96-well plates were coated with 500 ng/ml VEGF-A121 recombinant protein and blocked with bovine serum albumin (Sigma). sVEGFR2-Fc protein, 1 μg/ml, was preincubated with a dilution series of the assayed VEGF ligands at 37 °C for 1 h. The preincubated samples were transferred onto the VEGF-A121-coated plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The amount of bound sVEGFR2-Fc was quantified using an anti-human Fc-AP (Sigma) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma) by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. The VEGFR-3 binding affinities were determined similarly, but the 96-well plates were coated with 200 ng/ml VEGF-C, and preincubations were done with 500 ng/ml sVEGFR3-Fc. To determine the IC50 values of the proteins, sigmoidal dose response curves were fitted to measured data using non-linear regression in Prism 4 (GraphPad Prism Software). Porcine Aortic Endothelial (PAE)-KDR (31.Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3545-3555PubMed Google Scholar) cells (received as generous gifts from Dr. Kari Alitalo) were cultured in F12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma), and the required selection antibiotic (400 μg/ml G418 (InvivoGen) for PAE-KDR cells and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen)) for PAE-Flt4 cells, at 37 °C and a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells were serum-starved overnight and preincubated for 5 min with 1 mm Na3VO4 in phosphate-buffered saline (Lonza). Phosphorylations were induced by adding the recombinant proteins to the cells in 5 ml of serum-free F12 nutrient mixture. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and immediately lysed using ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min), and the total protein concentrations were determined with BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific). The lysates were adjusted to the same total protein concentration, supplemented with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Pure Nitrocellulose Membrane, Bio-Rad). Phosphorylated VEGFR-2 was immunoblotted with a phospho-VEGF receptor 2 (Tyr-1175) rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling), and total VEGFR-2 was immunoblotted with a VEGF receptor 2 rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling). Phosphorylated Akt was immunoblotted with a phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (Cell Signaling) antibody, and total Akt was immunoblotted with an Akt Antibody (Cell Signaling). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce), a chemiluminescent-based detection system (SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate, Pierce), and CL-XPosure films (Thermo Scientific) were used. After the detection of phosphorylated forms, the membranes were stripped for 15 min at room temperature with Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce), and the total amount of protein was detected. Total VEGFR-3 was immunoprecipitated with a VEGFR-3 antibody (Abcam). The samples were separated using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate) and VEGFR-3 antibodies and detected using a chemiluminescent-based detection system as above. The samples of 2 μg/ml VEGF-DΔNΔC or C25L mutant were incubated in cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution) or Tris buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1 μg/ml heparin) from 0 to 48 h. Microtiter plates (96-well; Microtiter Assembly Strip, EB, Thermo Scientific) were coated overnight with 5 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibody and blocked with bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The samples and standards generated by serial dilutions of both proteins were incubated in the coated plate and detected using sVEGFR2-Fc and an anti-human Fc-AP (Sigma) similar to the affinity measurements. The percentage of remaining activity was calculated in comparison to the 0-h samples. A Miles assay (33.Miles A.A. Miles E.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1952; 118: 228-257Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar) for analysis of vascular permeability in the skin was performed as described earlier (34.Rissanen T.T. Markkanen J.E. Arve K.

Doses of 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ng of recombinant proteins (VEGF-DΔNΔC, C25L mutant, or VEGF-A121) in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were used. Homology models of human VEGF-DΔNΔC dimer were built based on the known x-ray structures of VEGF-A and the VEGF-F VR-1 to gain a better understanding of the unique architecture of the subunit interface of VEGF-D. According to the structure-based alignment of VEGF sequences (Fig. 1A), which was used for modeling, the sequence identity was 33% between VEGF-D and VEGF-A and 30% between VEGF-D and VR-1. The sequence identity was clearly lower (∼9%) at residues 75–85, where VEGF-D had two amino acids more than VEGF-A and one amino acid more than VR-1. This is likely an important region for receptor specificity (22.Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M.

The monomers of the dimeric VEGF-DΔNΔC were built up of a central four-stranded β-sheet (β1, β3, β5, and β6) and two additional short β-strands (β4 and β7) which were extensions of β3 and β6 (Fig. 1B). The segment between β1 and β3 contained a short α-helix followed by a loop and the second β-strand, β2. The VEGF-DΔNΔC homodimer was antiparallel and had an elongated shape but was flat at the central part. Two intermolecular disulfide bonds formed by the conserved Cys-44 from one monomer and Cys-53 from the other one covalently linked the model structure. In the VEGF-DΔNΔC dimer, the partially helical N terminus of one VEGF-D monomer folded on top of the other monomer. The growth factor cysteine knot (14.Murray-Rust J. McDonald N.Q. Blundell T.L.

https://openalex.org/W2003990999,"A quantitative in vivo method for detecting protein-protein interactions will enhance our understanding of protein interaction networks and facilitate affinity maturation as well as designing new interaction pairs. We have developed a novel platform, dubbed “yeast surface two-hybrid (YS2H),” to enable a quantitative measurement of pairwise protein interactions via the secretory pathway by expressing one protein (bait) anchored to the cell wall and the other (prey) in soluble form. In YS2H, the prey is released either outside of the cells or remains on the cell surface by virtue of its binding to the bait. The strength of their interaction is measured by antibody binding to the epitope tag appended to the prey or direct readout of split green fluorescence protein (GFP) complementation. When two α-helices forming coiled coils were expressed as a pair of prey and bait, the amount of the prey in complex with the bait progressively decreased as the affinity changes from 100 pm to 10 μm. With GFP complementation assay, we were able to discriminate a 6-log difference in binding affinities in the range of 100 pm to 100 μm. The affinity estimated from the level of antibody binding to fusion tags was in good agreement with that measured in solution using a surface plasmon resonance technique. In contrast, the level of GFP complementation linearly increased with the on-rate of coiled coil interactions, likely because of the irreversible nature of GFP reconstitution. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of YS2H in exploring the nature of antigen recognition by antibodies and activation allostery in integrins and in isolating heavy chain-only antibodies against botulinum neurotoxin.

Protein-protein interactions are essential to virtually every cellular process, and their understanding is of great interest in basic science as well as in the development of effective therapeutics. Existing techniques to detect and screen pairs of interacting proteins in vivo include the yeast two-hybrid system (1Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) and protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) 2The abbreviations used are: PCAprotein-fragment complementation assayYS2Hyeast surface two-hybridGFPgreen fluorescence proteinSPRsurface plasmon resonancescFvsingle chain variable fragmentseGFPenhanced GFPMFImean fluorescence intensityLFA-1lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1ICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule-1HAhigh affinityVHHvariable domain of heavy chain from heavy chain-only antibodyLClight chainBoNTBotulinum neurotoxin.

The application of protein-protein interactions that are probed with yeast two-hybrid and PCA has been focused mainly on the interactions occurring in the nucleus or cytosol. To study interactions among secretory proteins and membrane-associated proteins, a variant of yeast two-hybrid has been developed for detecting protein-protein interactions occurring in the secretory pathway (7Stagljar I.

However, most existing methods are designed to map connectivity information for pairwise interactions and are not suitable for measuring the affinity between two interacting proteins, comparing interaction strength of different pairs, or ranking multiple binders to the interaction “hub” according to their binding affinity. protein-fragment complementation assay yeast surface two-hybrid green fluorescence protein surface plasmon resonance single chain variable fragments enhanced GFP mean fluorescence intensity lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 intercellular adhesion molecule-1 high affinity variable domain of heavy chain from heavy chain-only antibody light chain Botulinum neurotoxin. Quantitative estimation of protein-protein interactions in vivo will require the amount of the complex to be directly measured or the level of reconstituted reporters to be directly proportional to the strength of the interactions. To achieve quantitative analysis of protein interactions in eukaryotic expression system, we have designed a yeast surface two-hybrid (YS2H) system that can express a pair of proteins, one protein as a fusion to a yeast cell wall protein, agglutinin, and the other in a secretory form. When two proteins interact in this system, they associate in the secretory pathway, and the prey that would otherwise be released into the media is captured on the surface by the bait. We have devised two different schemes to quantitatively estimate the affinity of two interacting molecules: flow cytometric detection of antibody binding to the epitope tags fused to the prey and the bait, and the GFP readout from the complementation of split GFP fragments fused to the prey and the bait. They are induced under a bi-directional promoter to promote a synchronized and comparable level of expression. Herein we demonstrate the quantitative nature of YS2H in predicting the affinity between two interacting proteins, particularly in the range of 100 pm to 10 μm. This feature allowed us to examine specific interactions between antigen and antibody, to identify hot spots of allosteric activation in integrins, and to isolate camelid heavy chain-only antibodies against botulinum neurotoxin as components of therapeutic agents to treat botulism (9Arnon S.S. Schechter R. Inglesby T.V. Henderson D.A. Bartlett J.G. Ascher M.S. Eitzen E. Fine A.D. Hauer J. Layton M. Lillibridge S. Osterholm M.T. O'Toole T. Parker G. Perl T.M. Russell P.K. Swerdlow D.L. Tonat K. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 285: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). With the incorporation of PCA technique into the YS2H, our system may be developed into an in vivo tool to measure the kinetics of protein-protein interactions. Potential applications of YS2H include affinity maturation of antibodies, differentiation of weak to high affinity binders to the hub protein in interaction networks, and confirmation of hypothetical interacting pairs of proteins in a high throughput manner. Plasmid pCTCON was used as a backbone for constructing the YS2H vector (see Fig. 1a). A PCR fragment containing GAL10 promoter, AGA2, eGFP gene, FLAG tag, and terminator was inserted into the pCTCON by AgeI/KpnI sites. To express prey proteins as secretory forms, AGA2 sequence under the GAL1 promoter was removed by replacing an EcoRI/BamHI fragment with the fragment consisting of a signal sequence, either that of Aga2 or α-1 mating factor, and prey. The cDNA coding for the variable domains of AL-57 was obtained from the expression plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Shimaoka at Harvard Medical School). The variable domains of TS1/22 were cloned from the hybridoma (ATCC). VH and VL cDNAs were connected with four repeats of a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser linker sequence to produce scFv. The plasmid encoding a specific pair of prey and bait proteins was introduced into yeast cells using a commercial reagent (Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit, Zymo Research). Transformed yeast cells were grown in a solid medium plate for 48 h. A mutagenesis library of LFA-1 I domain was constructed by electroporation of a mixture of a MluI/NcoI linearized vector and error-prone PCR products of the I domain (Asn-129-Thr-318) into yeast, as described previously (10Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After transformation, the yeast libraries were grown in selective dextrose liquid medium at 30 °C with shaking for 24 h and induced in selective galactose media for 24–48 h at room temperature with shaking. To construct the variable domain of heavy chain from heavy chain-only antibody (VHH) yeast library, cDNA encoding VHH library was amplified by PCR using the primers shown in supplemental Table S1, which were designed based on the primers used by Maass et al. (11Maass D.R. Sepulveda J. Pernthaner A. Shoemaker C.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2007; 324: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). VHH cDNA PCR product was first ligated into the YS2H vector using NheI/BamHI sites and then was transformed into XL1-Blue (Stratagene) by electroporation. The plasmids extracted from ∼5 × 106 colonies were transformed into EBY100 by a lithium acetate method (12Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A single colony of EBY100 from fresh plate was inoculated into 10 ml of YPDA medium and cultured at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm for 16 h. The cells were then inoculated into 100 ml of YPDA at 0.5 A600 and cultured for another 4 h until A600 reaches 2. The cells were washed twice in water and resuspended in 10.8 ml of transformation mix buffer (7.2 ml of 50% polyethylene glycol, 1.1 ml of 1 m LiAc, 1.5 ml of 2 mg/ml single strand carrier DNA, and 150 μg of library plasmid in 1.0 ml water). The mixture was then incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. After incubation, the cells were cultured into 100 ml of selective dextrose liquid medium for 24 h and induced in selective galactose medium for 24–48 h. Library construction by homologous recombination or the lithium acetate method produced a library size of 106–107. The libraries of LFA-1 I domain and VHH were sorted with anti-Myc antibody using magnetic affinity cell sorting as described previously (10Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in this study were the anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10 (ATCC), anti-FLAG, and phycoerythrin-labeled goat polyclonal anti-murine antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To measure the surface expression of specific prey and bait proteins using flow cytometry, one to five colonies from solid medium plate were inoculated together to obtain averaged values. After induction, the cells were harvested, washed in 100 μl of the labeling buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% bovine serum albumin), and then incubated with ligands at 10 μg/ml in 50 μl of the labeling buffer for 20 min with shaking at 30 °C. The cells were then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies at 5 μg/ml in 50 μl of the labeling buffer for 20 min at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were washed once in 100 μl and suspended in 100 μl of the labeling buffer for flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). For detecting TS1/22 binding (see Fig. 4b), goat polyclonal anti-murine antibody was used as a primary antibody. The I domains were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 (Invitrogen) as inclusion bodies and refolded and purified by an S75 size exclusion column connected to fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare) (10Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). AL-57 as a single-chain format (scFv AL-57) was expressed using the protocol for I domain production, except that 3 mm cystamine and 6 mm cysteamine were added to the refolding buffer. Full-length BoNT/A and BoNT/B-LC encoding DNA (amino acids 1–448 of A-LC and 1–440 of B-LC) were synthesized employing codons optimal for expression in E. coli. A-LC and B-LC containing hexahistidine tags at both termini were produced using a pET14b vector. To express VHHs in soluble forms, we inserted VHH cDNA into the pET20b expression vector (Novagen). Soluble VHH was expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3, extracted by sonication, and purified using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column. Eluted VHHs were then injected into an S75 size exclusion column for further purification. A protein-coupled or a control mock-coupled CM5 sensor chip was prepared using an amine coupling kit (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ), as described previously (10Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SPR was measured using a Biacore (BIA2000). I domains were injected over the chip in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at room temperature. VHHs were injected over the chip in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at room temperature. The chip surface was regenerated by flowing 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-glycine, pH 1.5 buffer. YS2H is built on a yeast display system (13Colby D.W. Kellogg B.A. Graff C.P. Yeung Y.A. Swers J.S.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), which expresses, under the control of the GAL1 promoter, a protein of interest as a fusion to Aga2. Aga2 connects to the β-glucan linked Aga1 to form a cell wall protein called agglutinin. To extend this methodology to the expression of a pair of proteins, we have inserted into the yeast display vector, pCTCON (13Colby D.W. Kellogg B.A. Graff C.P. Yeung Y.A. Swers J.S. Wittrup K.D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), an additional expression cassette under the GAL10 promoter (15Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). We observed comparable expression of eGFP by GAL1 and GAL10 promoters using two different plasmids that were constructed to express eGFP under either GAL1 or GAL10 promoters (data not shown). The final YS2H vector (Fig. 1a) was designed to express the bait protein under the GAL10 promoter as a fusion to Aga2 and the prey protein under the GAL1 promoter without Aga2 fusion. The signal sequence used is either that of Aga2 (for the data in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) or the α-1 mating factor (for the data in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6) (16Egel-Mitani M. Hansen M.T. Norris K. Snel L. Fiil N.P. Gene. 1988; 73: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The expression level of prey proteins with α-1 mating factor was comparable with those containing Aga2 signal sequence (data not shown). FLAG and Myc tags are fused to the C-terminal of the bait and prey proteins, respectively, and are used to examine the surface expression of the bait and the amount of the prey that is bound to the bait (Fig. 1b). To incorporate the PCA technique into the YS2H system, we inserted the sequence encoding enhanced eGFP fragments (3Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) downstream of the bait (NeGFP contains residues Val-2 to Ala-155) and the prey (CeGFP with Asp-156 to Lys-239) to monitor their interaction by GFP readout (Fig. 1c). The deletion of the secretory signal sequence of the prey and bait proteins causes this pair to express in the cytosol (Fig. 1d), which can be used to compare protein-protein interactions occurring in the secretory pathway versus cytosol.FIGURE 2Detection of coiled coil interactions by epitope expression and GFP complementation. a, a schematic diagram (adapted from the Fig. 1 by De Crescenzo et al.

The metal ion and three oxygen atoms of water molecules are depicted as spheres. The residues that coordinate to the metal ion are shown in stick models. The structures of the I domains and the complex of I domain with the ICAM-1 were modeled based on the crystal structures, as described previously (31Jin M. Andricioaei I. Springer T.A.

These coiled coils have been designed de novo to have affinities (KD) in the range of 100 pm (E5/K5) to 100 μm (E3/K3) with higher affinity for longer helices through hydrophobic interactions at the interface and electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged residues from each helix (17De Crescenzo G. Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Myc expression (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), measured by antibody binding to Myc tag) exhibited a strong correlation with the interaction affinity within the range of 100 pm to 10 μm KD for E5-K5 to E5-K3 (Figs. 2b and 3a). With GFP complementation, this correlation extended beyond 10 μm KD, and the difference between E5-K3 and E3-K3, corresponding to the affinity range of 10 μm to 100 μm, was clearly discernible (Figs. 2c and 3b). The Myc expression and GFP complementation were close to the level of background when the acid coil (K3 in Fig. 2, b and c) was deleted, indicating a lack of spontaneous complementation of the two split GFP. The level of surface expression of the bait protein measured by antibody binding to the FLAG tag was relatively invariant (Fig. 2, b and c), supporting the idea that the difference in the amount of the prey protein is solely due to the difference in its affinity to the bait. In contrast to a quantitative correlation between the strength of protein-protein interactions and GFP complementation, the acid and base coil interactions occurring in the cytosol (expression of the coils without secretory signal sequence) led to the complementation of split GFP that lacks correlation with the strength of coiled coil interactions (Figs. 2d and 3c). However, GFP complementation for these pairs was still due to specific interaction between acid and base coils, evidenced by the absence of fluorescence when the base coil was deleted from NeGFP (Fig. 2d). To investigate a potential use of YS2H for antibody discovery, we first examined whether YS2H can detect specific interactions of known pairs of antigen and antibody. As a model system, we chose a ligand-binding domain of the integrin LFA-1, known as the Inserted or I domain, and monoclonal antibodies specific to LFA-1 I domain (Fig. 4). The I domain exists in two distinct conformations that correspond to low and high affinity states to its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (Fig. 5, a and b). Although the I domain in isolation is predominantly in an inactive, low affinity conformation, the mutations that would favor the active conformation were found to induce high affinity binding of the I domain to the ICAM-1. For example, the mutations of K287C and K294C (high affinity or HA I domain) designed to stabilize by disulfide bond the position of the α7-helix into active conformation led to an increase in the affinity to ICAM-1 by 10,000-fold over the wild-type I domain (18Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The antibodies that were expressed as scFv formats include the activation-insensitive antibody (TS1/22) (19Sanchez-Madrid F. Krensky A.M. Ware C.F. Robbins E. Strominger J.L. Burakoff S.J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7489-7493Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), binding to both inactive and active I domains, and the activation-dependent antibody (AL-57) (10Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Huang L. Shimaoka M. Rondon I.J. Roy I. Chang Q. Po M. Dransfield D.T. Ladner R.C. Edge A.S. Salas A. Wood C.R. Springer T.A. Cohen E.H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which binds only to the active I domain. The interaction between antigen and antibody was measured by the detection of Myc tag fused to the antibody at the C terminus (Fig. 4). A tag-based assay was chosen instead of GFP complementation because it was found that the I domain fused to NeGFP did not express (no antibody binding to FLAG tag), presumably because of the quality control machinery in protein secretion (21Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that prohibits misfolded proteins to be secreted (data not shown). This is in contrast to the expression of split GFP with a fusion of short coils, e.g. K3-NeGFP in Fig. 2c. Therefore, it appears that when NeGFP is fused to the I domain that by itself requires proper folding for secretion, the I domain fusion to NeGFP becomes completely misfolded and does not pass the quality control for secretion. Myc tag expression in YS2H was in agreement with the specificities of monoclonal antibody AL-57 and TS1/22 against the LFA I domain; although the clones expressing TS1/22 displayed Myc expression either with the wild-type or with the HA I domains as antigens (Fig. 4b), the AL-57 clones exhibited Myc expression only with the HA I domain (Fig. 4c). Next, we examined the ability of our system in isolating activating mutations in antigens that exhibit two different activation states. With the expression of AL-57 scFv and the error-prone PCR products of the wild-type I domain in YS2H, yeast library was constructed and sorted with anti-Myc antibody using a magnetic affinity cell sorter. With successive sorting, there was a gradual increase in the percentage of the population of cells that showed Myc expression above the background level (Fig. 5c). After two rounds of sorting, the cells were plated to yield individual clones, from which four clones were sequenced and tested for Myc expression. Of the four, three contained a mutation of F265S, and one contained L295P (Fig. 5d). These two mutations belonged to a long list of activation hot spots that were identified in our previous study (10Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), where a large number of yeast cells were sorted and analyzed for their binding to exogenous AL-57 or ICAM-1-Fcγ. The mutations of L295P and F265S were previously found to contribute to an increase in the binding of the I domain to ICAM-1 at 6 and 152%, respectively, of the HA I domain binding to ICAM-1 (10Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To directly measure the affinity of scFv AL-57 to I domain variants, we used a SPR technique (Fig. 5, e and f). A first order Langmuir adsorption equation was fitted to the sensograms to obtain the kinetic and equilibrium binding constants. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of L295P and F265S to scFv AL-57 were 243 and 15.7 nm, respectively, in agreement with higher Myc expression with F265S in our system. AL-57 binding to the LFA-1 I domain depends on the presence of metal ions at the top of the I domain, known as the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (Fig. 5b) (22Shimaoka M. Kim M. Cohen E.H. Yang W.

https://openalex.org/W1968353652,"Cardiac thin filament deactivation is initiated by Ca2+ dissociation from troponin C (cTnC), followed by multiple structural changes of thin filament proteins. These structural transitions are the molecular basis underlying the thin filament regulation of cardiac relaxation, but the detailed mechanism remains elusive. In this study Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to investigate the dynamics and kinetics of the Ca2+-induced conformational changes of the cardiac thin filaments, specifically the closing of the cTnC N-domain, the cTnC-cTnI (troponin I) interaction, and the cTnI-actin interaction. The cTnC N-domain conformational change was examined by monitoring FRET between a donor (AEDANS) attached to one cysteine residue and an acceptor (DDPM) attached the other cysteine of the mutant cTnC(L13C/N51C). The cTnC-cTnI interaction was investigated by monitoring the distance changes from residue 89 of cTnC to residues 151 and 167 of cTnI, respectively. The cTnI-actin interaction was investigated by monitoring the distance changes from residues 151 and 167 of cTnI to residue 374 of actin. FRET Ca2+ titrations and stopped-flow kinetic measurements show that different thin filament structural transitions have different Ca2+ sensitivities and Ca2+ dissociation-induced kinetics. The observed structural transitions involving the regulatory region and the mobile domain of cTnI occurred at fast kinetic rates, whereas the kinetics of the structural transitions involving the cTnI inhibitory region was slow. Our results suggest that the thin filament deactivation upon Ca2+ dissociation is a two-step process. One step involves rapid binding of the mobile domain of cTnI to actin, which is kinetically coupled with the conformational change of the N-domain of cTnC and the dissociation of the regulatory region of cTnI from cTnC. The other step involves switching the inhibitory region of cTnI from interacting with cTnC to interacting with actin. The latter processes may play a key role in regulating cross-bridge kinetics."

In search of Kir2.1 modulators, we screened a library of 720 naturally occurring compounds using a yeast strain in which mammalian Kir2.1 enables growth at low [K+]. One of the identified compounds, gambogic acid (GA), potently (EC50 ≤ 100 nm) inhibited Kir2.1 channels in mammalian cells when applied chronically for 3 h. This potent and slow inhibition was not seen with Kv2.1, HERG or Kir1.1 channels. However, acutely applied GA acted as a weak (EC50 = ∼10 μm) non-selective K+ channel blocker. Intracellular delivery of GA via a patch pipette did not potentiate the acute effect of GA on Kir2.1, showing that slow uptake is not responsible for the delayed, potent effect.

Similarly, immunostaining of intact cells expressing Kir2.1 with an extracellular epitope tag demonstrated that GA does not affect Kir2.1 surface expression.

This approach has led to identification of inhibitors that target the K+ channel pore directly (11.Zaks-Makhina E. Kim Y. Aizenman E. Levitan E.S. Mol.

Usually, such inhibitors act rapidly and reversibly. However, a few inhibitors inhibit Kir2.1 current with chronic application for hours. Thus far, such inhibitors have been found to interfere with Kir2.1 channel trafficking to the cell surface (14.Sun H. Liu X. Xiong Q. Shikano S. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5877-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here an assay utilizing Kir2.1-dependent growth of yeast is used to identify gambogic acid (GA) as a Kir2.1 inhibitor. Functional studies in mammalian cells showed that GA acts acutely in the micromolar range as a nonselective K+ channel blocker. However, GA also acts slowly at nanomolar concentrations to abolish Kir2.1, but not Kv2.1, HERG, or Kir1.1 channel activity. The time course of this specific high affinity action does not reflect limited penetration into the cell or a change in Kir2.1 surface expression. Instead, GA causes marked partitioning of Kir2.1 into the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction, consistent with a redistribution of Kir2.1 into plasma membrane microdomains whereby its activity is silenced. Thus, GA has revealed a novel regulatory mechanism that specifically abolishes the activity of Kir2.1 inwardly rectifying channels.

HTS was performed in 96-well plates. The MicroSource Natural Products Library (Discovery Systems, Inc., Gaylordsville, CT) consists of 720 biologically active molecules extracted from microorganisms, plants, and animals. Compounds in master plates were diluted and transferred to test plates using the Biomek 2000 robot (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). 50-μl aliquots of logarithmic yeast culture with A560 = 0.05 were seeded in wells using a multichannel pipettor, and plates were incubated at 30 °C in a humidified incubator for 48 h. Spaces between wells were filled with water to prevent evaporation. The A560 of yeast cultures was measured at 10 wells/s using Victor plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plates were vortexed immediately before measurements to disperse cells. HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1, Kir1.1, or HERG channels (gifts from Dr. Min Li, the Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Jerod Denton, Vanderbilt University, and Dr. Eckhard Ficker, Case Western Reserve University) were grown in polylysine-coated plates to 80–90% confluence. Cells were loaded with 86Rb+ for 4 h by incubation with 1 μCi/ml 86RbCl (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Prior to 86Rb+ flux measurements cells were washed two times with 86Rb+-free medium. Medium aliquots were collected at 1–40-min time points, and 86Rb+ release was measured by scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). At 40 min, cells were lysed with 1% SDS and residual radioactivity in cells was determined. GA (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added after 86Rb+ loading for 1–3 h, or during last wash for chronic and acute application, respectively, and was present during efflux measurement. Kir1.1 expression was induced by adding 1 μg/ml tetracycline 12 h prior to GA treatment. Rb+ efflux via HERG channels was induced by adding 50 mm KCl to the wash solution, and medium aliquots were collected at 1, 3, and 5 min after washing. HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 channel tagged with an extracellular HA epitope were treated with 1 μm GA or vehicle (0.01% DMSO) for 3 h. Cells were washed with Hank's balanced saline solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and harvested by incubation with 0.5 mm EDTA in HBSS for 5–10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with rat anti-HA monoclonal Ab 3F10 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) diluted 1:500 on ice for 1 h. After washing twice with HBSS cells were incubated with Cy2-conjugated goat antirat Ab diluted 1:1000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 15 min on ice. After 2 washes with HBSS, fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. The percentage of fluorescent cells was analyzed using the CELLQUEST software (Becton Dickinson). Adherent cells growing on polylysine-coated cover slips were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (NGS), incubated with 3F10 Ab (1:500 in 10% NGS) followed by Cy2-conjugated secondary Ab (1:1000 in 2% NGS) for 30 min each at room temperature.

Total membranes were isolated from HEK293 cells expressing Kir2.1-HA and Kv2.1-Myc channels harvested from 3 Petri dishes (9 cm). Cells were treated with GA (1 μm) or vehicle for 3 h. Cells were suspended in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, pH7.4, protease inhibitors) and disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. After clearing by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min, membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 1 h (TLA120.2 rotor, Beckman Coulter). Membranes were resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 1% TX100 for 15 min and collected by recentrifugation at 75,000 × g. After removing the supernatant (TX100-soluble fraction), the pellet (TX100-insoluble fraction) was resuspended in equal volume of buffer A with TX100. Equal volumes of each fraction were used for immunoblot analysis. K+ currents were recorded in a whole cell configuration from HEK293 cells expressing Kir2.1 channel or CHO cells expressing Kv2.1 channel. Cells were treated with GA 1–3 h prior to experiment (chronic application); alternatively, GA was added to bath or pipette solution (acute application). The pipette solution for recording Kir2.1 current had the following composition (in mm): 140 KCl, 10 K-HEPES, 2 MgCl2, and 1 K-EGTA (pH 7.2). For recording of Kv2.1 current, this solution was supplemented with 1 mm ATP. Bath solution contained in (mm): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, pH 7.4. A library of 720 biologically active compounds extracted from microorganisms, plants, and animals was screened with our previously described procedure, which is based on functional complementation of the Δtrk1 trk2 K+ uptake defect in yeast by the mammalian Kir2.1 channel (11.Zaks-Makhina E.

Specifically, growth of yeast expressing the Kir2.1 channel in low [K+] (<2 mm) media depends on Kir2.1 activity and so can be used as a reporter of Kir2.1 pharmacological modulation. Test compounds were added to yeast cultured in 96-well plates in low [K+] medium to the final concentration of 40 μm. Fig. 1A shows that yeast failed to grow in the test well containing GA, a component of Garcinia sp. resin (Fig. 1B). In contrast, at high [K+], which supports yeast growth by nonspecific K+ uptake, GA did not affect culture growth (Fig. 1A). Thus, GA specifically inhibits K+ uptake via Kir2.1 channels. Fig. 1C shows that GA inhibited the Kir2.1-mediated yeast growth in a dose-dependent fashion with an EC50 below 1 μm. Although growth was completely abolished with 40 μm GA, this was not toxic because yeast growth in 100 mm KCl was not affected (Fig. 1C). Thus, a prolonged yeast growth assay shows that GA is a potent inhibitor of Kir2.1 channel function. To test whether GA is a Kir2.1 inhibitor in mammalian cells, we measured Kir2.1-mediated flux in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing Kir2.1, using 86Rb+ as a tracer. Because GA was originally identified in yeast as a chronically acting inhibitor, HEK293 cells were exposed to GA for 3 h prior to ion flux measurements. Fig. 2A shows that GA inhibits 86Rb+ efflux via Kir2.1 in a concentration-dependent manner with apparent EC50 in the submicromolar range, as was detected for Kir2.1-mediated yeast growth inhibition. Next, we characterized GA inhibition using the patch-clamp technique. Kir2.1 currents were recorded in whole cell configuration from HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 channel and treated with GA for 3 h (chronic application). Under these conditions, GA acted in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 27 nm to produce near complete inhibition of Kir2.1 currents at 0.5 μm (Fig. 2, B and D). Thus, GA is a very potent Kir2.1 channel inhibitor in both yeast and mammalian cells. Having established that prolonged exposure of cells to GA inhibits Kir2.1 channels, we set out to determine whether GA is effective with acute application. When GA was added to the bath solution acutely at the time of measurement, inhibition dramatically decreased: 10 μm GA only inhibited Kir2.1 current by 30% of control (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, GA is dramatically more potent when applied chronically. The difference between chronic and acute effects of GA prompted us to examine the time course of the long-term effect. Cells were pretreated with GA at maximum blocking concentration (0.5 μm) for 0–180 min, and Kir2.1 currents were measured by whole cell patch clamp. The effect 0.5 μm GA was time-dependent: 50% inhibition occurred at 15 min, whereas complete inhibition required 3 h (Fig. 3A). Inhibition by a low concentration of GA (50 nm) did not significantly increase upon more prolonged (17 h versus 3 h) incubation (Fig. 3B), indicating that inhibition plateaus at 3 h. To test whether the delayed effect of bath applied GA is caused by slow uptake, GA was added to the pipette solution and Kir2.1 currents were recorded in dialyzed cells at various times following break-in to the whole cell recording configuration. The intracellular delivery of GA at the concentration sufficient for complete inhibition in the chronic application (1 μm) did not cause noticeable Kir2.1 current reduction within 12 min (Fig. 3C). Therefore, even when uptake is not limiting, the potent effect of GA on the Kir2.1 channel is delayed. To explore the specificity of GA, we tested other K+ channels. First, voltage-activated currents were recorded in the whole cell configuration from CHO cells stably expressing Kv2.1 channel. At the highest concentration used (10 μm), GA caused 70% inhibition of Kv2.1 currents when added acutely to the bath (Fig. 4A). The effect was dose-dependent, with apparent EC50 of more than 20 μm (Fig. 4B). Moreover, under these conditions, GA slightly altered the voltage-dependence of Kv2.1 activation (Fig. 4C). However, in contrast to Kir2.1, Kv2.1 current density was not noticeably affected by chronic (3 h) application of 50 nm GA (Fig. 4D). Thus, chronic application GA was ineffective against Kv2.1. Likewise, Rb+ flux assays showed that GA does not inhibit HERG channel activity in a stable HEK293 cell line evoked by depolarization with 50 mm KCl (Fig. 5A, compare con and 5 mm KCl). HERG channels were largely insensitive to 2 h of exposure of cells to 1–5 μm GA, whereas the specific HERG inhibitor E-4031 caused strong inhibition of 86Rb+ efflux (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, Kir1.1 channel activity in a stable HEK293 cell line was completely insensitive to 2.5 μm GA after 2 h of exposure (Fig. 5, C and D). Collectively, these data show that GA is selective for Kir2.1 channel over Kir1.1, Kv2.1, and HERG channels. To test whether long-term inhibition of Kir2.1 by GA is due to impaired channel trafficking, we used a stable HEK293 cell line expressing Kir2.1 channels with an HA epitope inserted into the extracellular loop. Specifically, cells were chronically treated with GA and examined for surface expression of Kir2.1 by immunofluorescence. A 3-h exposure to 1 μm GA did not noticeably change surface expression of Kir2.1 measured by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6A) and flow cytometry (Fig. 6, B and C). Thus, inhibition of Kir2.1 by GA is not associated with impaired trafficking of the channel to the cell surface. We next hypothesized that GA inhibits Kir2.1 current by changing the plasma membrane microenvironment of the channels. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of GA on extraction of Kir2.1 and Kv2.1 with TX100, an assay routinely used for characterization of K+ channel localization to membrane microdomains. HEK293 cells expressing Kir2.1-HA or Kv2.1-Myc channel were incubated with 1 μm GA for 3 h. Following mechanical cell disruption, membranes were isolated and then incubated with 1% TX100 for 15 min on ice. TX100-soluble and TX100-insoluble membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation and distribution of K+ channel protein in the fractions was determined by immunoblotting. Fig. 7A shows that GA shifts Kir2.1 partitioning toward the TX100-soluble fraction. Quantitatively, the ratio of TX100-soluble to TX100-insoluble Kir2.1 in control cells is 2:1 whereas in GA-treated cells this ratio is 12:1. Similarly, GA shifted Kv2.1 partitioning to TX100-soluble fraction (Fig. 7B). Thus, GA may have a global effect on plasma membrane microdomains that results in specific inhibition of Kir2.1 channels. The purpose of this study was to find specific inhibitors of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir2.1. To enable HTS for K+ channel drugs, we developed an assay (11.Zaks-Makhina E. Kim Y. Aizenman E. Levitan E.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that utilizes Kir2.1-dependent yeast growth (15.Tang W. Ruknudin A. Yang W.P. Shaw S.Y. Knickerbocker A. Kurtz S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as a reporter of K+ current pharmacological modulation. Earlier, using this assay we screened 15,000 small organic molecules from unbiased libraries and identified several K+ channel modulators that act at micromolar concentrations (11.Zaks-Makhina E. Kim Y. Aizenman E. Levitan E.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Now, in search of more potent Kir2.1 modulators, we screened a library of 720 compounds extracted from plants, animals, and microorganisms. GA was identified, together with other 36 hits (or over 5% of the library), as a Kir2.1 inhibitor in the primary screen. Sequential rounds of primary hit testing at decreasing concentrations identified GA as the only inhibitor active at submicromolar concentrations. Previously, we validated this assay by finding a rapidly acting blocker of the K+ channel pore (11.Zaks-Makhina E. Kim Y. Aizenman E. Levitan E.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The discovery of GA shows that the assay is capable of identifying chronic modulators as well. K+ current measurements in mammalian cells confirmed that GA specifically inhibits Kir2.1 current. Whole cell recordings demonstrated that chronic inhibition of Kir2.1 current by GA occurs with an EC50 of 27 nm (Fig. 2). Currently, no known drug acts on Kir2.1 channel at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, GA is a relatively potent Kir2.1 inhibitor. To investigate GA selectivity, we examined its effects on three other K+ channels. Patch clamp data indicated that chronic GA application at nanomolar concentrations does not inhibit the Kv2.1 current (Fig. 4). Moreover, Rb+ flux measurements showed that 2 h of exposure to micromolar concentrations of GA has no effect on K+ flux through the HERG and Kir1.1 channels (Fig. 5). The HERG channel, which produces the cardiac IKr current, is known for its promiscuous sensitivity to drugs. The fact that HERG is insensitive to GA suggests that this drug can be used for pharmacologic separation of IK1 and IKr currents. Furthermore, these results show that GA sensitivity varies among members of the Kir family. Our results indicate two distinct mechanisms of K+ channel inhibition by GA: a slow and potent Kir2.1-specific mechanism and a fast, low affinity nonspecific effect. The latter effect suggests a shared target on the conserved pore domain. Because GA is an anionic compound, it might not be considered a traditional pore blocker. However, another compound identified by the yeast screen acts at the extracellular tetraethylammonium site despite being uncharged (11.Zaks-Makhina E. Kim Y. Aizenman E. Levitan E.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, an effect on conduction cannot be excluded. Alternatively, the low affinity nonselective effect of GA might be caused by allosteric channel closure. The high affinity, specific inhibition of Kir2.1 develops slowly. Adding GA to pipette solution, as opposed to bath solution, does not accelerate inhibition of Kir2.1 (Fig. 3). Therefore, the delayed effect of GA is not due to slow entry of the drug into cells. Long-term inhibition of K+ currents may occur at various levels of K+ channel biogenesis including transcription, translation, subunit assembly, trafficking, and recycling. However, immunoblotting showed that GA does not affect synthesis of Kir2.1 protein (Fig. 7). Similarly, GA does not affect surface expression of this channel (Fig. 6). Thus, GA-induced inhibition is not due to changes in biogenesis or trafficking to the plasma membrane. Recent observations suggest that, in addition to gating and surface expression of K+ channels, K+ conductance can be regulated by localization of K+ channels to specific microdomains of the plasma membrane. Specifically, several K+ channels dynamically associate with membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, known as lipid rafts (16.Maguy A. Hebert T.E. Nattel S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Proteins associated with lipid rafts tend to co-fractionate with membranes resistant to solubilization with TX100 (17.Lingwood D. Simons K. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, solubilization with TX100 was used to assess the effect of GA on association of Kir2.1 with distinct membrane microdomains. We found that pretreatment of HEK293 cells with GA shifts Kir2.1 and Kv2.1 channels from the TX100-insoluble to the TX100-soluble fraction (Fig. 7), suggesting a nonspecific redistribution between distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane. Moreover, because GA also decreases Kir2.1 activity, this result is consistent with Kir2.1 being physiologically active in the context of TX100-insoluble microdomains, but not of TX100-soluble microdomains. The GA physico-chemical properties are compatible with this possibility: GA is a lipophilic molecule (LogP = 6.77 by Ghose and Crippen, Ref. 18.Ghose A.K. Crippen G.M. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1987; 27: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) that can potentially insert into the lipid bilayer and thereby might perturb association of Kir2.1 with regulatory lipids and proteins that specifically facilitate the function of Kir2.1 channels. Such facilitation might be due to direct binding or by stimulating a modification of the channel. Depletion of membrane cholesterol by methyl-cyclodextrin and partitioning of K+ channels into TX100-soluble microdomains are associated with decreases in Kv1.5 (19.Martens J.R. Sakamoto N.

Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2539-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, the same treatment correlates with increased Kir2.1 conductance in transfected CHO cells and vascular endothelial cells (9.Romanenko V.G. Fang Y. Byfield F. Travis A.J. Vandenberg C.A.

The opposite relationship between Kir2.1 conductance and partitioning into membrane microdomains found with GA could reflect different mechanisms of action for GA and methyl cyclodextrin. Likewise, GA has been shown to be a novel chronic Kir2.1 inhibitor whose mechanism of action differs from other slow acting compounds that arrest Kir2.1 trafficking, including celastrol (14.Sun H. Liu X. Xiong Q. Shikano S. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5877-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), helenine, and pomiferin. 5E. S. Levitan, manuscript in preparation. GA attracted attention as a potential anticancer drug after it was identified as a potent inducer of apoptosis in cell- and enzyme-based high-throughput screening programs (23.Zhang H.Z. Kasibhatla S. Wang Y. Herich J. Guastella J. Tseng B. Drewe J. Cai S.X. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Selective induction of apoptosis by GA involves binding of the drug to transferrin receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells (24.Kasibhatla S. Jessen K.A. Maliartchouk S. Wang J.Y. English N.M. Drewe J. Qiu L. Archer S.P. Ponce A.E. Sirisoma N. Jiang S. Zhang H.Z. Gehlsen K.R. Cai S.X. Green D.R. Tseng B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12095-12100Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). GA induces apoptosis in model cancer cells (NL60 lymphocytes) with LD50 = 115 nm. Our data show that at this concentration GA may also block inwardly rectifying currents and thus adversely affect the function of excitable tissues. Therefore, use of this drug as an anticancer drug may depend on delivery methods that minimize GA acid inhibition of nervous system and cardiovascular Kir2.1 channels. We thank Drs. Min Li, Jerod Denton, and Eckhard Ficker for providing channel expressing stable cell lines."

Little is known about the molecular mechanism of Nanog function. Here we describe the role of the tryptophan repeat (WR) domain, one of the two transactivators at its C terminus, in regulating stem cell proliferation as well as pluripotency. We first created a supertransactivator, W2W3×10, by duplicating repeats W2W3 10 times and discovered that it can functionally substitute for wild type WR at sustaining pluripotency, albeit with a significantly slower cell cycle, phenocopying Nanog(9W) with the C-terminal pentapeptide (WNAAP) of WR deleted. ES cells carrying both W2W3×10 and Nanog(9W) have a longer G1 phase, a shorter S phase in cell cycle distribution and progression analysis, and a lower level of pAkt(Ser473) compared with wild type Nanog, suggesting that both mutants impact the cell cycle machinery via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Both mutants remain competent in dimerizing with Nanog but cannot form a complex with Nac1 efficiently, suggesting that WNAAP may be involved in Nac1 binding. By tagging Gal4DBD with WNAAP, we demonstrated that this pentapeptide is sufficient to confer Nac1 binding. Furthermore, we can rescue W2W3×10 by placing WNAAP at the corresponding locations. Finally, we found that Nanog and Nac1 synergistically up-regulate ERas expression and promote the proliferation of ES cells. These results suggest that Nanog interacts with Nac1 through WNAAP to regulate the cell cycle of ES cells via the ERas/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, but not pluripotency, thus decoupling cell cycle control from pluripotency.

Paradoxically, recent work from Chambers et al. (9Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A.

Through high throughput technologies, several groups have identified the downstream targets of Nanog in the genome as well as proteins with which Nanog interacts (10Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B.

Embyonic stem cells can undergo unlimited self-renewal, so that the cell cycle appears to be less controlled than the somatic ones. For example, although RB plays a key role in the progression of somatic cell cycle through its phosphorylation by cyclin D/CDK4 or cyclin D/CDK6 and subsequent release of E2F to allow the expression of downstream genes critical for the progression through the G1/S checkpoint, embryonic stem cells execute cell cycles independent of RB phosphorylation and contain only a low level of cyclin D. In addition, although the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway promotes cell cycle progression in somatic cells, extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling is dispensable for cell cycle progression in embryonic stem cells. Last, p53 is an important check point to induce cell apoptosis in somatic cells, whereas ES cells lack such a checkpoint (12Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Until now, the only known regulator controlling the cell cycle of embryonic stem cells is the phosphorylation status of Akt at Ser473, which is activated by PI3K and is not regulated by mitogen stimulation (13Jirmanova L. Afanassieff M. Gobert-Gosse S. Markossian S. Savatier P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5515-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2003; 423: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We investigated the structure-function relationship of Nanog in a series of studies. Based on these results, Nanog is divided into the N-terminal domain, DNA binding homeodomain, C-terminal domain 1, tryptophan repeat (WR) domain, and C-terminal domain 2 (CD2) (Fig. 1A). We first demonstrated that Nanog is a transcription activator possessing two strong transactivators, WR and CD2 (15Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reporter assays demonstrated that deletion of WR had little effect on transcription activity of Nanog, whereas removal of CD2 reduced its activity severely, suggesting that WR is dispensable for Nanog function (15Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Consistently, we demonstrated that CD2, apparently endowed by a few critical aromatic residues with its strong transactivation activity, is required for Nanog to mediate LIF-independent ES cell self-renewal (17Wang Z. Ma T. Chi X. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4480-4489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we recently proved that WR plays an important role in Nanog-mediated LIF-independent ES cell self-renewal despite its apparent lack of contribution to Nanog transcription activity. 3D. Pei, Y. Guo, T. Ma, J. Zhang, W. Zhou, M. Chen, G. Pan, Y. Rao, Z. Fu, and X. Chi, unpublished results. The detailed function of other domains, especially the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain 1, are largely unknown. Nac1 is a BTB domain-containing protein related to Drosophila bric-a-brac/tramtrack, which prevents inappropriate neural gene expression (18Mackler S.A. Homan Y.X. Korutla L. Conti A.C. Blendy J.A.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6210-6217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that Nac1 is a protein-interacting partner of Nanog and may participate in a regulatory network for sustaining pluripotency (20Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N.

In this report, we describe our findings that Nanog interacts with Nac1 through a pentapeptide WNAAP unit to regulate the proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells via the ERas/PI3K/Akt pathway but not pluripotency. All of the WR mutants, W2W3×10, W3W2×10, WR×2, 9W, and W2W3×10mu, were substituted for the Nanog WR domain to construct Nanog(W2W3×10), Nanog(W3W2×10), Nanog(WR×2), Nanog(9W), and Nanog(W2W3×10mu), respectively.

The final concentration of DMSO (Sigma) or LY294002 (Sigma) used in inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was 10 μm. 3 μg of pCBA-hrGFP-c-Myc-Nanog, pCBA-hrGFP-c-Myc-Zfp281, or pCBA-hrGFP-c-Myc-Nac1 together with/without 1 μg of pPyCAGIP-Nanog-FLAG, were co-transfected with 1 μg of pPyCAGIP, pPyCAGIP-Nanog-FLAG, pPyCAGIP-Nanog(WR−)-FLAG, pPyCAGIP-Nanog(W2W3×10)-FLAG, pPyCAGIP-Nanog(9W)-FLAG, pPyCAGIP-Nanog(W2W3×10mu)-FLAG, pCR3.1, pCR3.1-FLAG-Gal4DBD, pCR3.1-FLAG-Gal4DBD-WNAAP, or pCR3.1-FLAG-Gal4DBD-2xWNAAP to HEK293T cells cultured in a well of a 6-well plate by using the calcium phosphate method. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed two times with PBS buffer and lysed by 200 μl of TNE buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) plus 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Whole cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. A volume of 40 μl of cleared whole cell lysates was reserved for Western blot analysis, and the remaining supernatants were transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube containing 15 μl of anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated by TNE buffer before use. After rocking for 2 h, at 4 °C, the anti-FLAG beads were then washed five times with TNE buffer. After all of the TNE buffer was removed, the beads were boiled for 5 min in 40 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer (with 5% β-mercaptoethanol) to elute the bound antibodies and antigens. After centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants (8 μl) were detected by immunoblotting. For Western blot analysis of mouse ES cells, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS). The prepared samples were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for detection by using specific first antibody and second antibody. The antibodies we used included the following: Akt antibody (catalog number 9272; Cell Signaling), pAkt(Ser473) antibody (catalog number ab27773; Abcam), Nanog antibody (catalog number ab21603; Abcam), β-actin antibody (catalog number A2066; Sigma), FLAG antibody (catalog number 2368; Cell Signaling), c-Myc antibody (catalog number K03145R; Biodesign), alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (catalog number A3687; Sigma), and peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (catalog number 074-1506; KPL). We plated ES cells at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured them for 4 days in ES medium. The cells were trypsinized and counted with a blood count plate (sample = 6) every day. ES cells cultured in ES medium were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and treated with the ApopNexin Annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis kit (catalog number APT750; Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). ES cells cultured in ES medium were harvested, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, washed in PBS, treated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min, and analyzed by a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). ES cells with 70% confluence were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 30 min. After they were washed twice, labeled ES cells were cultured for 0, 7, and 14 h in ES medium. Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. Cell pellets were then incubated in 4 n HCl for 30 min and washed in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.5) followed by a PBS wash. Cells were then resuspended in 50 μl of PBS-TB (PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and a 1:250 dilution of anti-BrdUrd antibody (BU-33; Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes in PBS-TB, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (catalog number sc-2010; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) with a 1:100 dilution in PBS-TB, 30 mm at room temperature. Cells were again washed twice in PBS-TB and then resuspended in PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 1 μg/ml RNase A and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). CGR8 ES cells cultured in ES medium were plated in 3.5-cm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of pPyCAGIP, pPyCAGIP-Nanog, pPyCAGIP-Nanog(W2W3×10), pPyCAGIP-Nanog(W3W2×10), pPyCAGIP-Nanog(WR×2), pPyCAGIP-Nanog(9W), pPyCAGIP-Nanog(WR−), or pPyCAGIP-Nanog(W2W3×10mu) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, the cells were passaged by 1:50 and plated in new 6-cm dishes for puromycin (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen) selection. 10 days later, a single clone was picked up and expanded in a 12-well plate and then further identified by Western blot analysis and real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis. Through detection by anti-Nanog antibody and normalization by endogenous β-actin, different molecular weight and band signal could be used to discriminate expression levels of the wild type versus mutant Nanog in stable cell lines. The total Nanog mRNA level (containing both endogenous and exogenous expression) revealed by real time RT-PCR would also help for this discrimination. The positive clone was named after its transgene. For establishment of ES cell lines carrying both transgenic Nanog and Myc-Nac1, 2 μg of pCAG-IRES-Neo or pCAG-Myc-Nac1-IRES-Neo was transfected into mock or Nanog ES cells, which were then selected by both puromycin (1 mg/ml) and G418 (500 μg/ml) and identified by Western blot with anti-Nanog and anti-Myc antibody. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl, as previously described (22Pan G. Li J. Zhou Y. Zheng H. Pei D. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1730-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Real time RT-PCRs were undertaken using the real time PCR master mix (SYBR GREEN) reagent kit (TOYOBO), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed in a 15-μl total volume for 40 cycles. The primers were as follows: β-actin, forward (5′-agtgtgacgttgacatccgt-3′) and reverse (5′-tgctaggagccagagcagta-3′); nanog, forward (5′-ctcaagtcctgaggctgaca-3′) and reverse (5′-tgaaacctgtccttgagtgc-3′); pou5f1, forward (5′-ggaagccgacaacaatgagaa-3′) and reverse (5′-tcgggcacttcagaaacatg-3′); zfp42, forward (5′-cagccagaccaccatctgtc-3′) and reverse (5′-gtctccgatttgcatatctcctg-3′); lamininB1, forward (5′-ttggatagcatcaccaagtatttcc-3′) and reverse (5′-ctcgcgtgagggcagact-3′); islet-1, forward (5′-tgtggacattactccctcttacagat-3′) and reverse (5′-tgggagacatgggcgatccacc-3′); t, forward (5′-atgcggacaattcatctgctt-3′) and reverse (5′-caggcactccgaggctagac-3′); ERas, forward (5′-ccaagacgcggcaaggt-3′) and reverse (5′-cctcctgggccctctga-3′). All of the data from quantitative RT-PCR, cell number count, and cell cycle distribution were shown as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by t test. p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 was considered to indicate statistical significance. We reported previously that Nanog possesses two potent transactivation domains, WR and CD2 (15Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The WR domain, a 10-tandem pentapeptide repeat starting with a tryptophan residue, has been demonstrated to be indispensable for Nanog to mediate pluripotency (23Mullin N.P. Yates A. Rowe A.J. Nijmeijer B. Colby D. Barlow P.N. Walkinshaw M.D. Chambers I. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Levasseur D.N. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 6326-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have uncovered the mechanism of transactivity of the WR domain, based on which we designed a superactive WR mutant, W2W3×10 (Fig. 1B).3 To test the effect of this superactive mutant on ES cells, we replaced the Nanog WR domain with this mutant to construct Nanog(W2W3×10) (Fig. 1B) and transfected mouse ES cells with Nanog and Nanog(W2W3×10), respectively. After stable expression clones were selected, we verified their expression level by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D). When culturing mock, Nanog, and Nanog(W2W3×10) ES cells in the presence of LIF for 5 days, Nanog(W2W3×10) ES cells formed smaller colonies than both mock and Nanog ES cells (Fig. 1C). This phenomenon suggests that Nanog(W2W3×10) would attenuate the proliferation of ES cells. To confirm it, we counted the cell number for a continuous 4 days in the presence of LIF. The slower proliferation rate of Nanog(W2W3×10) cells was consistent with its smaller colony size (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, in order to investigate whether this proliferation decrease is caused by alteration of Nanog-mediated pluripotency, we cultured these three cell lines both in the absence and presence of LIF for 5 days. As shown in Fig. 1C, Nanog and Nanog(W2W3×10) ES cells displayed pluripotent morphology with different colony sizes, whereas mock ES cells exhibited flat morphology, dispersed growth, and other differentiated features. The pluripotent state of these ES cells was also confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of two pluripotent markers, pou5f1 and zfp42. As shown in Fig. 1F, both pou5f1 and zfp42 maintained a high level in Nanog(W2W3×10) ES cells, medium level in Nanog ES cells, and low level in mock cells when cultured without LIF. These results indicated that duplicating WTNPTWSSQT 10 times in Nanog could decouple ES cell proliferation from pluripotency. The obvious difference between W2W3×10 and wild type WR is the length of total WR domain (50 amino acids for wild type WR versus 100 amino acids for W2W3×10). To investigate whether the longer WR domain is the key to mediate slow proliferation, we established mouse ES cell lines constitutively expressing Nanog mutant containing two tandem WRs (Fig. 1B) and then confirmed the protein expressed by these cells (Fig. 1D). Both colony sizes and cell numbers (Fig. 1, C and E) clearly showed that ES cells expressing Nanog with double WR domains proliferated at a rate similar to that of mock- or wild type Nanog-expressed cell lines. When cultured in the absence of LIF, Nanog(WR×2) cells exhibited pluripotent morphology and high expressions of pluripotent markers, such as pou5f1 and zfp42, that are comparable with the cells expressing wild type Nanog (Fig. 1, C and E). These results suggest that the doubling of wild type WR length in Nanog has no effects to reduce proliferation and pluripotency. Besides the length, the major difference distinguishing W2W3×10 from wild type WR is positional alteration between WTNPT and WSSQT. To exclude the possibility that relative sequence alteration slows down ES proliferation, we made another artificial repeat W3W2×10 (Fig. 1B) to substitute wild type WR and stably transfected it into mouse ES cells. The protein level of this mutant is shown in Fig. 1D. When cultured in the presence of LIF, Nanog(W2W3×10) and Nanog(W3W2×10) cell lines proliferate indistinguishably, as indicated by both colony size (Fig. 1C) and cell number (Fig. 1E). Even in absence of LIF, these two cell lines show similar morphology (Fig. 1C) and expression level of pluripotent marker (Fig. 1F). These findings suggested that either Nanog(W2W3×10) or Nanog(W3W2×10) can slow down proliferation of ES cells without losing pluripotency. By comparing sequences among W2W3×10, W3W2×10, and WR×2, we found their major difference lay on the two pentapeptides (WNGQP and WNAAP) at the C-terminal end of WR. A previous report comparing the Nanog protein sequence in four species showed that the latter one (WNAAP) was more conserved in these two pentapeptides (25Hart A.H. Hartley L. Ibrahim M. Robb L. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), suggesting that WNAAP may play a more significant role than other repeating units. To test this possibility, we made another two Nanog mutant constructs lacking the last pentapeptides (Nanog 9W) or the entire WR domain (Nanog(WR−)) and selected their stable expression cell lines from ES cells (Fig. 1, A and B). After we confirmed their expression levels (Fig. 1D), we found that Nanog(9W) ES cells grew slowly and formed small colonies, whereas the cells expressing Nanog lacking the entire WR appeared to proliferate normally (Fig. 1, C and E). Interestingly, the proliferation rate of Nanog(9W) ES cell lines ranked between the ES cells expressing wild type Nanog and Nanog (W2W3×10) based on data on colony sizes (Fig. 1C) and cell number (Fig. 1E). These findings implicated that WNAAP but not the other nine pentapeptides of WR plays a specific role in retarded proliferation in ES cells. Furthermore, when we withdrew LIF, the Nanog(9W) ES cell line exhibited pluripotent morphology (Fig. 1C) and marker gene expressions (Fig. 1E) comparable with those of the wild type Nanog cell line, whereas ES cells expressing Nanog lacking the entire WR showed significant differentiation (Fig. 1, C and E). These data suggest that the last WNAAP has little effect on pluripotency and just regulates proliferation. Indeed, upon embryonic body (EB) formation, all ES cell lines that express mock, Nanog, Nanog(9W), and Nanog(W2W3×10) were able to express differentiation markers, such as lamininB1, islet-1, and t (representing three germ layers) and down-regulated pou5f1 (indicating pluripotency) (Fig. 1, G–K), which indicated that ES cells expressing Nanog and its mutants kept the potential to differentiate, as mock ES cells did. In fact, compared with mock ES cells, the Nanog, Nanog(9W), and Nanog(W2W3×10) cell lines actually suppressed differentiation to certain levels as evidenced by expressing higher pou5f1 and lower differentiated markers at 5 days EB (Fig. 1, G–K, EB5), illustrating indistinguishable functions among Nanog and its two mutants in preventing EB-induced differentiation. Taking all of the data together, we could conclude that the C-terminal pentapeptide of the WR domain plays a critical role in regulating ES cell proliferation, not sustaining pluripotency. The smaller colony sizes and lower cell numbers we observed in Nanog(9W) and Nanog(W2W3×10) could be due to cell apoptosis. To certainly exclude this possibility, the early stage apoptotic marker, phosphatidylserine, was measured. As shown in Fig. 2A, we did not see significant differences in apoptotic populations (Annexin+PI−) among the cell lines we had tested thus far (mock, 2.55%; Nanog, 3.67%; Nanog(9W), 1.76%; Nanog(W2W3×10), 1.32%). Thus, the attenuated proliferations of Nanog(9W) and Nanog(W2W3×10) ES cells were not contributed to by apoptosis. To further understand the apparent slowdown of growth in Nanog(9W) and Nanog(W2W3×10) cells, we analyzed the cell cycle phase distribution of the above four cell lines (Fig. 2B). Statistical analyses indicated that Nanog(W2W3×10) and Nanog(9W) ES cells have significant longer G1 phase (∼12 and ∼6%, respectively) and shorter S phase (∼12 and ∼6%, respectively) compared with Nanog or mock ES cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the longer G1 and shorter S phases for Nanog(W2W3×10) ES cells compared with those of Nanog(9W) (Fig. 2B) are quite consistent with the lower growth rate observed for Nanog(W2W3×10) ES cells. In addition to counting cell number, we also pulse-labeled four cell lines with BrdUrd and examined cell cycle progression through flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). As shown, 7 h after BrdUrd pulse labeling, cells from all four cell lines mainly accumulated at 2 n (40–45%) and 4 n (35–40%) based on DNA content, indicating that mitosis was proceeding (Fig. 2C). However, 14 h after BrdUrd pulse labeling, significant different distributions were found in Nanog(9W) and Nanog(W2W3×10) cell lines (2 n, ∼25 and ∼40%; 2–4 n, ∼25 and ∼20%; 4 n, ∼50 and ∼40%, respectively) compared with that from both mock and Nanog cell lines (2 n, ∼5%; 2–4 n, ∼30%; 4 n, ∼65%). These data suggest that cells in Nanog(9W) and Nanog(W2W3×10) undergo arrest at G1/S transition (Fig. 2C). To identify a potential mechanism associated with this cell cycle delay, we examined the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, an indicator of PI3K/Akt activity, known as an important regulatory pathway for the G1/S transition during ES cell proliferation (13Jirmanova L. Afanassieff M. Gobert-Gosse S. Markossian S. Savatier P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5515-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,14Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2003; 423: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, overexpression of Nanog in ES cells appears to have elevated Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (∼1.3-fold), whereas overexpression of Nanog (W2W3×10) or Nanog(9W) significantly reduced this phosphorylation by ∼50 or ∼75%, respectively (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the amounts of Akt expression were nearly indistinguishable in all four ES cell lines (Fig. 2D). Compared with both mock and Nanog ES cells, delayed G1/S transitions in Nanog(W2W3×10) or Nanog(9W) ES cells, corresponding to reduction of cell proliferation, was consistent with their lower phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. These results suggested that the reduction"
https://openalex.org/W2168266149,"We report a synthetic biology approach to demonstrate substrate channeling in an unusual bifunctional flavoprotein dimethylglycine oxidase. The catabolism of dimethylglycine through methyl group oxidation can potentially liberate toxic formaldehyde, a problem common to many amine oxidases and dehydrogenases. Using a novel synthetic in vivo reporter system for cellular formaldehyde, we found that the oxidation of dimethylglycine is coupled to the synthesis of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate through an unusual substrate channeling mechanism. We also showed that uncoupling of the active sites could be achieved by mutagenesis or deletion of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthase site and that this leads to accumulation of intracellular formaldehyde. Channeling occurs by nonbiased diffusion of the labile intermediate through a large solvent cavity connecting both active sites. This central ""reaction chamber"" is created by a modular protein architecture that appears primitive when compared with the sophisticated design of other paradigm substrate-channeling enzymes. The evolutionary origins of the latter were likely similar to dimethylglycine oxidase. This work demonstrates the utility of synthetic biology approaches to the study of enzyme mechanisms in vivo and points to novel channeling mechanisms that protect the cell milieu from potentially toxic reaction products."
https://openalex.org/W2070518772,"A previous bioinformatics study identified a putative PY-NLS in the yeast transcription factor Tfg2p (Suel, K. E., Gu, H., and Chook, Y. M. (2008) PLoS Biol. 6, e137). In this study, we validate Tfg2p as a Kap104p substrate and examine the energetic organization of its PY-NLS. The Tfg2p PY-NLS can target a heterologous protein into the cell nucleus through interactions with Kap104p. Surprisingly, full-length Tfg2p is still localized to the nucleus of Kap104p temperature-sensitive cells and, similarly, Tfg2p with a mutated PY-NLS is nuclear in wild-type cells. Other Karyopherinbetas (Kapbetas) such as Kap108p and Kap120p also bind Tfg2p and may import it into the nucleus. More importantly, we demonstrate that Tfg2p is retained in the nucleus through DNA binding. Mutations of DNA binding residues relieve nuclear retention and unmask the role of Kap104p in Tfg2p nuclear import. More generally, steady-state localization of a nuclear protein is dictated by its nuclear import and export activities as well as its interactions in the nucleus and the cytoplasm."

The candidate region included the amino acid sequence Met10–Thr18 and, when present, was sufficient to direct transfected EGFP-proSP-C protein chimeras to post-ER, acidic vesicular compartments within A549 lung epithelial cells. Comparative analyses reveal that the primary sequence (MESPPDY) and its position within the proSP-C NTP is 100% conserved across all species (10Fisher J.H. Shannon J.M. Hofmann T. Mason R.J. Biochim.

Subsequent to this initial report, proline-rich sequences (XPPXY) in other proteins were identified as important motifs facilitating trans-interactions with tryptophan-containing (WW domain) protein ligands (14Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. Faseb J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 15Sudol M. Hunter T.

WW domains, named for structurally homologous, highly compact (35–45 amino acids) modular domains containing a pair of conserved tryptophan residues spaced 20–22 amino acids apart, adopt an antiparallel three stranded fold capable of interacting in trans with proline-rich recognition complexes (16Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Based on their ligand predilection, WW domains fall into two major and two minor groups (15Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Major Group I members bind polypeptides with the minimal core consensus sequence X-Pro-Pro-X-Tyr (XPPXY motif). Contained within Group I are a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that include Nedd4, Nedd4-2 (= Nedd4-like or Nedd4-L), WWP1, and YAP. These members are highly evolutionarily conserved and can interact with a variety of cellular proteins, including the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), β2-adrenergic receptor, lysosome-associated transmembrane protein 5, and Commisureless (in Drosophila) suggesting a pivotal role in many diverse cellular signaling processes primarily through regulation of trafficking. For the majority of cases, the domain ligands are directly monoubiquitinated and targeted to either endosomal or degradative (lysosomal or proteasomal) compartments (17Snyder P.M. Olson D.R.

Alterations in XPPXY motif-WW domain interactions have been shown to play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of human disease. For example, inherited forms of hypertension (Liddle syndrome) in which mutations in the PY (XPPXY) motif of the β-ENaC subunit produce alterations in ENaC trafficking from the cell surface (22Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The role of Nedd4 or other Group I family members in mediating anterograde trafficking of secreted proteins is largely undefined. On the basis of our previous data and many recent proteomic studies characterizing the potential role of proline-rich motifs in protein trafficking, we hypothesized that anterograde trafficking of proSP-C21 from proximal (ER-Golgi) compartments is dependent upon the interaction of its cytosolic PY (PPDY) motif with WW domain containing proteins. In the current report, utilizing scanning alanine mutagenesis, solid phase array binding, and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that proSP-C21 interacts with two members of the Group I WW domain family, Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, via its cytosolic PY motif. Both isoforms were found to be expressed in primary human alveolar type 2 cells. In gene silencing experiments using primary human type 2 cells in culture, Nedd4-2 exerted the dominant effect on proSP-C biosynthesis. Interestingly, although Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 binding is a necessary and sufficient requirement for trafficking, this translocation does not require direct proSP-C ubiquitination. Collectively these data offer the first detailed characterization of the role of E3 family ubiquitin ligases, typically reserved for the retrograde trafficking of proteins in the endosomal and degradative pathways, as a post-translational targeting paradigm for anterograde transport of a protein that is synthesized, processed, and released by the regulated secretory pathway.

The 5′ (forward) primer was an 82-mer and contained a KpnI site (bold), a Kozak sequence, and the HA coding sequence (underlined): TAC AAG GGT ACC ATG GAC TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT GCT GAC ATG GGT AGC AAA GAG GTA CTG ATG GAG AGC. The 3′ (reverse) primer was a 21-mer that contained an XhoI site (bold): TCT AGA TGC ATG CTC GAG CG. A chimera consisting of EGFP fused to the NH2 terminus of wild-type rat SP-C (EGFP/SP-C1–194) was cloned into the EGFPC1 expression vector and has been previously characterized (9Russo S.J. Wang W.J. Lomax C. Beers M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1034-L1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this as template, EGFP-mutant SP-C chimeras containing an NH2-terminal truncation (SP-C19–194) or internal deletion (SP-CΔ10–18) were subsequently produced and characterized (8Johnson A.L.

Scanning polyalanine mutagenesis of the NH2-terminal propeptide (SP-CA11–18, SP-CA12–17, SP-CA13–16, and SP-CA16A16) shown in Fig. 1 was performed using a three-step PCR amplification and subcloning strategy with oligonucleotide sets listed in supplemental Table S1. Oligonucleotides corresponding to rat SPC codons 1–18 (both + and − strands) or 1–17 (both + and − strands) were synthesized commercially (Sigma-Genosys) A Primary Annealing Reaction was performed with 10 μm of each complementary oligonucleotide strand by boiling and subsequent slow cooling in polystyrene insulation to permit complementary annealing yielding double-stranded mutant pieces. The second step involved Primary PCR (see supplemental Table S1) to yield products containing codons 18–194 or 19–194, respectively. A Secondary PCR to join the annealed oligonucleotide and Primary PCR products was performed by complementary and overlapping pairing of the extreme 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, to yield a full-length cDNA containing the poly Ala mutations. Unique restriction sites were engineered at both the 5′ and 3′ ends to facilitate unidirectional cloning into EGFPC1 using BspEI and XhoI. Site-directed mutagenesis to substitute alanine or arginine for one or both lysine residues contained within the NH2-terminal cytosolic domain of proSP-C21 (Lys6 and Lys34) was performed using a single two primer single PCR as previously described (27Kabore A.F. Wang W.J. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

For all constructs generated, fidelity of the PCR reactions and cloning were demonstrated by automated DNA sequencing of the coding regions performed in both directions by the Core Facility in the Department of Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania. The lung epithelial cell line A549 was originally obtained through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and has been used in prior studies (9Russo S.J. Wang W.J. Lomax C.

Enriched populations of epithelial cells were prepared from second-trimester human fetal lung from the Birth Defects Laboratory in the Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington Medical Center (Seattle, WA) or from Advanced Biosciences Resources, Inc. (Alameda, CA). All tissue was obtained and handled in compliance with state and federal law, and under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Fetal lung epithelial cells were prepared and cultured on tissue culture plastic in Weymouth medium in the presence or absence of 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and 0.1 mm isobutyl methylxanthine (DCI) to induce and maintain type 2 cell differentiation as described (31Gonzales L.W.

Cells were then plated into 2 ml of Weymouth media with 10% fetal calf serum. After culture overnight to allow recovery and attachment, medium was changed to Weymouth with DCI for 4 days without serum to induce differentiation of type 2 cells. Gene silencing of Nedd4 isoforms was achieved using combinations of commercially available siRNA (Silencer®, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) for Nedd4 (siRNA no. 120777) and Nedd4-2 (siRNA no. 23570) per the manufacturer's instructions. For evaluation of protein-protein interactions, an inducible GST gene fusion system in Escherichia coli was used to express and create ligand domain specific protein fusions. The NH2 propeptide domain of wild-type (Asp2–Gln23) and polyalanine-mutagenized, PPDY-deficient (SP-CA11–18) proSP-C depicted in Fig. 1 were amplified by PCR (supplemental Table S3) and subcloned into the GST vector, pGEX-2TK (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the EcoR1 and BamH1 restriction enzyme sites in the vector. Transformed BL21 E. coli were grown to log phase and treated with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm) × 4 h. Bacteria pelleted by centrifugation were resuspended, lysed by probe sonication, and cleared by centrifugation. To screen domain-ligand interactions, solubilized E. coli lysate containing either GST-SP-C2–23 (wild type) or GST-SP-CA11–18 were diluted to ∼1 mg/ml total protein and applied directly to TranssignalTM WW Domain Array I membranes (Panomics, Inc., Freemont, CA) per manufacturer's instructions. After washing, binding signals were detected by secondary probing with anti-NPROSP-C2–9 followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase and development with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence images were viewed on an Olympus I-70 inverted fluorescence microscope using a High Q FITC filter package for EGFP (excitation, 480 nm; emission, 535/550 nm; Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Where indicated, Texas Red-tagged immunostaining of permeabilized EGFP/SP-C-transfected cells, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, was performed and visualized with a High Q TR filter (excitation, 560/555 nm; emission, 645/675 nm) as described (8Johnson A.L.

Image acquisition, processing, and overlay analysis were performed using Metamorph IMAGE1 (Molecular Devices, Inc., Downingtown, PA). Cell pellets collected by scraping and centrifugation at 300 × g were solubilized with 40 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, 190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Following centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 s to remove nuclei, proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Lysates prepared from either 35S-labeled human type 2 cells or transfected epithelial cell lines were immunoprecipitated using specific anti-GFP, -Nedd4, -NPROP-C, or -HA antiserum as previously published (8Johnson A.L.

https://openalex.org/W1999226378,"During mitosis, establishment of structurally and functionally sound bipolar spindles is necessary for maintaining the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Tumor-associated microtubule-associated protein (TMAP), also known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 2 (CKAP2), is a mitotic spindle-associated protein whose level is frequently up-regulated in various malignancies. Previous reports have suggested that TMAP is a potential regulator of mitotic spindle assembly and dynamics and that it is required for chromosome segregation to occur properly. So far, there have been no reports on how its mitosis-related functions are regulated. Here, we report that TMAP is hyper-phosphorylated at the C terminus specifically during mitosis. At least four different residues (Thr-578, Thr-596, Thr-622, and Ser-627) were responsible for the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of TMAP. Among these, Thr-622 was specifically phosphorylated by Cdk1-cyclin B1 both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, compared with the wild type, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant form of TMAP, in which Thr-622 had been replaced with an alanine (T622A), induced a significant increase in the frequency of metaphase cells with abnormal bipolar spindles, which often displayed disorganized, asymmetrical, or narrow and elongated morphologies. Formation of these abnormal bipolar spindles subsequently resulted in misalignment of metaphase chromosomes and ultimately caused a delay in the entry into anaphase. Moreover, such defects resulting from the T622A mutation were associated with a decrease in the rate of protein turnover at spindle microtubules. These findings suggest that Cdk1-cyclin B1-mediated phosphorylation of TMAP is important for and contributes to proper regulation of microtubule dynamics and establishment of functional bipolar spindles during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1984619955,"The inhibitor peptide DT-2 (YGRKKRRQRRRPPLRKKKKKH) is the most potent and selective inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) known today. DT-2 is a construct of a PKG tight binding sequence (W45, LRKKKKKH, KI = 0.8 μm) and a membrane translocating sequence (DT-6, YGRKKRRQRRRPP, KI = 1.1 μm), that combined strongly inhibits PKG catalyzed phosphorylation (KI = 12.5 nm) with ∼1000-fold selectivity toward PKG over protein kinase A, the closest relative of PKG. However, the molecular mechanism behind this inhibition is not entirely understood. Using a combination of photoaffinity labeling, stable isotope labeling, and mass spectrometry, we have located the binding sites of PKG-specific substrate and inhibitor peptides. Covalent linkage of a PKG-specific substrate analogue was localized in the catalytic core on residues 356–372, also known as the glycine-rich loop, essential for ATP binding. By analogy, the individual inhibitor peptides W45 and DT-6 were also found to cross-link near the glycine-rich loop, suggesting these are both substrate competitive inhibitors. A bifunctional photoreactive analogue of DT-2 was found to generate dimers of PKG. This cross-linking induced covalent PKG dimerization was not observed for an N-terminal deletion mutant of PKG, which lacks the dimerization domain. In addition, non-covalent mass spectrometry was used to determine binding stoichiometry and binding order of the inhibitor peptides. Dimeric PKG binds two W45 and DT-6 peptides, whereas only one DT-2 molecule was observed to bind to the dimeric PKG. Taken together, these findings imply that (i) the two individual components making up DT-2 are both targeted against the substrate-binding site and (ii) binding of a single DT-2 molecule inactivates both PKG monomers simultaneously, which is an indication that (iii) in cGMP-activated PKG the catalytic centers of both subunits may be in each other's proximity. The inhibitor peptide DT-2 (YGRKKRRQRRRPPLRKKKKKH) is the most potent and selective inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) known today. DT-2 is a construct of a PKG tight binding sequence (W45, LRKKKKKH, KI = 0.8 μm) and a membrane translocating sequence (DT-6, YGRKKRRQRRRPP, KI = 1.1 μm), that combined strongly inhibits PKG catalyzed phosphorylation (KI = 12.5 nm) with ∼1000-fold selectivity toward PKG over protein kinase A, the closest relative of PKG. However, the molecular mechanism behind this inhibition is not entirely understood. Using a combination of photoaffinity labeling, stable isotope labeling, and mass spectrometry, we have located the binding sites of PKG-specific substrate and inhibitor peptides. Covalent linkage of a PKG-specific substrate analogue was localized in the catalytic core on residues 356–372, also known as the glycine-rich loop, essential for ATP binding. By analogy, the individual inhibitor peptides W45 and DT-6 were also found to cross-link near the glycine-rich loop, suggesting these are both substrate competitive inhibitors. A bifunctional photoreactive analogue of DT-2 was found to generate dimers of PKG. This cross-linking induced covalent PKG dimerization was not observed for an N-terminal deletion mutant of PKG, which lacks the dimerization domain. In addition, non-covalent mass spectrometry was used to determine binding stoichiometry and binding order of the inhibitor peptides. Dimeric PKG binds two W45 and DT-6 peptides, whereas only one DT-2 molecule was observed to bind to the dimeric PKG. Taken together, these findings imply that (i) the two individual components making up DT-2 are both targeted against the substrate-binding site and (ii) binding of a single DT-2 molecule inactivates both PKG monomers simultaneously, which is an indication that (iii) in cGMP-activated PKG the catalytic centers of both subunits may be in each other's proximity. Among the superfamily of protein kinases the two cyclic nucleotide-regulated protein kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase, form a closely related subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases (1Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 3Taylor S.S.

Rev. 2008; 27: 331-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both proteins share several structural elements, such as the N-terminal dimerization domain, an autoinhibition site, two in-tandem cyclic nucleotide-binding sites, and a highly conserved catalytic core (Fig. 1, A and B). Despite these similarities, these two enzymes display differences, which account for their unique properties.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). From a structural point of view these cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases differ as well. The holoenzyme of PKA is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. The catalytic subunits are non-covalently attached to the regulatory subunit dimer. Upon interaction with cAMP, the catalytic subunits dissociate from the holoenzyme and are free to catalyze heterophosphorylation (Fig. 1C). The mammalian type I PKGs are homodimeric cytosolic proteins containing two identical polypeptides of ∼76 kDa. Alternative mRNA splicing produces type Iα and type Iβ PKG, which are identical proteins apart from their first ∼100 N-terminal residues (7Francis S.H. Woodford T.A. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1988; 12: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). Each PKG subunit is composed of a regulatory and a catalytic domain on a single polypeptide chain. Consequently, when cGMP activates PKG, the catalytic and regulatory components remain physically attached (Fig. 1D). Within the catalytic domain PKA and PKG share a strong primary sequence homology (8Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, these enzymes also exhibit overlapping substrate specificities, a feature that often interferes with efforts to elucidate their distinct biological pathways. Peptide substrates with a primary amino acid sequence motif RRX(S/T)X are in general recognized by both PKA and PKG (9Glass D.B. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9728-9738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides this strong overlapping substrate specificity, several studies report on subtle differences in determinants that discriminate for PKA and PKG substrate specificity (10Colbran J.L.

To specifically discriminate between PKG and PKA activity in biological assays a highly specific PKG peptide inhibitor was developed (Table 1) (17Dostmann W.R. Taylor M.S. Nickl C.K. Brayden J.E. Frank R. Tegge W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14772-14777Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This peptide, YGRKKRRQRRRPPLRKKKKKH (DT-2), is the most potent and selective PKG inhibitor known today. Recently, the validity of DT-2 as a superior inhibitor of PKG in terms of potency, selectivity, and membrane permeability has been demonstrated (18Bove P.F. Wesley U.V. Greul A.K. Hristova M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 15649-15658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The inhibitor is a construct of a substrate competitive sequence, LRKKKKKH (W45), derived from a library screen that selected for tight PKG binding sequences, with a significant specificity toward PKG over PKA, and a membrane translocating signal peptide, YGRKKRRQRRRPP (DT-6). DT-2 strongly inhibits PKG-catalyzed phosphorylation (Ki = 12.5 nm), however, the molecular nature of DT-2 inhibition is not entirely understood (25Dostmann W.R. Tegge W. Frank R. Nickl C.K. Taylor M.S. Brayden J.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because high resolution structural data are not available for PKG, one of our goals is to elucidate binding sites for PKG-specific substrates and inhibitors in more detail using a combination of mass spectrometric techniques and photoaffinity labeling. To further delineate the nature of inhibition we have developed photoaffinity analogues of DT-2 and related inhibitory peptides, as well as a high affinity peptide substrate. The method of photoaffinity labeling enables the direct probing of target proteins through a covalent bond, which is photochemically introduced between a ligand and its specific receptor (26Brunner J. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 154-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In combination with modern mass spectrometric techniques this is a powerful approach for the characterization of peptide-protein interactions (27Jahn O. Eckart K. Tezval H. Spiess J. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2004; 378: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Substrate and inhibitor peptides containing photoactivatable analogues of phenylalanine, 4-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Phe(Bz)) or 4′-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl)-l-phenylalanine (Phe(Tmd)) were synthesized and used to locate their substrate/inhibitor-binding sites on PKG. These measurements indicate that the substrate peptide resides near the glycine-rich loop within the catalytic domain and that the inhibitor peptides are directed similarly toward this substrate-binding site, thereby acting as competitive inhibitors. In addition, nanoflow electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) was performed to study the interaction between DT-2 and PKG in more detail. ESI-MS has proven to be a useful tool to analyze the non-covalent interaction of proteins with ligands, oligonucleotides, peptides, or other proteins (28Heck A.J. Van Den Heuvel R.H. Mass Spectrom.

ESI-MS confirms that PKG is primarily a homodimer and is able to bind four cGMP molecules. Binding of DT-2 was strongly enhanced in the presence of cGMP. Surprising is the observation that only one DT-2 molecule binds to dimeric PKG. The information derived from these measurements allows for molecular modeling and structural refinements of the next generation of PKG-selective inhibitors.TABLE 1Inhibition contants (KI) of PKA- or PKG-specific peptide inhibitors and the PKA/PKG specificity indexPeptideSequencePKGKiPKAKiSpecificity index (PKA/PKG)Ref.μmμmPKI(5–24)TTYDFIASGRTGRRNAIHD-NH21500.0030.0002(11Dostmann W.R.

U-13C6/15N-labeled leucine was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). This amino acid was converted into its corresponding Fmoc derivative according to the method of ten Kortenaar (43Ten Kortenaar P.B. Van Dijk B.G. Peeters J.M. Raaben B.J. Adams P.J. Tesser G.I. Int.

HPLC grade trifluoroacetic acid and 1,2-ethanedithiol were obtained from Merck (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). AMPPNP, ATP, cGMP, dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, and MgCl2 were obtained from Sigma. Sequencing grade trypsin and GluC were purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Bovine PKG type Iα was expressed in SF9 insect cells and purified to homogeneity essentially as described (17Dostmann W.R. Taylor M.S. Nickl C.K. Brayden J.E. Frank R. Tegge W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Analytical and preparative HPLC runs were performed on a Gilson HPLC workstation (Middleton, WI). As an example, the peptide acetyl-Thr-Gln-Ala-Lys-Arg-Lys-Lys- Ser-Leu(12C/14N,13C/15N)-Ala-Met-Phe(Tmd)-Leu-Arg-NH2 (W64-[Phe(Tmd14)]) was synthesized using the FastMoc protocol on a 0.25-mmol scale (44Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar). Each synthetic cycle consisted of Nα-Fmoc removal by a 10-min treatment with 20% piperidine in NMP, a 6-min NMP wash, a 45-min coupling step with 1.0 mmol of preactivated Fmoc amino acid in the presence of 2 eq of DIPEA, and a 6-min NMP wash. Nα-Fmoc amino acids were activated in situ with 1.0 mmol of HBTU/HOBt (0.36 m in NMP) in the presence of DIPEA (2.0 mmol). After the final Fmoc removal the free amine was acetylated with an excess of acetic acid anhydride/DIPEA/HOBt in NMP. Fmoc-Phe(Tmd)-OH was coupled with HATU/HOAt in an excess of only 2 eq (with respect to the loading of the resin) for 90 min. Fmoc-Leu(13C/15N)-OH was coupled in the presence of 1 equimolar equivalent of Fmoc-Leu(12C/14N)-OH with HATU/HOAt in an excess of only 2 eq for 90 min. After these coupling steps any remaining free amine functionalities were acetylated with acetic acid anhydride/DIPEA/HOBt. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and deprotected by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/1,2-ethanedithiol (95:2.5:2.5, v/v) at room temperature for 3 h. The peptide was precipitated with methyl-tert-butyl ether/hexane (1:1, v/v) at −20 °C. The precipitate was decanted and subsequently washed with cold methyl-tert-butyl ether/hexane (1:1, v/v, 3×) and finally lyophilized from tert-BuOH/H2O (1:1, v/v). The crude lyophilized peptides were dissolved in a minimum amount of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN/H2O (5:95, v/v) and loaded onto the HPLC column (Phenomenex Luna C8, 100-Å pore size, 10-μm particle size, 2.2 × 25 cm). The peptides were eluted with a flow rate of 10.0 ml/min using a linear gradient of buffer B (100% in 96 min) from 100% buffer A (buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN/H2O (5:95, v/v), buffer B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN/H2O (60:40, v/v)). To determine purity, the synthesized peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography ESI-MS using a Shimadzu LCMS-QP8000 (Duisburg, Germany) single quadrupole bench-top mass spectrometer operating in a positive ionization mode. The purified peptides were loaded onto a Phenomenex Luna C8 column (100-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size, 0.46 × 25 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of buffer B (100% in 48 min) from 100% buffer A (buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN/H2O (5:95, v/v); buffer B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN/H2O (60:40, v/v)). The mass of purified peptides was finally confirmed by ESI-MS. Upon irradiation with UV-light (∼350 nm), 4′-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl)-l-phenylalanine irreversibly generates a highly reactive singlet carbene by a photodissociative process. This intermediate can enforce hydrogen abstraction on appropriately oriented target C–H bonds within a distance ∼3 Å or less (45Ploug M. Ostergaard S. Hansen L.B. Holm A. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 46Weber P.J. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because the electrophilic nature of the carbene intermediate renders solvent O–H bonds as appropriate H-donors, the radius of the photochemical insertion reaction is limited. Specific labeling by Phe(Tmd) would therefore suggest a closer proximity between target protein and the photoprobe (45Ploug M. Ostergaard S. Hansen L.B. Holm A. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Upon excitation (∼350 nm), the 4-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine irreversibly generates a highly reactive intermediate that rapidly enforces hydrogen abstraction on appropriately oriented target C–H bonds and has a lower reactivity toward water compared with Phe(Tmd). The protein, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in a 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 50 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, 4 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 200 μm AMPPNP, was incubated with 200 μm photoaffinity label at 30 °C for 10 min in the dark. The protein photolabel mixture was illuminated at 366 nm for 15 min in a 96-well plate on ice using a Sylvania light source (F8T5/BTB). For intact protein mass measurements, the sample was dialyzed overnight against 200 mm NH4OAc and finally concentrated using an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein masses were determined by nanoflow ESI-TOF-MS on a Micromass LC-T time-of-flight instrument using homemade borosilicate nano-electrospray needles. For optimal detection of the intact PKG source, interface pressures were optimized as previously described (47Pinkse M.W. Heck A.J. Rumpel K. Pullen F. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 48Tahallah N. Pinkse M. Maier C.S. Heck A.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For the HPLC tandem MS analysis the PKG protein was digested. Prior to digestion all cysteines were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated using iodoacetamide. The protein sample was subsequently diluted 10 times with 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and spun in an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter. This step was repeated three times. Finally, either trypsin or GluC was added to a final protein:protease concentration of 20:1 by weight. The digestion mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Proteolytic peptide mixtures were analyzed using an Ultimate nano-HPLC system (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) operating essentially as described by Meiring et al. (49Meiring H.D. van der Heeft E. ten Hove G.J. de Jong A.P. J. Sep. Sci. 2002; 25: 557-568Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto a Phenomenex Aqua C18 pre-column (200-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size) at 5 μl/min in 100% solvent A (0.6% acetic acid). Subsequently, peptides were separated on an Aqua C18 nano-reversed phase column (50 μm inner diameter, 20 cm/liter) with a flow rate of 100–150 nl/min. Elution was performed using a gradient of 0–60% solvent B (80% CH3CN and 0.6% acetic acid) at 1.2% min−1. The column effluent of the nano-LC was directly infused into a Qtof-1 quadrupole time-of flight instrument (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) using in-house prepared nanospray emitters. Mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode, and argon was used as collision gas. During LC-MS runs, analysis time of cross-linked products was increased by performing peak parking essentially as described by Meiring et al. (49Meiring H.D. van der Heeft E. ten Hove G.J. de Jong A.P. J. Sep. Sci. 2002; 25: 557-568Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In short, prior to elution of an analyte of interest the column flow rate was lowered to ∼20–40 nl/min by instantaneously dropping the column pressure using an extra flow-splitter. Hereby, the elution time was broadened to more than 2 min, and this allowed sufficient time to perform a low energy collision-induced dissociation analysis. For the fragmentation of labeled peptides the quadruple mass resolution parameters were set to a relatively large mass window (∼5 m/z units) to mass select both light and heavy leucine- or arginine-labeled precursor ions. Substrate and inhibitor peptide analogues containing either 4′-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl)-l-phenylalanine or 4-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine were synthesized using standard solid phase peptide synthesis (Table 2). These two phenylalanine derivatives are commonly used as photoactivatable residues that allow for the covalent cross-linking between peptide ligands and the target protein (50Kauer J.C.

Soc. 1984; 106: 7540-7545Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The substrate peptide TQAKRKKSLAMFLR (W64), in which the serine is the phosphate acceptor site (P0), was derived from a library screen directed to identify highly PKG-specific substrates (11Dostmann W.R. Nickl C. Thiel S. Tsigelny I. Frank R. Tegge W.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 52Tegge W. Frank R. Hofmann F. Dostmann W.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10569-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This peptide with a Km of 260 nm and a PKG/PKA specificity index of 19.2 is the most selective and specific synthetic substrate for PKG known today (Table 3). A photoactivatable analogue of this substrate was designed by incorporation of either Phe(Bz) or Phe(Tmd) at the p + 4 position, replacing the original phenylalanine. This position for the photoactivatable residue was chosen for two reasons. Firstly, in this manner the bulky side chains of Phe(Bz) and Phe(Tmd) are positioned on a site where a bulky amino acid is tolerated, so negative effects due to steric hindrance are minimized. Secondly, previously it was shown that a phenylalanine at the p + 4 position has a positive effect on selectivity toward PKG and increases PKG/PKA specificity index (10Colbran J.L. Francis S.H.

Fig. 2 shows the ESI-TOF-MS spectra of PKG after cross-linking with W64-[Phe(Bz)-12)] both in absence (Fig. 2A) and presence of cGMP (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2A the abundant ion signals between m/z 5500 and 7500 correspond to a protein of 153,010, matching to dimeric apo-PKG with a calculated mass of 15"

Previous studies have found increased uptake of prenatal HIV testing with abbreviated pre-test counseling, however little is known about patient decision making, testing satisfaction and knowledge in this setting.A randomized-controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted from October 2006 through February 2008 at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), the public teaching hospital of the City and County of San Francisco. A total of 278 English- and Spanish-speaking pregnant women were randomized to receive either abbreviated or standard nurse-performed HIV test counseling at the initial prenatal visit. Patient decision making experience was compared between abbreviated versus standard HIV counseling strategies among a sample of low-income, urban, ethnically diverse prenatal patients. The primary outcome was the decisional conflict score (DCS) using O'Connor low-literacy scale and secondary outcomes included satisfaction with test decision, basic HIV knowledge and HIV testing uptake. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of 278 women--134 (48.2%) in the abbreviated arm (AA) and 144 (51.8%) in the standard arm (SA). There was no significant difference in the proportion of women with low decisional conflict (71.6% in AA vs. 76.4% in SA, p = .37), and the observed mean difference between the groups of 3.88 (95% CI: -0.65, 8.41) did not exceed the non-inferiority margin. HIV testing uptake was very high (97. 8%) and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (99.3% in AA vs. 96.5% in SA, p = .12). Likewise, there was no difference in satisfaction with testing decision (97.8% in AA vs. 99.3% in SA, p = .36). However, women in AA had significantly lower mean HIV knowledge scores (78.4%) compared to women in SA (83.7%, p<0.01).This study suggests that streamlining the pre-test counseling process, while associated with slightly lower knowledge, does not compromise patient decision making or satisfaction regarding HIV testing.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00503308."

The enzyme from Bacillus thuringiensis closely resembles the catalytic barrel of PLCδ1 (1.Heinz D.W. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 6350-6650Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It can be activated toward both PI cleavage to cIP and cIP hydrolysis to I-1-P by non-substrate phosphatidylcholine (PC) (4.Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3355-3470Google Scholar, 5.Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 100890-110097Google Scholar, 6.Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 65130-66522Google Scholar). Studies have shown that tryptophan residues in two discrete surface structural features, short helix B and a longer loop, are needed for the enzyme to bind to activating PC surfaces and for optimal catalytic activity (7.Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 119875-198670Google Scholar, 8.Feng J. Bradley W.D. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 224657-246510Google Scholar). A crystal structure (9.Shao C. Shi X. Wehbi H. Zambonelli C. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 92280-99235Google Scholar) of an interfacially impaired mutant, W47A/W242A, showed that the enzyme could form dimers with a string of tyrosine residues (Tyr246, Tyr247, Tyr248, and Tyr251), forming the hydrophobic core of this dimer interface. The W47A/W242A dimer structure could not be formed by replacing the alanine at positions 47 and 242 with the original tryptophan residues without significant conformational rearrangements of the loop and helix B residues. Fluorescence quenching experiments were consistent with dimer formation of pyrene-labeled Cys mutants placed in the vicinity of the dimer interface (9.Shao C. Shi X. Wehbi H. Zambonelli C. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 92280-99235Google Scholar). However, the hydrophobic probes introduced could drive formation of a dimer that does not occur with wild type protein and is not directly relevant to membrane binding and catalysis. phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C 1,2-cyclic inositol phosphate recombinant PI-PLC d-inositol-1-phosphate phosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine root mean standard deviation small unilamellar vesicle dihexanoyl-PC dihexanoylphosphatidic acid tesla. phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C 1,2-cyclic inositol phosphate recombinant PI-PLC d-inositol-1-phosphate phosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine root mean standard deviation small unilamellar vesicle dihexanoyl-PC dihexanoylphosphatidic acid tesla. To further explore the relevance of this surface region of the protein to PI-PLC activity, we have constructed a series of mutants converting the tyrosine residues in the W47A/W242A dimer interface to serines (Y247S/Y251S, Y246S/Y247S/Y248S, and Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S). As more tyrosines are replaced by serine, there is a decrease in catalytic activity, both phosphotransferase cleavage of PI to cIP and diacylglycerol (in a variety of assay systems) and cyclic phosphodiesterase hydrolysis of cIP to I-1-P. There is an impairment of protein binding to PC vesicles when two or more tyrosine residues are removed that correlates with reduced specific activity in assays with PI/PC vesicles. Binding of the mutant proteins to diC7PC micelles has also been examined (intrinsic fluorescence and 31P NMR methods) and provides evidence that this interaction is very different when three or four tyrosines have been replaced by serine. Crystal structures of two of the mutant enzymes, Y247S/Y251S and Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S, have been solved, and these show that the proteins are very similar to the very closely related Bacillus cereus PI-PLC (10.Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 33863-38550Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in that they fail to crystallize as dimers (presumably because helix B and Trp242 prevent close approach of two monomers (9.Shao C. Shi X. Wehbi H. Zambonelli C. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 92280-99235Google Scholar)). Their active sites also superimpose well on that of the B. cereus PI-PLC. The only difference is in the loss of Tyr side chains in the area that forms the crystallographic dimer interface in W47A/W242A. These results can be interpreted as evidence for either (i) surface-induced dimerization of the PI-PLC or (ii) identification of a very specific PC binding site on the protein. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI) from bovine liver, and the short chain lipids dihexanoyl-PC (diC6PC) and diheptanoyl-PC (diC7PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. and used without further purification. Dihexanoyl phosphatidic acid (diC6PA) was prepared from diC6PC by phospholipase D cleavage. D2O was purchased from Sigma. cIP was generated enzymatically from crude PI using PI-PLC as described previously (4.Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3355-3470Google Scholar). All other chemicals were reagent grade. Because all four Tyr residues contribute to stability of the W47A/W242A dimer, single mutations converting each one to Ser were not prepared. Instead, a minimum of two Tyr were replaced. The primers were designed for use with the Exsite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to produce the double mutants Y246S/Y248S and Y247S/Y251S. The plasmid containing the double mutant Y247S/Y251S went through another round of Exsite mutagenesis to introduce mutations replacing Tyr246 and Tyr248 (to form Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S); the gene for Y246S/Y248S was further mutated to introduce Y247S (generating Y246S/Y247S/Y248S). All mutant PI-PLC genes were sequenced to make sure the correct mutations were incorporated and that no other mutation had arisen. Recombinant wild type B. thuringiensis PI-PLC (rPI-PLC) and the tyrosine mutants overexpressed well in Escherichia coli and were purified with two chromatographic steps (elution on a Q-Sepharose fast flow column followed by a phenyl-Sepharose column) (7.Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 119875-198670Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant PI-PLC secondary structure and thermal stability as monitored by the thermal denaturation transition (Tm) were measured using an AVIV 202 CD spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric sample temperature controller as described previously (8.Feng J. Bradley W.D. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 224657-246510Google Scholar, 11.Wehbi H. Feng J. Kolbeck J. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 93740-99382Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Comparison of secondary structure for wild type and mutant PI-PLC in this solution used wavelength scans from 265 down to 195 nm with protein (0.2–0.3 mg/ml) in a 0.1-cm cell at 25 °C. Secondary structure content was estimated with CDNN (12.Böhm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 1195-1910Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 13.Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 3390-3830Crossref Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The activity of these PI-PLC mutants toward PI (typically 4–8 mm) dispersed in either Triton X-100 (1:2 PI/Triton X-100 unless otherwise noted) or in diC7PC (1:4 PI/diC7PC unless otherwise noted) micelles, PI co-sonicated with PC (3:1 PI/PC), and toward cIP in the absence or presence of 5 mm diC7PC was measured by 31P NMR spectroscopy as described previously (4.Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3355-3470Google Scholar, 7.Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 119875-198670Google Scholar). Assays (in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) were carried out at either fixed time points (picked so that <10% product was generated) or as a function of time (monitoring cIP intensity over 0.5–1 h) to estimate specific activity for the different mutants. The amount of PI-PLC used depended on whether the phosphotransferase or cyclic phosphodiesterase step was to be followed (4.Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3355-3470Google Scholar, 5.Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 100890-110097Google Scholar, 7.Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 119875-198670Google Scholar). Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of PI-PLC as a function of added diC7PC were initially carried out on a Shimadzu RF5000U spectrofluorometer, then more recently using a Fluorolog R-3 spectrofluorometer. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C with ∼2 μm protein in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and 5-nm excitation and emission slit widths. At this concentration of protein there was no detectable light scattering for any of the protein samples with PC (or diC6PA) micelles added. Changes in the fluorescence intensity were usually expressed as (I − I0)/I0, where I0 is the intensity of protein alone, and I is the intensity in the presence of an additive. A vesicle binding assay based on centrifugation to separate free and vesicle-bound protein was used to characterize the partitioning of PI-PLC to PC interfaces (11.Wehbi H. Feng J. Kolbeck J. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 93740-99382Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This assay used 10–15 μg/ml PI-PLC (ET) in 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5. The POPC SUV concentrations ranged from 0 to 2 mm. Filtrates, containing free enzyme, were lyophilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Band intensities were used to calculate the concentration of EF by comparing intensities from vesicle-containing samples to the ET value of the control. The concentration, EB, was then evaluated as ET − EF. Binding was analyzed using a simple binding isotherm and assuming the binding was cooperative: EB/ET = C(L0n/(L0n + Kdn)). The apparent Kd derived from this treatment, which is really the concentration of PC needed for half the maximum binding, allows a direct comparison of the extent to which the different mutant PLC proteins partition to PC vesicles. The line width of the diC7PC 31P resonance in the presence of PI-PLC was measured at 28 °C using a broadband probe in a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer. Samples contained 3 mg/ml (0.085 mm) enzyme in 0.05 m HEPES with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7. The initial concentration of diC7PC was 0.5 mm; this was gradually increased to 20 mm. At each concentration, the width at half peak height was measured (5.Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 100890-110097Google Scholar, 14.Zhang X. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 204900-220500Google Scholar). Field-cycling 31P T1 experiments were run at 22 °C on an unmodified Varian Unityplus 500 spectrometer at Brandeis University using a standard 10-mm Varian probe in a custom-built device which can move the sample, sealed in a standard 10-mm tube, from the sample probe up to or from a higher position within or just above the magnet, where the magnetic field is between 0.06 and 11.7 tesla (T) or can be varied with the aid of a small Helmholtz coil atop the magnet down to 0.002 T. The method and shuttling device are essentially as described previously, although improved by use of a stepper motor-based shuttle and many other new features (15.Roberts M.F. Cui Q. Turner C.J. Case D.A. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 33650-36370Google Scholar, 16.Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 113777-137650Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Relaxation rates at each field strength were measured using 6–8 programmed delay times. Data were analyzed by curve-fitting to equations as described earlier (15.Roberts M.F. Cui Q. Turner C.J. Case D.A. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 33650-36370Google Scholar, 16.Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 113777-137650Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17.Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 117071-170660Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results are parameterized quite well with only six constants. These are based on a standard “model-free” theory (18.Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 44559-45460Google Scholar), which is not fully appropriate to membranes. The parameters are nevertheless useful as indicating general time scales of motion and structural preferences. Four of the parameters are derived from the high-field part of the measurement, above 0.08 T. These are: τc, which is the time scale (typically ∼5 ns) associated with a restricted, rotational diffusion process motion of an individual phospholipid; CH, which reports the contribution of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) relaxation produced by sub-nanosecond motions within the lipid; CL, which is proportional to CSA relaxation produced by the part of the CSA relaxation remaining un-averaged by the above sub-nanosecond motions and resulting from the slower internal motions fluctuating with time scale τc; Rc(0), which is the dipolar-relaxation contribution resulting from 31P interacting with its nearest protons, mediated by the internal time-scale τc. Theory and other knowledge (15.Roberts M.F. Cui Q. Turner C.J. Case D.A. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 33650-36370Google Scholar, 19.Herzfeld J. Griffin R.G. Haberkorn R.A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 22718-27110Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) then allow us to estimate three other parameters from these, namely τhf, which is the time scale of the highest frequency motions mentioned above, Sc2, the square of the chemical shift anisotropy order parameter, and reff, which indicates the general size of the distance between the phosphorus and its nearest proton neighbors that relax it. There is also a distinct new dispersion observed by extending measurements to very low fields (<0.03 T) that is easily defined on top of a base line of magnitude Rc(0) that is expected to be flat at these low fields. This base line can, thus, be subtracted to produce a pure dispersion. This dispersion is parameterized using Solomon theory with a correlation time τv, and an extrapolated rate in the zero field limit (17.Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 117071-170660Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We treat τv as equal to the rotational correlation time Dr/6, where Dr is the rotational diffusion constant of the individual lipid axes due to both Einstein-Debye diffusion of the entire phospholipid aggregate in the absence or presence of PI-PLC and translational diffusion of individual lipids in the aggregate. The area under this dispersion can be related to the spatial probability-density distributions of the closest protons to the phosphorus, averaged over a time long compared with the time scale of internal rotation τc. Because the detailed spatial distribution is unknown, we have used a rigid rotator model due to Woessner (20.Woessner D.E. Encyclopedia of NMR.in: Grant D.M. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 10680-11083Google Scholar), with the axis assumed perpendicular to the aggregate surface (17.Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 117071-170660Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The R1 rate is then predicted to be proportional to (1–3 cos2θPH), where θPH is the angle between the director and the P-to-H vector. Only one of these four angles is reported here for PC micelles, as a comparison of data for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles with molecular dynamics simulations suggest the θPH ∼ 45° is likely to be the correct value for PC species (21.Klauda J.B.

Crystals of the PI-PLC Y247S/Y251S mutant were grown at 17 °C by vapor diffusion with hanging drop against a reservoir solution containing 9% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m zinc acetate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Later some crystals were soaked for 2 h in the mother liquor with 100 mm myo-inositol added to introduce a soluble substrate analog into the active site. Crystals of the Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S mutant were grown in 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m MnCl2, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. Data on crystals cooled to 80–100 K were collected at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Synchrotron X8C beamline. The diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK software (22.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 3060-3326Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Four tyrosines in W47A/W242A, Tyr246, Tyr247, Tyr248, and Tyr251, form the hydrophobic core of the dimer interface (Fig. 2). In rPI-PLC protein, their replacement with serine residues should dramatically weaken any membrane-induced dimerization, assuming the dimer is similar to W47A/W242A, but maintain any hydrogen-bonding interactions with solvent or phospholipid head groups. If, instead of direct dimer formation, these residues are involved in specific binding of PC molecules (possibly via a Tyr π-cation interaction with the choline moiety as has been observed in peptide systems (27.Tsou L.K. Tatko C.D. Waters M.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 114921-149170Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar)), both activity and PC binding might also be affected. The mutated PI-PLC proteins Y247S/Y251S, Y246S/Y247S/Y248S, and Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S were examined by CD for changes in secondary structure. Y246S/Y247S/Y248S exhibited a far-UV spectrum equivalent to rPI-PLC. However, both Y247S/Y251S and Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S appeared to have less α-helix and more β-sheet (Fig. 3A) at low concentrations in 10 mm borate buffer. Upon the addition of myo-inositol (a soluble portion of the substrate molecule that binds, although not with terribly high affinity, to the active site) a CD spectrum identical to rPI-PLC was observed for Y247S/Y251S (Fig. 3B). The α-helix content for the quadruple Tyr mutant, Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S, dispersed in this solution was not recovered with added myo-inositol. For comparison, myo-inositol had no effect on the secondary structure of rPI-PLC or the triple tyrosine mutant. This suggested that occupation of the active site with the polar part of the substrate can affect the structure of helical regions in the protein and that the double tyrosine mutant likely resembles rPI-PLC under those conditions. The presence of 30% isopropyl alcohol has also been shown to activate rPI-PLC (28.Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 85140-88521Google Scholar). This co-solvent has little effect on rPI-PLC secondary structure (if measured at 4 °C) (29.Wehbi H. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1613: 127-150Google Scholar); however, it did lead to recovery of α-helix for the quadruple mutant (Fig. 3B, inset). To the extent that a co-solvent system may mimic an interfacial environment of a membrane, these results indicate that conditions that lead to kinetic activation (e.g. isopropanol) tend to lead to changes in Y246S/Y247S/Y248S/Y251S secondary structure that approximate rPI-PLC. PI-PLC enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of PI to I-1-P in two steps (cleavage of PI to water-soluble cIP, then hydrolysis of cIP to I-1-P) that can be analyzed separately. Y247S/Y251S exhibited specific activity toward PI solubilized in diC7PC (1:4 PI/diC7PC) (Table 1), comparable with wild type enzyme. Changing the detergent matrix to Triton X-100 instead of an activating PC molecule leads to reduced specific activity for rPI-PLC, typically 30–40% (4.Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3355-3470Google Scholar). However, Y247S/Y251S phosphotransferase activity with PI/Triton X-100 micelles was noticeably lower than that of rPI-PLC. In comparison to Y247S/Y251S, the other tyrosine mutants had even lower specific activity toward PI whether solubilized in diC7PC or Triton X-100 (Table 1). A similar trend was observed for cleavage of PI/PC (4:1) vesicles; Y247S/Y251S was closest to rPI-PLC in cleavage ability, whereas the mutants with three or four of the tyrosines removed were much less active.TABLE 1Specific activities of surface tyrosine mutants towards PI and cIP in diverse assay systemsPI-PLCSpecific activityaIn the phosphotransferase assays, the PI concentration was 8 mm with either 32 mmdiC7PC, 16 mmTriton X-100, or 2 mmPOPC (for the SUVs).

https://openalex.org/W2042463776,"The mineralization of aromatic compounds by microorganisms relies on a structurally and functionally diverse group of ring-cleaving enzymes. The recently discovered benzoate oxidation pathway in Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 encodes a novel such ring-cleaving enzyme, termed BoxC, that catalyzes the conversion of 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA to 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA without the requirement for molecular oxygen. Sequence analysis indicates that BoxC is a highly divergent member of the crotonase superfamily and nearly double the size of the average superfamily member. The structure of BoxC determined to 1.5 Å resolution reveals an intriguing structural demarcation. A highly divergent region in the C terminus probably serves as a structural scaffold for the conserved N terminus that encompasses the active site and, in conjunction with a conserved C-terminal helix, mediates dimer formation. Isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular docking simulations contribute to a detailed view of the active site, resulting in a compelling mechanistic model where a pair of conserved glutamate residues (Glu146 and Glu168) work in tandem to deprotonate the dihydroxylated ring substrate, leading to cleavage. A final deformylation step incorporating a water molecule and Cys111 as a general base completes the formation of 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA product. Overall, this study establishes the basis for BoxC as one of the most divergent members of the crotonase superfamily and provides the first structural insight into the mechanism of this novel class of ring-cleaving enzymes.

Overall, this study establishes the basis for BoxC as one of the most divergent members of the crotonase superfamily and provides the first structural insight into the mechanism of this novel class of ring-cleaving enzymes. Aromatic compounds comprise approximately one-quarter of the earth's biomass (1Gibson J.S. Harwood C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and are the second most abundant natural product next to carbohydrates. The majority of aromatic compounds in the environment are in the form of the organic polymer lignin that plays a structural role in cross-linking cell wall polysaccharides in plants. Despite the inherent thermostability of the aromatic ring, these naturally occurring compounds are efficiently mineralized by various microorganisms. Human-made aromatic compounds, such as those used in industrial processes, however, are often recalcitrant to microbial degradation due to their chemical complexity, decreased bioavailability, and increased thermostability. Moreover, bacteria have only been exposed to these compounds for a relatively short period of time. As a result, these compounds persist in the environment, where they can increase to toxic levels and cause irreversible damage to the biosphere. The common structural blueprint shared by natural and human-made aromatic compounds is the resonance-stabilized planar ring system. Microorganisms overcome the stability of these aromatic structures by employing specific ring-cleaving enzymes that form part of complex catabolic pathways. Until recently, two general classes of microbial processes were characterized that catalyze the degradation of aromatic compounds. These classifications, termed the aerobic and anaerobic pathways, were based primarily on the mode of initial activation and subsequent cleavage of the aromatic ring. The aerobic pathway, exemplified by the peripheral biphenyl and the central ben-cat pathway, relies on the extensive use of molecular oxygen for both the hydroxylation (activation) and cleavage of the aromatic ring (2Bugg T.D. Tetrahedron. 2003; 59: 7075-7101Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 3Harwood C.S. Parales R.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 553-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 4Stanier R.Y. Ornston L.N. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1973; 9: 89-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The anaerobic pathway, however, mediates a reductive dearomatization followed by a hydrolytic ring cleavage, as observed in the classical benzoate pathway (5Evans W.C. Nature. 1977; 270: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Evans W.C. Fuchs G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7Harwood C.S. Gibson J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 504-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, the underlying mechanism incorporates an activation step that renders the ring susceptible to cleavage. Recently, a third aromatic degradation pathway was identified in Burkholderia xenovorans strain LB400 (LB400) (8Denef V.J. Klappenbach J.A. Patrauchan M.A. Florizone C. Rodrigues J.L. Tsoi T.V.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6301-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This novel pathway, termed the box (benzoate oxidation) pathway, incorporates features of both the aerobic and anaerobic pathways, resulting in a hybrid pathway. Microarray analysis of the 9.7-Mb genome of LB400 revealed two paralogous copies of the box pathway, one encoded on chromosome 1 (boxc) and the second on the megaplasmid (boxm) (9Denef V.J. Park J. Tsoi T.V. Rouillard J.M. Zhang H. Wibbenmeyer J.A. Verstraete W. Gulari E. Hashsham S.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Knock-out studies confirm that both box pathways are capable of assimilating benzoate (10Denef V.J. Patrauchan M.A. Florizone C. Park J. Tsoi T.V. Verstraete W. Tiedje J.M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7996-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) yet are differentially regulated based on available carbon source and growth phase of the organism (9Denef V.J. Park J. Tsoi T.V. Rouillard J.M. Zhang H. Wibbenmeyer J.A. Verstraete W. Gulari E. Hashsham S.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recent structural and biochemical characterization of benzoate CoA ligase (14Bains J. Boulanger M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and aldeheyde dehydrogenase (15Bains J. Boulanger M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) from the box pathway in LB400 have provided valuable insight into the basis of substrate specificity and details describing the molecular mechanisms. A unique feature of the hybrid box pathway is the incorporation of both CoA ligation and hydroxylation prior to ring cleavage (16Mohamed M.E. Zaar A. Ebenau-Jehle C. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that both strategies are important for ring activation. It is noteworthy that although CoA ligation is common in the activation of aromatic acids under anaerobic conditions, it has thus far been unseen in the aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. Furthermore, investigation of the box pathway intermediates from the related A. evansii demonstrated that the thioesterified dihydrodiol intermediate was not oxidized and rearomatized as normally occurs in aerobic aromatic metabolism (11Gescher J. Eisenreich W. Wörth J. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1586-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Instead, it was shown to be directly cleaved without the requirement of molecular oxygen in a reaction that resulted in the loss of one unit of carbon and oxygen as formate (11Gescher J. Eisenreich W. Wörth J. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1586-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This critical ring cleavage step in the box pathway is catalyzed by BoxC (2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA lyase/hydrolase) (11Gescher J. Eisenreich W. Wörth J. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1586-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which differs from traditional aerobic and anaerobic ring-cleaving enzymes in that oxygen is not used in catalysis, and the ring substrate is only partially reduced. Based on sequence analysis, BoxC is assigned to the crotonase superfamily. The cleavage reaction catalyzed by BoxC, however, suggests that BoxC defines a new mechanistic niche and intriguingly is one of the four outstanding crotonase superfamily members for which no structural information exists (17Hamed R.B. Batchelar E.T. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2507-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A mechanism for BoxC from A. evansii was recently proposed based on the identification of chemical species using NMR and mass spectrometry (11Gescher J. Eisenreich W. Wörth J. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1586-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the absence of structural information of BoxC, however, the mechanistic details, including the identity of the catalytic residues, remain undefined. To investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of BoxC, we carried out a structural and biophysical analysis complemented with molecular docking. The resulting data provide a compelling mechanistic model with the identification of key catalytic residues and active site structure that stabilize proposed transition state intermediates. Furthermore, the 1.5 Å resolution structure of BoxC reveals intriguing divergent architectural features with respect to other members of the crotonase superfamily. Overall, this study provides the first structural characterization of the novel BoxC family of enzymes and is interpreted with respect to the proposed molecular mechanism and divergence within the crotonase superfamily. The chromosomally encoded boxcc gene from B. xenovorans LB400 was cloned into pET-28a(+) (Novagen) in frame with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Sequence analysis confirmed that no mutations were introduced during cloning. Native (18Bains J. Boulanger M.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and selenomethionine BoxCC were produced and purified using nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Crystals of native BoxCC were obtained using the vapor diffusion method in 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5 (18Bains J. Boulanger M.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Crystals of selenomethionine BoxCC were initially obtained by seeding with native BoxCC crystals, followed by two additional rounds of microseeding to obtain diffraction quality crystals. Diffraction data for native BoxCC crystals were collected as described previously (18Bains J. Boulanger M.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Diffraction data for selenomethionine BoxCC were collected on beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratories) at the optimized wavelength of 0.9794 Å for the f″ selenium edge. Data processing was carried out using Crystal Clear/d*trek (19Pflugrath J. Acta Crystallog. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). A total of 12 selenium sites (six from each monomer) were identified and refined using autoSHARP (20Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 364: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a figure of merit of 0.297. High quality phases were obtained following density modification and 2-fold NCS averaging that enabled building and registering of ∼70% of the backbone using ARP/Warp (21Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The remaining structure was built manually, and solvent atoms were selected using COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and refined with REFMAC (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) to an Rcryst of 18.7% and an Rfree of 20.9%. In total, 174,578 reflections were used in refinement selected with a σ cut-off of 2.0. All solvent atoms were inspected manually before deposition. Stereochemical analysis of the refined BoxCC structure was performed with PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and SFCHECK in CCP4 (25Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

ITC was performed using a VPTM isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). All samples were characterized in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. Protein and ligand solutions were filtered and degassed immediately prior to use. Titrations were performed by injecting 20-μl aliquots of ligand solution into the ITC sample cell containing 200 μm BoxCC at 22 °C. All ITC data were corrected for the heat of dilution of the titrant by subtracting the heats generated by titrating the ligand into buffer alone. The equilibrium association constant and the stoichiometry were determined by curve fitting. Two independent titration experiments were performed per ligand, and the average was taken. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the Gibbs free energy equation, ΔG = −RT ln Ka = ΔH − TΔS. Multiple sequence alignments and the associated neighbor joining trees were determined by ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar), using the method of Saitou and Nei (27Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Buried surface area for the BoxCC dimer interface was calculated using the Protein-Protein interaction analysis server (available on the World Wide Web). Docking was performed with the program Molegro virtual docker (28Thomsen R. Christensen M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), using the molecular docking algorithm Moldock score. Initially, water, glycerol, and β-mercaptoethanol (β-Me) molecules were removed from the structure coordinates of BoxCC. Prior to docking, the structure of the 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA was built and energy-minimized at the MP2/6-31G* level using Gaussian 03 (29Frisch M.J. et al.Gaussian 03 (Revision B.04). Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA2003Google Scholar). Ligand binding cavities were identified using the Molegro Van der Waals molecular surface prediction algorithm with a grid resolution of 0.5 Å. A total of 50 docking runs with a population size of 200 were calculated over a 12-Å radius surrounding the predicted active site cavity with a grid resolution of 0.2 Å and a maximum of 10,000 iterations per position. Similar positions were clustered using a root mean square deviation of 1.5 Å. Prepositioned ligands were randomized in the predicted active site cavity prior to each docking run, and docking was constrained to the predicted active site cavity. In order to verify that positions resulting from in silico docking represent correctly bound conformations, each position was visually inspected and compared. Positions were also inspected and compared with the rerank score algorithm, protein interaction, hydrogen bonding, and affinity interaction energies and ordered by the energy of interaction protein-ligand. Complexes were optimized by using Moloc software (30Gerber P.R. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1998; 12: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Gerber P.R. Müller K. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1995; 9: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) with standard force field and optimization parameters. During energy minimization, the positions of amino acid side chains were fixed while allowing all ligand atoms to move. BoxCC crystallized as a dimer in the asymmetric unit of the primitive orthorhombic (P212121) cell. The structure was solved by single anomalous wavelength dispersion, using selenomethionine-derivatized BoxCC. The final model starts at Pro10 (monomer A) and Ala9 (monomer B) and extends through Val556 (Fig. 1A, left). Included in the final model are six molecules of glycerol and four molecules of β-Me. It is noteworthy that in each monomer a β-Me molecule is coordinated to the side chains of Cys90 and Cys111 (Fig. 1A, right). No β-Me is coordinated to the remaining four cysteines, suggesting that Cys90 and Cys111 are particularly reactive. The formation of the BoxCC dimer results in an extensive buried surface area of ∼3900 Å2, consistent with our observation that BoxCC elutes as a stable dimer from a size exclusion column (18Bains J. Boulanger M.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The dimeric interface of BoxCC is formed by a network of interlocking α-helices, with α6, α7, α19, and α20 contributing the majority of the buried surface area (Fig. 1B, left). Clear electron density is observed for each interface residue, including large polar residues, such as Arg191 and His192, that bridge the two monomers through an extensive solvent network that appears to increase shape complementarity of the interface (Fig. 1B, right). Nearly 62% of the residues responsible for dimer formation are conserved in BoxC orthologs, suggesting that the dimeric structure of this novel group of ring-cleaving enzymes will be consistent. In the broader context of the crotonase superfamily, the dimeric form is rare, with most members adopting trimer, tetramer, or hexamer (dimers of trimers) forms (32Bennett J.P. Whittingham J.L.

Only the carboxyltransferase subunits for the acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (42Zhang H. Yang Z. Shen Y. Tong L. Science. 2003; 299: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and the α-subunit of glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (GCDα) from A. fermentans (43Wendt K.S. Schall I. Huber R. Buckel W. Jacob U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3493-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which are subunits of larger multifunctional enzymes, are reported to be dimers. The 2-fold symmetry of the BoxCC dimer is mirrored in each of the monomeric subunits. The N-terminal (Fig. 1C; residues 1–250) and C-terminal (Fig. 1C; residues 251–507) domains are related by 180° rotations about the vertical and horizontal axes. A central helical bundle incorporating helix α20 formed by the terminal 49 residues of the C terminus (Fig. 1C; magenta) comprises the intramolecular interface. The N and C termini share only 18% sequence identity but adopt a conserved α/β architecture with a root mean square deviation of 1.69 Å over 131 Cα atoms (Fig. 1C, right). The N-terminal domain consists of a seven-stranded twisted β-sheet sandwiched between α-helices and an additional two-stranded β-sheet positioned perpendicular to the main β-sheet. A structural comparison indicates that the β substructures surrounded by α-helices are conserved in the crotonase superfamily (44Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 209-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the seven-strand twisted β-sheet in the C-terminal domain differs from the N-terminal domain in that it is longer and incorporates an additional antiparallel β-strand while lacking the second perpendicular β-sheet. In addition, a short helix in the N-terminal domain is substituted for a more extended helix in the C-terminal domain, resulting in a reorganized topology and surface structure. To evaluate the conserved architectural features of BoxCC in the context of its closely related orthologs, all of which exhibit greater than 57% identity, we mapped the sequence alignment results onto the Connolly surface (45Connolly M.L. Science. 1983; 221: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar) calculated for BoxCC (Fig. 2). A striking demarcation is observed between regions of high (50–61%; magenta) and low (15–20%; gray) sequence identity. It is clear from this analysis that maximum sequence divergence is localized to the C-terminal domain with the exception of helix α18 (Fig. 2, arrow), which is composed of conserved acidic residues (Asp477, Asp480, Glu481, Glu487, and Glu488). In the context of the BoxCC dimer, this negatively charged helix is solvent-exposed, suggesting a potentially important functional role. The majority of the conserved residues map to the dimer interface, contributing 81% of the overall buried surface area. The majority of the divergent region, however, is distal to the dimer interface. We hypothesize that this divergent region serves an ancillary role by providing a structural scaffold for the N-terminal domain and the dimerization interface. In this regard, it could thus also contribute indirectly in forming a docking surface for mediating a higher order complex with BoxA/B, as suggested previously (46Zaar A. Gescher J. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A homologous docking site on the dimeric structure has also been hypothesized for the GCDα subunit (43Wendt K.S. Schall I. Huber R. Buckel W. Jacob U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3493-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Members of the crotonase superfamily exhibit as little as 20% sequence identity but incorporate conserved structural hallmarks. To determine the evolutionary relationship between BoxCC and each mechanistic class of the crotonase superfamily (17Hamed R.B. Batchelar E.T. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2507-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we generated phylogenetic trees using the entire sequence of BoxCC (residues 1–556) and the individual N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 3). BoxCC is approximately double the size of most members of the crotonase superfamily with the exception of the dioxygenase (47Widboom P.F. Fielding E.N. Liu Y. Bruner S.D. Nature. 2007; 447: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the carboxyltransferase subunit of biotin-dependent carboxylases (42Zhang H. Yang Z. Shen Y. Tong L. Science. 2003; 299: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 43Wendt K.S. Schall I. Huber R. Buckel W. Jacob U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3493-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48Hall P.R. Wang Y.F. Rivera-Hainaj R.E. Zheng X. Pustai-Carey M. Carey P.R. Yee V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2334-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The carboxyltransferase subunits, however, have been omitted from the alignment, since they represent subunits of larger multifunctional enzymes. The N-terminal region (residues ∼50–250) of BoxCC shows highest similarity with the enoyl-CoA hydratases/isomerases, whereas the C-terminal region (residues ∼360–475) shares homology with 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoyl-CoA synthase and an enoyl-CoA hydratase. Residues 260–350 show no significant identity to any particular class, suggesting that this region is structurally and/or functionally specific to BoxCC. It is interesting to note, however, that this region lies in the most divergent stretch within the BoxCC orthologs (Fig. 2), consistent with a role as a support scaffold. A similar scenario was recently observed in dihydroxyphenylglyoxylate synthase, where the initial one-third of the sequence (N-terminal) shares no sequence homology to any known proteins (47Widboom P.F. Fielding E.N. Liu Y. Bruner S.D. Nature. 2007; 447: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). With the active site localized in the C termini of dihydroxyphenylglyoxylate synthase, this novel region has not been ascribed any specific role. Overall, the phylogram clearly demonstrates that of the proteins analyzed, BoxCC is the most divergent member of the crotonase superfamily (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of BoxCC is significantly more div"

The peripheral stalk of Escherichia coli is composed of a dimer of identical b subunits. In contrast, photosynthetic organisms express two b-like genes that form a heterodimeric peripheral stalk. Previously we generated chimeric peripheral stalks in which a portion of the tether and dimerization domains of the E. coli b subunits were replaced with homologous sequences from the b and b′ subunits of Thermosynechococcus elongatus (Claggett, S. B., Grabar, T. B., Dunn, S. D., and Cain, B. D. (2007) J. Bacteriol. 189, 5463–5471). The spatial arrangement of the chimeric b and b′ subunits, abbreviated Tb and Tb′, has been investigated by Cu2+-mediated disulfide cross-link formation. Disulfide formation was studied both in soluble model polypeptides and between full-length subunits within intact functional F1F0 ATP synthase complexes. In both cases, disulfides were preferentially formed between TbA83C and Tb′A90C, indicating the existence of a staggered relationship between helices of the two chimeric subunits. Even under stringent conditions rapid formation of disulfides between these positions occurred. Importantly, formation of this cross-link had no detectable effect on ATP-driven proton pumping, indicating that the staggered conformation is compatible with normal enzymatic activity. Under less stringent reaction conditions, it was also possible to detect b subunits cross-linked through identical positions, suggesting that an in-register, nonstaggered parallel conformation may also exist.

F1F0 ATP synthases are found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, and the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria (1von Ballmoos C. Cook G.M. Dimroth P. Annu. Rev.

These enzymes are responsible for harnessing an electrochemical gradient of protons across the membranes for the synthesis of ATP. In Escherichia coli F1F0 ATP synthase, the membrane-embedded F0 sector is composed of subunits ab2c10 and a soluble F1 portion composed of subunits α3β3γδϵ. The F0 sector houses a proton channel located principally in the a subunit, and the flow of protons through F0 generates torque used to rotate the c10 subunit ring relative to the ab2 subunits. The F1 γ and ϵ subunits are bound to the c10 ring and form the central or rotor stalk. Catalytic sites are located at the interfaces of each αβ pair in F1. The γ subunit extends into the center of the α3β3 hexamer, creating an asymmetry in the conformations of the αβ pairs (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). It is the rotation of the γ subunit and the resulting sequential conformational changes in each αβ pair that provides the driving force for the synthesis of ATP at the catalytic sites. The α3β3 hexamer is held stationary relative to the rotary stalk by the peripheral stalk consisting of the b2δ subunits. The peripheral stalk is essential for binding F1 to F0 and for coupling proton translocation to catalytic activity (6Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Weber J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 53-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Walker J.E. Dickson V.K. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the E. coli enzyme, the peripheral stalk is a dimer of identical b subunits. The stalk has been conceptually divided into functional domains called the membrane domain (bM1-I33), the tether domain (bE34-A61), the dimerization domain (bT62-K122), and the F1-binding domain (bQ123-L156) (9Revington M. McLachlin D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although there is ample evidence of direct protein-protein interactions between b subunits within the membrane, dimerization, and F1-binding domains, there is remarkably little evidence of tight packing between the b subunits in the tether domain. In fact, electron spin resonance studies suggested that the tether domains of the two b subunits may be separated by more than 20 Å in the F1F0 complex (10Zaida T. Hornung T. Volkov O. Hoffman A. Pandey S. Wise J. Vogel P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 11Steigmiller S. Börsch M. Gräber P. Huber M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Much of what is known about the structure of the stalk has been inferred from analysis of the properties of polypeptides modeling segments of the b subunit. The structure of a peptide modeling the membrane domain, bM1-E34, has been determined by NMR (12Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and a peptide based on the dimerization domain, bT62-K122, has been determined by x-ray diffraction (13Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both polypeptides assumed α-helical conformations, but neither structure directly revealed b subunit dimerization interactions. Recently, Priya et al. (14Priya R. Tadwal V.S. Roessle M.W. Gayen S.

Molecular modeling efforts supported by a variety of biochemical and biophysical experiments have yielded competing right-handed coiled coil (15Wood K.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

The parallel two-stranded left-handed coiled coli is a well known structure characterized by knobs-into-holes packing of the side chains of the two helices that are aligned in-register. An in-register conformation implies that any specific amino acid on the b subunit-subunit interface would occupy a position immediately adjacent to its counterpart in the other b subunit. In contrast, del Rizzo et al. (16Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) proposed a novel parallel right-handed coiled coil with the helices of the two b subunits offset by approximately one and a half turns of an α helix. This staggered model positions the two identical residues contributed by each of the b subunits in a homodimer into differing environments and at considerable distance from one another. Sequence analyses have been offered in support of both models (16Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Wise J.G. Vogel P.D.

In terms of experimental support, cross-linking studies of polypeptides have provided evidence that dimer packing could be in-register at many sites starting from residue Ala59 and continuing to the carboxyl termini in model bY24–L156 dimers and in bD53–K122 dimers (9Revington M.

In mixtures of dimerization domain polypeptides with cysteines incorporated at different sites, disulfides preferentially formed between positions that were 4–7 residues apart. For example, bD53–L156 dimers were covalently locked into the offset conformation by the formation of disulfide bridges between cysteines introduced at positions bA79 and bR83 as well as bR83 and bA90 (15Wood K.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31920-31927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These staggered dimers were more stable, melted with higher cooperativity, and bound soluble F1 with higher affinity than bD53–L156 dimers fixed in the in-register arrangement. Moreover, active and coupled F1F0 complexes were assembled with heterodimeric peripheral stalks using b subunits with tether domains varying in length by as many as 14 amino acids (22Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These F1F0 complexes had peripheral stalks that were by definition out of register, at least within the tether domain. In contrast to the homodimer of identical b subunits observed in the peripheral stalk of E. coli, photosynthetic organisms express two b-like subunits, b and b′, that are thought to form heterodimeric peripheral stalks in F1F0 ATP synthase. Previously, we generated heterodimeric peripheral stalks within the E. coli F1F0 by constructing chimeric b subunits (23Claggett S.B. Grabar T.B. Dunn S.D. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5463-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Segments of the tether and dimerization domains of the E. coli b subunit were replaced with the homologous regions of the Thermosynechococcus elongatus b and b′ subunits. The chimeric subunits formed heterodimeric peripheral stalks that were incorporated into intact, functional F1F0 ATP synthase complexes. The most active chimeric enzymes had T. elongatus primary sequences replacing residues bE39–I86 of the E. coli b subunit. For simplicity, these chimeric subunits will be referred to here as Tb and Tb′. The ability to generate F1F0 ATP synthases with Tb/Tb′ heterodimeric peripheral stalks provided a means to investigate the positions of the two subunits in the peripheral stalk. In the present work, we show that the Tb and Tb′ subunits assumed preferred positions relative to one another within the F1F0 complex. The staggered conformation appears to be a favored and functional conformation for the peripheral stalk. However, within a population of F1F0 complexes, some complexes with peripheral stalks in the in-register conformation are likely to exist. The host strain for all membrane preparations was KM2 (Δb), an E. coli strain that carries a chromosomal deletion of the uncF gene (b subunit) (24McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain MM294 was used for the expression of peptides modeling the b subunit (25Meselson M. Yuan R. Nature. 1968; 217: 1110-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). F1F0 ATP synthase viability was assessed in vivo by growing cells on minimal A medium supplemented with succinate (0.2%, w/v). The cells for membrane preparations were grown in Luria broth supplemented with glucose (0.2%, w/v) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (40 μg/ml). Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) were added as needed. All of the cells were grown at 37 °C. A b subunit gene was synthesized by GenScript that contained a C21S mutation and a V5 epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) on the carboxyl terminus. The C21S mutation is present in all b, Tb, and Tb′ subunit gene constructs but will not be included in the subunit designations throughout the paper for clarity. Plasmid pSBC127 (bV5) was generated by ligating the synthetic uncF(b) subunit gene from GenScript into the EcoRI/KpnI restriction sites of pUC19. Cysteine substitutions were engineered into b subunits by site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pSBC127 (bV5) using the oligonucleotides listed in supplemental Table S1. The plasmids were constructed for the expression of chimeric Tb or Tb′ subunits with a cysteine substituted for residue Ala83 or Ala90 (see Table 1). Tb subunit substitutions were made in plasmid pSBC97 (Tbhis) that has T. elongatus b subunit sequence substituted for residues Glu39–Ile86 and a histidine tag at the amino terminus. Tb′ constructs were based on plasmid pSBC98 (Tb′V5) that has the T. elongatus b′ subunit sequence substituted for the same region and a V5 epitope tag on the carboxyl terminus. All of the mutations were confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing.TABLE 1Growth of bacterial strainsStrain/plasmid(s)Gene productaTb, wild-type E. coli b subunit with sequence from the b subunit of T. elongatus substituted for amino acids Glu39–Ile86, a C21S mutation, and a six-histidine epitope tag at the amino terminus., bTb′, wild-type E. coli b subunit with sequence from the b′ subunit of T. elongatus substituted for amino acids Glu39–Ile86, a C21S mutation, and a V5 epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) at the carboxyl terminus., cThe native cysteine at bC21has been mutated to serine in all pSBC plasmids., dThe Db and Db′ genes produce peptides modeling the dimerization domains of the Tb and Tb′ subunits.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids were also constructed to facilitate expression of soluble polypeptides modeled on the Tb and Tb′ subunits (see Table 1). Regions of interest from the parent plasmids were amplified by PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1 and cloned into the expression plasmid pJB3 (26Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using the unique NdeI and HindIII sites. The forward primers for all of the Tb chimeras, SD101, and the Tb′ chimeras, SD102, included an NdeI site and encoded a protein starting with residues MSY followed by Tb or Tb′ sequence beginning at residue Asp53. Four plasmids were constructed to express peptides modeling the Tb or Tb′ subunit residues Asp53–Leu156 by PCR amplification of plasmids pSBC123 (TbE39–I86,A83C), pSBC124 (TbE39–I86,A90C), pSBC125 (Tb′E39–I86,A83C) and pSBC126 (Tb′E39–I86,A90C). Primers SD101/SD102 were used as the forward primer and SD104 as the reverse primer to generate plasmids pSD361 (PbA83C), pSD362 (Pb′A83C), pSD363 (PbA90C), and pSD364 (Pb′A90C), abbreviated as Pb and Pb′. Two additional plasmids expressing peptides modeling the Tb and Tb′ dimerization domain residues Asp53–Lys122 and containing a GGGC extension on the carboxyl terminus were constructed using SD103 as the reverse PCR primer and pSBC97 (Tb) or pSBC98 (Tb′) as the template DNA. The resulting plasmids pSD357 (Db+GGGC) and pSD358 (Db′+GGGC) are abbreviated as Db and Db′. Plasmid pSD357 (Db+GGGC) was moved into the expression plasmid pACT3 (27Dykxhoorn D.M. St Pierre R. Linn T. Gene. 1996; 177: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) using the EcoRI and HindIII sites to produce pSD359 (Db+GGGC) and allow coexpression with pSD358 (Db′+GGGC). Membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (28Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Membrane protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18516) Google Scholar). ATP-driven proton pumping assays were conducted by adding 500 μg of membrane protein to 3.5 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS, 2The abbreviations used are: MOPSmorpholinepropanesulfonic acidLDAON,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxideMESG7-methyl-6-thioguanosineNEMN-ethylmalemidePNPpurine nucleotide phosphorylaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. pH 7.3], 10 mm MgCl2) and monitoring the fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (30Sorgen P.L.

The ATP hydrolysis activities in membrane samples were determined using the 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine (MESG) method (31Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This assay determines the rate of ATP hydrolysis by using the enzyme purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP) to catalyze the reaction of inorganic phosphate (Pi) with MESG to form 7-methyl-6-thioguanine. The appearance of product was detected as an absorbance increase at 360 nm using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. A PNP stock solution was made by dissolving the solid enzyme in water to a concentration of 0.1 units/ml and stored at 4 °C. An MESG stock solution was made in water to a final concentration of 1 mm and stored in 5-ml aliquots at −20 °C. The MESG solution was thawed prior to use, and both MESG and PNP were kept on ice until needed. Each reaction consisted of 10–25 mg of membrane protein, 50 ml of 20× TM buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm MgSO4), 300 ml of MESG, 50 ml of PNP, and water to a final volume of 1 ml. The components were combined in a disposable glass tube, agitated briefly to mix, and poured into a cuvette prewarmed to 37 °C. Each reaction was allowed to sit for 1 min to stabilize the temperature before starting by the addition of 30 ml of 0.15 m ATP made in TM buffer. Absorbance data points were collected continuously for 5 min. The slope of the linear portion of the reaction was determined in units of absorbance/min using the software associated with the instrument. Stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO) was determined by adding LDAO to each reaction to a final concentration of 0.5% as described previously (32Gardner J.L. Cain B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Heterodimeric peripheral stalks were detected using a purification procedure essentially as described previously (22Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Membrane samples were solubilized and purified over a high capacity nickel chelate affinity matrix (Sigma) to selectively retain F1F0 ATP synthase complexes containing at least one histidine tag. Membrane- and nickel resin-purified proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel for immunoblot analysis (33Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31205-31211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were an antibody against the b subunit (a gift from G. Deckers-Hebestreit) and an antibody against the V5 epitope tag (Invitrogen). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, respectively. The presence of bound secondary antibody was detected by chemiluminescence with the Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus Western blotting detection system. The chimeric dimerization domains Db+GGGC and Db′+GGGC were coexpressed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in cells carrying both pSD359 (Db+GGGC) and pSD359 (Db′+GGGC). The Tb and Tb′ chimeras were separated by ion exchange chromatography, exploiting their substantial difference in charge. The cell extracts were first fractionated by procedures similar to those that have been previously described (16Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and then clarified by ultracentrifugation. Proteins that precipitated with ammonium sulfate at concentrations between 40 and 60% of saturation were collected. Anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose at pH 8.0 separated the domains into two peaks. Further fractionation of the first peak by cation exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose at pH 5.0 yielded essentially pure Tb dimerization domain. Application of the cation exchange step to the second peak resulted in partially purified b′ chimera; subsequent size exclusion chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-75 yielded the pure polypeptide. Chimeric polypeptides consisting of residues Asp53–Leu156 and containing internal cysteine substitutions at either position Ala83 or Ala90 were expressed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of cells carrying plasmids pSD361, pSD362, pSD363, or pSD364. Following cell breakage and clarification of the extracts by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant solutions were brought to 45% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation, dissolved, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. These partially purified samples were used for disulfide formation studies without further purification. The identity and purity of each product was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; the masses of the Tb and Tb′ subunits differ by 167 Da. All of the buffers included dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1 mm to maintain the cysteines in a reduced state. Protein concentrations were determined by the Advanced Assay (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) as described previously (16Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels using a Tris-Tricine buffer system (9Revington M. McLachlin D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Disulfide cross-links between b subunits in the peripheral stalk were formed by incubating membrane samples with 50 mm Cu2+ for time periods specified for each experiment. The cross-linking reactions were carried out in open 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes with mixing at 300 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer R heated to 37 °C. Each reaction was stopped by adding fresh N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to a final concentration of 5 mm, through mixing and cooling on ice. Two time points were taken for each sample, a zero time point and a 2- or 10-min time point. The zero time point sample was obtained by diluting the concentrated membranes to 5 mg/ml in TM buffer and adding NEM to react with free cysteine residues and prevent cross-linking. The reaction was mixed and allowed to sit at room temperature for 15 s before adding Cu2+ and placing on ice. Cross-linking for 2 or 10 min was done by diluting the membrane sample to 5 mg/ml in TM buffer and warming to 37 °C in the thermomixer. Prewarmed Cu2+ was added, and the samples were allowed to incubate with mixing for 2 or 10 min before further cross-linking was stopped by the addition of NEM. A total of 1 μg of each cross-linked sample was analyzed by Western blo"
https://openalex.org/W2085778391,"It is well known that Galpha(i1)(GDP) binds strongly to Gbetagamma subunits to form the Galpha(i1)(GDP)-Gbetagamma heterotrimer, and that activation to Galpha(i1)(GTP) results in conformational changes that reduces its affinity for Gbetagamma subunits. Previous studies of G protein subunit interactions have used stoichiometric amounts of the proteins. Here, we have found that Galpha(i1)(GDP) can bind a second Gbetagamma subunit with an affinity only 10-fold weaker than the primary site and close to the affinity between activated Galpha(i1) and Gbetagamma subunits. Also, we find that phospholipase Cbeta2, an effector of Gbetagamma, does not compete with the second binding site implying that effectors can be bound to the Galpha(i1)(GDP)-(Gbetagamma)(2) complex. Biophysical measurements and molecular docking studies suggest that this second site is distant from the primary one. A synthetic peptide having a sequence identical to the putative second binding site on Galpha(i1) competes with binding of the second Gbetagamma subunit. Injection of this peptide into cultured cells expressing eYFP-Galpha(i1)(GDP) and eCFP-Gbetagamma reduces the overall association of the subunits suggesting this site is operative in cells. We propose that this second binding site serves to promote and stabilize G protein subunit interactions in the presence of competing cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2000555535,"During endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), a relatively small number of ubiquitin ligases (E3) must be capable of ubiquitinating an assortment of substrates diverse in both structure and location (ER lumen, membrane, and/or cytosol).

This essential pathway, known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), prevents the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins through the regulated degradation of target substrates. Initiation of ERAD involves substrate recognition leading to ubiquitination mediated by ubiquitin ligases (E3). Multiple cellular E3 ligases have been identified that associate with the ER membrane, including Hrd1, Doa10 (known as TEB4 in mammals), and gp78 (1Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev.

These ligases are known to ubiquitinate a multitude of diverse substrates. However, the mechanisms by which substrates are selected remain poorly understood. Although evidence exists for direct binding of some substrates to E3 ligases (3Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat.

Indeed, it is now appreciated that E3 ligases in the ER membrane associate with a complex set of accessory molecules that, collectively, facilitate ERAD. The complexity of these systems confounds the characterization of substrate selection, but the fact that ERAD has been implicated in numerous diseases (10Yoshida H. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 630-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) magnifies the importance of attaining a fuller understanding of substrate recruitment/selection. endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated degradation major histocompatibility complex MHC class I heavy chain really interesting new gene membrane-associated RING-CH transporter associated with antigen processing transmembrane domain ubiquitin ligase monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline β2-microglobulin human. endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated degradation major histocompatibility complex MHC class I heavy chain really interesting new gene membrane-associated RING-CH transporter associated with antigen processing transmembrane domain ubiquitin ligase monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline β2-microglobulin human. Members of the RING finger domain-containing E3 ligase family are known to play a critical role in ERAD (1Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev.

In general, RING E3 ligases have been divided into two broad classes, single- and multi-subunit (11Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). Single-subunit E3 ligases possess discrete domains that mediate substrate binding and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme recruitment. In contrast, multi-subunit E3 ligases are dependent upon a complex of protein subunits that act together to mediate substrate binding and ubiquitin conjugation. The mK3 protein, encoded by the murine γ-herpesvirus 68, is a member of a family of E3 ligases found in several γ-herpesviruses and poxviruses, as well as in eukaryotes. These molecules are membrane-anchored and possess a cytosol-facing RING domain of the RING-CH subtype (12Ohmura-Hoshino M. Goto E. Matsuki Y. Aoki M. Mito M. Uematsu M. Hotta H. Ishido S. J. Biochem. 2006; 140: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Like many of its viral homologs, mK3 is a presumed single-subunit E3 ligase. MK3 is employed by the virus to interfere with the host immune response by inhibiting the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathway (14Stevenson P.G. May J.S. Smith X.G. Marques S. Adler H. Koszinowski U.H. Simas J.P. Efstathiou S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the presence of mK3, which localizes to the ER membrane, nascent class I heavy chains (HC) are ubiquitinated, leading to their rapid degradation in a proteasome-dependent fashion (15Boname J.M. Stevenson P.G. Immunity. 2001; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This ubiquitination is known to require a cytosolic tail on the class I HC (15Boname J.M. Stevenson P.G. Immunity. 2001; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Wang X. Connors R. Harris M.R. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4099-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, class I HC that are incapable of associating with the class I peptide-loading complex in the ER, consisting of TAP-1/2, tapasin, and additional accessory proteins (17Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 343-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), are resistant to mK3-mediated ubiquitination (18Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R. Virgin 4th, H.W. Hansen T.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the stable expression and function of mK3 require TAP-1, TAP-2, and tapasin. In fact, mK3 associates with this complex even in the absence of the class I HC (18Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R. Virgin 4th, H.W. Hansen T.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Yu Y.Y. Harris M.R. Lybarger L. Kimpler L.A. Myers N.B. Virgin 4th, H.W. Hansen T.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only the class I HC (and not TAP-1, TAP-2, or tapasin) is detectably ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded in the presence of mK3 (20Boname J.M. de Lima B.D. Lehner P.J. Stevenson P.G. Immunity. 2004; 20: 305-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, it was initially assumed that mK3 would bind directly to a unique determinant on the peptide-loading complex-associated class I HC; this would be consistent with a single-subunit E3 ligase. However, diverse transmembrane (TM) and cytosolic tails could be appended to the class I HC without loss of mK3-dependent ubiquitination (21Wang X. Lybarger L. Connors R. Harris M.R. Hansen T.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8673-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These observations, coupled with the dependence of mK3 on the peptide-loading complex for stable expression, led to an alternative model to explain the specificity of mK3 for MHC class I HC; the association of mK3 with TAP-1/2 and tapasin positions its RING-CH domain such that only the tail of class I HC but not the cytosolic domains of other proteins within the peptide-loading complex can be ubiquitinated (21Wang X. Lybarger L. Connors R. Harris M.R. Hansen T.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8673-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that a protein unrelated to class I HC in sequence can, upon association with the peptide-loading complex, be ubiquitinated by mK3. In addition, changing its relative position within the peptide-loading complex can alter the fate of this novel substrate. These data provide direct evidence to support an “adapter-mediated” model of substrate recruitment in which the peptide-loading complex functions as an “adapter complex” for mK3 and serves to recruit the substrate (class I HC) and orient the RING-CH domain of mK3. Additionally, our results highlight the distinction between substrate recruitment by adapters and specific requirements of the E3 ligase for ubiquitination of the substrates. Indeed, the features of class I HC ubiquitination by mK3 (a cytosolic tail with either lysine, serine, threonine, or cysteine residues (22Wang X. Herr R.A. Chua W.J. Lybarger L. Wiertz E.J. Hansen T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar)), held true for our unrelated chimeric substrate. The relationship of mK3 with viral and cellular E3 ligases, including Doa10/TEB4 (23Hassink G. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Lee S.J. Spaapen R. van Laar T. Coleman C.S. Bartee E. Früh K. Chau V. Wiertz E. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggests that studies of substrate recruitment/selection by this E3 ligase can provide insights that can inform our understanding of this process by other E3 ligases. Experiments were performed using the 3KO murine embryo fibroblast line (β2m−/−, class I Kb−/−, and class I Db−/−) (18Lybarger L. Wang X. Harris M.R. Virgin 4th, H.W. Hansen T.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and a tapasin-deficient murine embryo fibroblast line (Tpn−/− and H-2b) (24Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L.

Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) were used for the production of ecotropic retrovirus vectors following transient transfection. All cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all from Mediatech). Cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 100 units of mouse γ-interferon/ml to increase transcription of the peptide-loading complex protein genes. Retrovirus-containing supernatants were generated using the Vpack vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for transient production in 293T cells to generate ecotropic virus for infection. Packaging cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the supplier's instructions. Virus-containing supernatants were collected 48–72 h post-transfection and added to target cells in the presence of hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene) (Sigma) at a concentration of 8 μg/ml. Stable transductants were produced by selection with the appropriate antibiotics, at the following concentrations: puromycin, 2.5 μg/ml; Zeocin, 0.2 mg/ml; hygromycin, 0.2 mg/ml; geneticin, 0.5 mg/ml. The vectors used for expression of each cDNA were all murine stem cell virus-derived nonreplicating retroviral vectors. Each vector is bicistronic with the gene of interest upstream of an internal ribosome entry site element that precedes the antibiotic resistance marker. pMIP and pMIB are derivatives of pMSCV-IRES-GFP (pMIG (26Van Parijs L. Refaeli Y. Lord J.D. Nelson B.H. Abbas A.K. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 11: 281-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar)) in which the green fluorescent protein cDNA was replaced with the puromycin and bleomycin (Zeocin) resistance genes, respectively. pMIN and pMIH have been described (16Wang X. Connors R. Harris M.R. Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4099-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and encode neomycin and hygromycin resistance, respectively. All cDNAs used in this study were expressed from one of these vectors. The cDNA clones for soluble human β2m, mouse B7.2 (CD86), MHC class I Ld heavy chain, and mouse tapasin were all obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using human- and mouse-derived cells as RNA sources, respectively. Generation of the Ld T134K mutant and the mK3 cDNA have been described (19Yu Y.Y. Harris M.R. Lybarger L. Kimpler L.A. Myers N.B. Virgin 4th, H.W. Hansen T.H. J.

Transmembrane versions of human β2m all contain the entire open reading frame of hβ2m, including the N-terminal signal peptide fused in frame with various C-terminal domains. Tβ2m.B7.B7 consists of hβ2m fused to residues 208–284 of murine B7.2 (TM and cytosolic domains). Tβ2m.Tpn.Tpn consists of hβ2m fused to residues 381–442 of murine tapasin (TM and cytosolic domains). Tβ2m.B7.Tpn consists of hβ2m fused to residues 208–239 of B7.2 (TM domain) and residues 418–442 of tapasin (cytosolic tail). These chimeric constructs were generated by overlap-extension (fusion) PCR with the respective templates. Truncations of cytosolic domains were generated by PCR in which the reverse oligonucleotide incorporated a stop codon at the desired location. The class I Ld tail-deletion mutant (HC-ΔCyt) retained only six residues (KRRRNT). The Tβ2m.B7.B7 tail-deletion mutant (Tβ2m.B7.ΔCyt) retained only five residues (CHRRP; the two arginine residues are lysines in the native B7.2 sequence). All site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Mouse anti-CD86 (B7.2) clone GL1 was purchased from eBioscience (San Diego). All flow cytometric analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cells were stained on ice with the appropriate dilution of the indicated unconjugated primary antibodies. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pharmingen) was used to visualize the staining levels of the primary antibodies. For low pH treatment of cells to denature class I molecules, cells were suspended in 0.5% glycine buffer, pH 2.8, for 3 min at 37 °C. Excess complete culture medium was added to neutralize the samples, which were then treated as above for flow cytometric analysis. For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% digitonin (Wako, Richmond, VA), 20 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (both from Sigma), and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail III (Calbiochem). Separately, protein A- Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with saturating amounts of antibody. Excess antibody was removed from beads by washing three times with 0.1% digitonin/PBS buffer. Post-nuclear lysates were incubated with immobilized antibody overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with 0.1% digitonin/PBS buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in nonreducing lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen). Sequential immunoprecipitations were performed as described above with the exception of the elution step following the primary immunoprecipitation, which was performed by boiling in 0.5% SDS in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8. Samples were diluted with 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Nonidet P-40) (from Sigma) in PBS for a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. Supernatants were incubated with the second protein A-immobilized antibody overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 in PBS, and proteins were eluted by boiling in nonreducing lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. Direct denaturing immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described above, except that IGEPAL CA-630 was substituted for digitonin. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% IGEPAL in PBS and protease inhibitors. Post-nuclear lysates were denatured by the addition of 0.5% SDS and then boiled for 5 min. Samples were diluted with 1% IGEPAL CA-630 buffer for a final concentration of 0.1% SDS prior to incubation with immobilized antibody. Beads were washed four times with 0.1% IGEPAL/PBS, and proteins were eluted by boiling in nonreducing lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. For endoglycosidase-H (endo-H) treatment of precipitates, post-immunoprecipitation samples were eluted by boiling in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS. Eluates were mixed with an equal volume of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4, and either digested (or mock-digested) at 37 °C for >1 h with 1 milliunit of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) that was reconstituted in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4. For immunoblot of cell lysates, cells were lysed in 1% IGEPAL/PBS. Post-nuclear lysates were mixed with lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and 2-mercaptoethanol (1% final concentration). Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Samples were electrophoresed on NuPAGE SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Separated proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with either 5% dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), 0.1% SDS in PBS, or 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% SDS. The latter formulation (no milk) was used for the ubiquitin blots.
