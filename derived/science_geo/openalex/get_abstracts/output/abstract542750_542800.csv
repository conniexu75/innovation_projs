https://openalex.org/W2279293113,"K-Ras4B, a frequently mutated oncogene in cancer, plays an essential role in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Its C-terminal membrane-associated hypervariable region (HVR) is required for full biological activity. In the active GTP-bound state, the HVR interacts with acidic plasma membrane (PM) headgroups, whereas the farnesyl anchors in the membrane; in the inactive GDP-bound state, the HVR may interact with both the PM and the catalytic domain at the effector binding region, obstructing signaling and nucleotide exchange. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and NMR, we aim to figure out the effects of nucleotides (GTP and GDP) and frequent (G12C, G12D, G12V, G13D, and Q61H) and infrequent (E37K and R164Q) oncogenic mutations on full-length K-Ras4B. The mutations are away from or directly at the HVR switch I/effector binding site. Our results suggest that full-length wild-type GDP-bound K-Ras4B (K-Ras4BWT-GDP) is in an intrinsically autoinhibited state via tight HVR-catalytic domain interactions. The looser association in K-Ras4BWT-GTP may release the HVR. Some of the oncogenic mutations weaken the HVR-catalytic domain association in the K-Ras4B-GDP/-GTP bound states, which may facilitate the HVR disassociation in a nucleotide-independent manner, thereby up-regulating oncogenic Ras signaling. Thus, our results suggest that mutations can exert their effects in more than one way, abolishing GTP hydrolysis and facilitating effector binding.

The Ras family of small GTPases plays an essential role in signal transduction pathways that promote cellular proliferation, survival, growth, and differentiation (1.Cherfils J. Zeghouf M.

Ras behaves as a molecular switch by cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. Ras activity and subsequent signal propagation are initiated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that catalyze the exchange of GDP by GTP and are terminated by GTPase activating proteins. GTPase activating proteins accelerate by 5 orders of magnitude GTP hydrolysis compared with the intrinsic GTPase activity, which does not contribute significantly to steady-state levels of Ras-GTP (3.Bos J.L.

Oncogenic mutations, most commonly observed at amino acid residues Gly-12, Gly-13, and Gln-61, render Ras in a constitutively active GTP-bound state (10.Cox A.D. Fesik S.W. Kimmelman A.C. Luo J.

Accumulating evidence indicates that K-Ras (86%) is the most frequently mutated isoform in Ras-driven cancers followed by N-Ras (11%) and H-Ras (3%) (13.Prior I.A. Lewis P.D. Mattos C. A comprehensive survey of ras mutations in cancer.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 2457-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The sequences of Ras isoforms in their catalytic domains are extremely conserved (sequence identity >89%) (14.Castellano E. Santos E.

The diversity of HVR sequences may provide some clues for isoform-specific differences in network signaling and oncogenic potential. K-Ras4B is modified by farnesylation at Cys-185 within the conserved C-terminal CAAX box (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic amino acid; X, any amino acid) (15.Long S.B. Casey P.J. Beese L.S.

This post-translational modification together with the polybasic stretch of the HVR that forms electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged phospholipids in the inner plasma membrane (PM) leaflet allows K-Ras4B to insert the prenyl group in the HVR into a disordered PM (16.Brunsveld L.

Combining computational and experimental studies, we recently showed that the HVR post-translational modifications in K-Ras4B play a pivotal role in targeting microdomains of the PM, suggesting an additional function for HVR in regulation of Ras signaling (17.Jang H.

Previously, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Thapar et al. (30.Thapar R. Williams J.G. Campbell S.L. NMR characterization of full-length farnesylated and non-farnesylated H-Ras and its implications for Raf activation.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1391-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) revealed that the HVR of H-Ras transiently interacts with the catalytic domain. Furthermore, based on NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, we hypothesized that the HVR is modulated by the K-Ras4B catalytic domain in a nucleotide-dependent manner (31.Abraham S.J. Nolet R.P. Calvert R.J. Anderson L.M. Gaponenko V. The hypervariable region of K-Ras4B is responsible for its specific interactions with calmodulin.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7575-7583Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the details of the interactions of the HVR with the catalytic domain in the GDP-/GTP-bound forms of Ras remained unresolved. In particular, little is understood about how the oncogenic mutations affect the HVR of full-length Ras. Here, we mainly focus on the association of the HVR with the catalytic domain in solution. Based on earlier NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations data (32.Chavan T.S. Jang H. Khavrutskii L. Abraham S.J. Banerjee A. Freed B.C. Johannessen L. Tarasov S.G. Gaponenko V. Nussinov R. Tarasova N.I. High affinity interaction of K-Ras4B hypervariable region with Ras active site.Biophys. J. 2015; 10.1158/1538–7445.AM2014–3224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), two different full-length K-Ras4B1–185 (hereafter simply referred as K-Ras4B) conformations for the GTP- and the GDP-bound state were selected as initial models. 200 ns of explicit solvent MD simulations were performed for each of the 32 systems (Table 1, in total 6.4 μs), including wild-type K-Ras4B-GTP/GDP (K-Ras4BWT-GTP/GDP) and their mutants (K-Ras4BMut-GTP/GDP) in frequent (G12C, G12D, G12V, G13D, and Q61H) and infrequent (E37K and R164Q) oncogenic states. The simulations show that in solution, K-Ras4BWT-GDP exists in an autoinhibited form characterized by tight interactions between the HVR and the catalytic domain. The HVR partially overlaps the Ras effector binding region and in one conformational species forms an antiparallel β sheet with the β2 strand of the catalytic domain. Upon GTP loading, the HVR associates loosely with the catalytic domain, indicating a lower autoinhibition threshold in K-Ras4BWT-GTP. Some of the oncogenic mutations attenuate the association of the HVR with the catalytic domain, which may facilitate the release of the HVR from the catalytic domain in a nucleotide-independent manner. The attenuation of the HVR-catalytic domain interactions is much stronger for the K-Ras4B-GTP mutants than for the K-Ras4B-GDP mutants. To date, oncogenic mutations were assumed to exert their effects only directly on the catalytic domain. Here, for the first time, our data elucidate how specific oncogenic mutations affect the structural and dynamic behavior of the HVR of K-Ras4B by direct or longer range interactions. We show an additional, previously overlooked, mechanism that contributes to Ras signaling by exposing the switch I/effector binding region, which is occluded by the HVR under physiological conditions. These observations underscore the double-thronged nature of the mutations. They can exert their effects in more than one way, abolishing GTP hydrolysis and facilitating effector binding. Although the bulk of the results are derived from extensive simulations, our NMR data support the two types of HVR-mediated exposure by oncogenic mutations: direct (E37K) and longer range interactions (the most oncogenic mutation, G12D).TABLE 1Summary of MD simulation systems (each system ran for 200 ns)System nameIonsWater numbersTotal atomsr.m.s.d.Full-lengthCatalytic domainHVRÅSimulation of full-length K-Ras4B-GTP based on Model 1 WT K-Ras4B-GTP06,61422,8533.28 ± 0.351.73 ± 0.248.32 ± 1.04 G12C K-Ras4B-GTP07,13024,4057.34 ± 0.531.26 ± 0.1020.99 ± 1.21 G12D K-Ras4B-GTP17,13424,4196.05 ± 0.201.59 ± 0.0916.99 ± 0.51 G12V K-Ras4B-GTP07,13224,4163.48 ± 0.191.53 ± 0.189.36 ± 0.51 G13D K-Ras4B-GTP16,62622,8953.83 ± 0.701.52 ± 0.1611.13 ± 1.10 E37K K-Ras4B-GTP26,68623,0784.60 ± 0.711.88 ± 0.257.68 ± 0.69 Q61H K-Ras4B-GTP06,61722,8626.71 ± 0.271.85 ± 0.1819.17 ± 0.67 R164Q K-Ras4B-GTP16,58122,7484.84 ± 0.201.55 ± 0.1313.27 ± 0.29Simulation of full-length K-Ras4B-GTP based on Model 2 WT K-Ras4B-GTP05,95920,8883.06 ± 0.171.58 ± 0.125.24 ± 0.36 G12C K-Ras4B-GTP06,49722,5064.10 ± 0.281.31 ± 0.158.79 ± 0.91 G12D K-Ras4B-GTP16,49122,4903.31 ± 0.411.45 ± 0.335.20 ± 0.63 G12V K-Ras4B-GTP06,48522,47511.00 ± 0.701.74 ± 0.2431.42 ± 1.96 G13D K-Ras4B-GTP15,93420,8192.88 ± 0.231.66 ± 0.253.89 ± 0.40 E37K K-Ras4B-GTP25,89220,6967.28 ± 0.231.73 ± 0.1021.77 ± 0.68 Q61H K-Ras4B-GTP05,93720,8222.78 ± 0.561.64 ± 0.108.87 ± 1.81 R164Q K-Ras4B-GTP16,02121,0683.02 ± 0.321.69 ± 0.108.23 ± 0.94Simulation of full-length K-Ras4B-GDP based on Model 1 WT K-Ras4B-GDP15,40719,2293.53 ± 0.511.55 ± 0.138.80 ± 1.65 G12C K-Ras4B-GDP15,41819,2663.14 ± 0.302.00 ± 0.256.13 ± 1.12 G12D K-Ras4B-GDP05,42219,2783.79 ± 0.221.50 ± 0.089.33 ± 0.67 G12V K-Ras4B-GDP15,44219,3434.20 ± 0.592.30 ± 0.469.08 ± 1.32 G13D K-Ras4B-GDP05,41719,2632.50 ± 0.251.58 ± 0.135.03 ± 0.85 E37K K-Ras4B-GDP35,41119,2508.10 ± 1.801.53 ± 0.1525.09 ± 3.19 Q61H K-Ras4B-GDP15,41619,2563.51 ± 0.511.84 ± 0.138.43 ± 1.31 R164Q K-Ras4B-GDP05,27718,8313.36 ± 0.271.31 ± 0.109.26 ± 0.97Simulation of full-length K-Ras4B-GDP based on Model 2 WT K-Ras4B-GDP15,00218,0143.85 ± 0.462.20 ± 0.137.30 ± 1.50 G12C K-Ras4B-GDP15,01218,0484.19 ± 1.082.24 ± 0.1410.48 ± 3.07 G12D K-Ras4B-GDP05,01918,0693.48 ± 0.482.03 ± 0.126.47 ± 1.47 G12V K-Ras4B-GDP15,04318,1463.44 ± 0.322.47 ± 0.615.67 ± 1.58 G13D K-Ras4B-GDP04,98117,9554.99 ± 0.591.77 ± 0.1211.90 ± 1.98 E37K K-Ras4B-GDP35,09318,2965.50 ± 0.882.87 ± 0.2013.51 ± 1.02 Q61H K-Ras4B-GDP15,00418,0205.30 ± 0.202.12 ± 0.1413.13 ± 0.61 R164Q K-Ras4B-GDP04,98517,9554.18 ± 0.522.77 ± 0.268.20 ± 0.79 Open table in a new tab The catalytic domains of K-Ras4B in complex with a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue (GppNHp) (PDB ID 3GFT) and GDP (PDB ID 4EPT) (33.Sun Q.

The differences of NMR chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) between the full-length (residues 1–185) and the truncated catalytic domain (residues 1–166) in its GDP/GTPγS-bound forms (data deposited in Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank, ID 26635) showed that in the GDP-bound K-Ras4B, most of the changes are observed in the switch I and effector binding regions, β2, and in the C-terminal helix, β5 (32.Chavan T.S.

This indicates that the C-terminal HVR associates extensively with the catalytic domain in the GDP-bound state. However, in the GTPγS-bound form, only very few changes occur in the switch I and effector binding regions (Ile-36) and in proximity to the N-terminal portion (Ser-17 and Ala-18) (32.Chavan T.S.

Based on these observations, we generated four different initial configurations of each K-Ras4B-GTP/GDP with a covalently connected HVR to His-166 for the MD simulations. The analysis of the interaction energy between the HVR and the catalytic domain for each initial configuration revealed that the two models of each K-Ras4B-GDP/GTP are the best conformations of the HVR interacting with the catalytic domain. Therefore, we selected the two models, referred to as models 1 and 2, of each K-Ras4B-GDP/GTP as the templates to investigate the effects of oncogenic mutations on the conformational dynamics of the HVR. Models 1 and 2 of K-Ras4BWT-GDP correspond to the previous configurations 2 and 3 of K-Ras4BWT-GDP, whereas models 1 and 2 of K-Ras4BWT-GTP correspond to the previous configurations 3 and 4 of K-Ras4BWT-GTP (32.Chavan T.S.

Biol. 2014; 9: 2447-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) is 0.82 Å and 1.17 Å for all the Cα atoms, respectively, suggesting subtle conformational differences between the catalytic domains of K-Ras4BWT-GppNHp and K-Ras4BG12D-GppNHp as well as those of K-Ras4BWT-GDP and K-Ras4BG12D-GDP. Based on these data, coupled with the unavailability of crystal structures of other mutant K-Ras4B structures, the G12C, G12D, G12V, G13D, E37K, Q61H, and R164Q of each K-Ras4B-GTP/GDP were constructed using the wild-type models. The AMBER ff03 (35.Hornak V. Abel R. Okur A. Strockbine B. Roitberg A. Simmerling C. Comparison of multiple amber force fields and development of improved protein backbone parameters.Proteins. 2006; 65: 712-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar) force field was assigned for the proteins. The parameters for GTP and GDP were taken from the AMBER parameter database. The proteins were solvated in a truncated octahedral box with TIP3P (36.Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D.

Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29878) Google Scholar) water molecules; the box size was set to ensure a distance of at least 10 Å between the protein and the box boundaries. The systems were neutralized using counterions. Apart from neutralizing ions and one cofactor, Mg2+, no other ions were used in the simulations, which excludes a screening effect and likely increases the electrostatic interactions compared with the physiological setting. MD simulations were performed using the AMBER 11 package (37.Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The Amber biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6516) Google Scholar). To remove bad contacts in the solvated systems, all systems were subjected to 2000 steps of the steepest descent energy minimization followed by 3000 steps of the conjugate gradient energy minimization with a positional restraint of 500 kcal mol−1 Å−2 imposed on the heavy atoms of the proteins (38.Lu S.

Subsequently, the entire system was minimized without any restraints. After minimization, each system was heated gradually from 0 K to 300 K within 300 ps. This was followed by constant temperature equilibration at 300 K for 700 ps, with a positional restraint of 10 kcal mol−1 Å−2 in the complex in a canonical NVT ensemble. A total of 6.4-μs MD simulations was performed with periodic boundary conditions using the NPT ensemble; each system was simulated for 200 ns (Table 1). Langevin dynamics (39.Wu X. Brooks B.R. Self-guided Langevin dynamics simulation method.Chem. Phys. Lett. 2003; 381: 512-518Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar) was used to maintain the temperature at 300 K with a collision frequency of 1 ps−1, and a Langevin piston was assigned to maintain the pressure at 1 atm. An integration step of 2 fs was set for the MD simulations. Long range electrostatic interactions were incorporated by using the particle mesh Ewald method (40.Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. Particle mesh Ewald: an N·log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20818) Google Scholar). A cut-off equal to 10 Å was used for short range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. The SHAKE method (41.Ryckaert J.-P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. Numerical integration of the cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of n-alkanes.J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16900) Google Scholar) was applied to constrain all covalent bonds that involve hydrogen atoms. To produce the G12D and E37K mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length recombinant G12D and E37K K-Ras4B mutants were expressed in BL 21 AI Escherichia coli cells and purified according to the published protocol (42.Abraham S.J. Muhamed I. Nolet R. Yeung F. Gaponenko V. Expression, purification, and characterization of soluble K-Ras4B for structural analysis.Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 73: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cells were grown overnight at 18 °C, and K-Ras4B expression was induced with a final isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentration of 0.2 mm along with 0.2% arabinose in M9 media containing 15NH4Cl (CIL Inc.). The protein was purified on Ni2+-Sepharose beads (Pierce). SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was used to determine the purity of the protein. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C using Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer fitted with a cryogenic probe. The NMR buffer contained 10% D2O, 50 mm Tris citrate (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Sparky (University of California San Francisco) was used for all K-Ras4B assignments based on CBCACONH and NHCACB NMR spectra. Data processing was done with the NMRPipe software (43.Delaglio F.

The mean chemical shift differences were calculated as Δ δ NH = ( Δ δ 1 H N ) 2 + ( Δ δ 15 N ) 5 / 25 2 (Eq. 1) Only those chemical shift differences (Δδ) that were greater than the sum of the average of all chemical shift differences and 1 S.D. were considered to"
https://openalex.org/W2178453614,"Transcription factor Runx2 controls bone development and osteoblast differentiation by regulating expression of a significant number of bone-related target genes. Here, we report that transcriptional activation and repression of the Runx2 gene via its osteoblast-specific P1 promoter (encoding mRNA for the Runx2/p57 isoform) is accompanied by selective deposition and elimination of histone marks during differentiation of mesenchymal cells to the osteogenic and myoblastic lineages. These epigenetic profiles are mediated by key components of the Trithorax/COMPASS-like and Polycomb group complexes together with histone arginine methylases like PRMT5 and lysine demethylases like JARID1B/KDM5B. Importantly, knockdown of the H3K4me2/3 demethylase JARID1B, but not of the demethylases UTX and NO66, prevents repression of the Runx2 P1 promoter during myogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells. The epigenetically forced expression of Runx2/p57 and osteocalcin, a classical bone-related target gene, under myoblastic-differentiation is accompanied by enrichment of the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks at the Runx2 P1 promoter region. Our results identify JARID1B as a key component of a potent epigenetic switch that controls mesenchymal cell fate into myogenic and osteogenic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2203026251,"Pseudomonas fluorescens PCL1751 is a rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of a greenhouse-grown tomato plant in Uzbekistan. It controls several plant root diseases caused by Fusarium fungi through the mechanism of competition for nutrients and niches (CNN). This mechanism does not rely on the production of antibiotics, so it avoids the concerns of resistance development and is environmentally safe. Additionally, this bacterium promotes plant growth by alleviating salt stress for its plant host. To investigate the genetic mechanisms that may explain these observations, we determined the complete genome sequence of this bacterium, examined its gene content, and performed comparative genomics analysis with other Pseudomonas strains. The genome of P. fluorescens PCL1751 consisted of one circular chromosome that is 6,143,950 base-pairs (bp) in size; no plasmid was found. The annotation included 19 rRNA, 70 tRNA, and 5,534 protein-coding genes. The gene content analysis identified a large number of genes involved in chemotaxis and motility, colonization of the rhizosphere, siderophore biosynthesis, and osmoprotectant production. In contrast, the pathways involved in the biosynthesis of phytohormones or antibiotics were not found. Comparison with other Pseudomonas genomes revealed extensive variations in their genome size and gene content. The presence and absence of secretion system genes were highly variable. As expected, the synteny conservation among strains decreased as a function of phylogenetic divergence. The integration of prophages appeared to be an important driver for genome rearrangements. The whole-genome gene content analysis of this plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) provided some genetic explanations to its phenotypic characteristics. The extensive and versatile substrate utilization pathways, together with the presence of many genes involved in competitive root colonization, provided further support for the finding that this strain achieves biological control of pathogens through effective competition for nutrients and niches."
https://openalex.org/W2222230415,"Intense exercise training is a powerful stimulus that activates mitochondrial biogenesis pathways and thus increases mitochondrial density and oxidative capacity. Moderate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during exercise are considered vital in the adaptive response, but high ROS production is a serious threat to cellular homeostasis. Although biochemical markers of the transition from adaptive to maladaptive ROS stress are lacking, it is likely mediated by redox sensitive enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism. One potential enzyme mediating such redox sensitivity is the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase. In this study, we examined biopsy specimens of vastus lateralis and triceps brachii in healthy volunteers, together with primary human myotubes. An intense exercise regimen inactivated aconitase by 55-72%, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by 50-65%. In the vastus, the mitochondrial dysfunction was compensated for by a 15-72% increase in mitochondrial proteins, whereas H2O2 emission was unchanged. In parallel with the inactivation of aconitase, the intermediary metabolite citrate accumulated and played an integral part in cellular protection against oxidative stress. In contrast, the triceps failed to increase mitochondrial density, and citrate did not accumulate. Instead, mitochondrial H2O2 emission was decreased to 40% of the pretraining levels, together with a 6-fold increase in protein abundance of catalase. In this study, a novel mitochondrial stress response was highlighted where accumulation of citrate acted to preserve the redox status of the cell during periods of intense exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2226054946,"Oxathiapiprolin is a new oomycide (piperidinyl thiazole isoxazoline class) discovered by DuPont which controls diseases caused by oomycete plant pathogens. It binds in the oxysterol-binding protein domain of Oomycetes. Growth chambers studies with detached leaves and potted plants showed remarkable activity of oxathiapiprolin against Pseudoperonospora cubensis in cucurbits. The compound affected all stages in the asexual life cycle of the pathogen. It inhibited zoospore release, cystospore germination, lesion formation, lesion expansion, sporangiophore development and sporangial production. When applied to the foliage as a preventive spray no lesions developed due to inhibition of zoospore release and cystospore germination, and when applied curatively, at one or two days after inoculation, small restricted lesions developed but no sporulation occurred. When applied later to mature lesions, sporulation was strongly inhibited. Oxathiapiprolin suppressed sporulation of P. cubensis in naturally-infected leaves. It exhibited trans-laminar activity, translocated acropetaly from older to younger leaves, and moved from the root system to the foliage. Seed coating was highly effective in protecting the developed cucumber plants against downy mildew. UV microscopy observations made with cucumber leaves infected with P. cubensis revealed that inhibition of mycelium growth and sporulation induced by oxathiapiprolin was associated with callose encasement of the haustoria."

In the cardiac sarcomere, both cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) and troponin-I (cTnI) are prominent myofilament targets of PKA. Treatment of permeabilized myocardium with PKA induces enhanced myofilament length-dependent activation (LDA), the cellular basis of the Frank-Starling cardiac regulatory mechanism. It is not known, however, which of these targets mediates the altered LDA and to what extent. Here, we employed two genetic mouse models in which the three PKA sites in cMyBP-C were replaced with either phospho-mimic (DDD) or phospho-null (AAA) residues. AAA- or DDD-permeabilized myocytes (n = 12–17) were exchanged (∼93%) for recombinant cTnI in which the two PKA sites were mutated to either phospho-mimic (DD) or phospho-null (AA) residues. Force-[Ca2+] relationships were determined at two sarcomere lengths (SL = 1.9 μm and SL = 2.3 μm). Data were fit to a modified Hill equation for each individual cell preparation at each SL. LDA was indexed as ΔEC50, the difference in [Ca2+] required to achieve 50% force activation at the two SLs. We found that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cMyBP-C and cTnI each independently contribute to enhance myofilament length-dependent activation properties of the cardiac sarcomere, with relative contributions of ∼67 and ∼33% for cMyBP-C for cTnI, respectively. We conclude that β-adrenergic stimulation enhances the Frank-Starling regulatory mechanism predominantly via cMyBP-C PKA-mediated phosphorylation.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/p38 MAPK pathway regulates stress levels in the brain of these mice and showed that: 1) the ratio of free ASK1 to thioredoxin (Trx)-bound ASK1 is relatively lower in the transgenic brain whereas the reverse is true for the Klotho knockout mice; 2) the reduced p38 activation level in the transgene corresponds to higher level of ASK1-bound Trx, while the KO mice showed elevated p38 activation and lower level of–bound Trx; and 3) that 14-3-3ζ is hyper phosphorylated (Ser-58) in the transgene which correlated with increased monomer forms. In addition, we evaluated the in vivo robustness of the protection by challenging the brains of Klotho transgenic mice with a neurotoxin, MPTP and analyzed for residual neuron numbers and integrity in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Our results show that Klotho overexpression significantly protects dopaminergic neurons against oxidative damage, partly by modulating p38 MAPK activation level. Our data highlight the importance of ASK1/p38 MAPK pathway in the brain and identify Klotho as a possible anti-oxidant effector."
https://openalex.org/W2186986921,"Selenoproteins are a unique group of proteins that contain selenium in the form of selenocysteine (Sec) co-translationally inserted in response to a UGA codon with the help of cis- and trans-acting factors. Mammalian selenoproteins contain single Sec residues, with the exception of selenoprotein P (SelP) that has 7–15 Sec residues depending on species. Assessing an individual’s selenium status is important under various pathological conditions, which requires a reliable selenium biomarker. Due to a key role in organismal selenium homeostasis, high Sec content, regulation by dietary selenium, and availability of robust assays in human plasma, SelP has emerged as a major biomarker of selenium status. Here, we found that Cys is present in various Sec positions in human SelP. Treatment of cells expressing SelP with thiophosphate, an analog of the selenium donor for Sec synthesis, led to a nearly complete replacement of Sec with Cys, whereas supplementation of cells with selenium supported Sec insertion. SelP isolated directly from human plasma had up to 8% Cys inserted in place of Sec, depending on the Sec position. These findings suggest that a change in selenium status may be reflected in both SelP concentration and its Sec content, and that availability of the SelP-derived selenium for selenoprotein synthesis may be overestimated under conditions of low selenium status due to replacement of Sec with Cys."
https://openalex.org/W4232291661,"Introduction The association between glucose intolerance, elevated blood pressure and abnormal lipid levels is well established and comprises the basis of metabolic syndrome pathophysiology. We hypothesize that abnormal preconception lipid levels are associated with the increased risk of severe pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods We included all singleton deliveries (n = 27,721) of women without known cardiovascular morbidity and preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus during previous pregnancies. Association between preconception low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc level≤50 mg/dL), high triglycerides (level≥150 mg/dL) and the primary outcome (composite of gestational diabetes mellitus/or preeclampsia) was assessed using Generalized Estimation Equations. Results Primary outcome of preeclampsia and/or gestational diabetes was observed in a total of 3,243 subjects (11.7%). Elevated triglycerides and low HDLc were independently associated with the primary outcome: with odds ratio (OR) of 1.61 (95% CI 1.29–2.01) and OR = 1.33 (95% CI 1.09–1.63), respectively, after adjusting for maternal age, weight, blood pressure, repeated abortions, fertility treatments and fasting glucose. There was an interaction between the effects of HDLc≤50 mg/dL and triglycerides≥150 mg/dL with an OR of 2.69 (95% CI 1.73–4.19). Conclusions Our analysis showed an increased rate of preeclampsia and/or gestational diabetes in women with low HDLc and high triglycerides values prior to conception. In view of the severity of these pregnancy complications, we believe this finding warrants a routine screening for the abnormal lipid profile among women of a child-bearing age."

Accordingly, we performed hepatic transcriptome profiling in mice after FOXO1 knockdown in the absence or presence of TH, and we compared these results with hepatic FOXO1 and THRB1 (TRβ1) ChIP-Seq data. We identified a subset of TH-stimulated FOXO1 target genes that required co-regulation by FOXO1 and TH. TH activation of FOXO1 was directly linked to an increase in SIRT1-MTORC2 interaction and RICTOR deacetylation. This, in turn, led to decreased AKT and FOXO1 phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W1893231737,"Oxygen is critical for optimal bone regeneration. While axolotls and salamanders have retained the ability to regenerate whole limbs, mammalian regeneration is restricted to the distal tip of the digit (P3) in mice, primates, and humans. Our previous study revealed the oxygen microenvironment during regeneration is dynamic and temporally influential in building and degrading bone. Given that regeneration is dependent on a dynamic and changing oxygen environment, a better understanding of the effects of oxygen during wounding, scarring, and regeneration, and better ways to artificially generate both hypoxic and oxygen replete microenvironments are essential to promote regeneration beyond wounding or scarring. To explore the influence of increased oxygen on digit regeneration in vivo daily treatments of hyperbaric oxygen were administered to mice during all phases of the entire regenerative process. Micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) and histological analysis showed that the daily application of hyperbaric oxygen elicited the same enhanced bone degradation response as two individual pulses of oxygen applied during the blastema phase. We expand past these findings to show histologically that the continuous application of hyperbaric oxygen during digit regeneration results in delayed blastema formation at a much more proximal location after amputation, and the deposition of better organized collagen fibers during bone formation. The application of sustained hyperbaric oxygen also delays wound closure and enhances bone degradation after digit amputation. Thus, hyperbaric oxygen shows the potential for positive influential control on the various phases of an epimorphic regenerative response."
https://openalex.org/W2111502453,"We present a novel strategy to identify drug-repositioning opportunities. The starting point of our method is the generation of a signature summarising the consensual transcriptional response of multiple human cell lines to a compound of interest (namely the seed compound). This signature can be derived from data in existing databases, such as the connectivity-map, and it is used at first instance to query a network interlinking all the connectivity-map compounds, based on the similarity of their transcriptional responses. This provides a drug neighbourhood, composed of compounds predicted to share some effects with the seed one. The original signature is then refined by systematically reducing its overlap with the transcriptional responses induced by drugs in this neighbourhood that are known to share a secondary effect with the seed compound. Finally, the drug network is queried again with the resulting refined signatures and the whole process is carried on for a number of iterations. Drugs in the final refined neighbourhood are then predicted to exert the principal mode of action of the seed compound. We illustrate our approach using paclitaxel (a microtubule stabilising agent) as seed compound. Our method predicts that glipizide and splitomicin perturb microtubule function in human cells: a result that could not be obtained through standard signature matching methods. In agreement, we find that glipizide and splitomicin reduce interphase microtubule growth rates and transiently increase the percentage of mitotic cells-consistent with our prediction. Finally, we validated the refined signatures of paclitaxel response by mining a large drug screening dataset, showing that human cancer cell lines whose basal transcriptional profile is anti-correlated to them are significantly more sensitive to paclitaxel and docetaxel."
https://openalex.org/W2283708611,"Inflammation by IL-8-induced neutrophil recruitment and apoptosis of epithelial cells by decreased expression of VEGF have been suggested as one of the complicated pathogenic mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The role of neutrophil elastase (NE) in the development of COPD is also well known. However, little is known about how they interact. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of NE on cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced IL-8 and VEGF production and its molecular mechanism in bronchial epithelial cells. CSE increased both IL-8 and VEGF production in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). Although NE significantly enhanced CSE-induced IL-8 production, it suppressed VEGF production. This differential regulation was not CSE-specific. The effect of NE on IL-8 production, but not VEGF, was ERK-dependent. Interestingly, in contrast to decreased VEGF protein expression, NE accelerated VEGF transcription by CSE, suggesting post-translational modification. When cells were incubated with purified NE, it was detected in the cytoplasm, suggesting the intracellular translocation of NE. Furthermore, NE fragmented recombinant human VEGF in vitro but not recombinant human IL-8. These results indicate that VEGF down-regulation is due to direct degradation by NE, which is translocated into cells. Similar to in vitro cell experiments, elastase treatment increased CSE-induced IL-8; however, it suppressed VEGF production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of CSE-treated mice. Moreover, elastase treatment enhanced CSE-induced emphysema in mice. Considering the actions of IL-8 and VEGF, our results suggest that NE contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD by enhancing inflammation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2340010069,"It has been proposed that the APC/CCdh1 functions as a tumor suppressor by maintaining genomic stability. However, the exact nature of genomic instability following loss of Cdh1 is unclear. Using biochemistry and live cell imaging of single cells we found that Cdh1 knockdown (kd) leads to strong nuclear stabilization of the substrates cyclin A and B and deregulated kinetics of DNA replication. Restoration of the Cdh1-dependent G2 DNA damage checkpoint did not result in G2 arrest but blocked cells in prometaphase, suggesting that these cells enter mitosis despite incomplete replication. This results in DNA double-strand breaks, anaphase bridges, cytokinesis defects and tetraploidization. Tetraploid cells are the source of supernumerary centrosomes following Cdh1-kd, leading to multipolar mitosis or centrosome clustering, in turn resulting in merotelic attachment and lagging chromosomes. Whereas some of these events cause apoptosis during mitosis, surviving cells may accumulate chromosomal aberrations."
https://openalex.org/W2426832038,"Suppression of detachment-induced cell death, known as anoikis, is an essential step for cancer metastasis to occur. We report here that expression of KLF12, a member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors, is downregulated in lung cancer cell lines that have been selected to grow in the absence of cell adhesion. Knockdown of KLF12 in parental cells results in decreased apoptosis following cell detachment from matrix. KLF12 regulates anoikis by promoting the cell cycle transition through S phase and therefore cell proliferation. Reduced expression levels of KLF12 results in increased ability of lung cancer cells to form tumours in vivo and is associated with poorer survival in lung cancer patients. We therefore identify KLF12 as a novel metastasis-suppressor gene whose loss of function is associated with anoikis resistance through control of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1921794939,"How do the various anatomical parts (modules) of the animal body evolve into very different integrated forms (integration) yet still function properly without decreasing the individual's survival? This long-standing question remains unanswered for multiple reasons, including lack of consensus about conceptual definitions and approaches, as well as a reasonable bias toward the study of hard tissues over soft tissues. A major difficulty concerns the non-trivial technical hurdles of addressing this problem, specifically the lack of quantitative tools to quantify and compare variation across multiple disparate anatomical parts and tissue types. In this paper we apply for the first time a powerful new quantitative tool, Anatomical Network Analysis (AnNA), to examine and compare in detail the musculoskeletal modularity and integration of normal and abnormal human upper and lower limbs. In contrast to other morphological methods, the strength of AnNA is that it allows efficient and direct empirical comparisons among body parts with even vastly different architectures (e.g. upper and lower limbs) and diverse or complex tissue composition (e.g. bones, cartilages and muscles), by quantifying the spatial organization of these parts-their topological patterns relative to each other-using tools borrowed from network theory. Our results reveal similarities between the skeletal networks of the normal newborn/adult upper limb vs. lower limb, with exception to the shoulder vs. pelvis. However, when muscles are included, the overall musculoskeletal network organization of the upper limb is strikingly different from that of the lower limb, particularly that of the more proximal structures of each limb. Importantly, the obtained data provide further evidence to be added to the vast amount of paleontological, gross anatomical, developmental, molecular and embryological data recently obtained that contradicts the long-standing dogma that the upper and lower limbs are serial homologues. In addition, the AnNA of the limbs of a trisomy 18 human fetus strongly supports Pere Alberch's ill-named ""logic of monsters"" hypothesis, and contradicts the commonly accepted idea that birth defects often lead to lower integration (i.e. more parcellation) of anatomical structures."
https://openalex.org/W2189916494,"In pancreatic β-cells, voltage-gated potassium 2.1 (Kv2.1) channels are the dominant delayed rectifier potassium channels responsible for action potential repolarization. Here, we report that leptin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes known to inhibit insulin secretion, causes a transient increase in surface expression of Kv2.1 channels in rodent and human β-cells. The effect of leptin on Kv2.1 surface expression is mediated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of AMPK mimics whereas inhibition of AMPK occludes the effect of leptin. Inhibition of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β, a known upstream kinase of AMPK, also blocks the effect of leptin. In addition, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is involved in Kv2.1 channel trafficking regulation. Inhibition of PKA prevents leptin or AMPK activators from increasing Kv2.1 channel density, whereas stimulation of PKA is sufficient to promote Kv2.1 channel surface expression. The increased Kv2.1 surface expression by leptin is dependent on actin depolymerization, and pharmacologically induced actin depolymerization is sufficient to enhance Kv2.1 surface expression. The signaling and cellular mechanisms underlying Kv2.1 channel trafficking regulation by leptin mirror those reported recently for ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, which are critical for coupling glucose stimulation with membrane depolarization. We show that the leptin-induced increase in surface KATP channels results in more hyperpolarized membrane potentials than control cells at stimulating glucose concentrations, and the increase in Kv2.1 channels leads to a more rapid repolarization of membrane potential in cells firing action potentials. This study supports a model in which leptin exerts concerted trafficking regulation of KATP and Kv2.1 channels to coordinately inhibit insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2197545912,"Background The PI3K-AKT pathway is frequently activated in breast cancer. PIK3CA mutations are most frequently found in the helical (exon 9) and kinase (exon 20) domains of this protein. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of different types of PIK3CA mutations in combination with molecular biomarkers related to PI3K-AKT signaling in patients with early breast cancer. Methods Tumor tissue samples from 1008 early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in two similar randomized trials of HeCOG were examined. Tumors were subtyped with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH for ER, PgR, Ki67, HER2 and androgen receptor (AR). PIK3CA mutations were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (exon 20) and qPCR (exon 9) (Sanger/qPCR mutations). In 610 cases, next generation sequencing (NGS) PIK3CA mutation data were also available. PIK3CA mutations and PTEN protein expression (IHC) were analyzed in luminal tumors (ER and/or PgR positive), molecular apocrine carcinomas (MAC; ER/PgR negative / AR positive) and hormone receptor (ER/PgR/AR) negative tumors. Results PIK3CA mutations were detected in 235/1008 tumors (23%) with Sanger/qPCR and in 149/610 tumors (24%) with NGS. Concordance between the two methods was good with a Kappa coefficient of 0.76 (95% CI 0.69–0.82). Lobular histology, low tumor grade and luminal A tumors were associated with helical domain mutations (PIK3CAhel), while luminal B with kinase domain mutations (PIK3CAkin). The overall incidence of PIK3CA mutations was higher in luminal as compared to MAC and hormone receptor negative tumors (p = 0.004). Disease-free and overall survival did not significantly differ with respect to PIK3CA mutation presence and type. However, a statistically significant interaction between PIK3CA mutation status and PTEN low protein expression with regard to prognosis was identified. Conclusions The present study did not show any prognostic significance of specific PIK3CA mutations in a large group of predominantly lymph-node positive breast cancer women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Further analyses in larger cohorts are warranted to investigate possible differential effect of distinct PIK3CA mutations in small subgroups of patients."
https://openalex.org/W1829109861,"The function of the bZIP transcription factors is strictly dependent on their ability to dimerize. Heterodimerization has proven to be highly specific and is postulated to operate as a combinatorial mechanism allowing the generation of a large variety of dimers with unique qualities by specifically combining a small set of monomers; an assumption that has not yet been tested systematically. Here, the interaction pattern and the transactivation properties of 16 Arabidopsis thaliana bZIPs are examined in transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts to deliver a perspective on the relationship between bZIP dimerization and function. An interaction matrix of bZIPs belonging to the C, G, H, and S1 bZIP groups was resolved by Bimolecular Fluorescent Complementation (BiFC) coupled to quantitative flow cytometric analysis, while an extensive GUS reporter gene assay was carried out to determine the effect of different bZIP pairs on the expression of four different known bZIP-targeted promoters. Statistical data treatment and complementary bioinformatic analysis were performed to substantiate the biological findings. According to these results, the 16 bZIPs interact in three isolated networks, within which their members dimerize non-specifically and exhibit a significant level of functional redundancy. A coherent explanation for these results is supported by in silico analysis of differences in the length, structure and composition of their leucine zippers and appears to explain their dimerization specificity and dynamics observed in vivo quite well. A model in which the bZIP networks act as functional units is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2192837316,"The Commission on Investing in Health published its report, GlobalHealth2035, in 2013, estimating an investment case for a grand convergence in health outcomes globally. In support of the drafting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we estimate what the grand convergence investment case might achieve-and what investment would be required-by 2030.Our projection focuses on a sub-set of low-income (LIC) or lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). We start with a country-based (bottom-up) analysis of the costs and impact of scaling up reproductive, maternal, and child health tools, and select HIV and malaria interventions. We then incorporate global (top-down) analyses of the costs and impacts of scaling up existing tools for tuberculosis, additional HIV interventions, the costs to strengthen health systems, and the costs and benefits from scaling up new health interventions over the time horizon of this forecast. These data are then allocated to individual countries to provide an aggregate projection of potential cost and impact at the country level. Finally, incremental costs of R&D for low-income economies and the costs of addressing NTDs are added to provide a global total cost estimate of the investment scenario.Compared with a constant coverage scenario, there would be more than 60 million deaths averted in LIC and 70 million deaths averted in LMIC between 2016 and 2030. For the years 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030, the incremental costs of convergence in LIC would be (US billion) $24.3, $21.8, $24.7, and $27, respectively; in LMIC, the incremental costs would be (US billion) $34.75, $38.9, $48.7, and $56.3, respectively.Key health outcomes in low- and low-middle income countries can significantly converge with those of wealthier countries by 2030, and the notion of a ""grand convergence"" may serve as a unifying theme for health indicators in the SDGs."
https://openalex.org/W2193860999,"One week of treatment with EGF and gastrin (EGF/G) was shown to restore normoglycemia and to induce islet regeneration in mice treated with the diabetogenic agent alloxan. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration are not fully understood. We performed genetic lineage tracing experiments to evaluate the contribution of beta cell neogenesis in this model. One day after alloxan administration, mice received EGF/G treatment for one week. The treatment could not prevent the initial alloxan-induced beta cell mass destruction, however it did reverse glycemia to control levels within one day, suggesting improved peripheral glucose uptake. In vitro experiments with C2C12 cell line showed that EGF could stimulate glucose uptake with an efficacy comparable to that of insulin. Subsequently, EGF/G treatment stimulated a 3-fold increase in beta cell mass, which was partially driven by neogenesis and beta cell proliferation as assessed by beta cell lineage tracing and BrdU-labeling experiments, respectively. Acinar cell lineage tracing failed to show an important contribution of acinar cells to the newly formed beta cells. No appearance of transitional cells co-expressing insulin and glucagon, a hallmark for alpha-to-beta cell conversion, was found, suggesting that alpha cells did not significantly contribute to the regeneration. An important fraction of the beta cells significantly lost insulin positivity after alloxan administration, which was restored to normal after one week of EGF/G treatment. Alloxan-only mice showed more pronounced beta cell neogenesis and proliferation, even though beta cell mass remained significantly depleted, suggesting ongoing beta cell death in that group. After one week, macrophage infiltration was significantly reduced in EGF/G-treated group compared to the alloxan-only group. Our results suggest that EGF/G-induced beta cell regeneration in alloxan-diabetic mice is driven by beta cell neogenesis, proliferation and recovery of insulin. The glucose-lowering effect of the treatment might play an important role in the regeneration process."
https://openalex.org/W2253003772,"Protein splicing mediated by inteins is a self-processive reaction leading to the excision of the internal intein domain from a precursor protein and the concomitant ligation of the flanking sequences, the extein-N and extein-C parts, thereby reconstituting the host protein.

We report the novel GOS-TerL split intein identified from metagenomic databases as the first intein harboring the combination of Ser1 and Cys+1 residues. Mutational analysis showed that its efficient splicing reaction indeed follows the shift from oxoester to thioester and thus represents a rare diversion from the canonical pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2183607710,"Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious complication of preterm birth. Plasma N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has been suggested as a marker that may predict BPD within a few days after birth. Objectives To investigate the association between NT-proBNP day three and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death and further to assess the impact of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on this association in neonates born before 32 gestational weeks. Methods A cohort study of 183 neonates born before 32 gestational weeks consecutively admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. On day three plasma samples were collected and echocardiography carried out. NT-proBNP was measured by routine immunoassays. The combined outcome BPD or death was assessed at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the discrimination ability of NT-proBNP by the natural log continuous measure to recognize BPD or death. The association of BPD or death was assessed in relation to natural log NT-proBNP levels day three. Results The risk of BPD or death increased 1.7-fold with one unit increase of natural log NT-proBNP day three when adjusted for gestational age at birth (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.3; 2.3). The association was found both in neonates with and without a PDA. Adjusting for GA, PDA diameter, LA:Ao-ratio, or early onset sepsis did not change the estimate. Conclusion We found NT-proBNP to be associated with BPD or death in very preterm neonates. This association was not only explained by the PDA. We speculate that NT-proBNP may help the identification of neonates at risk of BPD as early as postnatal day three."
https://openalex.org/W2215790934,"Objective To investigate changes of muscle recruitment and coordination following constraint-induced movement therapy, constraint-induced movement therapy plus electrical stimulation, and traditional occupational therapy in treating hand dysfunction. Methods In a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial, children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to receive constraint-induced movement therapy (n = 22), constraint-induced movement therapy plus electrical stimulation (n = 23), or traditional occupational therapy (n = 23). Three groups received a 2-week hospital-based intervention and a 6-month home-based exercise program following hospital-based intervention. Constraint-induced movement therapy involved intensive functional training of the involved hand during which the uninvolved hand was constrained. Electrical stimulation was applied on wrist extensors of the involved hand. Traditional occupational therapy involved functional unimanual and bimanual training. All children underwent clinical assessments and surface electromyography (EMG) at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Surface myoelectric signals were integrated EMG, root mean square and cocontraction ratio. Clinical measures were grip strength and upper extremity functional test. Results Constraint-induced movement therapy plus electrical stimulation group showed both a greater rate of improvement in integrated EMG of the involved wrist extensors and cocontraction ratio compared to the other two groups at 3 and 6 months, as well as improving in root mean square of the involved wrist extensors than traditional occupational therapy group (p<0.05). Positive correlations were found between both upper extremity functional test scores and integrated EMG of the involved wrist as well as grip strength and integrated EMG of the involved wrist extensors (p<0.05). Conclusions Constraint-induced movement therapy plus electrical stimulation is likely to produce the best outcome in improving muscle recruitment and coordination in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy compared to constraint-induced movement therapy alone or traditional occupational therapy.

The concomitant occurrence of neuroblastoma and adrenocortical tumors in pediatric patients harboring the p.R337H mutation at our institution prompted us to investigate the putative association between p.R337H and pediatric neuroblastoma. Genomic DNA samples from 83 neuroblastoma patients referred to a single institution during the period of 2000–2014 were screened for the p.R337H mutation. Available samples from carriers were investigated for both nuclear p53 accumulation and loss of heterozigosity in tumor. Clinical data were obtained from medical records in order to assess the impact of 337H allele on manifestation of the disease. Seven out 83 neuroblastoma patients (8.4%) were carriers of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in our cohort. Immunohistochemical analysis of p.R337H-positive tumors revealed nuclear p53 accumulation. Loss of heterozigosity was not found among available samples. The presence of 337H allele was associated with increased proportion of stage I tumors. Our data indicate that in addition to adrenocortical tumors, choroid plexus carcinoma, breast cancer and osteosarcoma, genetic counseling and clinical surveillance should consider neuroblastoma as a potential neoplasia affecting p.R337H carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2096809186,"Epsilon toxin (Etx) is one of the major lethal toxins produced by Clostridium perfringens types B and D, being the causal agent of fatal enterotoxemia in animals, mainly sheep and goats. Etx is synthesized as a non-active prototoxin form (proEtx) that becomes active upon proteolytic activation. Etx exhibits a cytotoxic effect through the formation of a pore in the plasma membrane of selected cell targets where Etx specifically binds due to the presence of specific receptors. However, the identity and nature of host receptors of Etx remain a matter of controversy. In the present study, the interactions between Etx and membrane lipids from the synaptosome-enriched fraction from rat brain (P2 fraction) and MDCK cell plasma membrane preparations were analyzed. Our findings show that both Etx and proEtx bind to lipids extracted from lipid rafts from the two different models as assessed by protein-lipid overlay assay. Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Binding of proEtx to sulfatide, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol (3)-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol (5)-phosphate was detected. Removal of the sulphate groups via sulfatase treatment led to a dramatic decrease in Etx-induced cytotoxicity, but not in proEtx-GFP binding to MDCK cells or a significant shift in oligomer formation, pointing to a role of sulfatide in pore formation in rafts but not in toxin binding to the target cell membrane. These results show for the first time the interaction between Etx and membrane lipids from host tissue and point to a major role for sulfatides in C. perfringens epsilon toxin pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2228555256,"The Chief Medical Officer for England recommends that healthcare workers have a seasonal influenza vaccination in an attempt to protect both patients and NHS staff. Despite this, many healthcare workers do not have a seasonal influenza vaccination. Social network analysis is a well-established research approach that looks at individuals in the context of their social connections. We examine the effects of social networks on influenza vaccination decision and disease dynamics.We used a social network analysis approach to look at vaccination distribution within the network of the Lancaster Medical School students and combined these data with the students' beliefs about vaccination behaviours. We then developed a model which simulated influenza outbreaks to study the effects of preferentially vaccinating individuals within this network.Of the 253 eligible students, 217 (86%) provided relational data, and 65% of responders had received a seasonal influenza vaccination. Students who were vaccinated were more likely to think other medical students were vaccinated. However, there was no clustering of vaccinated individuals within the medical student social network. The influenza simulation model demonstrated that vaccination of well-connected individuals may have a disproportional effect on disease dynamics.This medical student population exhibited vaccination coverage levels similar to those seen in other healthcare groups but below recommendations. However, in this population, a lack of vaccination clustering might provide natural protection from influenza outbreaks. An individual student's perception of the vaccination coverage amongst their peers appears to correlate with their own decision to vaccinate, but the directionality of this relationship is not clear. When looking at the spread of disease within a population it is important to include social structures alongside vaccination data. Social networks influence disease epidemiology and vaccination campaigns designed with information from social networks could be a future target for policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W2290372617,"Despite abundant data supporting c-Src as a metastasis-promoting oncogene, activating mutations of c-Src are rare. This suggests that trans-interacting proteins may have a critical role in regulating c-Src activation. Here, we first report the discovery of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding glutamic acid-rich-like protein (SH3BGRL), a novel c-Src activator in mice. Ectopic expression of murine SH3BGRL (mSH3BGRL) strongly promoted both tumor cell invasion and lung metastasis. Molecularly, mSH3BGRL specifically bound the inactive form of c-Src phosphorylated at Tyr527, promoting Tyr416 phosphorylation of c-Src and subsequent FAK-mediated activation of ERK and AKT signaling pathways. Targeting endogenous c-Src alone was sufficient to abolish mSH3BGRL-induced cancer metastasis in vivo. Unexpectedly, human SH3BGRL (hSH3BGRL) in turn suppressed tumorigenesis and metastasis in nature. We attempted site-specific reversion of hSH3BGRL amino-acid sequence to mSH3BGRL and found V108A substitution sufficient to restore SH3BGRL function as a c-Src activator and metastasis promoter. Notably, the somatic mutation R76C of hSH3BGRL can similarly act as hSH3BGRL-V108A and mSH3BGRL in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our results uncover an evolutionarily controversial role of SH3BGRL in driving tumor metastasis through c-Src activation, and suggests that hSH3BGRL mutation status could be relevant to cancer diagnosis and therapy."

Methods Households were selected using stratified multi-stage sampling. In all selected households women aged 15–49 were eligible. In every second household men aged 15–59 were also eligible. Participants were asked to consent for anonymous HIV testing. All participants interviewed and tested were analysed. Multiple logistic regression identified associations with HIV infection, undiagnosed infection and with ever having a voluntary HIV test among sexually active participants. Results Of 7495 invited 86% (6,475) agreed to an interview and HIV test. Among 96 HIV positive participants, 78% had never taken a voluntary HIV test so were unaware of their serostatus, and 86% were sexually active in the last 12 months among whom 96% did not use a condom at last intercourse. 11% of all participants had previously voluntarily tested. Among women who had tested, 60% did so in antenatal care. We found that those living in an urban area, and those previously married, were more likely to be HIV infected. Voluntary HIV testing was more common in those aged 25–44, living in an urban area, females, having secondary or higher education, having first sexual intercourse at age 17 years or older, and using condoms at last sex. Although 82% of men and 69% of women had heard of HIV, only 35% and 29% respectively had heard of antiretroviral therapy. Conclusions The HIV prevalence in Sierra Leone has been stable. HIV testing, however, is uncommon and most infected individuals are unaware of their serostatus. This could allow the epidemic to escalate as individuals with undiagnosed infection are unlikely to change their behaviour or access treatment. Improving knowledge and increasing testing need to remain central to HIV prevention interventions in Sierra Leone."

Here, we report a novel approach to model the initiation of Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis that exploits the developmental and pluripotent potential of human embryonic stem cells. The inducible expression of EWS-FLI1 in embryoid bodies, or collections of differentiating stem cells, generates cells with properties of Ewing sarcoma tumors, including characteristics of transformation. These cell lines exhibit anchorage-independent growth, a lack of contact inhibition and a strong Ewing sarcoma gene expression signature. Furthermore, these cells also demonstrate a requirement for the persistent expression of EWS-FLI1 for cell survival and growth, which is a hallmark of Ewing sarcoma tumors."

Patients were grouped as having PAD only, AAA only, or both AAA and PAD. Differences in cAIx measurements between the three patient groups were tested by non-parametric tests and stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis to investigate associations with obstructive or aneurysmatic patterns of vascular disease.In the study sample of 184 patients, 130 had PAD only, 20 had AAA only, and 34 patients had both AAA and PAD.

It was significantly higher in females (35.2 ± 6.1, n = 55) than males (28.4 ± 8.2, n = 129), and significantly higher in patients over 80 years of age (34.4 ± 6.9, n = 22) than in those under 80 years (30.0 ± 8.2, n = 162). Intergroup comparison revealed a significant difference in cAIx between the three patient groups (AAA: 27.3 ± 9.5; PAD: 31.4 ± 7.8; AAA & PAD: 28.8 ± 8.5). cAIx was significantly lower in patients with AAA, higher in patients with both AAA and PAD, and highest in patients with PAD only (beta = 0.21, p = 0.006).Non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness in high-risk patients indicates that cAIx differs according to the pattern of vascular disease.

We proceeded to validate the oncogenic role of JRK in colon cancer cells and primary tumors. Consistent with a β-catenin activator function, depletion of JRK in several cancer cell lines repressed β-catenin transcriptional activity and reduced cell proliferation. Importantly, JRK expression was aberrantly elevated in 21% of colorectal cancers, 15% of breast and ovarian cancers and was associated with increased expression of β-catenin target genes and increased cell proliferation. This study shows that JRK is required for β-catenin hyperactivity regardless of the adenomatous polyposis coli/β-catenin mutation status and targeting JRK presents new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2302195020,"ClC-K chloride channels are crucial for auditory transduction and urine concentration. Mutations in CLCNKB, the gene encoding the renal chloride channel hClC-Kb, cause Bartter syndrome type III, a human genetic condition characterized by polyuria, hypokalemia, and alkalosis. In recent years, several Bartter syndrome-associated mutations have been described that result in truncations of the intracellular carboxyl terminus of hClC-Kb. We here used a combination of whole-cell patch clamp, confocal imaging, co-immunoprecipitation, and surface biotinylation to study the functional consequences of a frequent CLCNKB mutation that creates a premature stop codon at Trp-610. We found that W610X leaves the association of hClC-Kb and the accessory subunit barttin unaffected, but impairs its regulation by barttin. W610X attenuates hClC-Kb surface membrane insertion. Moreover, W610X results in hClC-Kb channel opening in the absence of barttin and prevents further barttin-mediated activation. To describe how the carboxyl terminus modifies the regulation by barttin we used V166E rClC-K1. V166E rClC-K1 is active without barttin and exhibits prominent, barttin-regulated voltage-dependent gating. Electrophysiological characterization of truncated V166E rClC-K1 demonstrated that the distal carboxyl terminus is necessary for slow cooperative gating. Since barttin modifies this particular gating process, channels lacking the distal carboxyl-terminal domain are no longer regulated by the accessory subunit. Our results demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of hClC-Kb is not part of the binding site for barttin, but functionally modifies the interplay with barttin. The loss-of-activation of truncated hClC-Kb channels in heterologous expression systems fully explains the reduced basolateral chloride conductance in affected kidneys and the clinical symptoms of Bartter syndrome patients.

https://openalex.org/W1899677798,"Meeting the future food security challenge without further sacrificing environmental integrity requires transformative changes in managing the key biophysical determinants of increasing agronomic productivity and reducing the environmental footprint. Here, we focus on Chinese rice production and quantitatively address this concern by conducting 403 on-farm trials across diverse rice farming systems. Inherent soil productivity, management practices and rice farming type resulted in confounded and interactive effects on yield, yield gaps and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (N2O, CH4 and CO2-equivalent) with both trade-offs and compensating effects. Advances in nitrogen, water and crop management (Best Management Practices—BMPs) helped closing existing yield gaps and resulted in a substantial reduction in CO2-equivalent emission of rice farming despite a tradeoff of increase N2O emission. However, inherent soil properties limited rice yields to a larger extent than previously known. Cultivating inherently better soil also led to lower GHG intensity (GHG emissions per unit yield). Neither adopting BMPs only nor improving soils with low or moderate productivity alone can adequately address the challenge of substantially increasing rice production while reducing the environmental footprint. A combination of both represents the most efficient strategy to harness the combined-benefits of enhanced production and mitigating climate change. Extrapolating from our farm data, this strategy could increase rice production in China by 18%, which would meet the demand for direct human consumption of rice by 2030. It would also reduce fertilizer nitrogen consumption by 22% and decrease CO2-equivalent emissions during the rice growing period by 7% compared with current farming practice continues. Benefits vary by rice-based cropping systems. Single rice systems have the largest food provision benefits due to its wider yield gap and total cultivated area, whereas double-rice system (especially late rice) contributes primarily to reducing GHG emissions. The study therefore provides farm-based evidence for feasible, practical approaches towards achieving realistic food security and environmental quality targets at a national scale."
https://openalex.org/W1896958355,"Parenchymal transection represents a crucial step during liver surgery and many different techniques have been described so far. Stapler resection is supposed to be faster than CUSA resection. However, whether speed impacts on the inflammatory response in patients undergoing liver resection (LR) remains unclear.This is a randomized controlled trial including 40 patients undergoing anatomical LR. Primary endpoint was transection speed (cm2/min). Secondary endpoints included the perioperative change of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, overall surgery duration, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality.Mean transection speed was significantly higher in patients undergoing stapler hepatectomy compared to CUSA resection (CUSA: 1 (0.4) cm2/min vs. Stapler: 10.8 (6.1) cm2/min; p<0.0001). Analyzing the impact of surgery duration on inflammatory response revealed a significant correlation between IL-6 levels measured at the end of surgery and the overall length of surgery (p<0.0001, r = 0.6188). Patients undergoing CUSA LR had significantly higher increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) after parenchymal transection compared to patients with stapler hepatectomy in the portal and hepatic veins, respectively (p = 0.028; p = 0.044). C-reactive protein levels on the first post-operative day were significantly lower in the stapler cohort (p = 0.010). There was a trend towards a reduced overall surgery time in patients with stapler LR, especially in the subgroup of patients undergoing minor hepatectomies (p = 0.020).Liver resection using staplers is fast, safe and suggests a diminished inflammatory response probably due to a decreased parenchymal transection time.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01785212."
https://openalex.org/W2221319669,"Oncogenic, activating mutations in KRAS initiate pancreatic cancer. There are, however, two other Ras family members, Nras and Hras, which can be activated in the presence of oncogenic Kras. The role of these wild-type Ras proteins in cancer remains unclear, as their disruption has been shown to enhance or inhibit tumorigenesis depending upon the context. As pancreatic cancer is critically dependent upon Ras signaling, we tested and now report that loss of Hras increases tumor load and reduces survival in an oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse model. These effects were traced to the earliest stages of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that wild-type Hras may suppress tumor initiation. In normal cells, activated Ras can suppress proliferation through p53-dependent mechanisms. We find that the tumor suppressive effects of Hras are nullified in a homozygous mutant p53 background. As such, loss of wild-type Hras fosters the earliest stages of pancreatic cancer in a p53-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2283928271,"We investigated the association of ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), interarm blood pressure (BP) difference and interankle BP difference, obtained by simultaneous four-limb BP measurement, with history of stroke in a Chinese adult population.This cross-sectional study included 1485 participants aged ≥35 years in the framework of the China Hypertension Survey. We performed simultaneous four-limb BP measurement using oscillometric devices with the participants in the supine position and calculated ABI and interarm/interankle BP differences between the 4 limbs. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of these BP parameters and other factors with a history of stroke.In univariate analyses, participants with ABI <0.9, interarm BP difference ≥15 mmHg, and interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg had a higher prevalence of stroke than those without (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0152, p = 0.002, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analyses suggested, ABI <0.9 was independently associated with a history of stroke after adjustment for interarm BP difference ≥15 mmHg, interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg, and traditional risk factors for stroke (p = 0.001). An interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg was associated with prior stroke after the two variables of hypertension and ABI were removed from the logistic regression model (p = 0.0142). Net reclassification improvement analysis showed that inclusion of interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg to the independent risk factors (age, family history of stroke, hypertension, and ABI) improved net reclassification by 11.92%.ABI <0.9 is an independent risk factor for stroke prevalence in Chinese adults and it just detected a small propotion of paticipants. The addition of interankle BP difference ≥10 mmHg to the independent risk factors for stroke may improve the prediction of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2207423776,"Substantial progress has been made in reducing childhood mortality worldwide from 1990-2015 (Millennium Development Goal, target 4). Achieving target goals on this however remains a challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya's infant mortality rates are higher than the global average and are more pronounced in urban areas as compared to rural areas. Only limited knowledge exists about the differences in individual level risk factors for infant death among rural, non-slum urban, and slum areas in Kenya. Therefore, this paper aims at 1) assess individual and socio-ecological risk factors for infant death in Kenya, and at 2) identify whether living in rural, non-slum urban, or slum areas moderated individual or socio-ecological risk factors for infant death in Kenya.We used a cross-sectional study design based on the most recent Kenya Population and Housing Census of 2009 and extracted the records of all females who had their last child born in 12 months preceding the survey (N = 1,120,960). Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify risk factors that accounted for the risk of dying before the age of one at the individual level in Kenya. Place of residence (rural, non-slum urban, slum) was used as an interaction term to account for moderating effects in individual and socio-ecological risk factors.Individual characteristics of mothers and children (older age, less previously born children that died, better education, girl infants) and household contexts (better structural quality of housing, improved water and sanitation, married household head) were associated with lower risk for infant death in Kenya. Living in non-slum urban areas was associated with significantly lower infant death as compared to living in rural or slum areas, when all predictors were held at their reference levels. Moreover, place of residence was significantly moderating individual level predictors: As compared to rural areas, living in urban areas was a protective factor for mothers who had previous born children who died, and who were better educated. However, living in urban areas also reduced the health promoting effects of better structural quality of housing (i.e. poor or good versus non-durable). Furthermore, durable housing quality in urban areas turned out to be a risk factor for infant death as compared to rural areas. Living in slum areas was also a protective factor for mothers with previous child death, however it also reduced the promoting effects of older ages in mothers.While urbanization and slum development continues in Kenya, public health interventions should invest in healthy environments that ideally would include improvements to access to safe water and sanitation, better structural quality of housing, and to access to education, health care, and family planning services, especially in urban slums and rural areas. In non-slum urban areas however, health education programs that target healthy diets and promote physical exercise may be an important adjunct to these structural interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2210261478,"The sources of water and corresponding delivery mechanisms to groundwater-fed fens are not well understood due to the multi-scale geo-morphologic variability of the glacial landscape in which they occur. This lack of understanding limits the ability to effectively conserve these systems and the ecosystem services they provide, including biodiversity and water provisioning. While fens tend to occur in clusters around regional groundwater mounds, Ives Road Fen in southern Michigan is an example of a geographically-isolated fen. In this paper, we apply a multi-scale groundwater modeling approach to understand the groundwater sources for Ives Road fen. We apply Transition Probability geo-statistics on more than 3000 well logs from a state-wide water well database to characterize the complex geology using conditional simulations. We subsequently implement a 3-dimensional reverse particle tracking to delineate groundwater contribution areas to the fen. The fen receives water from multiple sources: local recharge, regional recharge from an extensive till plain, a regional groundwater mound, and a nearby pond. The regional sources deliver water through a tortuous, 3-dimensional ""pipeline"" consisting of a confined aquifer lying beneath an extensive clay layer. Water in this pipeline reaches the fen by upwelling through openings in the clay layer. The pipeline connects the geographically-isolated fen to the same regional mound that provides water to other fen clusters in southern Michigan. The major implication of these findings is that fen conservation efforts must be expanded from focusing on individual fens and their immediate surroundings, to studying the much larger and inter-connected hydrologic network that sustains multiple fens."
https://openalex.org/W2241311495,"Anemia is an important risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, higher hemoglobin (Hb) is not necessarily better, as seen in several studies. This study aimed to validate the clinical use of an Hb target of 10-11 g/dL in Korean HD patients.A total of 1,276 HD patients from the Clinical Research Center (CRC) for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) were investigated in a prospective observational study. Cox proportional hazard analysis was conducted for each category of time-dependent Hb level and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose, with subgroup analysis stratified by age and diabetes status.Using a reference Hb level of 10-11 g/dL, the hazard ratios (HRs) of death were 5.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62-10.02, P <0.05) for Hb level <9.0 g/dL, and 2.03 (CI, 1.16-3.69, P <0.05) for Hb level 9.0-10.0 g/dL, after adjustment for multiple clinical variables. However, an Hb level ≥11 g/dL was not associated with decreased mortality risk. In an adjusted model categorized by Hb and ESA dose, the risk of death at an Hb level <10 g/dL and a higher dose of ESA (≥126 U/kg/week) had an HR of 2.25 (CI, 1.03-4.92, P <0.05), as compared to Hb level 10-11 g/dL and a lower dose of ESA. In subgroup analysis, those older than 65 years or who were diabetic had greater risk for mortality only in Hb category <9.0 g/dL. However, there was no significant interaction between age or diabetes status and Hb.Using CRC-ESRD data, we validated the association between Hb and ESA dose and mortality in Korean HD patients. The clinical practice target of an Hb of 10-11 g/dL before the new KDIGO guideline era seems reasonable considering its survival benefit in HD patients."

Patients with PCOS (n = 335) and controls (n = 354) were recruited in this study. Genetic variants of HSD11B1 (rs846908) and H6PD (rs6688832 and rs17368528) were analyzed by TaqMan method.We found a significantly 0.79-fold lower risk of G allele of rs6688832 in control group compared with the patients with PCOS (adjusted OR, 0.79; 95%CI = 0.63-0.99; P = 0.040). Additionally, significant difference in the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) was observed between AA and AG genotype in rs6688832. The rs6688832 AG genotype was associated with lower level of FSH (P = 0.039) and higher risk of hyperandrogenism (P = 0.016) in patients with PCOS. When all subjects were divided into different subgroups according to age and body mass index (BMI), we found that the frequency of G allele of rs6688832 was significantly higher in controls than that in PCOS patients in the subgroup of BMI > 23 (adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI = 0.50-0.98; P = 0.037).Our findings showed a statistical association between H6PD rs6688832 and PCOS risk in Chinese population. The G allele of rs6688832 in H6PD might exert potential genetic protective role against the development of PCOS, especially in overweight women. PCOS patients with AG genotype of rs6688832 might confer risk to the phenotype of hyperandrogenemia of PCOS."

https://openalex.org/W2262086248,"NF-κB is a major inflammatory response mediator in the liver, playing a key role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury. We investigated zonal as well as liver cell type-specific distribution of NF-κB activation across the liver acinus following adaptation to chronic ethanol intake and 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx). We employed immunofluorescence staining, digital image analysis and statistical distributional analysis to quantify subcellular localization of NF-κB in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We detected significant spatial heterogeneity of NF-κB expression and cellular localization between cytoplasm and nucleus across liver tissue. Our main aims involved investigating the zonal bias in NF-κB localization and determining to what extent chronic ethanol intake affects this zonal bias with in hepatocytes at baseline and post-PHx. Hepatocytes in the periportal area showed higher NF-κB expression than in the pericentral region in the carbohydrate-fed controls, but not in the ethanol group. However, the distribution of NF-κB nuclear localization in hepatocytes was shifted towards higher levels in pericentral region than in periportal area, across all treatment conditions. Chronic ethanol intake shifted the NF-κB distribution towards higher nuclear fraction in hepatocytes as compared to the pair-fed control group. Ethanol also stimulated higher NF-κB expression in a subpopulation of HSCs. In the control group, PHx elicited a shift towards higher NF-κB nuclear fraction in hepatocytes. However, this distribution remained unchanged in the ethanol group post-PHx. HSCs showed a lower NF-κB expression following PHx in both ethanol and control groups. We conclude that adaptation to chronic ethanol intake attenuates the liver zonal variation in NF-κB expression and limits the PHx-induced NF-κB activation in hepatocytes, but does not alter the NF-κB expression changes in HSCs in response to PHx. Our findings provide new insights as to how ethanol treatment may affect cell-type specific processes regulated by NF-κB activation in liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W2227082660,"Females homozygous for the Purkinje cell degeneration mutation (pcd) are fertile, although the success rate is much lower than in the wild type. We performed detailed analysis of reproductive abnormalities of pcd females. The number of oocytes produced following exogenous gonadotropin treatment was much lower in pcd3J-/- females than in pcd3J+/+ females. Furthermore, the estrous cyclicity of pcd3J-/- females according to the appearance of the vagina was almost undetectable comparing to that of the wild type. Histological analyses and follicle counting of 4- and 8-week-old pcd3J-/- ovaries showed an increase in the number of secondary follicles and a decrease in the number of antral follicles, indicating that AGTPBP1/ CCP1 plays an important role in the development of secondary follicles into antral follicles. Consistent with a previous analysis of the pcd cerebellum, pcd3J-/- ovaries also showed a clear increase in the level of polyglutamylation. Gene expression analysis showed that both oocytes and cumulus cells express CCP1. However, Ccp4 and CCP6, which can compensate the function of CCP1, were not expressed in mouse ovaries. Failure of microtubule deglutamylation did not affect the structure and function of the meiotic spindle in properly aligning chromosomes in the center of the nucleus during meiosis in pcd3J-/- females. We also showed that the pituitary-derived growth and reproduction-related endocrine system functions normally in pcd3J-/- mice. The results of this study provide insight into additional functions of CCP1, which cannot be fully explained by the side chain deglutamylation of microtubules alone."
https://openalex.org/W2200443532,"Parameters of the two-parameter logistic model are generally estimated via the expectation-maximization algorithm, which improves initial values for all parameters iteratively until convergence is reached. Effects of initial values are rarely discussed in item response theory (IRT), but initial values were recently found to affect item parameters when estimating the latent distribution with full non-parametric maximum likelihood. However, this method is rarely used in practice. Hence, the present study investigated effects of initial values on item parameter bias and on recovery of item characteristic curves in BILOG-MG 3, a widely used IRT software package. Results showed notable effects of initial values on item parameters. For tighter convergence criteria, effects of initial values decreased, but item parameter bias increased, and the recovery of the latent distribution worsened. For practical application, it is advised to use the BILOG default convergence criterion with appropriate initial values when estimating the latent distribution from data."
