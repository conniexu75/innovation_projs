https://openalex.org/W2964849163,"The human reference genome represents only a small number of individuals, which limits its usefulness for genotyping. We present a method named HISAT2 (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts 2) that can align both DNA and RNA sequences using a graph Ferragina Manzini index. We use HISAT2 to represent and search an expanded model of the human reference genome in which over 14.5 million genomic variants in combination with haplotypes are incorporated into the data structure used for searching and alignment. We benchmark HISAT2 using simulated and real datasets to demonstrate that our strategy of representing a population of genomes, together with a fast, memory-efficient search algorithm, provides more detailed and accurate variant analyses than other methods. We apply HISAT2 for HLA typing and DNA fingerprinting; both applications form part of the HISAT-genotype software that enables analysis of haplotype-resolved genes or genomic regions. HISAT-genotype outperforms other computational methods and matches or exceeds the performance of laboratory-based assays. A graph-based genome indexing scheme enables variant-aware alignment of sequences with very low memory requirements."

Here, we assess the performance of a massively parallel droplet-based method for mapping transposase-accessible chromatin in single cells using sequencing (scATAC-seq). We apply scATAC-seq to obtain chromatin profiles of more than 200,000 single cells in human blood and basal cell carcinoma. In blood, application of scATAC-seq enables marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity and reconstruction of trajectories of cellular differentiation. In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory program that governs intratumoral CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development. We anticipate that scATAC-seq will enable the unbiased discovery of gene regulatory factors across diverse biological systems. A droplet-based single-cell ATAC-seq method enables rapid mapping of chromatin accessibility in tens of thousands of cells."

The rumen is a specialized stomach that is adapted to the breakdown of plant-derived complex polysaccharides. The genomes of the rumen microbiota encode thousands of enzymes adapted to digestion of the plant matter that dominates the ruminant diet. We assembled 4,941 rumen microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using approximately 6.5 terabases of short- and long-read sequence data from 283 ruminant cattle. We present a genome-resolved metagenomics workflow that enabled assembly of bacterial and archaeal genomes that were at least 80% complete. Of note, we obtained three single-contig, whole-chromosome assemblies of rumen bacteria, two of which represent previously unknown rumen species, assembled from long-read data. Using our rumen genome collection we predicted and annotated a large set of rumen proteins. Our set of rumen MAGs increases the rate of mapping of rumen metagenomic sequencing reads from 15% to 50–70%. These genomic and protein resources will enable a better understanding of the structure and functions of the rumen microbiota.

https://openalex.org/W2963544910,"The epicardium and its derivatives provide trophic and structural support for the developing and adult heart. Here we tested the ability of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived epicardium to augment the structure and function of engineered heart tissue in vitro and to improve efficacy of hESC-cardiomyocyte grafts in infarcted athymic rat hearts. Epicardial cells markedly enhanced the contractility, myofibril structure and calcium handling of human engineered heart tissues, while reducing passive stiffness compared with mesenchymal stromal cells. Transplanted epicardial cells formed persistent fibroblast grafts in infarcted hearts. Cotransplantation of hESC-derived epicardial cells and cardiomyocytes doubled graft cardiomyocyte proliferation rates in vivo, resulting in 2.6-fold greater cardiac graft size and simultaneously augmenting graft and host vascularization. Notably, cotransplantation improved systolic function compared with hearts receiving either cardiomyocytes alone, epicardial cells alone or vehicle. The ability of epicardial cells to enhance cardiac graft size and function makes them a promising adjuvant therapeutic for cardiac repair."
https://openalex.org/W2965851198,"Sustained silencing of gene expression throughout the brain using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has not been achieved. Here we describe an siRNA architecture, divalent siRNA (di-siRNA), that supports potent, sustained gene silencing in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice and nonhuman primates following a single injection into the cerebrospinal fluid. Di-siRNAs are composed of two fully chemically modified, phosphorothioate-containing siRNAs connected by a linker. In mice, di-siRNAs induced the potent silencing of huntingtin, the causative gene in Huntington’s disease, reducing messenger RNA and protein throughout the brain. Silencing persisted for at least 6 months, with the degree of gene silencing correlating to levels of guide strand tissue accumulation. In cynomolgus macaques, a bolus injection of di-siRNA showed substantial distribution and robust silencing throughout the brain and spinal cord without detectable toxicity and with minimal off-target effects. This siRNA design may enable RNA interference-based gene silencing in the CNS for the treatment of neurological disorders. A divalent siRNA architecture enables sustained silencing of gene expression in deep regions of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2966048051,"Chromatin regulation through histone modifications plays an essential role in coordinated expression of multiple genes. Alterations in chromatin induced by histone modifiers and readers regulate critical transcriptional programs involved in both normal development and tumor differentiation. Recently, we identified that histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC7 are necessary to maintain cancer stem cells (CSCs) in both breast and ovarian tumors. Here, we sought to investigate the CSC-specific function of HDAC1 and HDAC7 mechanistically by using a stem-like breast cancer (BrCa) cell model BPLER and matched nonstem tumor cell (nsTC)-like HMLER, along with conventional BrCa cell lines with different CSC enrichment levels. We found that HDAC1 and HDAC3 inhibition or knockdown results in HDAC7 downregulation, which is associated with a decrease in histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at transcription start sites (TSS) and super-enhancers (SEs) prominently in stem-like BrCa cells. Importantly, these changes in chromatin landscape also correlate with the repression of many SE-associated oncogenes, including c-MYC, CD44, CDKN1B, SLUG, VDR, SMAD3, VEGFA, and XBP1. In stem-like BrCa cells, HDAC7 binds near TSS and to SEs of these oncogenes where it appears to contribute to both H3K27ac and transcriptional regulation. These results suggest that HDAC7 inactivation, directly or through inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3, can result in the inhibition of the CSC phenotype by downregulating multiple SE-associated oncogenes. The CSC selective nature of this mechanism and the prospect of inhibiting multiple oncogenes simultaneously makes development of HDAC7 specific inhibitors a compelling objective."
https://openalex.org/W2965362584,"There is much interest in delineating the mechanisms by which the α-synuclein protein accumulates in brains of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Preclinical studies with rodent and primate models have indicated that fibrillar forms of α-synuclein can initiate the propagation of endogenous α-synuclein pathology. However, the underlying mechanisms by which α-synuclein fibrils seed pathology remain unclear. To investigate this further, we have used exogenous fibrillar α-synuclein to seed endogenous α-synuclein pathology in human neuronal cell lines, including primary human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells. Fluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses were used to monitor levels of α-synuclein and key autophagy/lysosomal proteins over time in the exogenous α-synuclein fibril-treated neurons. We observed that temporal changes in the accumulation of cytoplasmic α-synuclein inclusions were associated with changes in the key autophagy/lysosomal markers. Of note, chloroquine-mediated blockade of autophagy increased accumulation of α-synuclein inclusions, and rapamycin-induced activation of autophagy, or use of 5′-AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonists, promoted the clearance of fibril-mediated α-synuclein pathology. These results suggest a key role for autophagy in clearing fibrillar α-synuclein pathologies in human neuronal cells. We propose that our findings may help inform the development of human neural cell models for screening of potential therapeutic compounds for PD or for providing insight into the mechanisms of α-synuclein propagation. Our results further add to existing evidence that AMPK activation may be a therapeutic option for managing PD.

https://openalex.org/W2965790690,"To demonstrate the feasibility of robotic middle ear access in a clinical setting, nine adult patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss indicated for cochlear implantation were included in this clinical trial. A keyhole access tunnel to the tympanic cavity and targeting the round window was planned based on preoperatively acquired computed tomography image data and robotically drilled to the level of the facial recess. Intraoperative imaging was performed to confirm sufficient distance of the drilling trajectory to relevant anatomy. Robotic drilling continued toward the round window. The cochlear access was manually created by the surgeon. Electrode arrays were inserted through the keyhole tunnel under microscopic supervision via a tympanomeatal flap. All patients were successfully implanted with a cochlear implant. In 9 of 9 patients the robotic drilling was planned and performed to the level of the facial recess. In 3 patients, the procedure was reverted to a conventional approach for safety reasons. No change in facial nerve function compared to baseline measurements was observed. Robotic keyhole access for cochlear implantation is feasible. Further improvements to workflow complexity, duration of surgery, and usability including safety assessments are required to enable wider adoption of the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2965958683,"Human monogenic diabetes, caused by mutations in genes involved in beta cell development and function, has been a challenge to study because multiple mouse models have not fully recapitulated the human disease. Here, we use genome edited human embryonic stem cells to understand the most common form of monogenic diabetes, MODY3, caused by mutations in the transcription factor HNF1A. We found that HNF1A is necessary to repress an alpha cell gene expression signature, maintain endocrine cell function, and regulate cellular metabolism. In addition, we identified the human-specific long non-coding RNA, LINKA, as an HNF1A target necessary for normal mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide a possible explanation for the species difference in disease phenotypes observed with HNF1A mutations and offer mechanistic insights into how the HNF1A gene may also influence type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2966250919,"In the current research on measuring complex behaviours/phenotyping in rodents, most of the experimental design requires the experimenter to remove the animal from its home-cage environment and place it in an unfamiliar apparatus (novel environment). This interaction may influence behaviour, general well-being, and the metabolism of the animal, affecting the phenotypic outcome even if the data collection method is automated. Most of the commercially available solutions for home-cage monitoring are expensive and usually lack the flexibility to be incorporated with existing home-cages. Here we present a low-cost solution for monitoring home-cage behaviour of rodents that can be easily incorporated to practically any available rodent home-cage. To demonstrate the use of our system, we reliably predict the sleep/wake state of mice in their home-cage using only video. We validate these results using hippocampal local field potential (LFP) and electromyography (EMG) data. Our approach provides a low-cost flexible methodology for high-throughput studies of sleep, circadian rhythm and rodent behaviour with minimal experimenter interference."
https://openalex.org/W2965242241,"Tumors are composed of phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cells that often resemble various differentiation states of their lineage of origin. Within this hierarchy, it is thought that an immature subpopulation of tumor-propagating cancer stem cells (CSCs) differentiates into non-tumorigenic progeny, providing a rationale for therapeutic strategies that specifically eradicate CSCs or induce their differentiation. The clinical success of these approaches depends on CSC differentiation being unidirectional rather than reversible, yet this question remains unresolved even in prototypically hierarchical malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show in murine and human models of AML that, upon perturbation of endogenous expression of the lineage-determining transcription factor PU.1 or withdrawal of established differentiation therapies, some mature leukemia cells can de-differentiate and reacquire clonogenic and leukemogenic properties. Our results reveal plasticity of CSC maturation in AML, highlighting the need to therapeutically eradicate cancer cells across a range of differentiation states."
https://openalex.org/W2965529086,"Resilience has been highlighted as a pivotal factor in overcoming the detrimental impact of trauma. The present study tests a resilience model of trauma using risk (rumination, emotion regulation, and entrapment) and protective (perceived social support) factors in a sample of firefighters who are at heightened risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, using a cross-sectional design. Specifically, the present study focuses on perceived social support as a resilience factor against PTSD symptoms, in response to trauma exposure. The sample included 545 firefighters from six large cities in Korea, who completed the following self-report questionnaires: Life Event Checklist, Event-related Rumination Inventory, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Entrapment scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire. Exposure to traumatic events indirectly affected PTSD symptoms via intrusive rumination, emotional regulation, and perceptions of entrapment. Additionally, the mediating effects of intrusive rumination and perceptions of entrapment were moderated by perceived social support. That is, firefighters with high levels of perceived social support reported lower severity of rumination and PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that perceptions of social support may operate as a resilience factor in buffering the effects of trauma on PTSD symptoms. Perceived social support interacts with intrusive rumination and perceptions of entrapment, thereby resisting the development of PTSD symptoms."

However, incidences of obstetric complications are increased for women who conceive using ART. There has been no prospective cohort study examining the influence of endometriosis and adenomyosis on obstetric outcomes after adjusting for the confounding influence of ART therapy.This study evaluated the impact of endometriosis and adenomyosis on the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.Data were obtained from a prospective cohort study, known as the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), of the incidence of obstetric complications for women with endometriosis and adenomyosis. The data of 103,099 pregnancies that resulted in live birth or stillbirth or that were terminated through abortion between February 2011 and July 2014 in Japan were included.Women with endometriosis or adenomyosis were at increased risk for complications during pregnancy compared to those without a medical history of endometriosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 1.41) or adenomyosis (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.37 to 2.16). Our analysis showed that the adjusted ORs for obstetric complications of pregnant women who conceived naturally or after infertility treatment that did not involve ART therapy were 1.26 (CI, 1.17 to 1.35) for pregnant women with a history of endometriosis and 1.52 (CI, 1.19 to 1.94) for those with a history of adenomyosis.The presence of endometriosis and adenomyosis significantly increased the prevalence of obstetric complications after adjusting for the influence of ART outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2965697617,"γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is an enzyme located on the surface of cellular membranes and involved in GSH metabolism and maintenance of redox homeostasis. High GGT expression on tumor cells is associated with increased cell proliferation and resistance against chemotherapy. GGT inhibitors evaluated so far in clinical trials are too toxic for human use. In this study, using enzyme kinetics analyses, we demonstrate that ovothiols, 5(Nπ)-methyl thiohistidines of marine origin, act as noncompetitive inhibitors of GGT, with an apparent Ki of 21 μm, when we fixed the concentrations of the donor substrate. We found that these compounds are more potent than the known GGT inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine and are not toxic toward human embryonic cells. In particular, cellular process-specific fluorescence-based assays revealed that ovothiols induce a mixed cell-death phenotype of apoptosis and autophagy in GGT-overexpressing cell lines, including human liver cancer and chronic B leukemic cells. The findings of our study provide the basis for further development of 5-thiohistidines as therapeutics for GGT-positive tumors and highlight that GGT inhibition is involved in autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2964440191,"Zika virus (ZIKV)3 is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family that has emerged as a public health threat because of its global transmission and link to microcephaly. Currently there is no vaccine for this virus. Conversion of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol by cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has been shown to have broad antiviral properties. However, the molecular basis of induction of CH25H in humans is not known. Elucidation of signaling and transcriptional events for induction of CH25H expression is critical for designing therapeutic antiviral agents. In this study, we show that CH25H is induced by ZIKV infection or Toll-like receptor stimulation. Interestingly, CH25H is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-6, and this induction depends on the STAT1 transcription factor. Additionally, we observed that cAMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF3) weakly binds to the CH25H promoter, suggesting cooperation with STAT1. However, ZIKV-induced CH25H was independent of type I interferon. These findings provide important information for understanding how the Zika virus induces innate inflammatory responses and promotes the expression of anti-viral CH25H protein."
https://openalex.org/W2966512150,"Statistical learning (SL) difficulties have been suggested to contribute to the linguistic and non-linguistic problems observed in children with dyslexia. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that children with dyslexia experience problems with SL, but the extent of the problems is unclear. We aimed to examine the performance of children with and without dyslexia across three distinct paradigms using both on- and offline measures, thereby tapping into different aspects of SL. 100 children with and without dyslexia (aged 8–11, 50 per group) completed three SL tasks: serial reaction time (SRT), visual statistical learning (VSL), and auditory nonadjacent dependency learning (A-NADL). Learning was measured through online reaction times during exposure in all tasks, and through offline questions in the VSL and A-NADL tasks. We find significant learning effects in all three tasks, from which we conclude that, collapsing over groups, children are sensitive to the statistical structures presented in the SRT, VSL and A-NADL tasks. No significant interactions of learning effect with group were found in any of the tasks, so we cannot conclude whether or not children with dyslexia perform differently on the SL tasks than their TD peers. These results are discussed in light of the proposed SL deficit in dyslexia."

This includes visual discrimination tasks, playing chess and Go, as well as spatial navigation (Banino et al., 2018Banino A. Barry C. Uria B. Blundell C. Lillicrap T. Mirowski P. Pritzel A.

Neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence.Neuron. 2017; 95: 245-258Google Scholar), it is controversial whether both network types utilize the same fundamental principles and hence to what extent ANNs can serve as models of animal cognition (Lake et al., 2017Lake B.M. Ullman T.D. Tenenbaum J.B. Gershman S.J. Building machines that learn and think like people.Behav. Brain Sci. 2017; 40: e253Google Scholar). However, if representations and algorithms are shared between BNNs and ANNs, then ANN models could be used to guide the analysis of large-scale biological datasets that are becoming prevalent in modern neuroscience (Engert, 2014Engert F.

And indeed, studies comparing visual processing with image classification ANNs (Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014Khaligh-Razavi S.-M. Kriegeskorte N.

Emergence of grid-like representations by training recurrent neural networks to perform spatial localization.arXiv. 2018; (arXiv:1803.07770)Google Scholar) uncovered parallels in representation between ANNs and BNNs. We recently used whole-brain calcium imaging and modeling to characterize how larval zebrafish process temperature information to generate behavioral output underlying heat gradient navigation (Haesemeyer et al., 2018Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. A brain-wide circuit model of heat-evoked swimming behavior in larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2018; 98: 817-831Google Scholar). This uncovered critical neural temperature response types in the larval zebrafish hindbrain that broadly fall into two classes, ON and OFF cells that represent changes with opposing sign. Within these classes, a set of neurons reports temperature levels, while another set encodes the rate of change. Since larval zebrafish readily navigate thermal gradients (Gau et al., 2013Gau P. Poon J. Ufret-Vincenty C. Snelson C.D. Gordon S.E. Raible D.W. Dhaka A. The zebrafish ortholog of TRPV1 is required for heat-induced locomotion.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5249-5260Google Scholar, Haesemeyer et al., 2015Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. The structure and timescales of heat perception in larval zebrafish.Cell Syst. 2015; 1: 338-348Google Scholar), we now generated and trained deep convolutional neural networks to solve a heat gradient navigation task using a larval zebrafish behavioral repertoire. This approach allowed us to compare stimulus representation and processing in biological and artificial networks that solve the same behavioral task using our rich biological dataset. We found that these behavioral constraints led to striking similarities in temperature processing and representation in the ANN with the zebrafish biological circuits. Namely, the model parallels temperature representation in ON and OFF-type units as well as ANN units showing sustained and adapting responses, effectively encoding both temperature levels and rates of change. Importantly, ANN performance critically relied on units representing temperature in a fish-like manner, while other nodes were dispensable for network function. We next used the accessibility of the ANN to uncover new features of the zebrafish BNN. This allowed identification of a novel neuronal response type in the zebrafish brain that was predicted by the ANN but escaped detection in previous calcium imaging experiments. Finally, our approach generalizes since training the same ANN constrained by the C. elegans motor repertoire resulted in distinct neural representations, indicating that the behavioral means of attaining a goal can influence sensory representations. These results indicate that behavioral constraints can lead to convergence on stereotypical stimulus representations in ANNs and BNNs, and they demonstrate the utility of ANNs to gain insight into processing in biological networks. We sought comparing temperature processing in zebrafish with that of ANNs that share the same behavioral goal, namely, heat gradient navigation. We designed two convolutional neural networks with rectifying linear units; the first explicitly predicts the consequences of behaviors within a gradient (Figures 1A–1C), while the other is a reinforcement learning model enacting a behavioral policy (Figure S1B). Four seconds of sensory and behavioral history experienced during virtual gradient navigation served as inputs to the networks since this timescale matches convolutional timescales in a zebrafish circuit model (Haesemeyer et al., 2018Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. A brain-wide circuit model of heat-evoked swimming behavior in larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2018; 98: 817-831Google Scholar). We, however, did not match ANN connectivity to zebrafish circuitry to avoid constraining network representations by anatomy, but instead limit constraints as much as possible to the behavioral goal and the available motor repertoire. Previously, we observed heat-responsive neurons encoding the rate and direction of temperature change in the larval zebrafish hindbrain and that therefore allow for a simple form of prediction (Haesemeyer et al., 2018Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. A brain-wide circuit model of heat-evoked swimming behavior in larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2018; 98: 817-831Google Scholar). Inspired by this finding, we designed our first network to predict the temperature reached after enacting one of four zebrafish behavioral elements: stay in place, swim straight, turn left, or turn right (Figure 1B). Importantly, this design choice is biologically plausible given the ubiquitous importance of predictive forward models in decision making across animal phyla (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M.

Adaptive locomotor behavior in larval zebrafish.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 72Google Scholar). We subsequently trained this predictive ANN using backpropagation on training data that were generated from a random walk through a radial heat gradient by drawing swims from distributions observed during zebrafish heat gradient navigation (Haesemeyer et al., 2015Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. The structure and timescales of heat perception in larval zebrafish.Cell Syst. 2015; 1: 338-348Google Scholar). We used drop-out (Srivastava et al., 2014Srivastava N. Hinton G. Krizhevsky A. Sutskever I. Salakhutdinov R. Dropout: a simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting.J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2014; 15: 1929-1958Google Scholar) during training to mimic redundancy and noise generally observed in BNNs. Comparing hidden layer sizes (256, 512, or 1,024 units per layer), performance on a test dataset saturated with 512 hidden units per layer (Figure 1D). We therefore chose this size for our ANN, but we did not fully explore the architectural space of convolutional ANNs, and it could therefore be that much simpler architectures solve the task just as efficiently. Trained networks successfully predicted temperatures reached after typical swims with average errors <0.1°C. To use this prediction for gradient navigation, we implemented a behavioral rule that favors those actions that bring the network closer to a set target temperature (Figure S1A). Invocation of this rule after training led to efficient gradient navigation with an average distance from the target temperature of 2.4°C (SD 0.6°C) compared to an average distance of 4.6°C (SD 0.4°C) in naive networks. While larval zebrafish swim in discrete bouts occurring on average at a frequency of 1 Hz, they modulate swim frequency by temperature (Haesemeyer et al., 2015Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. The structure and timescales of heat perception in larval zebrafish.Cell Syst. 2015; 1: 338-348Google Scholar), which could be a useful feature in the context of gradient navigation. We therefore extended the network with a module controlling swim probability independent of the already trained predictive function (Figure 1B; p(Swim)). To accomplish this task, the p(Swim) module uses a set of weights to transform the output of the temperature processing branch of the network into a swim probability similar to larval zebrafish where temperature-responsive hindbrain neurons control swim probability (Haesemeyer et al., 2018Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. A brain-wide circuit model of heat-evoked swimming behavior in larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2018; 98: 817-831Google Scholar). We trained these weights using an evolutionary algorithm. Such algorithms can efficiently minimize empirical costs such as heat gradient navigation errors without needing an explicitly defined cost function as required for backpropagation. This approach led to convergence on a specific set of weights for each of 20 trained networks within 50 generations (Figure 1E; Figures S1C–S1E). Importantly, these weights led to increases in swim frequency as temperature departs from preferred values (Figure 1F), which is also observed in larval zebrafish (Gau et al., 2013Gau P. Poon J. Ufret-Vincenty C. Snelson C.D. Gordon S.E. Raible D.W. Dhaka A. The zebrafish ortholog of TRPV1 is required for heat-induced locomotion.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5249-5260Google Scholar, Haesemeyer et al., 2015Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. The structure and timescales of heat perception in larval zebrafish.Cell Syst. 2015; 1: 338-348Google Scholar, Prober et al., 2008Prober D.A. Zimmerman S. Myers B.R. McDermott Jr., B.M. Kim S.-H. Caron S. Rihel J. Solnica-Krezel L. Julius D. Hudspeth A.J. Schier A.F. Zebrafish TRPA1 channels are required for chemosensation but not for thermosensation or mechanosensory hair cell function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10102-10110Google Scholar). This enhanced navigation performance of the network (Figure 1G) reducing the average distance to the preferred temperature from 2.4°C (SD 0.6°C) to 1.7°C (SD 0.6°C). As an alternative model, we designed an ANN that directly enacts a behavioral policy consisting again of the four behavioral elements “stay in place,” “swim straight,” “turn left,” or “turn right” (Figure S1B). We trained this model via a reinforcement learning strategy that rewarded movements in a virtual heat gradient based on how they influenced the distance to the target temperature (see STAR Methods). Such networks learned to reduce navigational errors within a heat gradient (Figure S1F) and closely matched the performance of our predictive model (Figures S1F and S1G). To gain further insight into the behavioral strategy employed by the trained predictive and reinforcement learning ANN, we compared gradient navigation behavior in larval zebrafish to that of the two ANN types (Figures 1H–1H″). Larval zebrafish not only modulate their bout frequency based on current temperature but also modulate turning based on temperature changes experienced during the last swim bout. Specifically, turning is enhanced when moving up a heat gradient, effectively reorienting larval zebrafish when departing from desired temperatures (Figure 1I). Interestingly, this strategy is learned by the predictive network but absent in the reinforcement learning network (Figure 1I). The reinforcement learning network instead learned a different strategy becoming either left or right biased (cf. Figures S1I–S1I″) and thereby circling near the target temperature (Figure 1H″). While not biasing turning overall (Figures S1I and S1I′), both larval zebrafish and the predictive network string together turns of the same direction within the heat gradient. Namely, the probability of maintaining direction across following turns was initially greater than chance but decayed back to chance level in zebrafish and the predictive ANN, while no such decay was observed for the reinforcement learning ANN (Figure 1J). Such turn coherence has been reported for zebrafish spontaneous behavior as well (Dunn et al., 2016Dunn T.W. Mu Y. Narayan S. Randlett O. Naumann E.A. Yang C.-T. Schier A.F. Freeman J. Engert F. Ahrens M.B. Brain-wide mapping of neural activity controlling zebrafish exploratory locomotion.eLife. 2016; 5: e12741Google Scholar), and within a gradient it likely allows for persistent reorientation without an overall turn bias. We had previously presented time varying heat stimuli to larval zebrafish and now compared behavior generation in response to these stimuli between zebrafish and our predictive ANN. While rates of swimming in response to these stimuli only correlated with a Pearson coefficient of 0.44 between zebrafish and the ANN (Figure S1J), both zebrafish and the ANN increased turning during the rising phase of the stimulus compared to the falling phase (Figure S1K). This argues that also for faster stimulus timescales zebrafish and the predictive ANN generate comparable behavior. In summary, we designed and trained ANNs to navigate a heat gradient using both a supervised and a reinforcement learning strategy. Behavioral comparisons suggest that a network designed to predict the consequences of movements within a heat gradient mimics important elements of the behavioral strategy displayed by zebrafish when navigating temperature gradients. We next sought to compare temperature representation between the ANN and the zebrafish BNN, which contains a critical set of temperature encoding cells within the hindbrain. These consist of ON and OFF-type cells sensitive to temperature levels on the one hand (named “Slow ON” and “Slow OFF”) and changes in temperature on the other (named “Fast ON” and “Fast OFF” cells) (Haesemeyer et al., 2018Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. A brain-wide circuit model of heat-evoked swimming behavior in larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2018; 98: 817-831Google Scholar). Spectral clustering across units revealed a very similar representation in the temperature navigation ANN (Figures S2A and S2B). Correlation analysis between ANN response types and zebrafish cell types revealed clear response similarities, with a corresponding cell type within the ANN for each zebrafish cell type with correlations r > 0.6 (Figure 2A). Comparing responses of the matching types revealed that indeed two mimicked Fast ON and Slow ON activity found in the larval zebrafish hindbrain (Figure 2B), while another two paralleled Fast OFF and Slow OFF activity (Figure 2C). This similarity in stimulus encoding highlights convergence in representation and information processing between larval zebrafish and the ANN. Using a linear model relating ANN units to calcium activity in every zebrafish neuron (Yamins et al., 2014Yamins D.L.K. Hong H. Cadieu C.F. Solomon E.A. Seibert D. DiCarlo J.J. Performance-optimized hierarchical models predict neural responses in higher visual cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 8619-8624Google Scholar; see STAR Methods) revealed a striking overlap between originally identified zebrafish heat cells across the brain (Figure S2C, left) and those cells that were well predicted by ANN activity (Figure S2C, right). Importantly, the overlap is much larger than expected by chance (Figure S2C′). Overall the ANN correspondence recovered 31% of all heat encoding cells in the zebrafish brain. This recovery is expected given trial-to-trial variability in heat cell calcium responses (Haesemeyer et al., 2018Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. A brain-wide circuit model of heat-evoked swimming behavior in larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2018; 98: 817-831Google Scholar). Encouraged by these similarities, we tried to use other prominent response types found in the ANN to identify heat processing cells in the larval zebrafish brain that may have been missed by previous clustering approaches. In particular, the ANN contained two abundant response types that were quite different from cell types previously described in zebrafish: a group of units responding to both stimulus on- and off-set (Figure S2D) as well as a type that we termed “integrating OFF” as it was most active at low temperatures and integrated over successive temperature decreases during the sine period of the stimulus (Figure 2D). We used these novel cell types as regressors (Miri et al., 2011Miri A. Daie K. Burdine R.D. Aksay E. Tank D.W. Regression-based identification of behavior-encoding neurons during large-scale optical imaging of neural activity at cellular resolution.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 964-980Google Scholar) to search the larval zebrafish brain data for cells with highly correlated responses. While we couldn’t identify cells that properly matched the response properties of the ON-OFF type (Figure S2D), there was a group of cells with activity closely resembling the “integrating OFF” type (Figure 2D). Importantly, these cells clustered spatially in the larval zebrafish brain, where most of them were located in a tight band in the rostro-dorsal cerebellum (Figure 2D′, arrow). This anatomical clustering strongly supports the idea that these cells indeed form a bona-fide heat-responsive cell type. By design the ANN connectivity was not matched to the BNN of larval zebrafish. In particular, temporal convolution occurs at both the sensory neuron level as well as in the hindbrain in larval zebrafish (Haesemeyer et al., 2018Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. A brain-wide circuit model of heat-evoked swimming behavior in larval zebrafish.Neuron. 2018; 98: 817-831Google Scholar), while our ANN only has one convolutional layer. Accordingly, all ANN response types already arise at the first layer of the network, while their abundance changes between layers (Figure S2B). Nonetheless, analysis of connectivity weights between the hidden layers in the temperature branch of the network revealed that zebrafish-like types receive on average stronger inputs from other zebrafish-like types than from non-fish types (Figure 2E). This suggests that zebrafish-like response types form a sub-network within the ANN. Comparing stimulus representations between the reinforcement learning network and larval zebrafish following the same correlation strategy revealed matching representations as well (Figure S2E). However, this network lacked a response type with a correlation >0.6 to Fast OFF neurons (Figure S2E). In fact, the unit type best correlated to zebrafish Fast OFF cells was equally well correlated to zebrafish Slow ON cells. The observed representations could be a general solution to navigational tasks that use time varying inputs, or they could be specific to spatial gradient stimuli. To disambiguate these hypotheses, we designed a network with a behavioral goal akin to phototaxis (Chen and Engert, 2014Chen X. Engert F. Navigational strategies underlying phototaxis in larval zebrafish.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 39Google Scholar, Huang et al., 2013Huang K.-H. Ahrens M.B. Dunn T.W. Engert F. Spinal projection neurons control turning behaviors in zebrafish.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 1566-1573Google Scholar, Wolf et al., 2017Wolf S. Dubreuil A.M. Bertoni T. Böhm U.L. Bormuth V. Candelier R. Karpenko S. Hildebrand D.G.C. Bianco I.H. Monasson R. Debrégeas G. Sensorimotor computation underlying phototaxis in zebrafish.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 651Google Scholar). This network variant receives as input a history of angles to a light source and has the task of predicting its angular position after the same swim types used in the thermotaxis network (Figures S3A and S3B). We found that this ANN efficiently learned to fixate a light source (Figures S3C and S3D). However, comparing cell responses between the thermotaxis and phototaxis networks revealed a much simpler stimulus representation in the latter (Figure S3E). This argues that the observed stimulus representations are not emergent features of networks trained to perform navigation but rather depend on the specific task at hand. Previously, we characterized the computations underlying behavior generation during heat perception in larval zebrafish using white noise temperature stimuli (Haesemeyer et al., 2015Haesemeyer M. Robson D.N. Li J.M. Schier A.F. Engert F. The structure and timescales of heat perception in larval zebrafish.Cell Syst. 2015; 1: 338-348Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to derive “filter kernels” that describe how larval zebrafish integrate temperature information to generate swim bouts (inset Figure 3A). These filter kernels revealed that larval zebrafish integrate temperature information for 500 ms to decide on the next swim and that they extract a derivative of the temperature stimulus as reflected in the 0-crossing of the filter (Figure 3A, inset). The filter kernels furthermore indicated that swims were in part controlled by a strong OFF response just before the start of a bout. For comparison, we now presented white noise temperature stimuli to the ANN and computed filter kernels for straight swims and turns (Figure 3A). These bear striking resemblances to the larval zebrafish filter kernels. Namely, even though no explicit constraints on integration timescales were given to the ANN, the filter kernels reveal that most information is integrated over timescales less than a second, akin to larval zebrafish integration timescales (Figure S4A). This is likely the result of the ANN adapting processing timescales to the average swim frequency used in the training data, a feature that has previously been suggested in bacterial chemotaxis (Block et al., 1982Block S.M. Segall J.E. Berg H.C. Impulse responses in bacterial chemotaxis.Cell. 1982; 31: 215-226Google Scholar). Supporting this idea, a reduction of training data baseline swim frequency to 0.5 Hz elongates the filters, while an increase to 2 Hz heightens the filter peaks close to the swim start (Figure S4B). The ANN furthermore computes both a derivative and an integral of temperature, and, notably, behavior is also influenced by a strong OFF response right before the start of a swim (arrowhead in Figure 3A). These are all hallmarks of larval zebrafish temperature processing. Furthermore, as in zebrafish, the OFF response before the swim-start is more strongly modulated for straight swims than turns (Figure 3A), a strategy that likely underlies the favoring of straight swims over turns when temperature approaches cooler, more favorable conditions (Figure 1I). While there are also differences in the filter kernels such as a different modulation in peak height between swims and turns the overall correspondence suggests similar processing strategies. As expected, the swim-triggered averages are completely unstructured in naive networks (Figure S4C). To gain insight into the contribution of ANN response types to behavior, we analyzed their behavior-triggered average activity during white noise stimulation (Figures 3B–3F). These averages reveal that Slow-ON and Slow-OFF types mostly enhance straight swims or turns re"

As part of this effort, there have been an array of studies in relation to the effects of building characteristics on indoor microbiota and their propensity to cause health issues. Despite the abundance of scientific inquiries, limited studies have been dedicated to concomitantly link these effects to the deterioration of ‘structural integrity’ in the building materials. This study focuses on the observed biodeteriorative capabilities of indoor fungi upon the ubiquitous gypsum board material as a function of building age and room functionality within a university campus. We observed that the fungal growth significantly affected the physical (weight loss) and mechanical (tensile strength) properties of moisture-exposed gypsum board samples; in some cases, tensile strength and weight decreased by more than 80%. Such intertwined associations between the biodeterioration of building material properties due to viable indoor fungi, and as a function of building characteristics, would suggest a critical need towards multi-criteria design and optimization of next-generation healthy buildings. Next to structural integrity measures, with a better understanding of what factors and environmental conditions trigger fungal growth in built environment materials, we can also optimize the design of indoor living spaces, cleaning strategies, as well as emergency management measures during probable events such as flooding or water damage."

The hypothesis for this study was that endometrial inflammation is reflected in mRNA expression patterns of peripheral blood leucocytes. Transcriptome profiles were evaluated in healthy cows and in cows with SCE using circulating white blood cells (WBC) and endometrial biopsy samples collected from the same animals at 45–55 days postpartum. Bioinformatic analyses of microarray-based transcriptional data identified gene profiles associated with distinct biological functions in circulating WBC and endometrium. In circulating WBC, SCE promotes a pro-inflammatory environment, whereas functions related to tissue remodeling are also affected in the endometrium. Nineteen differentially expressed genes associated with SCE were common to both circulating WBC and the endometrium. Among these genes, transcript abundance of immune factors C3, C2, LTF, PF4 and TRAPPC13 were up-regulated in SCE cows at 45–55 days postpartum. Moreover, mRNA expression of C3, CXCL8, LTF, TLR2 and TRAPPC13 was temporally regulated during the postpartum period in circulating WBC of healthy cows compared with SCE cows. This observation might indicate an advantageous modulation of the immune system in healthy animals. The transcript abundance of these genes represents a potential source of indicators for postpartum uterine health."

They are an important, but understudied and under-regulated, category of pollution releases given their frequency and magnitude. In this paper, we examine the demographic correlates of excess emissions, using data from industrial sources in Texas. Methods We conduct two complementary sets of analyses: one at the census tract level and one at the facility level. At the census tract level, we use a multinomial logit model to examine the relationships between racial, ethnic, and income characteristics and the incidence of excess emissions. At the facility level, we first estimate a logit model to examine whether these characteristics are associated with facilities that emit excess emissions, and then, conditional on the presence of excess emissions, we use ordinary least square regression to estimate their correlation with the magnitude of releases. Results Across our analyses, we find that the percentage of Black population and median household income are positively associated with excess emissions; percentage of college graduate, population density, median housing value, and percentage of owner-occupied housing unit are negatively associated with excess emissions. We, however, have not found a clear and significant relationship between the percentage of Hispanic population and excess emissions."

This signaling is initiated by pattern recognition receptors, such as the RNA helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), that sense viral RNA. These sensors then interact with the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which recruits additional signaling proteins, including TNF receptor–associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), to form a signaling complex that activates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) for transcriptional induction of type I IFNs. Here, using several immunological and biochemical approaches in multiple human cell types, we show that the GTPase-trafficking protein RAB1B up-regulates RIG-I pathway signaling and thereby promotes IFN-β induction and the antiviral response. We observed that RAB1B overexpression increases RIG-I–mediated signaling to IFN-β and that RAB1B deletion reduces signaling of this pathway. Additionally, loss of RAB1B dampened the antiviral response, indicated by enhanced Zika virus infection of cells depleted of RAB1B. Importantly, we identified the mechanism of RAB1B action in the antiviral response, finding that it forms a protein complex with TRAF3 to facilitate the interaction of TRAF3 with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein.

https://openalex.org/W2964736063,"Due to their limited access to the external productive inputs and the dependency on rain-fed agricultural production, small scale farmers in sub-Saharan Africa have continued to face undernutrition despite the significant advancements in agriculture. They however often live in areas endowed with high agrobiodiversity which could contribute, if explored, to improved diets and nutrition. Few studies have linked the contribution of agrobiodiversity to the micronutrient adequacy of the diets of young children among smallholder farmers. The study explored this relationship and contributes to the growing body of literature linking agrobiodiversity to nutrition of young children. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted as part of baseline assessment for an intervention study, one in the lean and a second in the plenty season in Vihiga county, Kenya. Household level interviews were administered to 634 households with children 12–23 months. Agrobiodiversity was defined as the number of crop species cultivated or harvested from the wild and the number of livestock maintained by the household across two agricultural seasons. Dietary data were collected using two-non-consecutive quantitative 24-hour recalls and analyzed using Lucille software. Diet quality was assessed using dietary diversity score based on seven food groups and mean probability of micronutrient adequacy computed for eleven micronutrients. A total of 80 species were maintained or harvested from the wild by the households. Mean household species richness was 9.9 ± 4.3. One in every four children did not meet the minimum dietary diversity score. The average mean probability of micronutrient adequacy was 68.11 ± 16.08 in plenty season compared to 56.37± 19.5% in the lean season. Iron, zinc and calcium were most limiting micronutrients in the diet, with less than 30% average probability of adequacy in both seasons. Household agrobiodiversity was positively associated with both dietary diversity score (r = 0.09, p = 0.029) and micronutrient adequacy (r = 0.15, p<0.000) in the pooled sample. One unit increase in species diversity was associated with 12.7% improvement in micronutrient adequacy. Despite the rich agrobiodiversity in the study area the diets were low in diversity and there is an unrealized opportunity to improve micronutrient intake through greater promotion and consumption of locally available agrobiodiversity."

The species was first reported in Brazil in 1986 and since then has been found in 24 of the 27 Brazilian states, often in peri-urban environments close to highly urbanized areas. To date, population genetics of this important mosquito in areas in the city of São Paulo has not been investigated. In this study, we used 12 microsatellite loci to investigate the microgeographic population genetics of Ae. albopictus, which is present throughout the city of São Paulo. All the analyses revealed structuring of the populations studied, divided into two groups with restricted gene flow between them and without evidence of isolation by distance. We propose two hypotheses to explain the results: (i) low dispersal capability—limited gene flow between populations is due to the low dispersal capability inherent to Ae. albopictus; and (ii) multiple introductions—the structure identified here results from multiple introductions, which led to different dispersal patterns within the city and more genetic heterogeneity. The ability of Ae. albopictus to invade new areas and expand may explain why these mosquito populations appear to be well established and thriving in the city of São Paulo."
https://openalex.org/W2966167995,"The intracellular accumulation of aggregated misfolded proteins is a cytopathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the functional relationship between protein misfolding or aggregation and the cellular proteostasis network that monitors and maintains proteome health is poorly understood. Previous studies have associated translational suppression and transcriptional remodeling with the appearance of protein aggregates, but whether these responses are induced by aggregates or their misfolded monomeric or oligomeric precursors remains unclear. Because aggregation in cells is rapid, nonlinear, and asynchronous, it has not been possible to deconvolve these kinetically linked processes to determine the earliest cellular responses to misfolded proteins. Upon removal of the synthetic, biologically inert ligand shield-1 (S1), AgDD, an engineered variant FK506-binding protein (FKBP1A), rapidly (t½ ∼5 min) unfolds and self-associates, forming detergent-insoluble, microscopic cytoplasmic aggregates. Using global diglycine-capture (K-GG) proteomics, we found here that this solubility transition is associated with immediate increases in ubiquitylation of AgDD itself, along with that of endogenous proteins that are components of the ribosome and the 26S proteasome. We also found that the earliest cellular responses to acute S1 removal include recruitment of ubiquitin protein ligase E3C (UBE3C) to the 26S proteasome and ubiquitylation of two key proteasomal ubiquitin receptors, 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN10 (RPN10) and Rpn13 homolog (RPN13 or ADRM1). We conclude that these proteasomal responses are due to AgDD protein misfolding and not to the presence of detergent-insoluble aggregates. The intracellular accumulation of aggregated misfolded proteins is a cytopathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the functional relationship between protein misfolding or aggregation and the cellular proteostasis network that monitors and maintains proteome health is poorly understood. Previous studies have associated translational suppression and transcriptional remodeling with the appearance of protein aggregates, but whether these responses are induced by aggregates or their misfolded monomeric or oligomeric precursors remains unclear. Because aggregation in cells is rapid, nonlinear, and asynchronous, it has not been possible to deconvolve these kinetically linked processes to determine the earliest cellular responses to misfolded proteins. Upon removal of the synthetic, biologically inert ligand shield-1 (S1), AgDD, an engineered variant FK506-binding protein (FKBP1A), rapidly (t½ ∼5 min) unfolds and self-associates, forming detergent-insoluble, microscopic cytoplasmic aggregates. Using global diglycine-capture (K-GG) proteomics, we found here that this solubility transition is associated with immediate increases in ubiquitylation of AgDD itself, along with that of endogenous proteins that are components of the ribosome and the 26S proteasome. We also found that the earliest cellular responses to acute S1 removal include recruitment of ubiquitin protein ligase E3C (UBE3C) to the 26S proteasome and ubiquitylation of two key proteasomal ubiquitin receptors, 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN10 (RPN10) and Rpn13 homolog (RPN13 or ADRM1). We conclude that these proteasomal responses are due to AgDD protein misfolding and not to the presence of detergent-insoluble aggregates. Unfolding or aggregation, that is the questionJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 294Issue 45PreviewCellular processes accompanying protein aggregation are diverse and entangled, making it difficult to investigate the underlying molecular processes in a time-resolved way. Gottlieb, Thompson, and colleagues address this shortcoming using a chemical biology approach to monitor ubiquitination within the first 10 min after the initiation of protein aggregation. Intriguingly, unfolding rather than aggregation seems to trigger the observed events. This work might provide a method to answer open questions regarding the regulation of the proteostasis network upon protein misfolding.

Moreover, the concentration of each protein must be precisely maintained by a carefully orchestrated balance of protein synthesis and degradation.

Although the nearly ubiquitous association of IBs in neurodegenerative diseases has long suggested a functional link between PN disruption and pathogenesis, the precise mechanistic relationship between protein misfolding and aggregation and neuropathology has been difficult to sort out. Indeed, there is no consensus whether IBs are toxic, neutral, or even cytoprotective (4Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disease.Nat.

Because the PN is a highly interconnected, multilayered network that controls all aspects of protein metabolism, its disruption has pleiotropic consequences that have been extremely challenging to deconvolve.

In this study, we exploit a model of ligand-inducible protein misfolding and aggregation that permits highly synchronous, population-wide analysis of global PN perturbation at the proteome level with exquisite temporal precision (9Miyazaki Y.

In the presence of S1, degradation domains are well-behaved, folded globular proteins. In the absence of ligand, degradation domains rapidly misfold and, when expressed in mammalian cells, are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), together with any protein to which they are attached (10Banaszynski L.A.

This work exploits “AgDD,” a variant degradation domain that differs from the widely used “DD” by the presence of an N-terminal decapeptide that is enriched in hydrophobic and aliphatic residues (Fig. 1A) (9Miyazaki Y.

Upon acute removal of S1 from the culture medium (“washout” (w/o)), both proteins unfold, sampling different conformations and potentially transitioning dynamically among them (9Miyazaki Y.

These partially unfolded proteins are targeted for ubiquitylation and, in the case of DD, rapid proteasomal degradation (t½ = 90 min) (12Bersuker K. Brandeis M. Kopito R.R.

By contrast, S1 w/o causes AgDD to rapidly aggregate into puncta that are refractory to degradation and coalesce into cytoplasmic IBs (9Miyazaki Y. Mizumoto K. Dey G. Kudo T. Perrino J. Chen L.-C. Meyer T. Wandless T.J. A method to rapidly create protein aggregates in living cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (11689, 27229621): 1168910.1038/ncomms11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that one of the earliest cellular responses (<10 min) to acute protein misfolding is ubiquitylation of RPN13, one of the key Ub receptors on the apical cap of the 26S proteasome. We find that partially unfolded rather than aggregated AgDD induces recruitment of the Ub ligase, UBE3C to the proteasome as well as UBE3C-dependent multiubiquitylation of RPN13 and polyubiquitylation of proteasome-associated AgDD. To study the earliest global changes to the PN that occur in response to acute protein folding stress, we exploited the ability of AgDD to unfold and aggregate following acute removal of the stabilizing ligand, S1 (9Miyazaki Y. Mizumoto K. Dey G. Kudo T. Perrino J. Chen L.-C. Meyer T. Wandless T.J. A method to rapidly create protein aggregates in living cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (11689, 27229621): 1168910.1038/ncomms11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To evaluate the suitability of AgDD for such global analysis, the spatial distribution of sfGFP fluorescence was monitored by time-lapse imaging of HEK293 cells stably expressing AgDD-sfGFP (heretofore, AgDD) following acute w/o of S1 (Fig. 1B). In the presence of ligand, AgDD fluorescence was diffuse, indistinguishable from that typically observed for unmodified GFP. Upon S1 w/o, AgDD rapidly shifted to a highly granular, punctate distribution observable at the earliest imaged time point, 2.5 min (Fig. 1C). Importantly, this pattern was observed in all cells at this time point, indicating that acute removal of S1 leads to simultaneous changes in AgDD distribution across an entire population of cells. Over the next 60 min, the puncta continued to increase in size and decrease in number, as reported previously (9Miyazaki Y. Mizumoto K. Dey G. Kudo T. Perrino J. Chen L.-C. Meyer T. Wandless T.J. A method to rapidly create protein aggregates in living cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (11689, 27229621): 1168910.1038/ncomms11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that individual AgDD IBs grow by coalescence of puncta. Coincident with this, diffuse AgDD fluorescence declined and was largely undetectable at later time points, suggesting that newly synthesized AgDD molecules, in the absence of S1, efficiently add onto pre-existing IBs. This transition of AgDD fluorescence from a diffuse to punctate appearance was accompanied by a rapid decline in the Triton X-100 solubility of AgDD, as assessed by sedimentation analysis (Fig. 1, C and B). The half-time for this solubility transition was ∼5.2 min, with 63% insoluble after 10 min of S1 w/o. These data indicate that AgDD rapidly, reproducibly, and synchronously transitions into detergent-insoluble aggregates upon acute S1 w/o. This approach is, therefore, well-suited to conduct a systems-level interrogation of temporally resolved PN responses to acute unfolding and aggregation of a single, defined cytosolic protein. To assess the immediate (i.e. ≤10 min) effects of acute AgDD unfolding on the PN that occur prior to transcriptional responses, we used an unbiased quantitative K-GG proteomic strategy to comprehensively assess the impact of S1 w/o on the cellular ubiquitylome (Fig. 2A). Because the UPS tags conformationally altered proteins with Ub chains that direct them for degradation by the 26S proteasome (14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system for protein degradation.Annu. Rev.

K-GG proteomics exploits an antibody against the diglycine signature remnant on peptides generated from ubiquitylated proteins after complete digestion with trypsin (due to cleavage of the C-terminal Arg-Gly-Gly sequence of ubiquitin) (16Peng J.

Thus, it allows global specific profiling of ubiquitin post-translational modification on proteins present in a cell population at a given time or under a given stress. By combining K-GG immunocapture with tandem mass tagging (TMT) technology (a combination of highly multiplexed isobaric tags), it is possible to obtain precise time-resolved assessments of changes to the ubiquitylome in a single experiment. Lysates from AgDD cells subjected to S1 w/o for 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min (Fig. 2A) were digested with trypsin, and K-GG immunoprecipitates from each time point were isolated, labeled with 11-plex isobaric tags, pooled, fractionated, and analyzed by nLC-MS/MS as described previously (18Rose C.M.

Highly multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of ubiquitylomes.Cell Syst. 2016; 3 (27667366): 395-403.e410.1016/j.cels.2016.08.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In total, we identified and quantified 4,549 common unique sites of ubiquitylation across all 11 experimental conditions in two independent experiments (Table S1). Parallel analyses of control samples from WT HEK293 cells not expressing AgDD cultured in the presence or absence of S1 or subjected to S1 w/o were performed to ensure that in the absence of AgDD, S1 and S1 w/o have no significant biological impact on protein ubiquitylation (Fig. S1 (B and C) and Table S2). Unsurprisingly, in AgDD cells, the earliest and most substantial changes in ubiquitylation (3.8–5.2-fold increase after 10-min S1 w/o) were detected on AgDD itself, with three sites (Lys-35, Lys-48, and Lys-53) significantly modified (Fig. 2B; note that ubiquitylated AgDD lysines are numbered according to their position in native FKBP1A). This result is consistent with previous publications showing that the DD domain undergoes partial unfolding and becomes rapidly ubiquitylated following S1 w/o (11Egeler E.L. Urner L.M. Rakhit R. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J. Ligand-switchable substrates for a ubiquitin-proteasome system.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21768107): 31328-3133610.1074/jbc.M111.264101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to ubiquitylation of AgDD itself, significant changes to the endogenous ubiquitylome were also observed following the acute 10-min S1 w/o, with some sites exhibiting increased or decreased levels of ubiquitylation and many sites trending monotonically over the time course (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1A). At 10 min, we identified 57 ubiquitylation sites corresponding to 48 proteins exhibiting statistically significant changes, including 42 sites with increased, and 15 sites with decreased modification (Fig. 2, B and C). The sites exhibiting significantly decreased ubiquitylation correspond to a group of cytosolic and organellar proteins with no obvious functional relationship to one another or to known stress-response pathways. By contrast, the 42 sites exhibiting statistically significant increased ubiquitylation in response to S1 w/o are strikingly enriched in functionally related PN proteins, including chaperones, proteasome subunits, ribosomal proteins, and ribosome biogenesis factors, suggesting that acute unfolding and aggregation of a single abundant protein leads to rapid (≤10-min) Ub modification of both protein degradation and protein synthesis machinery. In addition to proteins with documented roles in the PN, which will be discussed below, our analysis identified a significant increase in PARP4 ubiquitylation that increased monotonically across all time points following S1 w/o. PARP4 is a cytosolic poly-ADP ribosylase and one of three protein components of mammalian vault complexes. Purified vaults demonstrate ADP-ribosylase activity, confirming that PARP4 is enzymatically active in vaults (19Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. The 193-kD vault protein, VPARP, is a novel poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146 (10477748): 917-92810.1083/jcb.146.5.917Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Whereas many PARP proteins are active in stress-response pathways (20Gibson B.A. Kraus W.L. New insights into the molecular and cellular functions of poly(ADP-ribose) and PARPs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (22713970): 411-42410.1038/nrm3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), the relationship of PARP4 and potentially vault-associated PARP4 to the PN remains unknown. The most striking early changes to the ubiquitylome in response to S1 w/o were increased Ub modification of components of the UPS itself. We observed a significant monotonic increase in the modification of Ub at Lys-29 and Lys-33, suggesting that increased production or decreased turnover of these noncanonical Ub chains is an early and progressive response to acute unfolding and aggregation of AgDD. K-GG proteomic profiling also revealed that S1 w/o induces immediate 2–3-fold increases in Ub modification of the proteasome itself, notably on the Ub receptor, RPN13 (ADRM1), at two sites (Lys-21 and Lys-34) that were second in magnitude only to modification of AgDD itself. A single site in RPN10 (PSMD4, Lys-40) also exhibited a modest (1.5-fold) increase in ubiquitylation, reaching statistical significance only at 10 min following S1 w/o. These data reveal that acute unfolding and/or aggregation of a single highly expressed cytosolic protein leads to immediate and progressive increases in ubiquitylation of key nodes in the PN network, particularly the ribosome and the 26S proteasome. Acute unfolding and aggregation of AgDD could impair proteasome function by overwhelming substrate binding capacity or by “choking” the proteasome with hard-to-unfold aggregates (5Hipp M.S.

Moreover, ubiquitylation of 19S Ub receptors RPN13 and RPN10 could interfere with binding and degradation of UPS substrates, leading to their accumulation. Indeed, nearly stoichiometric modification of RPN13 through in vitro ubiquitylation of isolated proteasomes has been reported to impair substrate binding and degradation (23Jacobson A.D. MacFadden A. Wu Z. Peng J. Liu C.W. Autoregulation of the 26S proteasome by in situ ubiquitination.Mol. Biol.

To determine whether the observed increase in endogenous protein ubiquitylation induced by AgDD aggregation is the consequence of inhibited proteasome activity, we evaluated cleavage of a bioluminescent peptide reporter of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in cleared lysates from AgDD cells subjected to S1 w/o. Intriguingly, instead of a decrease, we observed a 40% increase in chymotrypsin-like activity relative to mock-treated controls after a 10-min S1 w/o (Fig. 3A), suggesting that unfolding and aggregation of AgDD stimulates, rather than inhibits, peptidase activity of the 20S proteasome. Despite this curious effect on 20S peptidase activity, S1 w/o impacted neither the steady-state level nor the degradation kinetics of core-glycosylated CD147 (CD147 (CG); Fig. 3B), an endogenous proteasome substrate whose degradation is strictly dependent on Ub conjugation and on 26S proteasome function (25Tyler R.E.

Overall, there was very poor (r2 < 0.11) correlation between the ubiquitylation sites altered at 10 min following S1 w/o and published Btz-responsive sites (Fig. 3C). Among the 57 significantly altered ubiquitylation sites identified in our K-GG proteomic analysis, only five—nuclear complex protein 2 homolog (NOCL2, Lys-516), 40s ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25, Lys-66), 40s ribosomal protein S16 (RPS16, Lys-50), catenin β-1 (CTNNB1, Lys-233), and RPN13 (ADRM1, Lys-21)—were also increased following direct proteasome inhibition. The poor correlation between the S1 w/o and Btz-induced changes to the K-GG ubiquitylome suggests that acute S1 w/o does not lead to globally impaired proteasome function. Together, these data indicate that the altered ubiquitylation status of proteins following S1 w/o might reflect activation of a cellular stress response and not a secondary consequence of proteasome impairment. To directly assess the effects of S1 w/o on RPN13 ubiquitylation, we used a mixture of Halo-tagged Ub-association domain (UBA) reagents that bind Ub conjugates without preference for chain linkage topology (26Aillet F.

https://openalex.org/W2966173915,"Background and aim Malnutrition is common in patients with cancer, and its early diagnosis can reduce or prevent further complications and improve the clinical and nutritional prognosis. Adductor Pollicis Muscle Thickness (APMT) and Handgrip Strength have been explored in this population to identify a reduction in strength and muscle mass prior to the use of conventional methods. We aimed to correlate APMT and Handgrip Strength with conventional anthropometric variables in cancer patients and verify their association with nutritional status as determined by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 80 patients diagnosed with cancer who were candidates for surgery. Nutritional status was obtained from the PG-SGA. Conventional anthropometric measurements were taken, as well as APMT and Handgrip Strength. Pearson’s correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression were applied to detect the influence of variables on APMT and HGS. A significance level of 5.0% was considered. Results A high prevalence of malnutrition and the need for dietotherapic intervention was found, identified by the PG-SGA. Correlations between APMT and Handgrip Strength with anthropometric variables and with the PG-SGA score were observed. After regression adjustments, the variables that interacted with APMT were TSF and AC, and the PG-SGA score, corrected Muscle Arm Area (CAMA), and age interacted with Handgrip Strength. Conclusion Correlations between anthropometric measurements and the PG-SGA score with APMT and Handgrip Strength were observed, even after adjusting for age and sex. These associations demonstrate that APMT and Handgrip Strength can be used with criterion in patients with cancer as complementary methods to evaluate nutritional risk and the need for nutritional intervention."

We conducted a study to understand conflicts with, and factors influencing the perceived value of an expanding population of onagers (Equus hemionus onager) in local communities in southern Iran. We asked about locals’ perceptions of six potential management strategies intended to lessen human-onager conflict. We found that human-onager conflict was restricted to 45% of respondents within the Bahram-e-Goor Protected Area, all of whom were involved in farming or herding activities. Locals within the protected area were more knowledgeable about onagers and valued onagers more than those living outside the protected area. The perceived value of onagers increased with level of education, total annual income, and perceptions of onager population trends; the perceived value of onagers decreased with the magnitude of conflict between onagers and locals. To tolerate or avoid conflicts with onagers, locals were supportive of monetary compensation and changing from a traditional lifestyle to industrialized farming (for farmers) or livestock production (for herders) with the help of government; locals did not support selling land to the government. Our study is among the first in human-wildlife conflict and local attitudes towards an endangered species and its recovery in Iran. We conclude that current levels of human-onager conflict are relatively low and perceived value of onagers is still relatively high. Therefore, wildlife authorities should consider the development of mitigation strategies with local communities before conflicts intensify."
https://openalex.org/W2964354144,"The neural mechanisms underlying behavioral therapy for vocal acoustic deficits in patients with Parkinson disease is unknown. A primary hypothesis is that voice therapy may modulate mesolimbic brainstem regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA is implicated in ultrasonic call peak frequency, involved in rewarding behaviors, and impacted by Parkinsonism. We tested the hypothesis that chronic (daily) behavioral vocal exercise of male Pink1-/- rats would alter ultrasonic vocalization acoustics and mesolimbic neurochemistry (catecholamines, GABA, mu-opioid receptor) compared to three different controls: sham-exercised Pink1-/-, unexercised Pink1-/-, and unexercised wildtype (WT) rats. A sub-hypothesis is that sham-exercise rats may exhibit changes to VTA neurochemistry as a result of a type or rewarding intervention. Results demonstrate that average bandwidth (frequency range) of ultrasonic vocalizations did not differ between WT, Pink1-/- no exercise vs. sham and vocal-exercise rats. However, average peak frequency is significantly reduced in vocal-exercised Pink1-/- rats compared to Pink1-/- no exercise, and WT groups. Unexpectedly, there were no significant acoustic differences between the vocal- and sham-exercised groups. There were no differences in catecholamine protein concentrations or tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression in the VTA between any of the groups. However, there was significant upregulation of all GABA-related genes in both vocal- and sham-exercised Pink1-/- rats (Gad1, Gad2, Gls, Glul); this finding was confirmed with follow up quantitative Western blotting for GAD. Additionally, there were differential results for mu-opioid receptor quantification in the VTA: vocal-exercised Pink1-/- rats showed increased mRNA expression for mu-opioid receptors whereas Western blotting indicated decreased protein levels in all Pink1-/- rats compared to WT controls suggesting the possible onset of pathology in this model. These data demonstrate modulatory effects of a rewarding behavioral paradigm on ultrasonic vocalization peak frequency. The results suggest that neuromodulators such as GABA and opioid activity, as well as the rewarding aspects of therapy may play a key role in shaping vocal treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2965314025,"Rationale In virtually all models of heart failure, prognosis is determined by right ventricular (RV) function; thus, understanding the cellular mechanisms contributing to RV dysfunction is critical. Whole organ remodeling is associated with cell-specific changes, including cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and activation of cardiac fibroblasts (Cfib) which in turn is linked to disorganization of cytoskeletal proteins and loss of sarcomeric structures. However, how these cellular changes contribute to RV function remains unknown. We’ve previously shown significant organ-level RV dysfunction in a large animal model of pulmonary hypertension (PH) which was not mirrored by reduced function of isolated cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that factors produced by the endogenous Cfib contribute to global RV dysfunction by generating a heterogeneous cellular environment populated by dedifferentiated cells. Objective To determine the effect of Cfib conditioned media (CM) from the PH calf (PH-CM) on adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM) in culture. Methods and results Brief exposure (<2 days) to PH-CM results in rapid, marked dedifferentiation of ARVM to a neonatal-like phenotype exhibiting spontaneous contractile behavior. Dedifferentiated cells maintain viability for over 30 days with continued expression of cardiomyocyte proteins including TnI and α-actinin yet exhibit myofibroblast characteristics including expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Using a bioinformatics approach to identify factor(s) that contribute to dedifferentiation, we found activation of the PH Cfib results in a unique transcriptome correlating with factors both in the secretome and with activated pathways in the dedifferentiated myocyte. Further, we identified upregulation of periostin in the Cfib and CM, and demonstrate that periostin is sufficient to drive cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation. Conclusions These data suggest that paracrine factor(s) released by Cfib from the PH calf signal a phenotypic transformation in a population of cardiomyocytes that likely contributes to RV dysfunction. Therapies targeting this process, such as inhibition of periostin, have the potential to prevent RV dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W2964928470,"Bacterial infections, in particular a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), are a major threat in patients with liver cirrhosis. Recently, it has been shown that the impact on mortality might be underestimated by established risk-scores. Onset of infection was suggested to define a distinct stage of cirrhosis. However, it remains unclear whether all stages of decompensated cirrhosis are equally affected. Moreover, if there is such a distinct stage, it must be determined whether it is reversible after the infection has resolved. In this study we aimed to further analyze the impact of a current as well as a resolved SBP in different stages of decompensated liver cirrhosis.A number of 579 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites were included. MELD-score was used to determine the stage of liver disease. Low (<15), intermediate (15-25) and high (>25) MELD-groups were compared. Patients were followed up for 90 days. Primary endpoint was overall mortality. Statistical analyses were performed using the log-rank test, Cox regression and competing risk analysis.Mortality was significantly higher in patients with nosocomial-acquired SBP (nSBP) compared to patients without SBP (p<0.001;HR = 2.05). However, the most prominent difference in mortality was documented in the intermediate MELD-group (nSBP: p = 0.02;HR = 2.10). Importantly, mortality in nSBP patients remained increased even after the initial nSBP episode had resolved (p<0.01;HR = 1.90). Again, this was only significant in those with intermediate MELD-scores (p = 0.02;HR = 2.28). While a current as well as a resolved nSBP were significantly linked to a higher mortality, neither of them did increase the likelihood for liver transplantation.Development of nSBP is independently associated with increased mortality supporting the concept of a distinct status of cirrhosis. Importantly, the prognosis remains unfavorable even after resolution of nSBP. This could be particularly relevant for patients with intermediate MELD-scores, who have limited chances for a donor liver."
https://openalex.org/W2965215986,"The accurate diagnosis and seroprevalence investigations of Zika virus (ZKV) infections remain complex due to cross reactivity with other flaviviruses. Two assay formats, both using labelled Zika virus NS1 antigen as a revealing agent (a double antigen binding assay, DABA, and an immunoglobulin Ig capture assay, G capture) were initially developed and compared with the indirect EuroimmunZ assay for the detection of anti-Zika antibody. Of 147 pre-Zika period serum samples, 39 (27%) were reactive in the EuroimmunZ or the DABA assays, 28 sera concordantly so. Such false reactivity was influenced by the serotype of Dengue virus (DV) to which individuals had been exposed to. Thus, of sera from patients undergoing secondary Dengue virus infection of known serotype, 91%, 45% and 28% of Dengue virus serotype 2, 3 and 4 respectively were reactive in one or more of the three assays. A novel method of quenching false sero-reactivity was therefore developed for the DABA and G capture assays. Initial addition of a single homologous Dengue virus serotype 3 NS1Ag quench significantly ablated false reactivities in the pre-Zika period sera. An equipotent quadrivalent quench comprising homologous Dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 NS1Ag was shown to be optimum yet retained sensitivity for the detection of specific anti-Zika antibody. Comparing DABA and G capture assays using quenched and unquenched conjugates in comparison with EuroimmunZ early in the course of PCR-confirmed infection indicated that a significant component of the apparent early anti-ZIKA antibody response is likely to be due to a Zika virus-driven anamnestic anti-Dengue virus response. The increased specificity provided by homologous antigen quenching is likely to provide a significant improvement in sero-diagnostics and to be of clinical value."

https://openalex.org/W2966560587,"Intra-chain domain interactions are known to play a significant role in the function and stability of multidomain proteins. These interactions are mediated through a physical interaction at domain-domain interfaces (DDIs). With a motivation to understand evolution of interfaces, we have investigated similarities among DDIs. Even though interfaces of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been previously studied by structurally aligning interfaces, similar analyses have not yet been performed on DDIs of either multidomain proteins or PPIs. For studying the structural landscape of DDIs, we have used iAlign to structurally align intra-chain domain interfaces of domains. The interface alignment of spatially constrained domains (due to inter-domain linkers) showed that ~88% of these could identify a structural matching interface having similar C-alpha geometry and contact pattern despite that aligned domain pairs are not structurally related. Moreover, the mean interface similarity score (IS-score) is 0.307, which is higher compared to the average random IS-score (0.207) suggesting domain interfaces are not random. The structural space of DDIs is highly connected as ~84% of all possible directed edges among interfaces are found to have at most path length of 8 when 0.26 is IS-score threshold. At this threshold, ~83% of interfaces form the largest strongly connected component. Thus, suggesting that structural space of intra-chain domain interfaces is degenerate and highly connected, as has been found in PPI interfaces. Interestingly, searching for structural neighbors of inter-chain interfaces among intra-chain interfaces showed that ~86% could find a statistically significant match to intra-chain interface with a mean IS-score of 0.311. This implies that domain interfaces are degenerate whether formed within a protein or between proteins. The interface degeneracy is most likely due to limited possible ways of packing secondary structures. In principle, interface similarities can be exploited to accurately model domain interfaces in structure prediction of multidomain proteins."

RS enzymes typically abstract a hydrogen from their substrates, generating a substrate-centered radical; class B RS methylases catalyze methyl transfer from SAM to cobalamin and then to a substrate-centered carbon or phosphorus radical. Radle et al. now show that Mmp10, an RS enzyme implicated in the methylation of Arg-285 in methyl coenzyme M reductase, binds a methylcobalamin cofactor required for methyl transfer from SAM to a peptide substrate. However, Mmp10 has little sequence homology to known methylases, suggesting this enzyme belongs to a new subclass of B12-dependent RS methylases."

The National Therapeutic Guide established artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, but compliance with this treatment is low. The aim of this study was to assess, for the first time, the performance of public healthcare workers in the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria, their compliance with first-line Malaria National Therapeutic Guide and the associated factors.A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the nine public health facilities in the Bata District of Equatorial Guinea to assess the management of uncomplicated malaria in children < 15 years of age. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to determine the recommended treatment compliance and related factors.A total of 227 children with uncomplicated malaria were recorded from 9 public health facilities. Most of the treatments prescribed (83.3%) did not follow the first-line treatment recommended for uncomplicated malaria. The diagnosis was established with parasite confirmation in 182 cases (80.2%). After adjustment for other variables, children under 2 months of age, the use of parasite confirmation to the diagnosis of malaria and being familiar with the national therapeutic guide were significantly associated with the prescription of the first-line recommended treatment. Cases attended at the hospital or in a health facility with ASAQ in the pharmacy at the time of the study were also more likely to be prescribed with the recommended treatment, but with non-significant association after adjustment for other variables.This study identified the factors associated with the low compliance with the first-line treatment by the public healthcare facilities of Bata District of Equatorial Guinea. It seems necessary to improve case management of children with uncomplicated malaria; to reinforce the use of Malaria National Therapeutic Guide and to inform about the danger of using artemisinin monotherapy. Furthermore, it is crucial to provide recommended first-line treatment to the pharmacies of all public health facilities to ensure access to this treatment."

However, no studies addressing both prediagnostic and postdiagnostic period of dementia have evaluated sedative agent usage over an extended period. Objectives To describe a longitudinal change in sedative medication use before and after the diagnosis with dementia over 10 years compared to patients without dementia. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using longitudinal claims data for senior national health insurance beneficiaries. After 1:4 propensity score matching, 54,165 older patients (≥60 years) were included. Difference-in-difference (DID) of sedative burden and use of sedative agents pre- and post-dementia diagnosis were estimated, and compared to those of patients without dementia. The yearly average daily sedative load (adSL) for each individual was calculated after applying duration, dose, and sedative score of medications from the sedative load model. The medication use for each sedative category was calculated using the defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 patient-days. Results The adSL in patients with dementia was consistently high before and after diagnosis and significantly increased after diagnosis, compared to those of patients without dementia (DID 0.123 unit/day, 95% confidence interval 0.117–0.129). DID of medication use was the highest for antidepressants (64.764 DDD/1000 patient-days) followed by Z-drugs and antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant usage steeply increased after dementia diagnosis. Conclusion Sedative burden in patients with dementia before and after dementia diagnosis was higher than that in patients without dementia, and was further increased after dementia diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2964789215,"Background Serious childhood illnesses (SCI), defined as severe pneumonia, severe dehydration, sepsis, and severe malaria, remain major contributors to amenable child mortality worldwide. Inadequate recognition and treatment of SCI are factors that impact child mortality in Botswana. Skills assessments of providers caring for SCI have not been validated in low and middle-income countries. Objective To establish preliminary inter-rater reliability, validity evidence, and feasibility for an assessment of providers who care for SCI using simulated patients and remote video capture in community clinic settings in Botswana. Methods This was a pilot study. Four scenarios were developed via a modified Delphi technique and implemented at primary care clinics in Kweneng, Botswana. Sessions were video captured and independently reviewed. Response process and internal structure analysis utilized intra-class correlation (ICC) and Fleiss’ Kappa. A structured log was utilized for feasibility of remote video capture. Results Eleven subjects participated. Scenarios of Lower Airway Obstruction (ICC = 0.925, 95%CI 0.695–0.998) and Hypovolemic Shock from Severe Dehydration (ICC = 0.892, 95%CI 0.596–0.997) produced excellent ICC among raters while Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI, ICC = 0, 95%CI -0.034–0.97) and LRTI + Distributive Shock from Sepsis (0.365, 95%CI -0.025–0.967) were poor. Oxygen therapy (0.707), arranging transport (0.706), and fluid administration (0.701) demonstrated substantial task reliability. Conclusions Initial development of an assessment tool demonstrates many, but not all, criteria for validity evidence. Some scenarios and tasks demonstrate excellent reliability among raters, but others may be limited by manikin design and study implementation. Remote simulation assessment of some skills by clinic-based providers in global health settings is reliable and feasible."

However, the currently available information on aortic stiffness (a prognostic marker for adverse cardiovascular outcomes) in these patients is scarce. In this study, we consecutively recruited 21 asymptomatic Bolivian adult patients with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease and 14 Bolivian adults, who were seronegative for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. No participants had a prior history of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or atrial fibrillation. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid-radial PWV (cr-PWV), carotid intima-media thickness and conventional echocardiographic measurements were recorded in all participants. Patients with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease had significantly higher cf-PWV (7.9±1.3 vs. 6.4±1.1 m/s, p = 0.003) and greater HOMA-estimated insulin resistance than subjects without Chagas disease. The two groups did not significantly differ in terms of age, sex, smoking, adiposity measures, blood pressure, plasma lipids, fasting glucose levels as well as cr-PWV, carotid intima-media thickness measurements, left ventricular mass and function. Presence of chronic indeterminate Chagas disease was significantly associated with increasing cf-PWV values (β coefficient: 1.31, 95% coefficient interval 0.44 to 2.18, p = 0.005), even after adjustment for age, sex, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and insulin resistance. In conclusion, asymptomatic Bolivian adult patients with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease have an early and marked increase in aortic stiffness, as measured by cf-PWV, when compared to Bolivian adults who were seronegative for Trypanosoma cruzi infection."
https://openalex.org/W2964821287,"Spirometry remains essential for the diagnosis of airway obstruction. Nevertheless, its performance in elderly hospitalized patients with multimorbidity can be difficult. The aim of this study is to assess the utility of the COPD-6 portable device in this population. We included all patients hospitalized for exacerbation of chronic diseases in a medical ward specialized in the care of multimorbidity patients, between September 2017 and May 2018. A questionnaire including sociodemographic, cognitive and functional impairment, among other variables, was completed the last day of admission. Subsequently, patients attempted to perform three valid respiratory manoeuvres with the COPD-6 device and then conventional spirometry. A total of 184 patients were included (mean age of 79.61 years, 55% men). Forty-seven (25.54%) patients were able to perform complete spirometric manoeuvres and 99 (53.8%) could perform a valid FEV1/FEV6 determination. The inability to perform a valid spirometry was related with the patient’s age, functional physical disability, cognitive impairment or the presence of delirium or dysphagia during admission. Only 9% of patients with a Mini Mental Cognitive Examination (MMEC) lower than 24 points could perform a valid spirometry. Of the patients with an MMEC < 24 points and unable to perform spirometry, 34% were able to complete the FEV1/FEV6 manoeuvres. No differences were found in the Charlson index, multimorbidity scale, number of domiciliary drugs, or length of stay between those patients able and those not able to perform respiratory manoeuvres. The agreement between the values for FEV1 measured with COPD-6 and those observed in the spirometry was good (r: 0.71; p<0.0001). Inability to perform a valid spirometry during hospitalization in elderly patients with multimorbidity is frequent and related with functional and cognitive impairment. FEV1/FEV6 determination using the COPD-6 portable device allows an important percentage of the patients with limitations to complete spirometric measurement."

Synthetic, reproducible media can be generated combining monodisperse microspheres with known geometrical and optical properties conveniently parameterized. The method is presented as a proof-of-concept, highlighting the design decisions along with their implications. Practical issues such as aerosol nebulization, particle carrier selection or the features of the medium chamber where the smoke-like atmosphere is to be tested are analyzed. A comparison between methanol and ethanol as carriers for polystyrene microsphere nebulization is also made. The method could be the seed for the obtention of standard reference media for calibration or standardized characterization of not only smoke detectors and exhaust smoke sensors but also other instruments relying on optical properties of dispersive media (dust in PV panels, public lighting, etc.)."
https://openalex.org/W2966780451,"Reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells, by overexpressing certain factors referred to as the reprogramming factors, can revolutionize regenerative medicine. To provide a coherent description of induced pluripotency from the gene regulation perspective, we use 35 microarray datasets to construct a reprogramming gene regulatory network. Comprising 276 nodes and 4471 links, the resulting network is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest gene regulatory network constructed for human fibroblast reprogramming and it is the only one built using a large number of experimental datasets. To build the network, a model that relates the expression profiles of the initial (fibroblast) and final (induced pluripotent stem cell) states is proposed and the model parameters (link strengths) are fitted using the experimental data. Twenty nine additional experimental datasets are collectively used to test the model/network, and good agreement between experimental and predicted gene expression profiles is found. We show that the model in conjunction with the constructed network can make useful predictions. For example, we demonstrate that our approach can incorporate the effect of reprogramming factor stoichiometry and that its predictions are consistent with the experimentally observed trends in reprogramming efficiency when the stoichiometric ratios vary. Using our model/network, we also suggest new (not used in training of the model) candidate sets of reprogramming factors, many of which have already been experimentally verified. These results suggest our model/network can potentially be used in devising new recipes for induced pluripotency with higher efficiencies. Additionally, we classify the links of the network into three classes of different importance, prioritizing them for experimental verification. We show that many of the links in the top ranked class are experimentally known to be important in reprogramming. Finally, comparing with other methods, we show that using our model is advantageous."

Participant characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Variables associated with cycling (p<0.1) were entered in a logistic regression model.Participants who cycled (46.7%, N = 197), mostly used their walking prostheses (91.9%, n = 188). Of cyclists, 92.4% had cycled before the amputation. Cyclists started cycling after the amputation by themselves (86.7%) mostly in order to increase/maintain health (67.0%). Most cyclists cycled on quiet roads. The most frequent destination was shops/market (64.1%). More facilitators were reported than barriers. Most reported barriers were related to health problems and negative attitudes toward cycling. Most reported facilitators were related to perceived health benefits and positive attitude toward cycling. The likelihood of cycling after the amputation increased in people who cycled before the amputation, were amputated lower than the knee, used a prosthetic foot with axis/axes, were amputated due to trauma, had income higher than 415 euro/month, and who reported a higher numbers of facilitators.After a lower limb amputation, nearly half of people cycled. People with a below knee amputation due to trauma with prior cycling experience and higher income tended to cycle after the amputation. People who perceived more facilitators were more likely to cycle. Although cyclists could use a walking prosthesis to cycle, a prosthetic foot with a greater range of motion than the SACH increased the cycling likelihood."

Our study evaluated the effects of azaperone and xylazine combination for immobilizing red brocket deer and allow for the standard capture and handling protocols (e.g., biological material, horn cutting, and trimming) to be conducted safely. Six adult, captive, red brocket deer received an intramuscular injection of either 1 mg/kg azaperone and 0.5 mg/kg xylazine (AX0.5) or 1 mg/kg azaperone and 1 mg/kg xylazine (AX1.0). Sedation latency, sternal recumbency, safe handling, and quality of the sedation were evaluated to provide an overview of how the immobilizing drugs affected managing the species in captivity. Additionally, heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, rectal temperature, pH, PaO2, PaCO2, SaO2, HCO3-, BE, Na+, K+ and serum lactate were also measured. The latency period of the animals in the AX0.5 group was greater than that of the animals in the AX1.0 group (7 ± 6.6 min vs. 5 ± 2.0 min), as was the time for them to assume sternal recumbency (12 ± 9.7 min vs. 6 ± 3.1 min). However, the time after the initial dose at which the animals could safely be handled (14 ± 4.5 min vs. 12 ± 5.2 min), and the time until the end of the safe handling period (75 ± 12.3 min vs. 85 ± 6.8 min) were similar for both groups. Animals in both groups showed physiological stability during all evaluations, but hypoxemia was observed in one animal in each group. We conclude that both drug combinations are safe and effective at sedating red brocket deer in captivity and suggest that the procedure be performed with oxygen supplementation to reduce the potential for hypoxia."
