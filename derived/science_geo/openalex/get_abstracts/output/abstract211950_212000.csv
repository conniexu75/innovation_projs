https://openalex.org/W1985637674,The oocytes of naturally occurring triploid females of the Ambystoma jeffersonianum complex each contain 84 lampbrush chromosomes. This constitutes hexaploidy (n = 14). The chromosomes are joined into pairs by chiasmata and form 42 bivalents. It is suggested that meiosis in triploid females is preceded by an endomitosis and the resulting sister chromosomes synapse to form pseudo-bivalents. Sperm from diploid males stimulate development of the triploid eggs but do not contribute chromosomes to the triploid nucleus. Bivalents in the oocytes of triploids have twice as many chiasmata as the corresponding bivalents in diploid animals. Such chiasmata cannot result in genetic recombination.

https://openalex.org/W2020231902,"WHILE performing investigations on the intra-leucocytic survival of Candida, we found that Candida tropicalis survived in whole human blood but Candida albicans did not. Results were similar for cell-free plasma and serum. In these investigations, 0.1 ml. of an inoculum of 107 Candida cells was added to 1 ml. of serum or plasma in siliconized tubes. The Candida-serum mixture was rotated at 37° C for 24 h. At 0, 6, and 24 h, Candida populations were determined by pour plate enumeration techniques. The serum was considered lethal for Candida if fungal census was reduced at least 10-fold at the 6- or 24-h periods when compared with the 0-h count."

https://openalex.org/W2086325169,"IT has been previously demonstrated, that dl-nor-epinephrine-3H is bound by the isolated perfused dog gracilis muscle and that nerve stimulation causes a release of the bound nore-epinephrine-3H. Both nor-epinephrine-3H and epinephrine-3H are bound in dense core vesicles of sympathetic nerve endings1. We therefore examined the possibility that epinephrine-3H taken up from the circulation could also be released by stimulation of sympathetic nerves."

Similar behaviour had been noted in rabbits and guinea pigs. This phenomenon was examined in a series of 40 male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g."

https://openalex.org/W1985706762,"Three related classes of immunoglobulins ( 7S gamma(-), beta(2)A(-), and gamma(1)M(-) globulin) in normal C3H and C3H and C57BL/6 mouse serums were isolated and examined for the isoantigens Iga-1 and Iga-2. The results indicate that the genetic locus determining the Iga-1 and Iga-2 antigens affects only a portion of the normal mouse immunoglobulin population (that is, 7S gamma-globulin) and only the gamma-specific part (""F"" piece) of the 7S gamma-globulin molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2087360034,"DURING the past few years a large number of protein polymorphisms have been described in different animal groups. This development is largely due to improvements in the techniques for protein separation, such as the method of starch-gel electrophoresis1. The combination of starch-gel electrophoresis with different enzyme staining methods has made it possible to examine also electro-phoretic variations in various enzymes2,3. In Drosophila melanogaster two different protein polymorphisms have recently been described4,5. One of them concerns a genetic variation in a particular esterase from adult flies4. This communication reports a genetic phosphatase variation found in larvae of D. melanogaster. Single larvæ of D. melanogaster were homogenized in a small drop of distilled water and this homogenate was absorbed in a small piece of filter paper (about 4 mm × 6 mm). These protein samples were examined by means of starch-gel electrophoresis. Two different types of discontinuous tris buffer systems were used6,7. After electrophoresis the gels were sliced and stained for phosphatase activity using α-naphthyl phosphate and fast blue RR salt in the gel buffer (pH 8.6)."

https://openalex.org/W1998296488,"FROM the structure of the gastrula and the observation of the movement of the primary mesenchyme cells first towards the animal pole along the lateral bordering of the oral field and then back, finally surrounding the ventral half of the oral field, the hypothesis was derived that an unknown factor is spreading from the centre—the later mouth—of the oral field towards the margin of it1. This spreading is accompanied by the differentiation of the cells of the oral field, for example by a decrease of unspecific esterases from the centre towards the margin2. Where the oral field is in contact with the dorsal and ventral ectoderm the ciliary band is differentiating."

https://openalex.org/W2027580355,"4-AMINOBUTYRATE (4-AB) has been found widespread in animals, plants and micro-organisms1–4. Because it is especially concentrated in brain5, a more or less direct relation with neurotransmission mechanisms (as 4-aminobutyrylcholine6, for example) has been suggested7,8. The transamination of 4-AB with 2-oxoglutarate to yield glutamate and succinic semialdehyde9,10, resulting in a by-pass to the Krebs cycle, which has been shown in brain and in some micro-organisms, tentatively suggests a more general pathway11. Although 4-AB, as well as the enzyme that produces it from glutamate-L-glutamate 1-carboxylyase, are present in appreciable quantities in a high variety of plants12, little is known about 4-AB metabolism in plant tissues."
