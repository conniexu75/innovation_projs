https://openalex.org/W2072619059,"Primary brain tumors (gliomas) have the unusual ability to diffusely infiltrate the normal brain thereby evading surgical treatment. Chlorotoxin is a scorpion toxin that specifically binds to the surface of glioma cells and impairs their ability to invade. Using a recombinant His-Cltx we isolated and identified the principal Cltx receptor on the surface of glioma cells as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). MMP-2 is specifically up-regulated in gliomas and related cancers, but is not normally expressed in brain. We demonstrate that Cltx specifically and selectively interacts with MMP-2 isoforms, but not with MMP-1, -3, and -9, which are also expressed in malignant glioma cells. Importantly, we show that the anti-invasive effect of Cltx on glioma cells can be explained by its interactions with MMP-2. Cltx exerts a dual effect on MMP-2: it inhibits the enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and causes a reduction in the surface expression of MMP-2. These findings suggest that Cltx is a specific MMP-2 inhibitor with significant therapeutic potential for gliomas and other diseases that invoke the activity of MMP-2.

They constitute a heterogeneous group of tumors associated with significant morbidity and mortality (1Prados M.D. Levin V. Semin. Oncol. 2000; 27: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). Gliomas are characterized by a high invasive potential and display a wide diversity of histological features. They are derived from glial support cells in the brain and the vast majority are thought to be of astrocytic origin (2Linskey M.E. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1997; 34: 5-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even low-grade gliomas infiltrate the entire brain, a feature that precludes their successful therapy (3Rooprai H.K. Rucklidge G.J. Panou C. Pilkington G.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although systemic spread is a rarity in malignant gliomas, invasion of tumor cells has been tracked predominantly in the basement membrane of blood vessels, the subependymal space, the glia limitans externa, and parallel and intersecting nerve fiber tracts in the white matter (4Tonn J.C. Wunderlich S. Kerkau S. Klein C.E. Roosen K. Anti-cancer Res. 1998; 18: 2599-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Significant progress has been made in understanding pathways of glioma migration and invasion. Molecular mechanisms of brain tumor invasion are complex. They involve modification of receptor-mediated adhesive properties of tumor cells, degradation and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM)1 by tumor-secreted metalloproteinases, and creation of an intercellular space for invasion of tumor cells (5Giese A. Westphal M. Neurosurgery. 1996; 39: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Spatial and temporal regulation of ECM proteolytic degradation is maintained to ensure successful invasion of tumor cells through the ECM. It has been established through in vitroand in vivo glioma models that the deposition of ECM components occurs at the confrontation zone between glioma cells and normal brain tissue (6Giese A. Laube B. Zapf S. Mangold U. Westphal M. Anti-cancer Res. 1998; 18: 2435-2447PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, paths of invading tumor cells are also enriched in ECM molecules that promote cell motility (7Gladson C.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Haugland H.K. Tysnes B.B. Tysnes O.B. Anti-cancer Res. 1997; 17: 1035-1042PubMed Google Scholar). Cells interact with the ECM via integrins that play a major role in cell invasion. Indeed, functional blocking anti-integrin antibodies (9Gutheil J.C. Campbell T.N. Pierce P.R. Watkins J.D. Huse W.D. Bodkin D.J. Cheresh D.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3056-3061PubMed Google Scholar) and disintegrins, a group of snake venom toxins, can block migration and invasion via an RGD-sequence dependent interaction (10Ritter M.R. Zhou Q. Markland F.S., Jr. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Schmitmeier S. Markland F.S. Chen T.C. Anti-cancer Res. 2000; 20: 4227-4233PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sheu J.R. Yen M.H. Kan Y.C. Hung W.C. Chang P.T. Luk H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to these interactions with the extracellular brain environment, invading glioma cells undergo dramatic shape and cell volume changes allowing them to make their way through the narrow extracellular spaces (13Soroceanu L. Manning T.J., Jr. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process appears to require the secretion of fluid along with Cl− ions, as several Cl− channel inhibitors including DIDS and tamoxifen have been shown to inhibit glioma cell invasion in vitro (13Soroceanu L. Manning T.J., Jr. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorotoxin (Cltx) is a 36-amino acid peptide that was originally isolated from Leiurus quinquestriatus venom (14DeBin J.A. Strichartz G.R. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and has been shown to inhibit small conductance Cl− channels in colonic epithelial cells (14DeBin J.A. Strichartz G.R. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15DeBin J.A. Maggio J.E. Strichartz G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C361-C369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cltx also inhibits Cl− fluxes across glioma membranes (13Soroceanu L. Manning T.J., Jr. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ullrich N. Sontheimer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1511-C1521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies show that Cltx specifically and selectively binds to glioma cells (17Soroceanu L. Gillespie Y. Khazaeli M.B. Sontheimer H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4871-4879PubMed Google Scholar) and radiolabeled Cltx targets tumor cells in mice bearing xenografted glioma tumors. Glioma cell migration and invasion into fetal brain aggregates is significantly reduced by Cltx (13Soroceanu L. Manning T.J., Jr. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent survey of over 200 tissue biopsies from patients with various malignancies suggests that Cltx binds to the surface of gliomas and other embryologically related tumors of neuroectodermal origin (18Lyons S.A. O'Neal J. Sontheimer H. Glia. 2002; 39: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) but not to normal brain. The unusual specificity of Cltx for glioma tissues and its remarkable anti-invasive effect prompted us in the current study to isolate and identify the membrane receptor for Cltx. Affinity purification with a recombinant His6-Cltx followed by mass spectroscopy and sequencing identified the putative Cltx receptor as the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). MMP-2 co-purified as a major component of a stable macromolecular complex comprised of MMP-2, αvβ3 integrin, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2, which are proteins involved in cell migration and invasion. Cltx inhibited the enzymatic activity of MMP-2 in vitro and reduced the surface expression of MMP-2 in glioma cells. Cltx was found to specifically bind to MMP-2 but not to MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9, which are also expressed by glioma cells. These findings explain the specificity of Cltx for glioma in the intracranial animal model studies and also the previously documented anti-invasive potential of Cltx. Cltx may thus be a highly effective drug of therapeutic potential for gliomas and possibly other diseases that invoke the activity of MMP-2. Human glioma cell lines D54-MG (obtained from Dr. D. D. Bigner, Duke University, Durham, NC) and CCF-STTG-1 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 7% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cortical astrocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat pups at postnatal day 0 and cultured as described earlier (19Ye Z.C. Sontheimer H. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2181-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies directed against MMP-2, MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, actin, as well as α-rabbit and α-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, pure MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and filipin were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal α-MMP-2 antibody was obtained from RDI Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Monoclonal antibodies for αvβ3 integrin and recombinant human MMP-2 were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Alexa Fluor (488) goat anti-mouse IgG2a and Alexa red (546) goat anti-rabbit conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used for immunofluorescence at the manufacturers recommended dilutions. As a first step toward biochemical isolation of the receptor for Cltx, a recombinant fusion protein, His-Cltx, was synthesized inEscherichia coli. To produce His-Cltx, we cloned Cltx intoHindIII and EcoRI sites of pGHBE (a modified pGEX2T vector in which the EcoRI, SmaI, andBamHI sites were replace with HindIII,BamHI, and EcoRI). The cloned Cltx was then subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pRSETB vector (Invitrogen). pRSETB has an N-terminal polyhistidine tag (His6), which allowed the purification of His-Cltx by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Talon Resin, Clontech Labs). His-tagged fusion protein was purified as a 8-kDa protein using buffer conditions as described by the manufacturer. Matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences) inserts of 8 μm pore size were rehydrated following the manufacturer's recommendations. These chambers were then coated on the lower surface with vitronectin and used for invasion assay as described earlier for transwell migration assays (13Soroceanu L. Manning T.J., Jr. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, glioma cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/filter. Cells were treated with 30 nmto 3 μm of either commercial peptide Cltx (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) or His-Cltx and further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells which remained in the upper chamber were scrubbed off the inserts and the invaded cells were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik stain kit (Dade Behring, VWR Scientific, Switzerland). The relative inhibition of invasion was calculated as decrease in the number of migrated cells in the presence of Cltx compared with untreated vitronectin-coated control. Dose-response curves were obtained from six samples each and data were averaged. Half-maximal inhibition of matrigel cell invasion was achieved with ∼200 nm Cltx and did not differ between His-Cltx and commercial Cltx (Alomone). Glioma cells plated in a 96-well plate at 5000 cells/well and loaded with MEQ and Cl− fluxes across glioma membranes were assayed in the presence of 30 nm to 3 μm His-Cltx or native peptide Cltx (Alomone) using previously described methods (13Soroceanu L. Manning T.J., Jr. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications in preparation of MEQ dye. Briefly, MEQ was reduced to a yellow oil by 12% sodium borohydride under constant flow of nitrogen. When yellow oil separated out, the oil was subjected to two consecutive extractions in a 50% ether:water (v/v) mixture and then further dried under nitrogen. Experiments were performed at room temperature with gluconate-based buffers as described earlier. Inhibition of Cl− fluxes was directly compared for His6-Cltx and commercially available Cltx and found to be indistinguishable. Briefly, proteins processed from membrane fractions, cytosolic fractions, or total cell lysates were analyzed by Far Western blots using protocols described before (20Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Kaempf U. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with 300–500 nm His-Cltx followed by detection of the bound proteins using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Clontech, 1:5000). Cultured cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped with cell scrapers, and pelleted at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell homogenates were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 1.0 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2 supplemented with 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixtures I and II (mixture I: 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml antipain, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor; and mixture II: 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 30 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride in dimethyl sulfoxide)) and homogenizing in tissue grinders for 1 min with incubations on ice at 1-min intervals. Cell debris was spun down at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and fractionated and membrane fractions were processed for analysis as described earlier (21Ye Z.C. Rothstein J.D. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10767-10777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described (22MacFarlane S.N. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5245-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation analysis, samples were prepared and precleared as described earlier (22MacFarlane S.N. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5245-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precleared lysate was incubated with Protein A beads already pre-reacted with rabbit serum (60 min at room temperature) for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were then centrifuged gently and supernatant was collected. Protein A beads were pre-reacted with primary antibody (1:1, v/v) and followed procedures for immunoprecipitation as described (22MacFarlane S.N. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5245-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface proteins were biotinylated as previously described (21Ye Z.C. Rothstein J.D. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10767-10777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at 80% confluence in a 100-mm dish were incubated with 3.8 ml of a 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce) in PBS/calcium/magnesium solution for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Following quenching of biotinylation in PBS/calcium/magnesium plus 100 mm glycine, and further incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking, glycine solution was aspirated and rinsed twice with PBS/calcium/magnesium. Cells were then lysed and biotinylated cell surface fractions and intracellular fractions were separated and analyzed by immunoblotting as described (21Ye Z.C. Rothstein J.D. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10767-10777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant chlorotoxin was coupled to Actigel-ALD (Sterogene, Carlsbad, CA) and stored following the manufacturer's recommendations. His-Cltx was added to Actigel-ALD (0.5 mg/ml of resin) followed by ALD-coupling solution (1 m NaCNBH3) to a final concentration of 0.1 m (0.2 ml/ml resin). Four gorilla flasks of D54-MG cells were grown to confluence, yielding about 20 mg of total protein. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and re-centrifuged at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman T70.1 rotor for 60 min at 4 °C. Pellets, representing the total cell membrane fraction, were resuspended in homogenization buffer (supplemented with protease inhibitors) containing 1% SDS followed by addition of a 7-fold excess volume of 1% Triton X-100. The samples were then heated to 48 °C for 5 min. This lysate was then precleared with unconjugated Actigel-ALD beads with end-over-end rotation (100-μl bead slurry per 1-ml lysate) for 4 h at 4 °C. Following a brief centrifugation at 100 ×g, the supernatant was removed and incubated with the His-Cltx-conjugated Actigel-ALD beads (250 μl/ml of precleared lysate) for 4 h at 4 °C or overnight. The beads were then centrifuged for 2 min at 100 × g and unbound material was removed. The beads were extensively washed with homogenization buffer (supplemented additionally with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.01% Tween). The bound proteins were then eluted by boiling with Laemmli SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 600 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Samples were separated on denaturing 8, 10, or 4–15% gradient gels by SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by Western blots and overlay assays. The identity of the receptor was determined following electrophoresis of the affinity purified fractions on a 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel, staining with Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad), and excising the band of interest. The proteins were then destained and trypsinized and the protein digest extract was analyzed by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The peptide masses were entered into MASCOT to identify the protein by searching the NCBI data base. Sequence information was obtained with a Micromass Q-TOF-2 mass spectrometer. Gelatin zymography was performed using 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin (Bio-Rad). Briefly, eluates from the affinity purification column were separated by SDS-PAGE on the gel, and following electrophoresis the gel was washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h to remove SDS and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5.0 mm CaCl2, and 1 μmZnCl2, and 0.005% Brij buffer. The gel was then stained with Coomassie for 30 min and destained quickly for 5 min to reveal gelatinolytic activity as opaque unstained bands. Gelatinase activity was analyzed utilizing a MMP gelatinase activity assay kit (Chemicon) provided with recombinant human MMP-2 following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, purified human MMP-2 (Chemicon) was diluted in reaction buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2) at concentrations ranging from 2.8 to 280 nm. 50-μl samples of these different concentrations of MMP-2 were transferred to a rehydrated biotin-binding plate and incubated for 30 min with 160 μl of 30–1000 nm Cltx in a 96-well plate in the presence of biotinylated gelatin. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 or 30 min, 100 μl of each sample was analyzed for MMP-2 activity (n = 8) as described by the manufacturer (Chemicon). To localize net gelatinolytic activity of MMPs by in situ zymography, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled DQ gelatin that is intramolecularly quenched (Molecular Probes) was used as a substrate for degradation by gelatinases as reported earlier (23Oh L.Y. Larsen P.H. Krekoski C.A. Edwards D.R. Donovan F. Werb Z. Yong V.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8464-8475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis by gelatinases yields cleaved fluorescein isothiocyanate-gelatin peptides and the localization of this fluorescence indicates the sites of net gelatinolytic activity. Briefly, glioma cells were plated on 12-mm coverslips. After 24 h incubation, cells were treated with 30 nm Cltx, 300 nm Cltx, or 50 μm 1,10-phenanthroline for 30 min at 37 °C. Untreated cells served as negative control for this experiment. Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with zymography reaction buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm NaN3, pH 7.6, the high concentration of azide prevented the gelatin from being phagocytosed and thus allowing cell surface gelatinolytic activity to occur) containing 100 μg/ml DQ gelatin at 37 °C overnight. At the end of the incubation period, without fixation or further washes, gelatinolytic activity of the MMPs was localized and photographed by fluorescence microscopy and images were acquired by Spot digital camera. Glioma cells were plated at 40% confluency onto 12-mm round coverslips in appropriate tissue culture medium. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, medium was aspirated and replaced by serum-free medium containing irrelevant His-protein (pRsetB-His) for untreated controls and serum-free media containing His-Cltx (300 nm) and further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were rinsed, after fixation, with PBS (3 × 10 min). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature with blocking buffer (PBS containing 3% goat serum, 0.1% azide, and 0.3% Triton X-100 (for permeabilized samples), α-MMP-2 primary antibodies were added to the cells (1:500) and incubated overnight at room temperature in blocking buffer with or without Triton X-100. Cells were then rinsed (3 × 10 min) with PBS containing blocker and then incubated with Alexa red (1:750) secondary antibodies in blocker for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using gel mount following another 10-min wash in PBS. Immunofluorescence study was carried out using a Leica epifluorescence microscope (×40 oil and ×100 oil objectives), and images were captured using a digital spot camera. Glioma cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in serum containing media. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed and then incubated with serum-free media containing 300 nm His-Cltx, irrelevant His-protein (pRsetB-His), or 50 μm 1,10-phenanthroline for 30 min at 37 °C to allow sufficient internalization of His-Cltx. Cells were then washed and cell surface biotinylation was carried out as described above. Biotinylated cell surface fractions and intracellular fractions were analyzed using Western blots for quantitative levels of Cltx. Alternatively, cells were treated with filipin at 5 μg/ml for 15 min at 4 °C to flatten the caveolae prior to treatments with Cltx. Cells were then processed for cell surface biotinylation as described above to analyze the level and route of internalization of His-Cltx and associated MMP-2. Data were analyzed with Origin (version 6.0, MicroCal, Northampton, MA). All curve fitting was performed using curve fitting routine provided by this software. Analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons of data. All values are reported as mean ± S.E. and percentages calculated from mean values. To isolate and characterize the putative Cltx receptor, we synthesized recombinant Cltx with a His6 tag (His-Cltx) in E. coli. The biological activity of the recombinant His-Cltx was indistinguishable from that of commercially available peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”). Total cell lysates as well as crude membrane preparations of glioma cells were probed with His-Cltx and showed binding to a prominent protein with a corresponding molecular weight of ∼70,000. This protein was not present in cultured rat astrocytes (Fig. 1 a). To demonstrate that the expression of the Cltx-binding protein is on the cell surface, we used a cell surface biotinylation approach to distinguish between cell surface proteins and proteins contained in intracellular membranes. In Far Western blots with His-Cltx, we found that the Cltx-binding protein was present both in the cell surface membrane fractions in two glioma cell lines as well as intracellullar fractions (D54-MG and CCF-STTG1; Fig. 1 b). Actin immunoreactivity, which served as a control, was only found associated with intracellular fractions (Fig. 1 b). For isolation and further purification of the Cltx receptor, His-Cltx was immobilized to Actigel ALD beads by chemical conjugation. Affinity purification of glioma membrane fractions (20 mg) using this column revealed that the putative Cltx receptor could be purified together with a number of other proteins that were mostly insoluble in 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3 a). To disrupt this complex and selectively purify only Cltx-binding proteins, membrane fractions were sequentially treated with buffers containing 1% SDS and then a 7-fold excess volume of 1% Triton X-100. Samples were subsequently heated to 48 °C for 5 min before binding to the affinity column. These conditions were able to disrupt the complex and allow the isolation of a ∼70-kDa protein, which retained binding to His-Cltx as assessed by Far Western blots (Fig. 1 c). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of this affinity purified 70-kDa protein following tryptic digestion of the excised protein band from SDS-PAGE revealed its identity to be the matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-2 (see mass profile Fig. 1 d). Sequence information obtained with a Micromass Q TOF-2 mass spectrometer further confirmed the identity of the Cltx receptor as MMP-2 (Fig. 3 b). The overlay assays of affinity purified membrane fractions in Fig. 1 c suggest that the Cltx receptor, most likely MMP-2, is only expressed in glioma cell membranes but not in astrocytes. To demonstrate that this lack of Cltx binding in astrocytes is because of the absence of MMP-2, we performed Western blot analysis of astrocyte and glioma cell lysates with rabbit α-MMP-2 antibodies (Fig. 2 a). MMP-2 immunoreactivity was only seen in glioma cells but not in astrocytes explaining the lack of His-Cltx binding to astrocytes. MMP-2 can exist in several molecular weight forms including a latent proenzyme of 72,000, a ∼64,000 activation intermediate, a ∼62,000 mature protease (24Sato H. Seiki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and a 45,000 process active form (25Fridman R. Toth M. Pena D. Mobashery S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2548-2555PubMed Google Scholar, 26Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). In Western blots, MMP-2 antibodies recognized three bands at these molecular weights in total cell lysates from glioma cells (Fig. 2 a). Following affinity purification of glioma membranes with His-Cltx, MMP-2 antibodies recognize primarily a 72-kDa band (Fig. 2 b). This is consistent with previous reports showing this species to be the major form of MMP-2 on glioma membranes (27Sawaya R.E. Yamamoto M. Gokaslan Z.L. Wang S.W. Mohanam S. Fuller G.N. McCutcheon I.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Nicolson G.L. Rao J.S. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The ability of Cltx to interact with MMP-2 in glioma cells and not astrocytes is supported by overlays demonstrating that His-Cltx binds to recombinant MMP-2, as well as bands of the same mobility in D54-MG and CCF-STTG1 glioma cell lines but not astrocytes (Fig. 2 c). Proteins affinity purified from D54 membranes with His-Cltx were found to exhibit gelatinase activity in gelatin zyomograms (Fig. 2 d). The mobility of the zymographically active bands appeared between ∼60,000 and 75,000 and ∼45,000, which are molecular weights consistent with the presence of the various MMP-2 species. Whether Cltx inhibits MMP-2 catalytic activity will be examined below. Given that glioma cells express several MMPs including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 (28Nakagawa T. Kubota T. Kabuto M. Sato K. Kawano H. Hayakawa T. Okada Y. J. Neurosurg. 1994; 81: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) we sought to evaluate whether the zymographically active bands in Fig. 2 d were because of an association of Cltx with MMP-2 or one of these other MMPs. To do this, purified MMP-1, -3, and -9 were run on gels and probed with His-Cltx. Our data show that Cltx only interacts with MMP-2 (Fig. 2 e). Taken together, these findings suggest that MMP-2 is the principal receptor for Cltx on the surface of glioma cells. As mentioned above, His-Cltx affinity purification of its receptor also led to the isolation of additional protein bands (Fig. 3 a) that could be separated from MMP-2 by heating to 48 °C in SDS and Triton X-100. These data indicate that in the plasma membrane of glioma cells, the Cltx receptor is present in a macromoelcular complex with other proteins. To better understand the nature of this protein complex, membrane samples solubilized in Triton X-100 and affinity purified with His-Cltx were separate by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, excised, and processed for mass spectrometry. Of the additional six major proteins bands seen by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3 a), mass spectrometric analysis was able to determine the identity of three as MT1-MMP, αv integrin, and TIMP-2 (Fig. 3 b). Details pertaining to the identification by mass spectrometry are given in Fig. 3 b. The presence of these proteins in His-Cltx-isolated material was confirmed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against αvβ3 integrin, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2 (Fig. 3 c). The co-existence of MMP-2 (Fig. 2) in a complex with MT1-MMP, αvβ3 integrin, and TIMP-2 is intriguing as it has previously been shown that MMP-2 is docked"

Unlike most other TRP-related channels, which are inhibited by La3+ and Gd3+, currents through TRPC4 and TRPC5 are potentiated by La3+. Because these differential effects of lanthanides on TRPC subtypes may be useful for clarifying the role of different TRPCs in native tissues, we characterized the potentiating effect in detail and localized the molecular determinants of potentiation by mutagenesis. Whole cell currents through TRPC5 were reversibly potentiated by micromolar concentrations of La3+or Gd3+, whereas millimolar concentrations were inhibitory. By comparison, TRPC6 was blocked to a similar extent by La3+ or Gd3+ at micromolar concentrations and showed no potentiation. Dual effects of lanthanides on TRPC5 were also observed in outside-out patches. Even at micromolar concentrations, the single channel conductance was reduced by La3+, but reduction in conductance was accompanied by a dramatic increase in channel open probability, leading to larger integral currents. Neutralization of the negatively charged amino acids Glu543and Glu595/Glu598, situated close to the extracellular mouth of the channel pore, resulted in a loss of potentiation, and, for Glu595/Glu598 in a modification of channel inhibition.

The properties and activation mechanisms of TRPCs have been studied extensively in heterologous expression systems. By contrast, relatively little information is available on their role in native cells. Two recent studies (6Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ.

Therefore, precise knowledge of the properties of heterologously expressed TRPC channels may be essential to evaluate the involvement of TRPC proteins in receptor-operated cation conductances in native cells.Structurally, TRP channels, like many other cation channels, have been proposed to have six transmembrane segments (S1–S6), intracellular N and C termini, and a pore-forming reentrant loop between S5 and S6. Based on amino acid sequence similarity, the mammalian members of the TRPC subfamily can be subdivided into four groups (4Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev.

This subdivision is also supported by functional data. One of the major functional criteria is the mechanism of channel activation. From studies in heterologous expression systems, it is undisputed that receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C is a key event in the activation of all TRPC isoforms. Evidence indicates that currents mediated by TRPC3, TRPC6, or TRPC7 can be activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) independently of protein kinase C (9Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C.

By contrast, TRPC4 and TRPC5 are not activated by DAG, and some evidence indicates that unidentified components of the phospholipase C pathway other than DAG or store depletion activate the channels (14Okada T.

Interestingly, recent studies have reported that 100 μm La3+ has potentiating effects on mouse, rat, and human TRPC4 and mouse TRPC5 (15Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T.

By contrast, other TRPCs are inhibited by micromolar concentrations of La3+ or Gd3+ (6Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ.

For this study we chose the rat TRPC6B slice variant (12Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which lacks 54 amino acids at the distal N terminus compared with rat TRPC6A, and has not previously been characterized electrophysiologically. Unlike TRPC6A, TRPC6B has been reported to be activated by agonist application but not by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) (12Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In whole cell patch clamp recordings, we found that TRPC5 was bimodally modulated by lanthanides, with potentiation at micromolar concentrations being succeeded by inhibition at millimolar concentrations. In contrast, TRPC6 was inhibited by micromolar concentrations and showed no potentiation. At the single channel level, the effects of La3+ on TRPC5 are complex, affecting the single channel conductance, the mean open time, and the frequency of channel openings. By site-specific neutralization of extracellular negatively charged amino acids, we have identified two sites, close to the pore mouth, that are involved in potentiation of TRPC5 by La3+.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we show that currents mediated by TRPC5 and TRPC6 are affected differently by the lanthanides La3+ and Gd3+. Although whole cell currents through TRPC6 were inhibited concentration-dependently by lanthanides, those through TRPC5 were potentiated by low concentrations but inhibited by high concentrations. The dual effect of La3+ on TRPC5 was also observed at the single channel level and involved a combination of an inhibitory effect on channel amplitude and an increase in channel open probability. By an analysis of point mutants, we identified two sites, close to the extracellular mouth of the pore, which are involved in La3+- and Ca2+-induced channel potentiation.Inhibitory effects of different di- and trivalent cations, including La3+ and Gd3+, have been described for most Ca2+-permeable channels. Accordingly, current block by bath application of lanthanide ions has been reported for several members of the TRPC subfamily of TRP channels, e.g. for human and mouse TRPC3 (29Okada T. Inoue R.

There is considerable variability in the IC50 values obtained, with higher values in Ca2+ imaging experiments than in electrophysiological recordings. The IC50 value obtained for rat TRPC6 in the present study was in good agreement with the values obtained in whole cell patch clamp experiments for mouse TRPC6 (6Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and human TRPC3 (39Halaszovich C.R. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37423-37428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).The pronounced increase in agonist-induced currents in TRPC5-expressing cells with micromolar La3+ in the present study are in agreement with previous studies on this channel (15Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), and we have extended this observation to Gd3+, which is approximately equally effective. A further novel finding of the present study is that higher lanthanide concentrations (≥1 mm) were less effective in potentiating the current and even reversibly inhibited currents carried by TRPC5. Millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ also potentiated agonist-induced currents and prevented the effects of micromolar La3+, suggesting that physiological divalent cations may also bind at the same site.Evidence for two different actions of lanthanides on the channel was supported by the effects of La3+ on single channel currents in outside-out patches. La3+ caused a concentration-dependent decrease in single channel current amplitude, while, at the same time, increasing the channel open probability (NPo). Both effects were already observed at a concentration of 1 μm. The concentration dependence of the increase in current in outside-out patches (NPo·i) closely paralleled the increase in whole cell current, although the maximum potentiation was, on average, about 3–4-fold higher in outside-out patches than in whole cell experiments. Because of our inability to resolve currents at millimolar concentrations of La3+, it is not clear from the single channel data why potentiation declines and inhibition occurs. A decrease in single channel current is at least partly responsible for the decrease in whole cell current.There are few reports of potentiating effects of La3+ on ion channel currents, and more importantly, to our knowledge, there are no reports that describe dual effects on ion channel activity. Potentiating actions of 100 μm La3+ have been observed in whole cell recordings for mouse, rat, and human TRPC4- and mouse TRPC5-mediated currents (15Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T.

In the latter, heteromultimers of TRPC1 and TRPC5 are thought to be formed, which, compared with homomeric TRPC5, have a drastically reduced single channel current (−0.5 pA at a holding potential of −60 mV). The single channel current amplitude was not affected by the inclusion of La3+ in the pipette solution. For native nonselective cation currents, there is one report of a potentiation of the native current (I cat) in rat ileal smooth muscle cells by La3+, with an apparent Kd of 190 μm (46Inoue R. Morita H. Yanagida H. Ito Y. J. Smooth Muscle Res. 1998; 34: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). From relaxation analysis, prolonged single channel mean open life times were suggested to be the main cause of the augmentative effect of La3+. Interestingly, in the mouse, TRPC4 is expressed in this tissue (47Walker R.L. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1184-C1192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to heterologously expressed TRPC4 and TRPC5, it should be noted that some studies reported an inhibition by micromolar lanthanide concentrations (14Okada T. Shimizu S. Wakamori M. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Takada N. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10279-10287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,48McKay R.R. Szymeczek-Seay C.L. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The loss of the potentiating effects of La3+ and Ca2+ in mutants of two sites (Glu543 and Glu595/Glu598), which, according to models of TRP channel structure, are located opposite each other at the start and end of the pore-forming loop between S5 and S6, strongly supports an extracellular site of action. Importantly, identical amino acids are present in TRPC4 at the positions corresponding to Glu543and Glu595 in TRPC5, but acid amino acids are not present at corresponding positions in TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7. Larger variations in structure prevent an identification of corresponding residues in TRPC1. The differences between the TRPC isoforms provide an explanation for the specificity of the potentiating effect for TRPC4 and TRPC5. Interestingly, these sites are analogous to those in TRPV1 (VR1) which are involved in proton-mediated channel potentiation (Glu600) and proton-mediated channel activation (Glu648) (49Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and can modulate sensitivity to the activator capsaicin (49Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 50Welch J.M. Simon S.A. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Indeed, at the latter site TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPV1 have identical EFTE motifs. Because the distal steps leading to activation of this channel and the activation mechanism are not known, it is not clear how La3+ or Ca2+ binding to the extracellular sites results in current potentiation. By analogy to TRPV1, where neutralization of Glu600 and Glu648 leads to potentiation of the capsaicin sensitivity (49Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 50Welch J.M. Simon S.A. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that La3+ or Ca2+, by neutralizing the negative charges, potentiate the response of TRPC5 to its unknown activator.The TRPC5 mutation E595Q/E598Q also affected inhibition by La3+, whereas E543Q did not. For the wild type channel, the reduction in single channel current by La3+ at all potentials without an increase in open channel noise is indicative of a fast block at a site outside the membrane electrical field. Similarly, inhibition of whole cell currents in the mutant E543Q, which lacked potentiation, was potential-independent. In contrast, the mutant E595Q/E598Q showed a slower flickery block at the single channel level and a clear potential dependence of whole cell current inhibition, with inward currents being more strongly reduced than outward currents. The loss of the fast block by mutation at the extracellular site E595Q/E598Q and the potential dependence of the block remaining after mutation indicate that in both cases La3+ blocks the channel from the outside. The effect of this mutation on inhibition by La3+, the increase in single channel current, and the increase in P Ca/P Nasuggest that this site lies close to, or in, the permeation pathway. Considering the change in channel inhibition by La3+, it is possible that the increase in single channel current in E595Q/E598Q results from a reduction in block by a physiological cation. By analogy to other channels with similar structure, the glutamates will form a negatively charged ring around the extracellular pore mouth, with, in tetramers, at least 12 negatively charged residues. These amino acids may act as “gatekeepers” controlling cation entry into the pore.Further evidence that both potentiation of TRPC5 and inhibition of TRPC6 by lanthanides results from an extracellular action of La3+ is provided by the presence of the effects in experiments with intracellular EGTA buffers and their persistence in the presence of higher concentrations of BAPTA. Both buffers have a very high affinity for lanthanides. Recently, Halaszovich et al. (39Halaszovich C.R. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37423-37428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggested that La3+ and Gd3+block human TRPC3 channels from the cytosolic side of the membrane and that different apparent IC50 values might simply reflect different uptake rates for lanthanide ions in different cell types (see below). Our data support an extracellular site of action on TRPC6 and on TRPC5, although we cannot exclude additional intracellular effects.Because of the variability in results from different laboratories, the applicability of results from heterologous overexpression studies on TRPC channels to native channels has recently been questioned (e.g. 5). However, for TRPC6, at least, properties nearly identical to those observed after overexpression are seen for native channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (6Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y.

The bile acid responsiveness of ASBT is controversial. Bile acid feeding in mice results in decreased expression of ASBT protein and mRNA. Mouse but not rat ASBT promoter activity was repressed in Caco-2, but not IEC-6, cells by chenodeoxycholic acid. A potential liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) cis-acting element was identified in the bile acid-responsive region of the mouse but not rat promoter. The mouse, but not rat, promoter was activated by LRH-1, and this correlated with nuclear protein binding to the mouse but not rat LRH-1 element. The short heterodimer partner diminished the activity of the mouse promoter and could partially offset its activation by LRH-1. Interconversion of the potential LRH-1 cis-elements between the mouse and rat ASBT promoters was associated with an interconversion of LRH-1 and bile acid responsiveness. LRH-1 protein was found in Caco-2 cells and mouse ileum, but not IEC-6 cells or rat ileum. Bile acid response was mediated by the farnesoid X receptor, as shown by the fact that overexpression of a dominant-negative farnesoid X-receptor eliminated the bile acid mediated down-regulation of ASBT. In addition, ASBT expression in farnesoid X receptor null mice was unresponsive to bile acid feeding. In summary cell line- and species-specific negative feedback regulation of ASBT by bile acids is mediated by farnesoid X receptor via small heterodimer partner-dependent repression of LRH-1 activation of the ASBT promoter.

The complexity of the current literature reflects the difficulties of in vivo assessment of a transport system that is part of a highly integrated and tightly regulated metabolic pathway.The molecular mechanisms of bile acid responsiveness have been elucidated in recent elegant investigations from a number of laboratories (16Chawla A. Repa J. Evans R. Mangelsdorf D. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). In general two systems have been characterized, those that are under positive or negative feedback regulation by bile acids. Positive feedback regulation is mediated by the direct effect of a complex of bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor. Notable examples include transcriptional activation of the ileal lipid-binding protein (ILBP) and the canalicular bile salt excretory pump promoters by bile acids (17Makishima M. Okamoto A. Repa J.

The first step is dependent upon activation of the expression of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) by a complex of bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor. SHP then mediates down-regulation of target genes by inhibiting the activity of endogenously expressed positive trans-acting factors. For example SHP inactivates the liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) and the retinoic acid receptor in the cases of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (22Lu T. Makishima M. Repa J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.

Analysis in our own laboratory has indicated that in the rat, ileal ASBT does not respond to alterations in lumenal bile acid concentrations (10Arrese M. Trauner M. Sacchiero R.J. Crossman M.W. Shneider B.L. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast mouse studies conducted by Torchia and confirmed in our own laboratory (reported herein) (8Torchia E. Cheema S. Agellon L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Ma L. Sehayek E. Breslow J. Shneider B.

Al-Ansari N. Shneider B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38703-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and mouse (herein) ASBT promoters permit in vitro analysis of bile acid responsiveness independent of the complexities of in vivo integrated alterations in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Studies—All animal studies were performed under protocols approved by the animal care and use committees of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Rockefeller University and the National Institutes of Health. The effect of bile acids on the expression of ASBT in the mouse ileum was determined in male C57Bl/6J mice that were fed a diet supplemented with 0.5% cholic acid or 0.5% taurocholic acid for a period of 7 days. Ileal protein homogenates and brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from the distal one-third of mouse ileum using methods that have been previously developed for the analysis of fetal and neonatal rat ileum (26Shneider B. Setchell K.D.R. Crossman M. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Brush border membrane enrichment was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase in homogenates and membranes. Quantitative Western blot analysis of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and the ileal lipid-binding protein was performed as described previously (10Arrese M. Trauner M. Sacchiero R.J. Crossman M.W. Shneider B.L. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibodies against ILBP were generously provided by Dr. Michael Crossman (Children's Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). β-Actin was used as a loading control (Sigma). Northern blot analysis was used to assess changes in steady-state mRNA levels of ASBT and ILBP as described previously (10Arrese M. Trauner M. Sacchiero R.J. Crossman M.W. Shneider B.L. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was analyzed from the distal one third of the small intestine from five separate samples in each group (chow-fed and cholic acid-fed). Signal intensity for 28 S rRNA was used as a loading control.Cell Culture—Human Caco-2 colon epithelial cells and rat IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The plasmid-transfected cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.5% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum for 40 h before harvest for reporter gene assays. The change in medium was designed to minimize the effect of bile salts found in fetal calf serum.Cloning and Characterization of the Mouse ASBT Promoter—A partial murine ASBT cDNA was obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to amino acid sequences conserved between the ileal and liver sodium/bile acid cotransporters; the sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers corresponded to amino acids 75–81 and 261–266, respectively, of the human ASBT. Oligonucleotide primers were then designed based on this mouse sequence and the predicted exon 1 region and used to screen a mouse (strain Sv129/OLA) bacteriophage P1 library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). Two mouse genomic clones (12605, 12606) containing slc10A2 sequences were obtained and mapped. The structure of the mouse slc10a2 gene was elucidated using a combination of subcloning, restriction enzyme analysis, Southern blotting, long PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing. The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the GenBankTM with accession number AF266724. Specific elements of the ASBT promoter were cloned and sequenced from several representative mouse (C57Bl/6J, SJL/J, and BALB/cByJ, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and rat (Long Evans, SHR, Fischer-344, Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY) strains. Genomic DNA from each of the species was amplified with oligonucleotide primers extending from -385 to -95 (sense, 5′-GCCCTAGAAGTCTGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTGGGAATAATTTTAG-3′). PCR products were then sequenced directly.For transcription studies, a SacI fragment encompassing nucleotides -1297 to +101 (where the “A” of the ATG is +1) was subcloned into pBluescript II KS and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 sequencer. Using this 1.4-kb ASBT 5′ sequence as a template, four fragments were PCR-synthesized and subcloned into the vector pGL3-Basic (Invitrogen), forming the mouse ASBT5′ constructs pGL3-mASBT5′/1.1 kb, pGL3-mASBT5′/0.7 kb (no correlate in rat constructs), pGL3-mASBT5′/P2 (mP2) and pGL3-mASBT5′/P3 (mP3), which correspond to the rat ASBT5′ constructs pGL3-ASBT5′/-829/+384, pGL3-ASBT5′/-378/+118(rP2), and pGL3-ASBT5′/-208/+118(rP3), respectively (25Chen F. Ma L. Al-Ansari N. Shneider B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38703-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).DNA Oligonucleotides and Site-directed Mutagenesis—To prepare ASBT 5′ mutant constructs, complimentary strands of DNA oligonucleotides, containing the appropriate sequences and the desired point mutations within the LRH-1 element, were synthesized in vitro by the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Core Facility (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). The site-directed point mutagenesis of mouse and rat ASBT 5′ sequences was performed by a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), targeted to the potential LRH-1 cis-acting element in the mouse (positioned from -336 to -327) and the corresponding sequence in the rat (positioned from -340 to -331) P2 DNA fragments, respectively (see Fig. 1). The DNA oligonucleotide primers, mLRHmu and rLRHmu, were synthesized with sequences labeled as “LRH oligo sequence,” as shown in Fig. 1. Two PCR generated point mutations converted mouse original LRH-1 cis-elements into the corresponding rat sequence and vice versa (Fig. 1). The resulting PCR products, pmP2-LRHmu and prP2-LRHmu, were examined for their sizes by electrophoresis, and the point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Nuclear Protein Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear proteins were extracted from Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells using the method as described previously (27Chen F.Y. Harris L.C. Remack J.S. Brent T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit as described by Bio-Rad (technical bulletin 1015), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protein preparations were aliquoted into vials, quick-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out as described previously (28Rondon I. MacMillan L. Beckman C. Goldberg M. Schneider T. Bunn H. Malter J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16594-16598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 5 μg of nuclear protein extract and 105 cpm of DNA probes in 15 mm KCl, 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol in a total volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. Following digestion with 127 units of DNase I (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 7% native polyacrylamide gel. Competition experiments were performed using specific or nonspecific unlabelled oligonucleotide probes. Supershift assays were performed using either an LRH-1-specific polyclonal antibodies or an irrelevant antibody (anti-human growth hormone).Transient Transfection and Firefly Luciferase Assay—The procedures for transient transfection and firefly luciferase analysis of cells were performed as described previously (25Chen F. Ma L. Al-Ansari N. Shneider B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38703-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, transient transfection was carried out by electroporation (0.22 kV and 0.95 μF) of 5 × 106 cells with 4 μg of ASBT 5′/luciferase hybrid constructs and 0.1 μgof a quantitative control plasmid pRL-TK containing a thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase gene (Promega). After electroporation, the cells were cultured for an additional 40 h before performing dual luciferase assays (Promega) as described by the manufacturer.Bile Acid and Orphan Nuclear Receptor Gene Constructs—To examine the effect of bile acids on mouse promoter activity, mouse ASBT 5′/firefly luciferase hybrid reporter construct, pGL3-mASBT5′/P2-transfected Caco-2 cells were treated for 40 h with various concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μm) of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, Sigma) followed by dual luciferase assays. The effect of 100 μm CDCA on the mouse P2 and P3 constructs and the rat ASBT 5′ construct pGL3-ASBT5′/-378/+118 was assessed by transient transfection analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from four separate sets of control or CDCA treated"
https://openalex.org/W2165546509,"ATP depletion induced by hypoxia or mitochondrial inhibitors results in Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol in cultured rat proximal tubule cells. Translocated Bax undergoes further conformational changes to oligomerize into high molecular weight complexes (Mikhailov, V., Mikhailova, M., Pulkrabek, D. J., Dong, Z., Venkatachalam, M. A., and Saikumar, P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 18361–18374). Here we report that following Bax translocation in ATP-depleted rat proximal tubule cells, Bak, a proapoptotic molecule that normally resides in mitochondria, also reorganizes to form homo-oligomers. Oligomerization of both Bax and Bak occurred independently of Bid cleavage and/or translocation. Western blots of chemically cross-linked membrane extracts showed nonoverlapping “ladders” of Bax and Bak complexes in multiples of ∼21 and ∼23 kDa, respectively, consistent with molecular homogeneity within each ladder. This indicated that Bax and Bak complexes were homo-oligomeric. Nevertheless, each oligomer could be co-immunoprecipitated with the other, suggesting a degree of affinity between Bax and Bak that permitted co-precipitation but not cross-linking. Furthermore, dissociation of cross-linked complexes by SDS and renaturation prior to immunoprecipitation did not prevent reassociation of the two oligomeric species. Notably, expression of Bcl-2 prevented not only the oligomerization of Bax and Bak, but also the association between these two proteins in energy-deprived cells. Using Bax-deficient HCT116 and BMK cells, we show that there is stringent Bax requirement for Bak homo-oligomerization and for cytochrome c release during energy deprivation. Using Bak-deficient BMK cells we further show that Bak deficiency is associated with delayed kinetics of Bax translocation but does not affect either the oligomerization of translocated Bax or the leakage of cytochrome c. These results suggest a degree of functional cooperation between Bax and Bak in this form of cell injury, but also demonstrate an absolute requirement of Bax for mitochondrial permeabilization."

Decreased metal binding site occupancy and exposure to the disulfide-reducing agents dithiothreitol, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), or reduced glutathione increased the fraction of anomalously migrating mutant SOD1 proteins. Furthermore, the incubation of mutant SOD1s with TCEP increased the accessibility to iodoacetamide of cysteine residues that normally participate in the formation of the intrasubunit disulfide bond (Cys-57 to Cys-146) or are buried within the core of the β-barrel (Cys-6). SOD1 enzymes in spinal cord lysates from G85R and G93A mutant but not wild type SOD1 transgenic mice also exhibited abnormal vulnerability to TCEP, which exposed normally inaccessible cysteine residues to modification by maleimide conjugated to polyethylene glycol. These results implicate SOD1 destabilization under cellular disulfide-reducing conditions at physiological pH and temperature as a shared property that may be relevant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutant neurotoxicity.

Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, and ∼20% of these individuals inherit one of >90 autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (2Rosen D.R.

In addition, SOD1 knock-out mice are not susceptible to motor neuron loss unless following axonal injury (10Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M.

The observation that some mutant SOD1s exhibit accelerated turnover in vivo or increased proteolytic susceptibility compared with the WT enzyme (13Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M.

The induction of chaperone proteins that can protect cultured motor neurons from mutant SOD1 toxicity (16Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Google Scholar) and appear to associate with SOD1 mutants (17Shinder G.A. Lacourse M.C. Minotti S. Durham H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12791-12796Google Scholar) provides further evidence that destabilization or unfolding of mutant SOD1s in vivomay be related to their toxicity.We previously purified 14 different biologically metallated ALS mutant SOD1s and observed that one group of “WT-like” mutants (A4V, L38V, G41S, G72S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133Δ) bound copper in a fully active coordination environment remarkably similar to that of normal SOD1 despite causing a lethal phenotype (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Google Scholar). The other six “metal-binding region” mutants (H46R, H48Q, G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N) were clearly distinguished from WT SOD1 according to decreased metal ion contents, altered visible absorption spectra, or decreased specific activities. In a further analysis by differential scanning calorimetry, we found that metal-binding region mutants generally exhibited a larger fraction of species that unfolded at lowT m values compared with those of the WT-like mutants and normal SOD1 (19Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Eggers D.K. Roe J.A. Tiwari A. Brown Jr., R.H. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15932-15937Google Scholar). Although purified SOD1 mutants can lose in vitro metal ion binding specificity following partial denaturation at non-physiological pH (20Goto J.J. Zhu H. Sanchez R.J. Nersissian A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1007-1014Google Scholar), the retention of many native properties in the “as-isolated” WT-like mutants suggests that other influences may destabilize these SOD1 mutants in vivo.Fully metallated bovine SOD1 is active in 4% SDS or 8 murea (21Forman H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Google Scholar) and melts in solution at temperatures above 90 °C (22Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Google Scholar). SOD1 also retains its dimeric quaternary structure upon exposure to 1% SDS in the absence of other denaturing stresses such as heat, urea, reducing agents, or EDTA (23Keele Jr., B.B. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2875-2880Google Scholar, 24Abernethy J.L. Steinman H.M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7339-7347Google Scholar, 25Malinowski D.P. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5055-5060Google Scholar). Structural properties of SOD1 that contribute to its extreme thermochemical stability include an eight-stranded β-barrel motif, binding sites for copper and zinc ions, hydrophobic interactions associated with dimerization, and an unusual intrasubunit disulfide bond bridging a loop residue, Cys-57, and Cys-146 of the β-barrel (24Abernethy J.L. Steinman H.M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7339-7347Google Scholar, 26Bertini I. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 45: 127-250Google Scholar). The loop that includes Cys-57 also strongly influences the conformation of Arg-143, which regulates steering of superoxide anion and reactivity of the copper ion via a local hydrogen bond network and the disulfide linkage to Cys-146 (27Banci L. Benedetto M. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11780-11791Google Scholar, 28Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Fadin R. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. J. Biol. Inorg.

Furthermore, portions of this loop contribute to the dimer interface and form the zinc ion binding site (26Bertini I. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 45: 127-250Google Scholar). Conservation of these structural features in all eukaryotic SOD1s suggests that conformational stability of the enzyme, in general, and the disulfide loop, in particular, is critical under physiological conditions.The ratio of reduced (GSH) to oxidized glutathione ([GSH]/[oxidized glutathione]) of ∼30−100:1 in the cytosol (30Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Google Scholar) normally inhibits the formation of disulfide linkages in cytosolic proteins (31Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Google Scholar), yet WT SOD1 maintains a strong disulfide bond. We hypothesized that the disulfide linkage in ALS-related SOD1 mutants could be vulnerable to cleavage under cellular reducing conditions, which might further destabilize even WT-like mutants. In this study, we correlated changes in electrophoretic mobility, cysteine accessibility to modifying reagents, and protease susceptibility upon incubation of purified SOD1 mutants with disulfide-reducing agents. We then compared sulfhydryl accessibility of WT versus mutant SOD1 proteins in tissue lysates from transgenic mice expressing WT, G85R, or G93A SOD1s under reducing conditions. Our findings suggest that SOD1 destabilization related to thiol-reducing influences in the spinal cord and brain may contribute to the toxicity of mutant SOD1 enzymes in familial ALS.DISCUSSIONThe conformation and stability of ALS-related SOD1 mutants in affected tissues may be influenced directly by the mutant substitutions or indirectly as a consequence of disulfide bond reduction, decreased metal ion binding, monomerization, or other vulnerabilities under conditions in vivo. In this study, we correlated the effects of disulfide-reducing agents upon electrophoretic mobility, cysteine accessibility, and protease sensitivity among purified WT and ALS-related SOD1 variants of known metal ion content (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that G85R and G93A mutant SOD1s in transgenic mouse tissue lysates were susceptible to modification at normally inaccessible cysteine residues under reducing conditions.Our initial observation that all 14 of the ALS mutants exhibited accelerated migration during partially denaturing PAGE (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) indicated that ALS mutants share properties distinct from WT SOD1. To clarify the nature of those properties, we showed that the mutant proteins were more susceptible than WT SOD1 to disulfide reduction by TCEP (Fig. 5) and proteolysis in the presence of DTT (Fig. 6). Metal-binding region SOD1 mutants (H46R, G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N) that were severely deficient in copper and zinc ions (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Google Scholar) exhibited the greatest increase in PAGE mobility (Fig. 1), increased reactivity to iodoacetamide in the presence of TCEP (Fig. 5), and greater susceptibility to proteolysis (Fig. 6). This behavior was consistent with the known importance of metal ion binding to SOD1 stability. However, even WT-like mutants (A4V, L38V, G41S, G72S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133Δ), which had more normal metal ion coordination and specific dismutase activity (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Google Scholar), could be distinguished from WT SOD1 under disulfide-reducing conditions (Figs. 1 and 5).The large loop containing residues 49–84, which is anchored by the disulfide bond to the β-barrel, not only composes part of the dimer interface but also forms the zinc binding site that links directly to the copper ion via His-63 (44Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Google Scholar). In addition, the backbone oxygen atoms of residues Cys-57 and Gly-61 in this loop form three hydrogen bonds that correctly orient the side chain of Arg-143, an important determinant of copper ion accessibility in SOD1 (27Banci L. Benedetto M. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11780-11791Google Scholar, 28Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Fadin R. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 795-803Google Scholar, 45Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. Mullenbach G.T. Hallewell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11182-11187Google Scholar, 46Fisher C.L. Cabelli D.E. Tainer J.A. Hallewell R.A. Getzoff E.D. Proteins. 1994; 19: 24-34Google Scholar, 47Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Rosato A. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9108-9118Google Scholar, 48Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Google Scholar). These structural features increase the likelihood that disulfide reduction at Cys-57, and the disorder of this loop could facilitate partial unfolding, monomerization, metal ion loss, or altered reactivity of bound copper. Human SOD1 also contains two cysteine residues (Cys-6 and Cys-111) that increase the irreversibility of SOD1 thermal unfolding (49Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Google Scholar). The buried side chain of Cys-6, packed tightly within the interior of the β-barrel, should remain inaccessible to solvent unless the SOD1 core is severely disrupted. For example, sulfhydryl reactivity of Cys-6 in bovine SOD1 occurs during exposure to 6m guanidinium chloride but not 8 m urea (25Malinowski D.P. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5055-5060Google Scholar). In contrast, the side chain of Cys-111 is exposed on the protein surface near the dimer interface and may be conjugated to GSH in vivo (50Schinina M.E. Carlini P. Polticelli F. Zappacosta F. Bossa F. Calabrese L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 433-439Google Scholar). Our mass spectrometry results (Fig. 5) suggest that increased susceptibility to disulfide reduction of SOD1 mutants also contributed to partial unfolding of the β-barrel as indicated by accessibility of all four cysteine residues to modification by iodoacetamide. Consistent with these findings, Mal-PEG labeling of SOD1 at multiple cysteine residues was observed in tissue lysates from G85R and G93A but not WT SOD1 transgenic mice (Fig. 7).SOD1 is unusual in its ability to form a stable intrasubunit disulfide bond in the reducing environment of the cytosol, and this property may also be important for proper folding of the enzyme (51Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Google Scholar, 52Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Rotilio G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 313-316Google Scholar). We demonstrated that ALS-related SOD1 mutants were sensitive to physiological concentrations of glutathione (Fig. 3), the main cytosolic thiol-disulfide redox buffer. It is also possible that thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin pathways (53Prinz W.A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Google Scholar) could impair disulfide formation or stability during folding of the mutant SOD1 enzymes. In this regard, thioredoxin is up-regulated in erythrocytes of familial ALS patients (54Ogawa Y. Kosaka H. Nakanishi T. Shimizu A. Ohoi N. Shouji H. Yanagihara T. Sakoda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 251-257Google Scholar), and its transcript is also increased ∼6-fold in ALS spinal cord tissue (55Malaspina A. Kaushik N. de Belleroche J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 132-145Google Scholar), possibly as a defense against oxidative stress. The requirement to maintain cellular redox homeostasis and prevent the formation of non-native disulfide bonds thus might strongly influence the degree of mutant SOD1 misfolding or unfolding in specific tissues.How might the susceptibility of mutant SOD1 enzymes to disulfide reduction relate to motor neuron toxicity in familial ALS? One possibility is that destabilization of the zinc-binding loop upon disulfide cleavage could promote selective zinc ion loss while retaining reactive copper ions at the active site. Zinc-deficient, copper-containing SOD1 is neurotoxic in vitro, possibly by a mechanism involving nitric oxide (56Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Google Scholar). Alternatively, disulfide reduction could alter copper ion reactivity by perturbing the position of Arg-143, which influences substrate selectivity or by creating a novel copper binding site upon exposure of free cysteine residues. On the other hand, disease progression in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice is not affected by genetic ablation of copper chaperone-dependent copper loading into SOD1 (57Subramaniam J.R. Lyons W.E. Liu J. Bartnikas T.B. Rothstein J. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Gitlin J.D. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 301-307Google Scholar) or by expression of SOD1 mutants that severely disrupt the copper binding site (58Wang J. Xu G. Gonzales V. Coonfield M. Fromholt D. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 128-138Google Scholar). However, the toxicity of bound copper has not been completely excluded because unshielded copper ions may be toxic at even nanomolar concentrations (59Williams R.J.P. da Silva J.J.R.F. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2000; 202: 247-348Google Scholar).Disulfide reduction of the ALS mutants may also contribute to toxicity by mechanisms independent of abnormal copper reactivity. For example, the exposure of hydrophobic residues or reactive cysteines could favor abnormal interactions of SOD1 with itself or with other cellular constituents. Mutant SOD1 can form insoluble protein complexes at early stages in G93A SOD1 transgenic mouse tissues and following proteasome inhibition in cultured cells (60Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Google Scholar). Similarly, a fraction of total mutant SOD1 in brain and spinal cord tissues from SOD1 mice forms high molecular weight complexes that accumulate with disease progression (61Wang J. Xu G. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 139-148Google Scholar) and mouse tissues can exhibit thioflavin-S-positive inclusions (58Wang J. Xu G. Gonzales V. Coonfield M. Fromholt D. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 128-138Google Scholar). Oxidative stress may also be linked to the accumulation of mutant SOD1 either by decreased proteasome activity or by impaired degradation of oxidatively damaged SOD1 (62Oeda T. Shimohama S. Kitagawa N. Kohno R. Imura T. Shibasaki H. Ishii N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2013-2023Google Scholar). An increased burden of partially unfolded SOD1 proteins or complexes could ultimately impair cellular chaperone capacity (16Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Google Scholar), perturb mitochondrial function (63Kong J. Xu Z. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3241-3250Google Scholar), sequester anti-apoptotic factors (12Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9010-9014Google Scholar), disrupt protein recycling, or impose an unsustainable metabolic cost to vulnerable tissues (reviewed in Ref.3Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar).Our data suggest that cellular disulfide reducing influences at physiological temperature and pH are sufficient to convert relatively well folded WT-like SOD1 mutants (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Google Scholar) or less stable metal-binding region mutants (19Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Eggers D.K. Roe J.A. Tiwari A. Brown Jr., R.H. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15932-15937Google Scholar) into more severely destabilized species. These non-native mutant forms might resemble the subset of highly unstable SOD1 C-terminal truncation mutants (15Ratovitski T. Corson L.B. Strain J. Wong P. Cleveland D.W. Culotta V.C. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1451-1460Google Scholar, 64Zu J.S. Deng H.X. Lo T.P. Mitsumoto H. Ahmed M.S. Hung W.Y. Cai Z.J. Tainer J.A. Siddique T. Neurogenetics. 1997; 1: 65-71Google Scholar), which also lack the disulfide bond consequent to deletion of Cys-146. Overall, these results implicate susceptibility to conformational destabilization of SOD1 by a cellular reducing environment as a shared property that may be relevant to ALS mutant neurotoxicity.

Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, and ∼20% of these individuals inherit one of >90 autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (2Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P.

SOD1 is a 32-kDa homodimeric enzyme expressed predominantly in the cytosol that decreases the intracellular concentration of superoxide radicals (O 2⨪) by catalyzing their dismutation to O2 and H2O2. ALS-associated mutations of conserved residues throughout the protein impart a toxic property to the enzyme that appears unrelated to its normal dismutase activity (reviewed in Ref. 3Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar). Whereas transgenic mice that overexpress mutant SOD1s consistently develop lethal motor neuron degeneration (4Gurney M.E. Pu H.

In addition, SOD1 knock-out mice are not susceptible to motor neuron loss unless following axonal injury (10Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Google Scholar). Mutant SOD1 enzymes have been proposed to facilitate aberrant copper-mediated chemistry, disrupt protein recycling or chaperone function, form toxic aggregates, or induce organelle dysfunction or apoptosis (3Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar, 11Brown Jr., R.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 841-846Google Scholar, 12Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The observation that some mutant SOD1s exhibit accelerated turnover in vivo or increased proteolytic susceptibility compared with the WT enzyme (13Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Google Scholar, 14Hoffman E.K. Wilcox H.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. J. Neurol.

The induction of chaperone proteins that can protect cultured motor neurons from mutant SOD1 toxicity (16Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Google Scholar) and appear to associate with SOD1 mutants (17Shinder G.A. Lacourse M.C. Minotti S. Durham H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12791-12796Google Scholar) provides further evidence that destabilization or unfolding of mutant SOD1s in vivomay be related to their toxicity. We previously purified 14 different biologically metallated ALS mutant SOD1s and observed that one group of “WT-like” mutants (A4V, L38V, G41S, G72S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133Δ) bound copper in a fully active coordination environment remarkably similar to that of normal SOD1 despite causing a lethal phenotype (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Google Scholar). The other six “metal-binding region” mutants (H46R, H48Q, G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N) were clearly distinguished from WT SOD1 according to decreased metal ion contents, altered visible absorption spectra, or decreased specific activities. In a further analysis by differential scanning calorimetry, we found that metal-binding region mutants generally exhibited a larger fraction of species that unfolded at lowT m values compared with those of the WT-like mutants and normal SOD1 (19Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Eggers D.K. Roe J.A. Tiwari A. Brown Jr., R.H. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15932-15937Google Scholar). Although purified SOD1 mutants can lose in vitro metal ion binding specificity following partial denaturation at non-physiological pH (20Goto J.J. Zhu H. Sanchez R.J. Nersissian A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2092063619,"Abstract The prion protein (PrP) is a Cu2+ binding cell surface glycoprotein. There is increasing evidence that PrP functions as a copper transporter. In addition, strains of prion disease have been linked with copper binding. We present here CD spectroscopic studies of Cu2+ binding to various fragments of the octarepeat region of the prion protein. We show that glycine and l-histidine will successfully compete for all Cu2+ ions bound to the PrP octapeptide region, suggesting Cu2+ coordinates with a lower affinity for PrP than the fm dissociation constant reported previously. We show that each of the octarepeats do not form an isolated Cu2+ binding motif but fold up cooperatively within multiple repeats. In addition to the coordinating histidine side chain residues, we show that the glycine residues and the proline within each octarepeat are also necessary to maintain the coordination geometry. The highly conserved octarepeat region in mammals is a hexarepeat in birds that also binds copper but with different coordination geometry. Finally, in contrast to other reports, we show that Mn2+ does not bind to the octarepeat region of PrP."

Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 484: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To minimize detrimental effects of the reactive intermediates to host tissues and cells, arthropod phenoloxidases known so far are all produced as inactive proenzymes and require specific proteinases for proteolytic activation. Activation of proPO in insects is probably mediated by a serine proteinase cascade, analogous to the coagulation pathway and complement system in human plasma (1Ashida M. Yamazaki H. Molting and Metamorphosis. 1st Ed. Japan Scientific Society Press, Tokyo1990: 239-265Google Scholar, 2Sugumaran M. Söderhäll K. Iwanaga S. Vasta G.

Components of this proteinase system in insects may be already present in circulating hemolymph or released from hemocytes or fat body when pathogens or parasites are encountered. Recognition of invading microorganisms or aberrant host tissues may trigger the autoactivation of the first proteinase in the pathway, leading to the sequential activation of other components in the system through limited proteolysis. Prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase (PAP) (also known as prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPAE)) is the terminal enzyme that directly converts proPO to PO. The reactions catalyzed by phenoloxidase can then result in melanization of foreign organisms trapped in capsules or hemocyte nodules (7Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Presumably, protein-protein interactions ensure that the defense response occurs near the site of infection. Inhibitors of serine proteinases and phenoloxidases may further reduce unwanted damage caused by the active enzymes (8Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of proPO activation have been investigated in several insect species. We have isolated a PAP from a cuticular extract of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (9Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12220-12225Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This serine proteinase, now renamed PAP-1, hydrolyzes a synthetic peptidyl-p-nitroanilide substrate but requires another protein factor for generating active PO. A cDNA clone for PAP-1 was obtained from an M. sexta hemocyte library. Sequence comparison indicated that the protein belongs to a family of arthropod serine proteinases containing a clip domain (10Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol.

In this paper, we report the purification and characterization of a second serine proteinase from M. sexta hemolymph that activates proPO.

Molecular cloning of PAP-2 indicates that it is most similar to the silkworm PPAE and has two clip domains at its amino terminus (12Satoh D. Horii A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The PAP-2 zymogen is present at a higher level in hemolymph of M. sexta larvae that were challenged with killed bacteria. PAP-2 requires serine proteinase homologs from M. sexta plasma (13Yu, X-Q., Jiang, H., Wang, Y., and Kanost, M. R. (2003)Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar) as cofactors for proPO activation. Since the serine proteinase homologs associate with immulectin-2, a C-type lectin isolated from Manducahemolymph (13Yu, X-Q., Jiang, H., Wang, Y., and Kanost, M. R. (2003)Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 14Yu X-Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37373-37381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 15Yu X-Q. Kanost M.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 484: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), they may serve as anchoring/auxiliary factors for PAP-2 so that proPO activation only occurs as a local defense response against nonself. M. sexta eggs were originally purchased from Carolina Biological Supply, and larvae were reared on an artificial diet (16Dunn P. Drake D. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1983; 41: 77-85Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Pharate pupae with metathoracic brown bars were chilled and dissected for hemolymph collection. When all tissues were cautiously removed from the integument with a spatula, hemolymph was pooled and collected carefully with a 1-ml pipetter, avoiding contaminating tissue fragments. This method yields significantly greater amounts of hemolymph than cutting a proleg of pharate pupae, because their hemolymph volume is quite low. Individual hemolymph samples (0.8–1 ml/insect) were immediately mixed with 100% saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0) to prevent the rapid melanization of hemolymph, which occurs at this developmental stage. The ammonium sulfate was adjusted to 50% saturation, and the suspension was stored at −70 °C. Hemolymph collected this way contains many active proteinases and is stable for at least 2 years. For the bacterial induction experiment, fifth instar M. sexta larvae (day 2) were injected with Micrococcus luteus (10 μl/larva, 10 μg/μl; Sigma), formalin-killed Escherichia coli XL1-blue (108 cells/larva, 10 μl), or H2O (10 μl) as a negative control. proPO was purified from M. sexta larval hemolymph as described previously (17Jiang H. Wang Y., Ma, C. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Column fractions (10 μl) were mixed with 0.5 μg of proPO and 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, to a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated in microplate wells on ice for 60 min. PO activity was measured by adding 200 μl of 2 mm dopamine in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, to each sample well. Absorbance at 470 nm was then monitored continuously using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). One unit of PAP activity is defined as the amount of enzyme yielding PO that produces an increase of 0.001 absorbance units/min. Amidase activity was assayed by using acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-p-nitroanilide (A0180; Sigma) as a chromogenic substrate. Samples of column fractions (10–20 μl) were mixed with 200 μl of 50 μm substrate in 0.1m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.8. One unit of activity is defined as ΔA 405/min = 0.001. Since a detailed, optimized purification scheme is presented below, we briefly describe here how PAP-2 was first isolated from M. sexta hemolymph. Unless otherwise specified, conditions for separation remained the same in the first and second PAP-2 purification. The plasma (42.5 ml) from bar stage prepupae was first fractionated with 15–40% saturation of ammonium sulfate and then dialyzed before separation on a hydroxylapatite column. Fractions were assayed for PO and proPO-activating activities. The fractions that activated proPO were pooled, concentrated in a Centriplus-30 (Millipore Corp.), and applied to a Sephacryl S100-HR column. Since proPO-activating activity was low in this and the following steps, acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-p-nitroanilide hydrolysis (Sigma) was used to monitor an amidase activity (IEARase) that activates proPO only in the presence of other protein factors. Combined fractions of IEARase were passed through concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose 4B (5 ml; AmershamBiosciences) and Jacalin-agarose columns (5 ml; Vector Laboratories) to remove minor proteins that are difficult to separate in the final step. The unbound fraction from the lectin affinity columns was concentrated in a Centriplus-30 concentrator, and buffer exchange was carried out in the same centrifugal filter device. The sample was separated by HPLC on an MA7Q anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing the IEARase activity were individually concentrated in a Microcon-30 concentrator (Millipore Corp.). The partially purified IEARase (PAP-2) was treated with SDS-sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and separated by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The protein was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Amido Black (Sigma). The 35-kDa polypeptide, which corresponded to a [3H]DFP-labeled band detected as described by Jianget al. (9Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12220-12225Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), was subjected to automated Edman degradation. To determine the amino-terminal sequence of its 25-kDa light chain, purified PAP-2 (2 μg) was mixed with 1 μg of pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 10 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mm p-aminobenzamidine. The reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 18 h followed by 25 °C for 4 h. The proteins in the mixture were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10%. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed with cold anhydrous acetone and dissolved in 20 μl of the SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. After gel separation and transfer, the first six residues of the 25-kDa band were determined as described above. λ phage DNA (0.1 μg) isolated from a bacteria-induced fat body cDNA library was used as a template in a PCR to amplify a PAP-2 cDNA fragment. Two degenerate primers were designed based on the amino-terminal sequence of PAP-2 catalytic domain: 660 (5′-ACA GCC ATC GAY CAR TAY CCN TGG-3′) and 661 (5′-G CTG GCG CTG ATH GAR TAY CAY AA-3′), which encode TAIDQYPW and LALIEYHK, respectively. Primer 625 (5′-CAT GAG SGG RCC RCC SGA RTC NCC-3′) is the reverse complement of the sequence encoding GDSGGPLM, a highly conserved sequence around the active site serine residue in the chymotrypsin family of serine proteinases. In a first PCR, primer 660 was used with primer T7, which anneals with sequence in the cloning vector near the 3′-end of the inserted cDNA, under the following conditions: 94 °C, 30 s; 53 °C, 40 s; and 72 °C, 80 s for 30 cycles. The reaction product (1 μl) was used directly as a template for a second, nested PCR by using primers 661 and 625 under the same cycling conditions. After electrophoresis of the resulting products on a 1% agarose gel, a DNA band of the expected size (about 0.6 kb) was recovered and cloned into the pGem-T vector (Promega). After this clone was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis to encode PAP-2, the PCR-derived cDNA fragment was labeled by 32P and used as a probe to screen the induced M. sexta fat body cDNA library in λZAP II (Stratagene) (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 2.90-2.100Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified to homogeneity and subcloned by in vivo excision of pBluescript phagemids. Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Fat body and hemocyte total RNA samples were prepared according to Wang et al. (20Wang Y. Willott E. Kanost M.R. Insect Mol. Biol. 1995; 4: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis in agarose gels containing formamide, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with 32P-labeled PAP-2 cDNA. A duplicate blot was hybridized with a cDNA for M. sexta ribosomal protein S3 (21Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as a loading control. To detect a possible change of proPAP-2 in larval hemolymph upon bacterial challenge,Manduca larvae were injected with buffer, Escherichia coli, or M. luteus. Cell-free hemolymph samples collected at 24 h after injection were resolved by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using the polyclonal antiserum to proPAP-2 as the first antibody. 2C. Ji, Y. Wang, J. Ross, and H. Jiang, manuscript in preparation. All procedures for purification of PAP-2 were carried out at 4 °C. A frozen bar stage hemolymph sample (40 ml) was thawed, and the protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 25 min. The pellet was resuspended in 80 ml of HT buffer (pH 6.8, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl), supplemented with 0.001% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea and 0.5 mm p-aminobenzamidine. To remove the β-1,3-glucan recognition proteins in the hemolymph (22Ma C. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7505-7514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), curdlan (0.2 g) was incubated with the protein solution with gentle agitation for 10 min on ice. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min to remove the flocculent materials including curdlan. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was slowly added to the supernatant to a final saturation of 35%. After centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 30 min, the pellet was collected and dissolved in 20 ml of HT buffer. The fractionated plasma sample was dialyzed against the same buffer (1.0 liter for 8 h, twice), and the resulting particulate substances were removed by passing the sample through a syringe filter (0.45 μm, low protein binding; Fisher). The protein solution was diluted with equal volume of H2O and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (2.5-cm inner diameter × 7 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.5 × HT buffer. Following a washing step with 60 ml of 0.5× HT and 50 ml of 1× HT buffers, bound proteins were eluted at 0.5 ml/min for 4 h with a linear gradient of 20–150 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.5m NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and an IEARpNa amidase assay. Active fractions containing PAP-2 were combined and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min, dissolved in 3.0 ml, 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5 (S100 buffer), and then immediately applied to a Sephacryl S100-HR column (2.5-cm inner diameter × 100 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with S100 buffer at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min, and fractions were collected at 2.5 ml/tube after the first 100 ml. Fractions containing PAP-2 were pooled and supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2 at a final concentration of 1 mm each. The sample was loaded onto a ConA-Sepharose 4B column (5.0 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 and washed with the same buffer until A 280 was lower than 0.05. The flow-through fraction was dialyzed against Q buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), supplemented with 0.5 mm p-aminobenzamidine (2 liters each time for 8 h, twice). After passing through a syringe filter, the dialyzed sample (45 ml) was applied to a UNO-Q6 column (6 ml; Bio-Rad) equilibrated by Q buffer. Following a washing step, the bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–0.2 M NaCl in Q buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min for 30 min. This step was performed in a cold chamber using a Biologic Duo-Flow Protein Purification System (Bio-Rad). Fractions (0.5 ml/tube) were collected and analyzed by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) followed by silver staining (23Switzer R.C. Merril C.R. Shifrin S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) or immunoblot analysis. Affinity labeling with [3H]DFP and fluorographic detection of PAP-2 were carried out according to Skinner and Griswold (24Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Purified PAP-2 was stored at −70 °C for characterization and activity assays. The purified PAP-2 was desalted using a C18 zip tip (Millipore) and eluted with 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trichloroacetic acid. The sample was mixed with an equal volume of saturated sinapinic acid matrix on a MALDI plate, air-dried, and subjected to mass determination on a Voyager Elite mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with delayed extraction. The spectra were calibrated using bovine serum albumin as an external standard. To determine the site at which PAP-2 cleaves proPO, 1.0 μg of proPO was incubated with 0.2 μg of PAP-2 on ice for 60 min, and the reaction mixture was desalted and eluted as described above. Molecular masses of peaks that were not present in the control spectra of proPO and PAP-2 were compared with calculated values of the amino-terminal peptides to determine the cleavage site in proPO. The SPH-1 and -2 were isolated from induced larval hemolymph according to Yu et al. (13Yu, X-Q., Jiang, H., Wang, Y., and Kanost, M. R. (2003)Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The protein preparation (10 μl) was incubated with 40 μl of 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) in 5 mmCaCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 16 h to inactivate serine proteinases that might be associated with the SPHs. The treated sample was dialyzed against the same buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 ml/8 h each time, twice). To test the effect of M. sexta SPH-1 and SPH-2 on the activation of proPO, purified proPO was incubated with buffer, PAP-2, SPH-1 and -2, or a mixture of PAP-2 and the SPHs at 4 °C for 60 min. PO activity in the reaction mixtures was assayed, using dopamine as a substrate. As described in the legend to Fig. 6, the reaction mixtures were also subjected to electrophoresis followed by silver staining or immunoblot analysis using antiserum againstManduca proPO (diluted 1:2000) as the first antibody. To study whether PO activity is involved in the formation of SDS-stable PO polymers, we included 0.001% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU), a PO inhibitor, in some of the reaction mixtures and analyzed the samples similarly. Preliminary experiments indicated that active PO and proteinases are already present in the hemolymph of bar stage prepupalM. sexta larvae in the absence of microbial challenge. As a step toward understanding the prophenoloxidase-activating system inM. sexta hemolymph, we attempted to purify a PAP from plasma of bar stage insects. To preserve the enzyme activities and minimize protein cross-linking caused by active PO, we kept the plasma and column fractions at high salt concentrations in the presence of inhibitors of phenoloxidase and proteases. Based on our previous experience with the cuticular PAP (PAP-1) (9Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12220-12225Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we employed three different assays to follow each purification step: proPO activation, [3H]DFP labeling, and an amidase assay using acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-p-nitroanilide as a substrate. Among the commercially available peptidyl-p-nitroanilide substrates, IEARpNa is most similar to the amino-terminal side of the putative activation site in M. sexta proPO-p1 (Leu-Ser-Asn-Arg51) and proPO-p2 (Leu-Asn-Asn-Arg51) (17Jiang H. Wang Y., Ma, C. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). When the 15–40% ammonium sulfate fraction of the cell-free hemolymph was separated on a hydroxylapatite column, the proPO-activating activity roughly coincided with one of the IEARase peaks (data not shown). These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and then resolved by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S100-HR column (Fig. 1 A). We detected a major IEARase activity peak in fractions 30–34 as well as low levels of IEARpNa hydrolysis in some other column fractions. This amidase peak did not correspond to the proPO-activating activity found in fractions 10–16 (data not shown). The proPO-activating activity in all of the fractions accounted for only 5–10% of the total activity loaded onto the column. One possibility is that, like PAP-1 (9Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12220-12225Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), proPO activation is mediated by a complex of a proteinase and a protein cofactor, and separation of this complex led to the low activity of PAP-2. To test this hypothesis, we incubated aliquots of fraction 32 with a small amount of other column fractions for 1 h along with purified proPO. Fraction 32 did not contain PO activity, and it generated little active PO when incubated with proPO (Fig. 1 B). After fraction 32 was incubated with proPO in the presence of fraction 10–16, which contained only low levels of PO and proPO-activating activities, a large increase in PO activity was observed. This result supported the hypothesis that proPO activation requires PAP and a cofactor. Because high amidase activity was detected in fraction 32 but not in fraction 14, we concluded that the PAP is probably present in fraction 32 and that the cofactor is in fraction 14. Their molecular masses are estimated to be about 50 and 200–500 kDa, respectively, based on their elution volume from the Sephacryl S-100 column. The pooled fractions 30–34 from the gel filtration column were passed through a ConA-Sepharose column and a Jacalin-agarose column to remove some plasma glycoproteins. The flow-through fractions from the lectin affinity columns were concentrated and separated on an anion exchange HPLC column. A single small IEARase peak was present in fractions 26–28, and a [3H]DFP labeling experiment indicated that these fractions contained a single radioactive band at 35 kDa (data not shown). As shown on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue, this band was prominent and well separated from other proteins (Fig. 1 C). This 35-kDa band and a 25-kDa band were shifted to a 48-kDa position under nonreducing conditions (see Fig. 5), which suggests that the proteinase, named PAP-2, is composed of a catalytic heavy chain (35 kDa) and a regulatory light chain (25 kDa) linked by a disulfide bond. The first 29 residues of the 35-kDa polypeptide were determined to be Ile-Leu-Gly-Gly-Glu-Ala-Thr-Ala-Ile-Asp-Gln-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Leu-Ala-Leu-Ile-Glu-Tyr-His-Lys-Leu-Ala-Glu-Ile-Lys-Leu-Met (Fig. 2). This sequence is similar to a region at the beginning of the catalytic domain in PPAE from the silkworm Bombyx mori (12Satoh D. Horii A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of the 25-kDa light chain starts with a pyro-Glu residue, since, after deblocking with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, the newly exposed sequence was determined to be Ala-(Cys)-Thr-Leu-Pro-Asn (Fig. 2).Figure 2Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of M. sexta PAP-2. Amino acid residues, shown in one-letter codes, are aligned with the first nucleotide of each codon. The secretion signal peptide isunderlined. The double underlinedsequence of the mature protein was confirmed by deblocking and sequencing of the PAP-2 light chain (Fig. 1 C). The proteolytic activation site is indicated (∥), and the double-underlined sequence after that was determined by Edman degradation sequencing of the 36-kDa PAP-2 heavy chain. PutativeN- and O-linked glycosylation sites are marked (+). The catalytic residues at the active site are indicated withasterisks, and residues determining the primary specificity of PAP-2 are labeled (@). A polyadenylation signal (AATAAA,underlined) near the 3′-end of the coding region is probably used for generating a short form of the mRNA, which ends at nucleotide 1365 followed by a 19-nucleotide poly(A) tail.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We designed two degenerate primers encoding part of the amino-terminal sequence of the 35-kDa polypeptide. Using these primers along with a vector-specific primer (T7) and a degenerate primer based on a conserved sequence around the active site serine, we obtained a 0.6-kb cDNA fragment in a nested polymerase chain reaction and cloned it into a pGem-T plasmid vector. Sequence analysis confirmed that the cDNA encoded a sequence starting with Leu-Ala-Leu-Ile-Glu-Tyr-His-Lys-Leu-Ala-Glu-Ile-Lys-Leu-Met. The rest of the sequence is typical of a serine proteinase from the S1 family (25Rawlings R.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Using the 32P-labeled cDNA fragment as a probe, we screened a bacteria-induced M. sexta larval fat body cDNA library. Approximately 1.0 × 103 positives were found in the first round screening of 6.0 × 105plaques, indicating that PAP-2 mRNA is abundant at 24 h after immune challenge. Plaque purification and in vivo excision of phagemids were carried out with 16 of the putative positive clones. Sequence analysis of their 3′ termini indicated that these clones are all identical except for clone 4. Therefore, we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of clone 2 (the longest) and clone 4. Clone 2 encompasses a 2299-nucleotide cDNA, which includes a complete open reading frame spanning nucleotides 34–1359 (Fig. 2). The same coding region was found in clone 4 with a few nucleotide substitutions, most of which do not alter the amino acid sequence. A significant difference occurs in the 3′-untranslated regions of the two sequences; clone 2 contains 915 nucleotides between the stop codon and poly(A) tail, but clone 4 has only six. Apparently, in clone 4 the AATAAA sequence near the en"
https://openalex.org/W2046083187,"Aurora-B is an evolutionally conserved protein kinase that regulates several mitotic events including cytokinesis. We previously demonstrated the possible existence of a protein kinase that phosphorylates at least Ser-72 on vimentin, the most widely expressed intermediate filament protein, in the cleavage furrow-specific manner. Here we showed that vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation occurred specifically at the border of the Aurora-B-localized area from anaphase to telophase. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Aurora-B led to a reduction of this vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation. In vitro analyses revealed that Aurora-B phosphorylates vimentin at ∼2 mol phosphate/mol of substrate for 30 min and that this phosphorylation dramatically inhibits vimentin filament formation. We further identified eight Aurora-B phosphorylation sites, including Ser-72 on vimentin, and then constructed the mutant vimentin in which these identified sites are changed into Ala. Cells expressing this mutant formed an unusually long bridge-like intermediate filament structure between unseparated daughter cells. We then identified important phosphorylation sites for the bridge phenotype. Our findings indicate that Aurora-B regulates the cleavage furrow-specific vimentin phosphorylation and controls vimentin filament segregation in cytokinetic process.

Unlike microtubules and actin filaments, the protein components of IFs vary in a cell-, tissue-, and differentiation-dependent manner. For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and desmin, type III IF proteins, are expressed specifically in astroglial and muscular cells, respectively. On the other hand, vimentin, one of other type III IF proteins, is expressed in mesenchymal cells, in most types of cultured and tumor cells, and transiently in many cells during the early stages of development (1Steinert P.M.

Fink L.M. Cell. 1982; 29: 43-52Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that the phosphorylation of IF proteins by various types of serine/threonine protein kinases induces disassembly of the filament structure (9Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Google Scholar). Using GFAP or vimentin mutated at mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, we previously demonstrated that mitotic IF protein phosphorylation is required for proper IF segregation (10Yasui Y. Amano M.

Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2868-2876Google Scholar). The most likely candidate kinases are Rho-kinase, protein kinase C, and a protein kinase that phosphorylates at least Ser-72 on vimentin in the cleavage furrow-specific manner (11Yasui Y. Goto H. Matsui S. Manser E. Lim L. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2868-2876Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular identity and regulation of this vimentin-Ser-72 kinase.Drosophila Aurora- and Saccharomyces cerevisiaeIpl1p-like protein kinases form a conserved family of enzymes from the budding yeast to mammals (12Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Google Scholar, 13Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Google Scholar, 14Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Google Scholar). Although the yeast genome encodes only one kinase, mammals have at least three subfamilies of Aurora/Ipl1p-related kinases (12Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Google Scholar, 13Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Google Scholar, 14Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Google Scholar). Among these kinases, Aurora-B (also called Aurora 1 or AIM-1) is associated with chromosomes from prophase to metaphase and with spindle midzone/midbody during the later mitotic phase (15Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Google Scholar, 16Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that Aurora-B is involved in chromosome condensation/segregation and cytokinesis during mitotic progression (15Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Google Scholar, 16Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Google Scholar, 17Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K.

In the earlier mitotic phase (from prophase to metaphase), Aurora-B was reported to phosphorylate histone H3 (17Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J.

Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Google Scholar). H3 phosphorylation is thought to be required for correct chromosome condensation and subsequently chromosome segregation (17–19,23). However, much less is known about target substrates of Aurora-B in the cytokinetic process.In this report, we show that the intracellular distribution of Aurora-B overlapped with that of vimentin phosphorylated at Ser-72. Inhibition of endogenous Aurora-B by the expression of its dominant-negative mutant reduced the vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation at undetectable levels. By identifying eight Aurora-B phosphorylation sites on vimentin in vitro, we have demonstrated that vimentin-Ser-72 is an in vitrophosphorylation site of Aurora-B. Mutations at Aurora-B phosphorylation sites on vimentin induced the impaired segregation of vimentin filaments in postmitotic cells. We then determined that Ser-72 is one of the important phosphorylation sites responsible for the vimentin IF-bridge phenotype formation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe previously demonstrated that expression of vimentin or GFAP in which putative phosphorylation sites are changed into Ala induced the formation of a long bridge-like IF structure (referred to as IF-bridge) between unseparated daughter cells (10Yasui Y. Amano M. Nagata K. Inagaki N. Nakamura H. Saya H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1249-1258Google Scholar, 11Yasui Y. Goto H. Matsui S. Manser E. Lim L. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2868-2876Google Scholar). This phenotype was induced by the site-specific mutation in the amino-terminal head domain of each IF protein. In the case of vimentin, mutation at Rho-kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and at Ser-72 is a prerequisite for a high percentage of postmitotic cells to show the IF-bridge phenotype (Fig.1 A; see also Ref. 11Yasui Y. Goto H. Matsui S. Manser E. Lim L. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2868-2876Google Scholar). Since few cells formed IF-bridge in postmitotic cells transfected with vimentin mutated at Rho-kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, vimentin-Ser-72 is one of the most essential mutation sites (Fig. 1 A; see also Ref. 11Yasui Y. Goto H. Matsui S. Manser E. Lim L. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2868-2876Google Scholar). This site is phosphorylated specifically at the cleavage furrow from anaphase to cytokinesis (11Yasui Y. Goto H. Matsui S. Manser E. Lim L. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2868-2876Google Scholar). All these observations suggest that there may exist a protein kinase that by itself can induce vimentin filament separation through the cleavage furrow-specific vimentin phosphorylation at least at Ser-72. However, this vimentin-Ser-72 kinase had not been identified previously.Since Aurora-B is involved in cytokinesis (15Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Google Scholar, 16Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Google Scholar), we compared the subcellular distribution of Aurora-B with that of vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation. Vimentin phosphorylated at Ser-72 is associated with the cleavage furrow to form a ring-like structure, and it is distributed very close to the border of the Aurora-B-containing area from anaphase to telophase (Fig. 1, B and C). During cytokinesis, this phosphorylated vimentin is separated into two populations at the midzone (Fig. 1 B, arrow). To determine whether Aurora-B is involved in vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation, we transfected cells with pcDNA3-myc-Aurora-B (K/R), a construct with a mutation at the ATP-binding site (15Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Google Scholar, 20Goto H. Yasui Y. Nigg E.A. Inagaki M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 11-17Google Scholar). This mutant is known to disperse endogenous Aurora-B in the spindle midzone and then to block its function in a dominant-negative manner (15Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Google Scholar, 29Murata-Hori M. Tatsuka M. Wang Y.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1099-1108Google Scholar). In Aurora-B (K/R)-expressing cells, we often observe abnormal mitoses, such as abnormal chromosome segregation including a chromatin bridge (Fig. 1 D). Similar observations were noted in studies done to deplete Aurora-B using RNA-mediated interference inCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila (16Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Google Scholar, 17Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Google Scholar, 18Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 865-880Google Scholar, 19Giet R. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 669-682Google Scholar). Vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-72 was not observed in such cells (Fig.1 D), which suggested that vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-72 is governed by Aurora-B.To determine whether vimentin can serve as an excellent substrate for Aurora-B, we carried out the in vitro studies. Aurora-B can phosphorylate vimentin (Fig.2 A); this phosphorylation level increases in a time-dependent manner and reaches about 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein at 30 min (Fig. 2 B). However, Aurora-B (K/R) cannot induce vimentin phosphorylation (Fig.2 A). Next, we examined the effect of vimentin phosphorylation by Aurora-B on filament-forming ability. Analyses by centrifugation (Fig. 2 C) and by electron microscopy (Fig.2 D) revealed that the phosphorylation of vimentin by Aurora-B dramatically inhibits filament formation.Figure 2Phosphorylation of vimentin by Aurora-B.As shown in A, vimentin was phosphorylated by K/R (lane 1) or WT (lane 2) of Aurora-B. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) and then subjected to autoradiography (32 P). B, time course of vimentin phosphorylation by Aurora-B WT. As shown in C andD, vimentin (Vim.) treated with K/R (lanes 1 and 2) or WT (lanes 3 and 4) of Aurora-B for 60 min was incubated with 150 mm NaCl at 37 °C for further 60 min. After incubation, samples were divided into two. One was subjected to high speed centrifugation (12,000 × g). The supernatant (lanes 1 and3) and the precipitate (lanes 2 and 4) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (C). The other was observed using electron microscopy (25Goto H. Kosako H. Tanabe K. Yanagida M. Sakurai M. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11728-11736Google Scholar) (D). Bar, 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify the sites on vimentin phosphorylated by Aurora-B, vimentin (150 μg) was phosphorylated by Aurora-B in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP to about 2.0 mol of phosphate/mol of protein for 30 min, and then this phosphorylated vimentin was digested with a lysine-specific protease. Since vimentin has no lysine residues in the head domain (see Fig. 3 D) but many in the rod or tail domain, this procedure generates a 12-kDa fragment consisting of the head domain and much smaller polypeptides (26Wood L. Theriault N. Vogeli G. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 171-175Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that almost all radioactivities in the phosphorylated vimentin were recovered in this 12-kDa fragment (Fig.3 A), thus indicating that the phosphorylation sites were restricted to only the head domain of vimentin. This phosphorylated head domain separated by reverse-phase HPLC was treated with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC again. Consequently, six radioactive peptides were obtained (Fig.3 B); each amino acid sequence is also shown in Fig.3 D. All these peptides were phosphorylated at serine residues, as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig.3 C). The sites of phosphorylation in each phosphopeptide (P1-P6) were determined to be Ser-64/Ser-65, Ser-6, Ser-24, Ser-72, Ser-38/Ser-46, and Ser-86, respectively (data not shown; see also Fig. 3 D and Ref. 28Furuhashi K. Hatano S. Ando S. Nishizawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9326-9330Google Scholar). These findings indicate that Aurora-B can directly phosphorylate vimentin at Ser-72.Rho-kinase phosphorylates Ser-71, a neighboring site of Ser-72, on vimentin (25Goto H. Kosako H. Tanabe K. Yanagida M. Sakurai M. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11728-11736Google Scholar). If vimentin is phosphorylated on Ser-71 by Rho-kinase, does Aurora-B still phosphorylate Ser-72 on vimentin? To address this, we made two vimentin mutants, S71E and S72E, in which Ser-71 or Ser-72 is changed to Glu. Since Ser-71 and Ser-72 are specific phosphorylation sites for Rho-kinase and Aurora-B, respectively, S71E and S72E mimic vimentin phosphorylated by either kinase. As shown in Fig.3 E, S71E was phosphorylated in vitro by Aurora-B at Ser-72, and S72E was also phosphorylated by Rho-kinase at Ser-71. These results strongly suggest that when vimentin is phosphorylated at Ser-71 by Rho-kinase or at Ser-72 by Aurora-B, Aurora-B could phosphorylate vimentin at Ser-72, and Rho-kinase also phosphorylates vimentin at Ser-71. These results also suggest the possibility that Ser-71 and Ser-72 could be phosphorylated on the same vimentin molecule in cells undergoing cytokinesis.cAMP-dependent protein kinase or p21-activated kinase was also reported to phosphorylate vimentin at Ser-72 in vitro (Fig. 3 D, see also Refs. 30Geisler N. Hatzfeld M. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 441-447Google Scholar and 31Goto H. Tanabe K. Manser E. Lim L. Yasui Y. Inagaki M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 91-97Google Scholar). So there is the possibility that other kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase or p21-activated kinase, may phosphorylate vimentin at Ser-72 in the cleavage furrow-specific manner. Since vimentin is distributed diffusely at the cytoplasm in the outside of mitotic spindle during mitosis (5Ho C.L. Martys J.L. Mikhailov A. Gundersen G.G. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1767-1778Google Scholar, 6Yoon M. Moir R.D. Prahlad V. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-157Google Scholar), localization of vimentin-Ser-72 kinase is likely to be restricted to the cleavage furrow area. However, neither the cAMP-dependent protein kinase active form nor p21-activated kinase was localized at the cleavage furrow area during mitosis; both kinases are diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm during mitosis. 2A. Kawajiri, Y. Fukami, and M. Inagaki, unpublished observations. On the other hand, Aurora-B is localized in the spindle midzone (15Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Google Scholar, 16Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Google Scholar), at the border of which vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation occurs (Fig. 1, B andC). Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Aurora-B led to a reduction of this vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation (Fig.1 D). Together with in vitro data (Figs. 2 and 3), these observations lead us to the notion that Aurora-B regulates the cleavage furrow-specific vimentin-Ser-72 phosphorylation, likely through the direct enzyme-substrate reaction.Aurora-B phosphorylates vimentin at Ser-72 but not at Ser-71 (Fig. 3). On the other hand, Rho-kinase phosphorylates vimentin at Ser-71 but not at Ser-72 in vitro (Fig. 3 D; see also Ref. 25Goto H. Kosako H. Tanabe K. Yanagida M. Sakurai M. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11728-11736Google Scholar). Since Rho-kinase accumulates at the cleavage furrow (32Kosako H. Goto H. Yanagida M. Matsuzawa K. Fujita M. Tomono Y. Okigaki T. Odai H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2783-2788Google Scholar), it may be responsible for vimentin-Ser-71 phosphorylation. Rho-kinase also phosphorylates GFAP, an IF protein expressed specifically in astroglial cells, at Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-38 in vitro (33Kosako H. Amano M. Yanagida M. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10333-10336Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at these three sites occurs specifically at the cleavage furrow (34Matsuoka Y. Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2895-2902Google Scholar). Recently, we have obtained the data that Aurora-B can phosphorylate GFAP at the same three sites. 3A. Kawajiri and M. Inagaki, unpublished observations. Taken together, the cleavage furrow-specific IF phosphorylation may be regulated by both Rho-kinase and Aurora-B.To analyze the functional significance of the cleavage furrow-specific vimentin phosphorylation, we constructed a set of vimentin mutants in which sites phosphorylated by Rho-kinase, Aurora-B, or both are changed to Ala. When these constructs were transfected in T24 cells, IF-bridge formation was observed in cells expressing the mutants (Fig.4 A and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the bridge phenotype was frequently observed in cells expressing vimentin with mutations in Aurora-B sites (∼30%) as compared with wild type vimentin (0%), whereas mutations in Rho-kinase sites displayed more moderate effects (∼2%). Mutations at both Aurora-B and Rho-kinase sites showed synergistic effects (∼51%) in the IF-bridge formation (Fig. 4 B). The expression of the above vimentin mutants had no effects on T24 cell shape or on the vimentin filament structure in interphase cells (Fig.4 D). These mutational analyses reveal that both Aurora-B and Rho-kinase may play important roles in the correct separation of vimentin filaments.Figure 4Effects of mutations in the Aurora-B and/or Rho-kinase phosphorylation sites on the formation of bridge-like structure of vimentin filaments. A, vimentin IF-bridge-like structure in T24 cells expressing vimentin with mutations at Aurora-B- and Rho-kinase-phosphorylation sites.

MT; microtubules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the next set of experiments, we determined the Aurora-B phosphorylation sites important for vimentin IF-bridge formation since the kinase phosphorylates eight different sites. As shown in Fig.4 C, when Ser-6, Ser-24, Ser-38, or Ser-72 was left unaltered, the number of the cells with IF-bridge was considerably decreased as compared with vimentin mutated at all Aurora-B sites. The vimentin mutants without alteration at Ser-46, Ser-65, or Ser-86 showed moderate IF-bridge-forming ability, and conservation of Ser-64 had no effects on the ability. Since Ser-38 is a common phosphorylation site to Aurora-B and Rho-kinase, the IF-bridge-forming ability of the vimentin mutant with unaltered Ser-38 was much less as compared with other mutants tested. Together, Ser-6, Ser-24, Ser-38, Ser-46, Ser-65, Ser-72, and Ser 86 were suggested to be pertinent in vivophosphorylation sites by Aurora-B and are contributing to IF-bridge formation. To obtain vimentin IF-bridge phenotype efficiently, mutations at many Aurora-B phosphorylation sites are required. Conversely, phosphorylation at only one or two sites out of eight Aurora-B sites is enough for proper vimentin filament segregationin vivo. This hypothesis is well consistent with thein vitro observation that phosphorylation level at 1–2 mol phosphate/mol of vimentin induces efficient vimentin filament disruption.In the present study, we observed two characteristic phenotypes by blocking Aurora-B function: the chromosome bridge (Fig. 1 D) and the IF-bridge (Fig. 4). The former was induced by kinase-negative Aurora-B at the late mitotic phase, and the cell no longer completes cytokinesis. It is notable that, in the experiments using the K/R mutant, cell cycle is arrested at the late mitotic phase, and the possible effects of the mutant on vimentin after cytokinesis cannot be analyzed. To overcome this problem and analyze the function of Aurora-B on vimentin, we used vimentin mutated at Aurora-B phosphorylation sites and detected the IF-bridge after cytokinesis. The functional relationship between the chromatin-bridge and the IF-bridge is an issue for future study.We propose the following mechanisms regulating the cleavage furrow-specific vimentin phosphorylation (Fig. 4 E). Continuous furrow ingression may increase vimentin accessibility not only to Rho-kinase in the plasma membrane of the cleavage furrow (32Kosako H. Goto H. Yanagida M. Matsuzawa K. Fujita M. Tomono Y. Okigaki T. Odai H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2783-2788Google Scholar) but also to Aurora-B in the spindle midzone (15Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Google Scholar, 16Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Google Scholar). These localized interactions induce cleavage furrow-specific vimentin phosphorylation by both kinases. Although Aurora-B more than Rho-kinase may contribute to the localized elevation of the vimentin phosphorylation level (Fig.4 B), these kinases are most likely to function in cooperation and induce the break/looseness of the vimentin filament network, specifically at the cleavage furrow.In summary, we show that Aurora-B governs the cleavage furrow-specific phosphorylation of vimentin-Ser-72. Vimentin phosphorylation by Aurora-B may play an important role in the segregation of vimentin filaments. Our findings also support the notion that Aurora-B regulates cytokinesis partly through the cleavage furrow-specific phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins including vimentin. Intermediate filaments (IFs),1 together with microtubules and actin filaments, form the cytoskeletal framework in the cytoplasm of various eukaryotic cells and are also present in nuclei as the major component of nuclear lamina. Unlike microtubules and actin filaments, the protein components of IFs vary in a cell-, tissue-, and differentiation-dependent manner. For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and desmin, type III IF proteins, are expressed specifically in astroglial and muscular cells, respectively. On the other hand, vimentin, one of other type III IF proteins, is expressed in mesenchymal cells, in most types of cultured and tumor cells, and transiently in many cells during the early stages of development (1Steinert P.M. Liem R.K. Cell. 1990; 60: 521-523Google Scholar, 2Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Google Scholar). IFs are known to be dramatically reorganized during mitosis (4Foisner R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 297-305Google Scholar, 5Ho C.L. Martys J.L. Mikhailov A. Gundersen G.G. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1767-1778Google Scholar, 6Yoon M. Moir R.D. Prahlad V. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-157Google Scholar). This mitotic IF reorganization is known to be accompanied with increase in IF phosphorylation (7Celis J.E. Larsen P.M. Fey S.J. Celis A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1429-1434Google Scholar, 8Evans R.M. Fink L.M. Cell. 1982; 29: 43-52Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that the phosphorylation of IF proteins by various types of serine/threonine protein kinases induces disassembly of the filament structure (9Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Google Scholar). Using GFAP or vimentin mutated at mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, we previously demonstrated that mitotic IF protein phosphorylation is required for proper IF segregation (10Yasui Y. Amano M.

https://openalex.org/W2144979082,"The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) is the most conserved part of the HIV-1 RNA genome, and it contains regulatory motifs that mediate various steps in the viral life cycle. Previous work showed that the 5′-terminal 290 nucleotides of HIV-1 RNA adopt two mutually exclusive secondary structures, long distance interaction (LDI) and branched multiple hairpin (BMH). BMH has multiple hairpins, including the dimer initiation signal (DIS) hairpin that mediates RNA dimerization. LDI contains a long distance base-pairing interaction that occludes the DIS region. Consequently, the two conformations differ in their ability to form RNA dimers. In this study, we have presented evidence that the full-length 5′-UTR also adopts the LDI and BMH conformations. The downstream 290–352 region, including the Gag start codon, folds differently in the context of the LDI and BMH structures. These nucleotides form an extended hairpin structure in the LDI conformation, but the same sequences create a novel long distance interaction with upstream U5 sequences in the BMH conformation. The presence of this U5-AUG duplex was confirmed by computer-assisted RNA structure prediction, biochemical analyses, and a phylogenetic survey of different virus isolates. The U5-AUG duplex may influence translation of the Gag protein because it occludes the start codon of the Gag open reading frame.

BMH has multiple hairpins, including the dimer initiation signal (DIS) hairpin that mediates RNA dimerization. LDI contains a long distance base-pairing interaction that occludes the DIS region. Consequently, the two conformations differ in their ability to form RNA dimers. In this study, we have presented evidence that the full-length 5′-UTR also adopts the LDI and BMH conformations. The downstream 290–352 region, including the Gag start codon, folds differently in the context of the LDI and BMH structures. These nucleotides form an extended hairpin structure in the LDI conformation, but the same sequences create a novel long distance interaction with upstream U5 sequences in the BMH conformation. The presence of this U5-AUG duplex was confirmed by computer-assisted RNA structure prediction, biochemical analyses, and a phylogenetic survey of different virus isolates. The U5-AUG duplex may influence translation of the Gag protein because it occludes the start codon of the Gag open reading frame. human immunodeficiency virus type I 5′-untranslated region nucleotides long distance interaction branched multiple hairpin dimer initiation signal repeat transactivation region polyadenylation primer activation signal primer binding site splice donor nucleocapsid open reading frame dimethylsulfate reverse transcriptase, wt, wild-type simian immunodeficiency virus Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 virions contain two full-length positive-stranded RNA molecules as genome. The full-length RNA not only serves as viral genome but also functions as an mRNA to encode the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. The highly structured 5′-UTR is the most conserved part of the HIV-1 genome and is involved in several steps of the viral replication cycle (1Berkhout B. Progr. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Google Scholar). Distinct functions have been assigned to individual sequence and/or structure motifs (presented in different colors in Fig. 1 A). The 5′-UTR consists of an upstream repeat (R) region that recurs at the 3′-terminus of the HIV-1 genome and that comprises TAR and the polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal. The well characterized TAR hairpin mediates transcription activation by binding of the viral Tat protein and the cellular protein, cyclin T (2Puglisi J.D. Tan R. Calnan B.J. Frankel A.D.

The poly(A) hairpin inhibits premature polyadenylation of the nascent RNA by masking of the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal (11Klasens B.I.F. Das A.T. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1870-1876Google Scholar, 12Klasens B.I.F. Thiesen M. Virtanen A. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 446-454Google Scholar). The U5 region is located downstream of the R region and contains two important signals for reverse transcription, the primer activation signal (PAS) and the primer binding site (PBS) (13Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Google Scholar, 14Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2329-2339Google Scholar). Additional essential motifs are located further downstream in the 5′-UTR. These include the RNA dimer initiation signal (DIS), the major splice donor site (SD) that is required for the generation of subgenomic mRNAs, the packaging signal (Ψ) that is required for the assembly of infectious virus particles, and a hairpin motif that includes the Gag start codon (15Laughrea M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14518-14529Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the HIV-1 5′-UTR has been studied extensively, and a variety of structure models have been proposed (1Berkhout B. Progr. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Google Scholar,18Harrison G.P. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4144-4153Google Scholar, 19Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Google Scholar). Recently, the 5′-UTR was shown to fold alternative secondary structures (Fig. 1 A) (24Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7 (N. Y.): 143-157Google Scholar). The ground state conformation is formed by a long distanceinteraction of the poly(A) and DIS regions and is termed LDI. The alternative, metastable conformation is a branched structure with multiple hairpins and is termed BMH. The two conformations differ in their ability to form RNA dimers. The DIS sequence is masked in the LDI conformation by long distance base pairing with upstream sequences, thus preventing dimer formation. In contrast, the DIS hairpin with the palindromic loop sequence is folded in the BMH structure. Thus, BMH RNA is able to engage in a kissing-loop interaction with the DIS palindrome of a second RNA molecule, thereby forming loose dimers (15Laughrea M. Jette L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13464-13474Google Scholar, 25Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Google Scholar, 26Paillart J.C.

Heat treatment or incubation with the HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) protein triggers the formation of a tight dimer with extended inter-strand base pairing (15Laughrea M. Jette L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13464-13474Google Scholar, 25Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Google Scholar, 28Clever J.L.

Interestingly, the NC protein also mediates the switch from LDI to BMH (24Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7 (N. Y.): 143-157Google Scholar). This RNA switch mechanism may allow regulation and appropriate timing of the different 5′-UTR functions. For instance, the HIV-1 genomic RNA should be translated into the Gag and Gag-Pol proteins prior to RNA dimerization and packaging into assembling virions. The LDI and BMH structures have been studied in transcripts that comprise the 5′-terminal 290 nucleotides (nts) of the HIV-1 leader RNA. Because the SD site is located at nucleotide position 289, these results suggest that both genomic and subgenomic HIV-1 mRNAs can fold the LDI conformation. The 5′-UTR of the genomic HIV-1 RNA consists of 335 nucleotides up to the AUG start codon of the Gag open reading frame (ORF). In this work, we studied the folding of the downstream leader region 290–368 that contains the SD and Ψ signals and part of the Gag ORF. Computer-assisted folding and a phylogenetic survey of the leader RNA of different primate lentiviruses revealed a novel long distance interaction between U5 sequences and the Gag initiation codon: the U5-AUG duplex. The proposed U5-AUG long distance interaction was analyzed by mutational analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and RNA structure probing. The U5-AUG long distance interaction is formed exclusively in the BMH structure and not in the alternative LDI fold. The duplex is of particular interest because it occludes the AUG start codon of the Gag ORF, and it therefore has the potential to be involved in regulation of mRNA translation. Computer-assisted RNA secondary structure predictions were performed using the Mfold version 3.0 algorithm (32Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Google Scholar, 33Zuker M. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. Algorithms and Thermodynamics for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction: A Practical Guide. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht/Boston/London1999: 11-43Google Scholar) offered by the MBCMR Mfold server (mfold.burnet.edu.au/). Standard settings were used for all folding jobs (37 °C and 1.0 m NaCl, with a 5% suboptimality range). Folding was performed with sequences comprising nucleotides 1–368 of the genomic RNA sequence of the wild-type (wt) and mutant HIV-1 LAI RNA. Phylogenetic studies were based on MFold data obtained with 500-nucleotide leader fragments of the primate lentiviral genomes. For mutation of the HIV-1 leader RNA, we used the plasmid Blue-5′LTR (34Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3830-3840Google Scholar). This pBluescript-derived construct contains the XbaI-ClaI fragment of the infectious pLAI clone, including the 5′-LTR, the complete 5′-UTR, and part of the Gag ORF (−454/+376). Mutations were created by a standard PCR mutagenesis protocol. For construction of the s1 mutation, oligonucleotide primers TA007 (5′-CCC76AAGCTTGCCTTGAGTGCTTCAAGTAGTGTGCACCCATCTGTTGTGTGACTCT GG130-3′) and AD-GAG (complementary to position 442–462 of the HIV-1 genome) were used in a standard PCR reaction. For the w1 and w2 mutations, we used the forward primers TA009 (5′-CCC76AAGCTTGCCTTGAGTGCTTCAAGTAGTGTGTGTTTGTCTGTTGTGTG ACTCTGG130-3′) and TA008 (5′-CCC76AAAGCTTGCCTTGAGTGCTTCAAGTAGTGTG GAAAGTCTGTTGTGTGACTCTGG130-3′). The mutated nucleotides are underlined, and the nucleotide positions of the HIV-1 sequence are indicated in superscript. The sequence of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. The mutant PCR products were digested by HindIII and ClaI and cloned into the Blue-5′LTR vector. The XbaI-ClaI fragments were subsequently cloned into pLAI-R37, a derivative of the full-length infectious clone pLAI (35Berkhout B. van Wamel J. Klaver B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 59-69Google Scholar). The mutant proviral constructs were designated pLAI-s1, -w1, and -w2. Transfection of the SupT1 cell line was performed by electroporation, and CA-p24 levels were determined as described previously (13Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Google Scholar, 36Back N.K.T. Nijhuis M. Keulen W. Boucher C.A.B. Oude Essink B.B. van Kuilenburg A.B.P. Van Gennip A.H. Berkhout B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4040-4049Google Scholar). pLAI, pLAI-s1, -w1, and -w2 plasmids were used as template in a PCR reaction with primers T7–2 (corresponding to position 1–18 of the HIV-1 genome with an upstream T7 RNA promoter sequence) and R:A368-A347 (complementary to 368–347 of the HIV-1 genome). The PCR products were ethanol-precipitated and used forin vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase with [α-32P]dCTP according to the manufacturer's protocol (MEGAshortscript T7 transcription kit, Ambion, Inc.). Transcription reactions were stopped by addition of formamide-containing loading buffer and applied to 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gel slices containing the radiolabeled transcript were excised and soaked in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) overnight at room temperature to elute the RNA. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in water. Equal amounts of RNA were heat-denatured and slowly renatured in the presence of dimerization buffer L (40 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Aliquots were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA) and 0.25 × TBM (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.1 mmMgCl2), either with a formamide-containing buffer or non-denaturing loading buffer. Gels were dried and applied to a Storm PhosphoImager. We used the computer program ImageQuant 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences) to quantify the RNA signals. The dimerization yield was determined by dividing the amount of dimer by the total amount of RNA (dimer plus monomer). pLAI and pLAI-s1 plasmids were used as templates in a PCR reaction with primers T7–2 and TA015 (complementary to 442–462 of HIV-1 genome). The PCR products were ethanol-precipitated and used for in vitrotranscription with the Ambion MEGAshortscript T7 transcription kit. Transcripts were DNase I-treated, phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in water. The RNA samples were heat-denatured, followed by addition of sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 100 and 1 mm. The RNA (10 μg) was treated at room temperature with 2 μl of kethoxal for 10 min, with 1 μl of dimethylsulfate (DMS) for 5 min, or mock-treated. The reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μg ofEscherichia coli tRNA. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 22 μl of water, and 4 μl was used in a primer extension assay with 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide primers. Antisense primers reverse poly(A) 104/77 (complementary to 77–104 of the HIV-1 genome), cn3 (complementary to position 133–161), lys21 (complementary to 182–202), R:G290-G270 (complementary to 270–290), R:A368-A347, and TA015 were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The kinase was inactivated at 80 °C for 10 min. For a primer extension reaction, 2 ng of the labeled probe was heat annealed to the RNA in 83 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 125 mm KCl. Avian myeloblastoma virus reverse transcriptase (RT, 5 units) was added in RT buffer to yield a mixture with 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm dNTP, and 50 μg/ml actinomycin D. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 200 mm NaOH and an additional incubation of 20 min. The samples were ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in formamide loading buffer, and applied to 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. The products were visualized by a Storm PhosphoImager. Previous work by Huthoff and Berkhout (24Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7 (N. Y.): 143-157Google Scholar) showed that the HIV leader RNA is able to form two mutually exclusive secondary structures. In the ground state structure, the leader RNA adopts the LDI conformation that is based on an interaction between the poly(A) and DIS regions. In the presence of the viral NC protein, the LDI conformation switches to the BMH conformation that presents the poly(A) and DIS hairpins. Studies thus far have focused on transcripts that comprise the 5′-terminal 290 nucleotides of the HIV-1 leader RNA. In this study, we have analyzed the RNA folding of the complete 5′-UTR. Using the MFold computer program, we identified a novel long distance interaction that includes the start codon of the Gag ORF. This base-pairing possibility occurs between nucleotides 105–115 in the U5 region and 334–344 surrounding the AUG initiation codon and is termed the U5-AUG duplex. These two sequence elements are marked in the linear presentation of the 5′-UTR and the LDI and BMH structures (Fig.1 A). The duplex consists of 11 consecutive base pairs, including four G-U base pairs (Fig.1 B). The MFold results indicate that formation of the U5-AUG duplex occurs exclusively in BMH-like structures and not in the LDI conformation (results not shown). To test for the presence of the U5-AUG duplex, we designed mutants that either strengthen or weaken the base pairing interaction (Fig.1 C). The duplex is stabilized in the s1 mutant by substitution of three G-U base pairs by one G-C and two A-U base pairs. The duplex is destabilized in the w1 and w2 mutants by replacing the central C-G base pairs either by U-G base pairs or by A-G mismatches, respectively. We first set out to determine the dimerization properties of the wt and mutant transcripts on a non-denaturing gel. Radiolabeled transcripts of the genomic RNA (nts 1–368) were synthesized in vitro, incubated at RNA dimerization conditions, and analyzed on gel (Fig. 2 A). RNA monomers and dimers were detected for all transcripts in TBE and TBM gels. The most noticeable observation is that the s1 transcript with the stabilized U5-AUG duplex migrates faster in TBM gels than the wt transcript. Formamide-denatured samples were included as control (indicated above the lanes), and the remarkable migration of the s1 transcript is lost upon denaturation. The s1 dimer also migrates faster than the wt dimer in the TBE gels, but the fast migrating s1 monomer is observed as a diffuse band. Apparently, Mg2+ in the gel is required to stabilize the U5-AUG duplex in s1 monomers. The results of two experiments were quantified to calculate the level of RNA dimerization for the wt and mutant transcripts (Fig. 2 B). The TBM gel shows both dimer types (loose and tight dimers), whereas only tight dimers are detected on TBE gels. The small difference in dimerization efficiencies in TBE versus TBM gels is therefore likely because of the presence of loose dimers on the latter gel type. The mutant transcripts s1, w1, and w2 dimerize more efficiently than the wt transcript, independent of the presence of Mg2+. Apparently, all mutations in the U5 motif result in elevated levels of RNA dimerization, which may be because of their destabilizing effect on the LDI conformation. To test whether the fast migration of the s1 transcript is caused by stabilization of the U5-AUG interaction, we created a set of double mutants (Fig. 1 D). The downstream segment 334–343 of the U5-AUG duplex was substituted by sequences that disrupt or weaken base pairing. The three central C-G base pairs were opened in the AUG3 mutant, and nearly all base pairs were disrupted in the AUG10 mutant. The destabilizing mutations were introduced both in the wt and s1 mutant transcripts. The wt and mutant transcripts were subjected to non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig.3 A). Most importantly, opening of the U5-AUG duplex in the s1-AUG3 and s1-AUG10 mutants corrects the unusual migration of the s1 transcript. The AUG3 and -10 mutations have no effect on the migration of the wt transcript. These results confirm that formation of the U5-AUG duplex in transcript s1 induces a conformation in the HIV-1 leader RNA that migrates relatively fast during gel electrophoresis. We also quantified the dimerization efficiencies of this set of mutants (Fig. 3 B). The wt transcript shows a moderate increase in dimerization efficiency upon introduction of the AUG3 or -10 mutations (from 30 to 34% dimers). The s1 transcript shows increased dimerization (60% dimers), and this effect is countered by the AUG3 or -10 mutations (47% dimers). Thus, the increased dimerization efficiency of the s1 transcript is caused, at least partially, by stabilization of the U5-AUG duplex in the BMH context. We next set out to determine the secondary structure of the wt and s1 mutant transcript (1–462) by RNA structure probing. Because the fast migrating s1 structure was only visible in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2), the transcripts were heat-denatured and refolded in the presence of Mg2+. The transcripts were treated with limiting amounts of kethoxal or DMS and subsequently used as template for reverse transcription with several antisense DNA primers. The cDNA products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The complete set of probing data is listed in Table I. To facilitate the discussion of this complex data set, we will first present the new secondary structure models in Fig. 4. The wt RNA is folded in the ground state LDI conformation, in which the poly(A) and DIS regions (marked orange and pink) are base paired in a long distance interaction that extends the stem of the PBS domain. The downstream region 282–352 folds an extended stem-loop structure with three internal loops and a GGAG loop (markedyellow). The top of this extended hairpin is, in fact, the previously described Ψ or SL3 hairpin that is required for viral RNA packaging (37Zeffman A. Hassard S. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 877-893Google Scholar). We termed the extended hairpin ΨE. The SD site (marked gray) is located within an internal loop of ΨE. The Gag initiation codon (marked by anasterisk) is located in the central internal loop and the adjacent stem segment of ΨE. The downstream Gag sequences (nts 358–367) are possibly engaged in long distance base pairing with nucleotides 60–67 in the R region directly downstream of TAR. This interaction is termed the R-Gag duplex. In contrast, the s1 mutant RNA folds the BMH structure that exposes both the poly(A) and DIS hairpins. The downstream sequences in s1 RNA fold the SD hairpin and the short version of the Ψ hairpin, and the leader domain is closed by the U5-AUG duplex (105–115 pairs with 334–344).Table ISecondary structure probing of the wt and s1 mutant leader RNAReactivity of wt and s1 RNA to kethoxal (G-specific) and DMS (A- and C-specific) were estimated and classified into five categories: +++ = highly reactive, ++ = reactive, + = moderately reactive, +/− = marginally reactive, − = not reactive.

Open table in a new tab Reactivity of wt and s1 RNA to kethoxal (G-specific) and DMS (A- and C-specific) were estimated and classified into five categories: +++ = highly reactive, ++ = reactive, + = moderately reactive, +/− = marginally reactive, − = not reactive. The sequences that constitute the U5-AUG duplex are indicated by outlined boxes and the Gag initiation codon is indicated in bold. The sequence substitutions in the s1 RNA are indicated in italics. s indicates reverse transcription stops. The structures shown in Fig. 4 are consistent with the MFold analyses. The LDI conformation with the extended PBS stem and the extended ΨE hairpin is the most stable structure adopted by the wt RNA. The BMH folding with the multiple hairpins (poly(A), DIS, SD, and short Ψ) and the novel U5-AUG duplex is the most stable structure adopted by s1 RNA. Apparently, the metastable BMH folding is facilitated by stabilization of the U5-AUG interaction. We previously demonstrated that the BMH fold can also be triggered by stabilization of the poly(A) or the DIS hairpin (24Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7 (N. Y.): 143-157Google Scholar). Few leader RNA motifs do not change their structure during the LDI to BMH switch: the TAR hairpin (nts 1–57, marked green), the upper primer activation signal/primer binding site domain (nts 116–239, markedlilac and blue), and the short Ψ hairpin (nts 305–331, marked yellow). The constitutive folding of the TAR and PBS domains in the LDI and BMH structures was described previously (24Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7 (N. Y.): 143-157Google Scholar). Apparently, these structures fold autonomously, suggesting that their biological function is independent of the LDI/BMH switch. The structure probing data of the wt and s1 RNA are presented to highlight the differences between the LDI and BMH structures. There are three regions that differ significantly in accessibility to the single strand-specific reagents kethoxal and DMS in the two transcripts. The first region is segment 105–115 of the U5-AUG duplex in which the s1 mutations were introduced (Fig.5 A). G106 and G108 are accessible to kethoxal in the wt transcript, whereas G106 and A108 are not sensitive to kethoxal and DMS in the s1 transcript. Apparently, these nucleotides are base-paired in the s1 transcript. Interestingly, the control primer extension reaction yields two major stop products on the s1 RNA template at position U118 and U120(marked s in Table I). Because the wt transcript has an identical sequence, it is likely that the RT enzyme is stopped by a structure that is specific for the s1 template. Apparently, the RT enzyme stopped three and five nucleotides before reaching the U5-AUG duplex. The second region that shows differential s1-wt reactivity concerns the sequences flanking the Gag initiation codon (Fig.5 B). Purines 332–336 are exclusively accessible to kethoxal and DMS in the wt transcript, indicating that these nucleotides are single-stranded. The third region that exhibits major probing differences is domain 235–242 (Fig. 5 C). This sequence is completely sensitive to kethoxal and DMS in the s1 transcript, whereas it is only partially sensitive in the wt transcript. Together, these results support the folding of the U5-AUG interaction in the s1 mutant transcript. As a result, nucleotides 240–242 become single-stranded exclusively in the BMH fold of the s1 transcript (Figs. 4 and5 C). These nucleotides are paired to nucleotides 113–115 in the LDI conformation of the wt transcript.Figure 5RNA structure probing data for the wt and s1 transcripts.

All five A residues of the poly(A) signal 73AAUAAA78 are equally accessible to DMS in the wt transcript, confirming that the poly(A) signal is single-stranded as in the LDI structure. In contrast,73AA74 is less exposed to DMS than76AAA78 in the s1 transcript, indicating that the poly(A) hairpin of the BMH conformation is formed. We previously used this differential reactivity within the poly(A) signal to differentiate between the LDI and BMH structures (24Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7 (N. Y.): 143-157Google Scholar). Several nucleotides in the DIS region (264 and 274–276) are more exposed in wt RNA compared with s1 RNA, confirming the LDI fold of wt RNA (Fig.5 E). In contrast, A263 is exclusively DMS-sensitive in the s1 transcript, consistent with the folding of the DIS hairpin in the BMH structure. These combined results confirm that the wt transcript adopts the LDI conformation as the ground state structure and the s1 mutations force the RNA into the alternative BMH fold. Slight differences in reactivity between the two transcripts are also observed for positions 66–68, 274–305, and 356 (Table I). For instance, G290 and G292 are more reactive and G298 is less reactive in s1 RNA. These differences led to the proposed folding of the SD hairpin in the BMH structure and the ΨE hairpin and R-Gag duplex in the LDI conformation (Fig.4). The nucleotides in the bottom stem segment of ΨE and in the R-Gag duplex are moderately accessible to kethoxal/DMS (Table I), suggesting that these RNA structures are metastable. We have shown that the s1 mutant folds the U5-AUG duplex as part of the BMH fold. The U5-AUG interaction is not present in th"

In addition, both proteins are essential components for the light input of various blue light responses, including the light entrainment of the circadian clock. Recently, we identified WC-1 as the blue light photoreceptor responsible for these light responses. In this study, we show that the formation of the FRQ-WC complex in vivo, a step critical in closing the circadian negative feedback loop, requires WC-1. In addition, we show that WC-1 negatively regulates the expression ofwc-2 at the level of the transcription, forming another interacting loop. In a wc-1 mutant, we demonstrate that there is alternative protein initiation of WC-1, and the requirements of WC-1 for the light induction of frq and other genes differ significantly, suggesting the existence of different WC complexes in the cell. Consistent with this interpretation, our results show that there are at least two different types of WC-1/WC-2 complexes in vivo, and that the larger WC-1/WC-2 complex contains more than one WC-1 molecule. Using a series ofwc-1 mutants, we show that the WC-1 PASC domain and its C-terminal region are essential for the formation of the WC-1/WC-2 complex. Functional analyses reveal that the DNA-binding domain of WC-1 is required only for the activation of frq in the dark and not for the light function of the protein, confirming that WC-1 is a multifunctional protein with separable protein domains.

The circadian oscillators are networks of positive and negative elements that form the core circadian feedback loops generating the basic circadian rhythmicity (1Dunlap J.C.

The positive elements of the loop activate the transcription of the negative elements, whereas the negative elements feedback to block their own activation. In Neurospora,Drosophila, and mammals, the positive elements of the loops are all heterodimeric protein complexes consisting of PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS)1domain-containing transcription factors (1Dunlap J.C.

On the other hand, two alternatively translated FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein forms are the negative elements (7Aronson B. Johnson K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C.

In constant darkness, the WC-1·WC-2 heterodimeric complex binds to two light-regulated elements (LREs) in the promoter offrq and activates the transcription of frq (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc.

In either wc-1 or wc-2 mutants, the levels of frq RNA and FRQ protein are very low in the dark, and the circadian clock is not functional under normal conditions (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc.

In addition, WC-1 is the limiting factor for the formation of the WC-1/WC-2 complex (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).After the transcription of frq, two forms of FRQ protein (large and small FRQ forms) are made (17Liu Y. Garceau N. Loros J.J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After their amounts reach a certain level, they feedback to repress the transcription of frq by interacting with the WC-1/WC-2 complex (7Aronson B. Johnson K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 994-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), thus closing the negative feedback loop. In addition to its role as a negative element of the loop, FRQ positively regulates the expression of both WC-1 and WC-2 through two different mechanisms, forming positive feedback loops interlocked with the negative feedback loop (12Lee K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2000; 289: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our previous data suggest that the positive feedback loops are important for the robustness and stability of the clock (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).In addition to their essential role in the circadian feedback loop, WC-1 and WC-2 are also essential components in the light input of the clock and other light responses in Neurospora (16Crosthwaite S.K. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Science. 1997; 276: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 25Ballario P. Vittorioso P. Magrelli A. Talora C. Cabibbo A. Macino G.

Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 365-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In true wc-1 or wc-2 null mutants, most if not all light responses are abolished, including the light induction offrq (21Collett M.A. Garceau N. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recently, we (28He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and Froehlich et al. (19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) identified WC-1, a flavin dinucleotide (FAD)-containing protein, as the blue light photoreceptor mediating these light responses. The result of the in vitro DNA binding assay suggests that a large WC complex (that is different from the dark complex) binds to the frq LREs in a light-dependent manner to mediate light input of the clock (19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, light irradiation triggers rapid induction offrq transcription, a process that leads to the resetting of the clock (29Crosthwaite S.K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1003-1012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although the level of WC-1 determines the concentrations of the WC complex formed in vivo (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the WC-2 PAS domain-mediated WC-1/WC-2 complex formation is important for maintaining the steady state level of WC-1 and its functions in the circadian clock and light responses (20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Without WC-2 or the formation of a WC-1/WC-2 complex, the level of WC-1 in the cell is low (20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).These previous studies indicate that WC-1 is a protein with at least two roles: it is a circadian positive element in the dark and a photosensing transcriptional activator mediating light responses. Previously, WC-2 was proposed to function as a scaffold protein that mediates the FRQ-WC interaction to close the negative feedback loop (18Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); however, the involvement of WC-1 in this interaction is unclear. Although it is clear that WC-2 positively regulates WC-1 by forming the WC complex, it is not known whether WC-1 regulates the expression of WC-2. In addition, based on the data described above, there should be different forms of the WC complexes with distinct functions in the cell, but no in vivo evidence is available about the nature of the different WC complexes. Furthermore, we do not know which domain of WC-1 mediates its interaction with WC-2 and whether different regions of WC-1 have distinct functional roles. In this study, experiments were carried out to address these questions. Together, our results demonstrate that WC-1 is a multifunctional protein with separable protein domains.DISCUSSIONIn constant darkness, WC-1 and WC-2, the two PAS-containing transcription factors, form a complex that binds thecis-acting elements of the frq promoter and activates the transcription of frq, leading to the cycling of frq and the overt rhythmicity (19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 36Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 757-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Recently, WC-1 has also been identified as the first fungal blue light photoreceptor that binds FAD as a chromophore and (together with WC-2) binds to the LREs of the frq promoter in a light-dependent manner (19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 28He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid light-dependent induction of frq transcription mediated by the WC complex is the mechanism that allows the Neurospora clock to be entrained by light (16Crosthwaite S.K. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Science. 1997; 276: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 29Crosthwaite S.K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1003-1012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Therefore, both WC proteins are required for the clock function in the dark and for the light input of the clock. In addition, the WC complex is required for other light responses inNeurospora (27Lakin-Thomas P. Coté G. Brody S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 365-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The physical interaction between the WC complex and FRQ is a crucial step that closes the Neurospora circadian negative feedback loop (15Cheng P. Yang Y. Heintzen C. Liu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although WC-2 was previously proposed as a scaffold protein that mediates such an interaction (18Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), here we show that the presence of WC-1 is essential for the formation of the FRQ-WC complex (Fig. 1). In mutants without WC-1, despite the normal expression of WC-2, no WC-2-FRQ interaction was detected in vivo. Because WC-1 needs WC-2 to form complexes to maintain its level and because WC-1 is the limiting factor in WC complexes (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we think that WC proteins can interact only with FRQ in vivo as a WC-1/WC-2 complex. A similar situation may also exist inDrosophila, in which PER and TIM may only interact with the dCLK-CYC heterodimer and not with the free CYC protein (37Bae K. Lee C. Hardin P.E. Edery I. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1746-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Previously, we showed that FRQ positively regulates the expression of WC-2 and that the PAS domain of WC-2 is required for the formation of the WC complex and the maintenance of the steady state of WC-1 (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here we show that WC-1 negatively regulates the expression ofwc-2 at the level of transcription (Figs. 2 and 3), thus forming another interacting feedback loop. Interestingly, the repression of wc-2 by WC-1 is light independent, suggesting that this function of WC-1 does not require its role in light sensing (Fig. 3 C). Such an interlocked nature of the expression of the two WC proteins may be important for maintaining an appropriate ratio of the two proteins in the cell, allowing them to function properly in the clock and in light responses. The opposite effects of FRQ and WC-1 on wc-2 may help explain the fact that WC-2 is not rhythmically expressed (13Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although we could not exclude the possibility that WC-1 regulates wc-2indirectly, these data suggest that in addition to being a transcription activator, WC-1 may function as a transcription repressor as well.Consistent with WC-1 being a multifunctional protein, our data also demonstrate the existence of different forms of the WC complexes and the significantly different requirements of WC-1 for light induction offrq and other genes. The differential requirement of WC-1 for light-induced gene expression is highlighted by our result in thewc-1 4401 mutant (Fig. 4). In this mutant, resulting from alternative protein initiation from a downstream AUG, less than 1% of the normal amount of WC-1 was expressed, and it was still associated with WC-2. However, its light induction of frqwas near normal, whereas the light induction of al-3 andvvd was mostly abolished. A similar situation was also observed for a wc-2 mutant. In thewc-2 ER33 mutant (a point mutation in the zinc finger DNA-binding domain), although its light induction of other genes are abolished, its light induction of frq was close to normal (16Crosthwaite S.K. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Science. 1997; 276: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Collett M.A. Garceau N. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the light induction of frq, a step critical in the light resetting of the clock, does not require fully functional WC proteins, and needs only a very low amount of a WC complex.Recently, a study by Dragovic et al. (38Dragovic Z. Tan Y. Gorl M. Roenneberg T. Merrow M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3643-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that in some wc mutants, conidiation rhythms could still be driven by light/dark cycles. Although this study suggested the existence of awc-independent photoreceptor in Neurospora that regulates the conidiation process, the interpretation of the results is complicated by the fact that the Δwc-1 strain (generated by RIP) used in that study may not be a real wc-1 null strain. In that wc-1 mutant strain, although the light induction of other genes was eliminated, the light induction offrq could still be observed, a fact that is in conflict with the results obtained in true wc-1 null strains and otherwc-1 mutants (16Crosthwaite S.K. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Science. 1997; 276: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 28He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the results we presented here, we think that the wc-1 mutant used by Dragovic et al. (38Dragovic Z. Tan Y. Gorl M. Roenneberg T. Merrow M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3643-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is most likely not a real null, and it could produce a low level of WC-1 (that could not be detected by regular Western blot analysis) because of alternative protein initiation from a downstream AUG.The differential requirement of WC complex in the light induction of genes and the in vitro DNA binding data (19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) suggest the existence of different WC complexes in the cell, a notion that was confirmed by the immunoprecipitation assay in a wt,Myc-WC-1 strain (Fig. 5). Using the extract of this strain, we found that there were at least two types of WC-1-containing protein complexes in the cell: ∼20–30% of WC-1 was found to self-associate to form a large WC-1/WC-2 complex. The larger WC complex may be the large WC-containing complex identified by Froehlich et al. (19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) using a in vitro DNA binding assay that binds to the LREs of thefrq promoter in a light-dependent manner and regulates light responses. In contrast to WC-1, no WC-2 was found to self-associate in vivo, although strong self-association was previously observed in vitro (34Ballario P. Talora C. Galli D. Linden H. Macino G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because WC-1 needs WC-2 to form a complex to maintain its steady state level, one WC-2 molecule should form complexes with more than one WC-1 molecule in the cell. Our results also confirm the previous results that the majority of WC-1 is in a WC-1/WC-2 heterodimeric complex (18Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 28He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The function of the WC-1/WC-2 heterodimer may be important for the activation offrq and other genes in the dark (19Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 39Lewis Z.A. Correa A. Schwerdtfeger C. Link K.L. Xie X. Gomer R.H. Thomas T. Ebbole D.J. Bell-Pedersen D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 917-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).To map the WC-1 domain that mediates its interaction with WC-2 and to determine the function of various WC-1 domains, we made a series ofwc-1 mutants. Our results indicate that the PASC domain and its immediate C-terminal region (upstream of the putative NLS) are required for the formation of the WC-1/WC-2 complex, whereas the rest of WC-1 is not essential (Figs. 6 and 7). Although the requirement of the PASC domain for the interaction is consistent with the interaction mediated by the PAS-PAS interaction of the two WC proteins (20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the involvement of the PASC C-terminal region indicates that PASC alone is not sufficient for such an interaction. Consistent with our previous work of WC-2 (20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), these results show that the formation of the WC complex is essential for their functions in the circadian clock and light responses and for maintaining the steady state level of WC-1. However, the existence of the WC-1/WC-2 complex is not sufficient to be a functional complex, because the PASB domain of WC-1 is required for both of its dark and light functions whereas it is not required for the complex formation (Fig. 8, A and B).One surprising result from the deletion study is that the C-terminal part of the WC-1 protein (starting from the putative NLS and including the zinc finger) is not required for the light induction offrq, al-3, and vvd (Fig. 8). However, the NLS and DNA-binding domain are required for the expression of FRQ in the dark. Thus, by deleting this region of WC-1, we separated the light and dark functions of WC-1. This is in contrast with the mutant lacking the entire LOV domain, in which only the light function but not the dark function of WC-1 is defective (28He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Without the DNA-binding domain of WC-1, how does WC-1 mediate the light-induced gene expression? Because WC-1 forms complexes with WC-2, the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of WC-2 must be responsible for the DNA binding in these mutants. Interestingly, as described above, in awc-2 mutant (ER33) that contains a point mutation in the DNA-binding domain, the light induction of frq was still observed, although the light induction of other genes was defective (16Crosthwaite S.K. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Science. 1997; 276: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Collett M.A. Garceau N. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the light induction offrq only requires one DNA-binding domain from either of the WC proteins, but the DNA-binding domain of WC-2 may be essential for binding to the promoters of other light-inducible genes. On the other hand, the DNA-binding domains of both WC proteins may be required for DNA binding and transcription activation of frq in the dark.In conclusion, our results show that WC-1 is required for the formation of the FRQ·WC complex and it negatively regulates the expression ofwc-2. In addition, WC-1 differentially regulates the light induction of frq and other genes, and there are different forms of the WC complexes in the cell, possibly with distinct functions. Together, our data demonstrate that WC-1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the circadian clock, light sensing, and transcription repression in Neurospora. Endogenous circadian clocks control a wide variety of daily physiological, behavioral, cellular, and biochemical activities in most eukaryotic and certain prokaryotic organisms. The circadian oscillators are networks of positive and negative elements that form the core circadian feedback loops generating the basic circadian rhythmicity (1Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar,2Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The positive elements of the loop activate the transcription of the negative elements, whereas the negative elements feedback to block their own activation. In Neurospora,Drosophila, and mammals, the positive elements of the loops are all heterodimeric protein complexes consisting of PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS)1domain-containing transcription factors (1Dunlap J.C.

https://openalex.org/W1984093263,"The malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, spends part of its life cycle inside the erythrocytes of its human host. In the mature stages of intraerythrocytic growth, the parasite undertakes extensive remodeling of its adopted cellular home by exporting proteins beyond the confines of its own plasma membrane. To examine the signals involved in export of parasite proteins, we have prepared transfected parasites expressing a chimeric protein comprising the N-terminal region of the Plasmodium falciparum exported protein-1 appended to green fluorescent protein. The majority of the population of the chimeric protein appears to be correctly processed and trafficked to the parasitophorous vacuole, indicating that this is the default destination for protein secretion. Some of the protein is redirected to the parasite food vacuole and further degraded. Photobleaching studies reveal that the parasitophorous vacuole contains subcompartments that are only partially interconnected. Dual labeling with the lipid probe, BODIPY-TR-ceramide, reveals the presence of membrane-bound extensions that can bleb from the parasitophorous vacuole to produce double membrane-bound compartments. We also observed regions and extensions of the parasitophorous vacuole, where there is segregation of the lumenal chimera from the lipid components. These regions may represent sites for the sorting of proteins destined for the trafficking to sites beyond the parasitophorous vacuole membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2051352279,"Vertebrate proteasomes are structurally heterogeneous, consisting of both (or standard) proteasomes and immunoproteasomes. Constitutive proteasomes contain three ubiquitously expressed catalytic subunits, Delta (beta 1), Z (beta 2), and X (beta 5), whereas immunoproteasomes contain three interferon-gamma-inducible catalytic subunits, LMP2 (beta 1i), MECL (beta 2i), and LMP7 (beta 5i). We recently have demonstrated that proteasome assembly is biased to promote immunoproteasome homogeneity when both types of catalytic subunits are expressed in the same cell. This cooperative assembly is due in part to differences between the LMP7 (beta 5i) and X (beta 5) propeptides. In the current study we demonstrate that differences between the MECL (beta 2i) and Z (beta2) propeptides also influence cooperative assembly. Specifically, replacing the MECL propeptide with that of Z enables MECL incorporation into otherwise constitutive (Delta(+)/X(+)) proteasomes and facilitates X incorporation into otherwise immunoproteasomes (MECL(+)/LMP2(+)). We also show, using MECL(-/-) mice, that LMP2 incorporation does not require MECL, in contrast with previous suggestions that their incorporation is mutually codependent. These results enable us to refine our model for cooperative proteasome assembly by determining which combinations of inducible and constitutive subunits are favored over others, and we propose a mechanism for how propeptides mediate cooperative assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1986827304,"Vav2 is a member of the Vav family that serves as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho family of Ras-related GTPases. Unlike Vav1, whose expression is restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin, Vav2 is broadly expressed. Recently, Vav2 has been identified as a substrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor; however, the mechanism by which Vav2 is activated in EGF-treated cells is unclear. By the means of an in vitro protein kinase assay, we show here that purified and activated EGF receptor phosphorylates Vav2 exclusively on its N-terminal domain. Furthermore, EGF receptor phosphorylates Vav2 on all three possible phosphorylation sites, Tyr-142, Tyr-159, and Tyr-172. In intact cells we also show that Vav2 associates with the activated EGF receptor in an Src homology 2 domain-dependent manner, with Vav2 Src homology 2 domain binding preferentially to autophosphorylation sites Tyr-992 and Tyr-1148 of the EGF receptor. Treatment of cells with EGF results in stimulation of exchange activity of Vav2 as measured on Rac; however, the intensity of the exchange activity does not show any correlation with the level of Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Introducing a point mutation into the Vav2 pleckstrin homology domain or treatment of cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 prior to EGF stimulation inhibits Vav2 exchange activity. Although phosphorylation mutants of Vav2 can readily induce actin rearrangement in COS7 cells, pleckstrin homology domain mutant does not stimulate membrane ruffling. These results suggest that EGF regulates Vav2 activity basically through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 may rather be necessary for mediating protein-protein interactions.

These results suggest that EGF regulates Vav2 activity basically through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 may rather be necessary for mediating protein-protein interactions. In recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating that Rho-like GTPases are key regulators in signaling pathways that link extracellular growth signals to the assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). To date, the Rho family consists of at least 14 members, including the widely expressed RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 proteins. RhoA regulates formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in many types of cells, Rac1 stimulates formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffling, and Cdc42 controls assembly of filopodia (2Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Ras superfamily, Rho proteins act as molecular switches to control cellular processes by cycling between active, GTP-bound and inactive, GDP-bound states. Activation of the GTPases, through GDP-GTP exchange, is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas inactivation is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors appear to stabilize the inactive, GDP-bound form of the protein. Activated Rho GTPases interact with cellular target proteins, such as rhotekin, rhophilin, citron, and several serine/threonine kinases, to trigger a wide variety of cellular responses, including the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Vav was originally identified as a transforming gene when an N-terminally truncated form was expressed in fibroblasts as a result of a recombination event occurring during transfection (4Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Vav is normally expressed predominantly if not exclusively in hematopoietic cells where it plays a key role in signaling pathways downstream of the T cell receptor and the B cell receptor (for review see Ref. 5Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Vav is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine following activation of these and other receptors. In addition to two SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; NT, N-terminal; DH, Dbl homology; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; IP, immunoprecipitated; N-PAK, N-terminal-PAK domains, an SH2 domain, a cysteine-rich domain, a calponin homology domain, and an acidic domain, Vav also contains a Dbl homology domain followed by a pleckstrin homology domain characteristic of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for proteins of the Rho subfamily of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. Recently Vav has been shown to act enzymatically as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA (6Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R.

Recently, novel Vav family members, Vav2 and Vav3, have been identified that are widely expressed in human tissues (8Henske E.P. Short M.P. Jozwiak S. Bovey C.M. Ramlakhan S. Haines J.L.

In addition, Vav2 is capable of associating with autophosphorylated growth factor receptors through its SH2 domain (13Moores S.L. Selfors L.M. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W. Brugge J.S.

It has been also reported that Vav2 SH2 domain can bind directly to multiple autophosphorylation sites on the PDGF receptor (13Moores S.L. Selfors L.M. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W.

Although the interaction of Vav family members with plasma membrane receptors has been well characterized, little is known about the mechanism by which receptor tyrosine kinases regulate the activity of Vav2 or Vav3. PI3K is known to play a role in the activation of Rac, both from the study of the actin cytoskeleton (16Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr.

Activation of PI3K in the absence of other stimuli is sufficient to cause membrane ruffling (19Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), a downstream effect of Rac activation. The mechanism by which PI3K activation leads to Rac activation is unknown. However, it has been reported recently that 3′ phosphorylated phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate can bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Vav and promote its exchange activity toward Rac in vitro(21Han J.

Although this suggests that the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Vav toward Rac could be responsive to PI3K activation, the role of Vav PH domain is still controversial. In this study we have investigated the role of Vav2 as a regulator of Rac activity in EGF signaling pathway. We identified the EGF receptor-dependent phosphorylation sites of Vav2 in vitro and in vivo and investigated the role of Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation in regulation of Vav2 activity. Our results, based on several tyrosine mutants of Vav2, demonstrate that the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 is likely less important than its PI3K-dependent activation and probably more complicated than just one tyrosine phosphorylation site regulates Vav2 activity. In addition, we provide evidence that PI3K stimulated by EGF treatment of cells contributes to Vav2-dependent Rac activation. These results suggest that EGF regulates Vav2 activity through PI3K activation, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 may be necessary for mediating protein-protein interactions. Full-length Vav2 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into SalI/EcoRI site of EGFP-C2 plasmid (Clontech). cDNA corresponding to the N-terminal part of Vav2 (amino acids 1–194; NT domain), Dbl homology domain (amino acids 195–386; DH), PH domain (amino acids 387–590), and the C-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 domains of Vav2 (amino acids 591–590) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into theSalI/EcoRI site of pGEX-4T vector (AmershamBiosciences). Mutations were created with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In all cases the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and gave essentially single bands on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS polyacrylamide gels. GFP were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against GFP. Monoclonal antibody raised against the GFP was supplied by the Cancer Research UK Hybridoma Development Unit. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Rac antibody and anti-EGF receptor antibody were purchased from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories. Anti-GST, anti-PI3K p110α, and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Monoclonal anti-Vav2 antibody was purchased from Babraham Bioscience Technologies. Five phosphopeptides, pY992, pY1068, pY1086, pY1148, and pY1087, derived from the autophosphorylation sites of EGF receptor, were synthesized with the following sequences: DADE(pTyr)LIPQ, VQNP(pTyr)HNQP, PVPE(pTyr)INQS, DNPD(pTyr)QQDF, and ENAE(pTyr)LRVA, respectively. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). For stimulation, cells, 80% confluent, were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with EGF (Sigma-Aldrich) at 50 ng/ml for 5 min. Alternatively, the cells were pre-treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 at 20 μm for 60 min and then stimulated with EGF as above. LipofectAMINE was obtained from Invitrogen and used for transfection of COS7 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 × 105cells were plated on 6-well dishes 24 h prior to transfection. 1 μg of the various Vav2 constructs and 7 μl of LipofectAMINE were added to each well in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 5 h, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured in their regular medium. Prior to stimulation with EGF, cells were serum-starved for 18 h. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (22Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Briefly, after stimulation, COS7 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Hepes puffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml each of leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then precleared with protein G-Sepharose, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with 8 μg of monoclonal anti-GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitates were collected by incubating with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) system. For precipitation with GST fusion proteins, 5 μg of GST-Vav2-SH2 domain was used as non-covalently-bound adducts to glutathione-agarose beads. Separation of bound proteins and immunoblotting were performed as described above. For Vav2 phosphorylation, 5–5 μg of GST-tagged fragments of Vav2 immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were washed with phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm ATP) and resuspended in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer. Kinase reaction was initiated by addition of 1 μg of EGF receptor purified by affinity chromatography from lysates of EGF-treated A431 cells, as described previously (22Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). After 20 min at room temperature, immobilized GST proteins were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold solution containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. PI3K activity was measured as described previously (23Myers Jr., M.G.

After appropriate treatments, cell lysates were incubated with anti-PI3K p110α antibody as indicated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by incubating with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4 and then 2 times with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μmNa3VO4. The kinase activity was measured by resuspending the immunoprecipitates in 30 μl of kinase buffer and incubating with 10 μl of 2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 1 μl of 1m MgCl2, 1 μl of 100 mm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 22 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 20 μl of 5 n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) mix. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The organic phase containing the phosphoinositol phosphates were spotted onto a silica gel TLC plate coated with 1% potassium oxalate and separated in a solvent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (90:70:14.6:5.4). The TLC plate was exposed to x-ray film for 1–5 h at −80 °C and developed. GST-N-PAKα fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from Escherichia colion glutathione-Sepharose beads. For the pull outs, transiently transfected COS7 cells were grown in 6-cm dishes, starved overnight, and harvested 48 h after transfection in lysis buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2. The precleared lysates were added to the GST-N-PAKα beads (∼20 μg of N-PAK proteins per point) and tumbled on a wheel for 60 min at 4 °C. After a single wash in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mm MgCl2 the beads were drained and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound and activated Rac was identified following Western blotting. COS7 cells on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml for 20 min. Coverslips were mounted onto slides in a 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 10% Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem), 25% glycerol, and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (DABCO; Sigma-Aldrich). Expression of various Vav2-GFP constructs was determined by GFP fluorescence. Microscopy was performed on a Nikon Eclipse E400 fluorescence microscope. It has been well documented that EGF receptor can phosphorylate Vav2 in intact cells (11Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell.

(12López-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have shown recently that tyrosine kinase Lck can phosphorylate all potential tyrosine residues (Tyr-142, Tyr-160, Tyr-174) in the N-terminal domain of Vav1. In addition, a phosphospecific antibody generated against the phosphorylated Tyr-174 was capable of recognizing the phosphorylated Vav2 and Vav3 proteins in EGF-treated cells, suggesting that this phosphorylation site is conserved in all known member of the Vav family (12López-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the EGF receptor-dependent phosphorylation sites on Vav2 (apart from Tyr-174) have not been identified so far. To map the phosphorylation site(s) of EGF receptor on Vav2, we cut the Vav2 molecule into four parts and expressed the protein domains as GST fusion proteins. These protein domains represent the NT part of Vav2, the DH domain, the PH domain, and finally the C-terminal part of the molecule that contains two SH3 and one SH2 domains (SH3-SH2-SH3). Activated EGFR was then purified from EGF-treated A431 cells and used for an in vitro phosphorylation assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GST fusion proteins were mixed with activated EGF receptor for 20 min in the presence of ATP, washed samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted proteins were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, EGF receptor can phosphorylate only the N-terminal domain of Vav2 but not the GST fusion protein control or other domains of Vav2. Previous studies have revealed that the Vav can be phosphorylated by a number of tyrosine kinases in activated T and B lymphocytes, including Fyn, Syk, ZAP-70, and Lck (26Cantrell D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R535-R538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the major phosphorylation site was Tyr-174 (7Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12López-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation site is in the N-terminal domain of Vav proteins; therefore, we tested whether EGF receptor is also capable of phosphorylating Tyr-172 of Vav2, a tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr-174 of Vav. A point mutation was introduced into the Vav2 NT domain, changing tyrosine 172 to phenylalanine (Y172F). In the phosphorylation assay, GST-NT and GST-NT-Y172F fusion proteins were incubated with the EGF receptor. After intensive washing, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. As the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot demonstrates, we could detect a small but significant decrease in the level of mutant NT domain phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). In addition to the Tyr-172, the N-terminal domain of Vav2 contains two more conserved tyrosine residues that can be found in all member of the Vav family (12López-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, we introduced additional point mutations into NT-Y172F domain, changing tyrosines 142 and 159 to phenylalanines, respectively. The performed phosphorylation assay and then the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot shows that the EGF receptor-dependent phosphorylation of the double mutant NT-Y172/142F significantly decreased compared with the level of NT-Y172F phosphorylation. In addition, the phosphorylation of the other double mutant, NT-Y172/159F, was further decreased (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that activated EGF receptor is likely capable of phosphorylating all three tyrosine residues in the N-terminal domain of Vav2. It is noteworthy that the isoform of Vav2 we used in our experiment possesses another tyrosine residue, Tyr-187, in its N-terminal domain. However, this tyrosine residue is neither conserved among Vav family members nor represents consensus phosphorylation site for EGF receptor. Nevertheless, point mutation was introduced into Vav2 NT domain, changing Tyr-187 to phenylalanine, but this mutation did not affect the phosphorylation level of Vav2 NT domain (data not shown). Immunoblotting of the nitrocellulose membrane with anti-GST antibody revealed that equal amounts of Vav2-NT constructs were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that EGF receptor phosphorylates Vav2 on all three tyrosine residues in vivo, GFP-tagged fusion constructs of Vav2 were generated encoding wild type Vav2 and different Vav2 mutants including Vav2-Y172F, Vav2-Y172/142F, Vav2-Y172/159F, and Vav2-Y159F. These mutants were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and then Vav2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies using lysates prepared from unstimulated or EGF-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, EGF treatment of cells leads to a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type Vav2. However, when single point mutants were used, both Vav2-Y172F and Vav2-Y159F showed decreased tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation of double mutant Vav2-Y172/142F was further reduced compared with Vav2-Y159F or Vav2-Y172F. Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation of the double mutant Vav2-Y172/159F was hardly detectable. This experiment demonstrates that in response to EGF all three candidate phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal domain of Vav2 are phosphorylated. Immunoblotting of the same nitrocellulose membrane with anti-GFP antibody revealed that equal amounts of different Vav2 constructs were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 C). To confirm that endogenous Vav2 can be tyrosine-phosphorylated in COS7 cells in response to EGF stimuli, and EGF acts specifically through its receptor, Vav2 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Vav2 antibody from lysates of unstimulated and EGF-treated cells. Fig. 2 D demonstrates that EGF stimulates phosphorylation of endogenous Vav2 in COS7 cells, and autophosphorylated EGF receptor is co-immunoprecipitated with Vav2. In addition, the effect of EGF could be inhibited by addition of specific EGF receptor inhibitors PD168393 and PD153035 (Calbiochem). Although it has been reported recently that interaction of Vav2 with activated EGF receptor is mediated in an SH2 domain-dependent manner, Pandey et al. (14Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) used only GST fusion proteins to investigate the nature of this interaction. To examine whether Vav2-EGFR association is an SH2 domain-dependent interaction in vivo, we introduced point mutations into the SH2 domain of GFP-Vav2 protein, as described previously for Vav (27Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan at position 673 of Vav2 was mutated to arginine (W673R), and glycine at position 693 was changed to arginine (G693R). GFP-Vav2 proteins were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and then GFP proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of untreated and EGF-stimulated cells. The immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, wild type Vav2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGF treatment of cells and co-immunoprecipitates with the autophosphorylated EGF receptor. However, when SH2 mutant proteins were used, interactions of both W673R and G693R mutants with the EGF receptor were strongly decreased. These data clearly suggest that Vav2 associates with the autophosphorylated EGF receptor in an SH2 domain-dependent manner in vivo. Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of those Vav2 mutants that are not capable of associating with the activated EGF receptor are markedly decreased. To investigate further the Vav2/EGF receptor interactions, specific phosphopeptides were synthesized based on the major autophosphorylation sites of the EGF re"

Because the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt activation pathway is required for BCR-ABL-mediated transformation and survival signaling in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in this study we examined the involvement of FKHRL1 in the BCR-ABL-mediated signaling pathway. FKHRL1 was constitutively phosphorylated in BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines KCL22 and KU812, and its phosphorylation was inhibited by treatment with STI571, a specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Concomitantly, STI571 induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, accompanied by up-regulation of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1 in KCL22 cells. In addition, FKHRL1 was constitutively phosphorylated in the TF-1/bcr-abl cell line ectopically expressing BCR-ABL but not in the parent TF-1 cell line. Considering several lines of evidence that phosphorylated FKHRL1 has lost transcriptional activity and that p27/Kip1 expression is positively regulated by dephosphorylated “active” FKHRL1, BCR-ABL may down-regulate p27/Kip1 expression via the loss of FKHRL1 function as a transcription factor. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible “active FKHRL1” FKHRL1-TM (a triple mutant of FKHRL1, in which all three Akt phosphorylation sites have been mutated), estrogen receptor system in the KCL22 cell line. The addition of tamoxifen inhibited the cell growth indicating that overexpression of FKHRL1 in the nucleus antagonized deregulated proliferation of CML cells. Collectively, FKHRL1 regulates the expression of p27/Kip1 as a downstream molecule of BCR-ABL signaling in CML cells. BCR-ABL-induced loss of FKHRL1 function may be involved in oncogenic transformation of CML partially via the down-regulation of p27/Kip1 proteins.

BCR-ABL-induced loss of FKHRL1 function may be involved in oncogenic transformation of CML partially via the down-regulation of p27/Kip1 proteins. The bcr-abl fusion gene originates from a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome (1McLaughlin J. Chianese E. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6558-6562Google Scholar). The resultantbcr-abl fusion gene encodes the chimeric BCR-ABL proteins of p230, p210, and p185 (230, 210, and 185 kDa). These fusion proteins have constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity and are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 1The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ER, estrogen receptor; 4-OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; FCS, fetal calf serum; MTT, 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; IREs, insulin-response elements; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau 1The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ER, estrogen receptor; 4-OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; FCS, fetal calf serum; MTT, 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; IREs, insulin-response elements; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2Lugo T.G.

The expression of BCR-ABL activates multiple signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT, Ras, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (11Sattler M. Salgia R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 63-79Google Scholar). Among these, it was demonstrated that the activation of PI3K and the downstream Akt signaling pathways is required for not only BCR-ABL-mediated transformation but also cell survival of CML cells (12Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that members of human Forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1, AFX, and FKHR are directly phosphorylated by activated Akt (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

We also reported that FKHRL1 is directly phosphorylated by activated Akt as one of the downstream molecules of the PI3K/Akt activation pathway in erythropoietin and thrombopoietin signalings (18Kashii Y. Uchida M. Kirito K. Tanaka M. Nishijima K. Toshima M. Ando T. Koizumi K. Endoh T. Sawada K. Momoi M. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. Blood. 2000; 96: 941-949Google Scholar, 19Tanaka M. Kirito K.

More than 100 Forkhead family transcription factors have been identified in diverse species ranging from yeasts to humans (20Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Google Scholar). These transcription factors are related to embryogenesis, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, the three Forkhead transcription factors, FKHRL1, AFX, and FKHR, are human homologs of DAF-16, which is involved in lifespan extension of Caenorhabditis elegans (21Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Google Scholar, 22Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Google Scholar). The genes encoding these three molecules were originally identified in breakpoints of which chromosome translocations are recognized in human tumors (23Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Google Scholar, 24Hillion J. Le Coniat M. Jonveaux P. Berger R. Bernard O.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 3714-3719Google Scholar, 25Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 195-202Google Scholar). FKHRL1 has three potential Akt phosphorylation sites (RXRXX(S/T)): Thr-32 (RPRSCT 32), Ser-253 (RRRAVS 253), and Ser-315 (RSRTNS 315) (26Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Google Scholar). When cells are stimulated with serum or growth factors, FKHRL1 is phosphorylated by activated Akt and is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in the inhibition of target gene transcription (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar, 14Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

In contrast, when cells are deprived of serum or growth factors, FKHRL1 becomes a dephosphorylated form, translocates into the nucleus, and activates the transcription of target genes. Thus, the transcriptional activity of FKHRL1 is negatively regulated via Akt-induced phosphorylation. Therefore, FKHRL1-TM, which is replaced at three amino acids, Thr-32, Ser-253, and Ser-315 with alanine, is predicted to be an active form as a transcription factor (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar). Medema et al. (27Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Google Scholar) and we (19Tanaka M. Kirito K. Kashii Y. Uchida M. Toshima M. Endoh T. Sawada K. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. J. Biol.

These findings strongly suggested that FKHRL1 controls cell cycling via regulating the p27/Kip1 expression. Taken together with several lines of evidence that BCR-ABL suppressed p27/Kip1 expression via the PI3k/Akt activation pathway (29Jonuleit T. van Der Kuip H. Miething C. Michels H. Hallek M.

To address this notion, we examined the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in a CML-derived cell line. To elucidate further the pathological role of FKHRL1 in CML, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible FKHRL1-TM:estrogen receptor (ER) system in a CML-derived cell line. We show here that FKHRL1 lies downstream of the BCR-ABL signaling pathway, and that this molecule has a negative effect on deregulated cell growth caused by BCR-ABL fusion protein. Loss of function of FKHRL1 may be involved in the oncogenic transformation of CML cells. Fetal calf serum (FCS) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody against BCR was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phospho-FKHRL1 (Thr-32) and phospho-c-Abl (Tyr-245) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibody against native FKHRL1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). An antibody against p27/Kip1 was purchased from BD Biosciences. The 2-phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative STI571 (molecular mass, 590 daltons) was developed and kindly provided by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). The stock solutions of this compound were prepared at 1 mm with Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. pcDNA3 containing human FKHRL1-TM-ER cDNA was kindly provided by Paul Coffer from the University Medical Center (Heidelberglaan, The Netherlands). To prepare the dominant-negative form of FKHRL1 (FKHRL1-DN), we restricted pcDNA3.1-containing human FKHRL1-TM cDNA with Bst1107 and EcoRV restriction enzymes, and we deleted the transactivation domain. Anti-Bim antibody was a gift from Toshiya Inaba (Hiroshima, Japan). KCL22, KU812 cell lines, and TF-1/bcr-abl cell lines were maintained in liquid culture with IMDM containing 10% FCS (32Kubonishi I. Miyoshi I. Int. J. Cell Cloning. 1983; 1: 105-117Google Scholar, 33Kishi K. Leuk. Res. 1985; 9: 381-390Google Scholar, 34Nakajima A. Tauchi T. Ohyashiki K. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2001; 15: 989-990Google Scholar). TF-1 cells were maintained in liquid culture with IMDM containing 10% FCS with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1 ng/ml). KCL22 cells were transfected with mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3; Invitrogen) containing human FKHRL1-TM-ER (27Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Google Scholar) or FKHRL1-DN cDNA by the Lipofectin method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). We selected three independent clones resistant to neomycin (1.0 mg/ml). Cell growth was examined by a colorimetric assay according to Mosmann (35Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were incubated at a density of 1 × 104/100 μl in 96-well plates in IMDM containing 10% FCS. After 72 h of culture at 37 °C, 20 μl of sterilized 5 mg/ml 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) was added to each well. Following 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of 10% SDS was added to each well to dissolve the dark-blue crystal product. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm using a microplate reader (model 3550; Bio-Rad). The cells were washed and suspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.7 ng/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride. After 20 min of incubation on ice, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the appropriate concentration of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C or for 1–2 h at room temperature. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (1:2,000), the blots were probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies for 90 min at room temperature. After a second washing, the blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (ECL Western blot detection system; Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize the immunoreactive bands. The blots were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min, washed, blocked, and reprobed. Cell cycle analysis was performed by staining DNA with propidium iodide in preparation for flow cytometry with the FACScan/CellFIT system (BD Biosciences). Oligonucleotides containing an array of seven insulin-response elements (IREs) (three IRSA (CAAAACAA) and four IRSB (TTATTTTG)) were cloned into theKpnI-HindIII site of pGL3 basic vector to generate pGL3–7xIREs. The pGL3–7xIREs and pECE vector containing FKHRL1-TM cDNA with or without pCDNA3.1 containing FKHRL1-DN cDNA were introduced into 293 cells by lipofection with the internal control plasmid pRL-TKLUC (Promega, Madison, WI). After transfection, the cells were cultured for 36 h and then harvested for dual luciferase assay according to the manual (Promega). In some experiments, a luciferase reporter containing the p27/Kip1 promoter was used. In the following experiments, we mainly used the KCL22 cell line. This cell line was established from the bone marrow cells of a patient with blastic crisis of BCR-ABL-positive CML (32Kubonishi I. Miyoshi I. Int. J. Cell Cloning. 1983; 1: 105-117Google Scholar). Therefore, KCL22 would be a good model of CML cells for elucidating the biological function of FKHRL1. We initially examined whether or not STI571 inhibits the proliferation of KCL22 cells. KCL22 cells were exposed to various concentrations of STI571 (0.03–3 μm) for 3 days. MTT reduction assay revealed that STI571 inhibited the proliferation of KCL22 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). To clarify the mechanism by which STI517 inhibited the cell growth of KCL22 cells, we examined the effect of STI571 on cell cycling of the KCL22 cells. 1 μm STI571 induced the G0/G1arrest in KCL22 cells in a time-dependent manner. The G0/G1 ratio began to increase at 9 h and reached a plateau at 24 h upon STI571 treatment, inversely to S and G2/M populations (Fig. 1 B). The ratio of apoptotic cells did not increase during the observation periods up to 72 h (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 C, a CDK inhibitor, p27/Kip1 protein was detected after 3 h of exposure to STI571, and the expression level was gradually increased up to 48 h. We performed Western blotting with anti-phospho-c-Abl (Tyr-245) or anti-phospho-FKHRL1 (Thr-32) antibody in KCL22 cells. FKHRL1 and BCR-ABL fusion protein were constitutively phosphorylated in this cell line (Fig. 2 A,lane 1). Next we examined whether or not STI571 inhibits the phosphorylation of these two proteins. KCL22 cells were exposed to STI571 (1 μm) for the indicated periods of up to 8 h and then harvested. The phosphorylation of BCR-ABL fusion protein began to diminish after a 1-h exposure to STI571 (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, KCL22 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of STI571 (0.05–5 μm) for 6 h. The phosphorylation of BCR-ABL significantly diminished at 1 μm and completely disappeared at 5 μm STI571 (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with the kinetics of BCR-ABL phosphorylation, STI571 inhibited the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A andB). However, STI571 did not affect the expression level of BCR-ABL and FKHRL1 proteins (Fig. 2, A andB). To exclude the possibility that phosphorylation of FKHRL1 is limited to KCL22, we examined the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in another Bcr-Abl-positive cell line, KU812. BCR-ABL was constitutively phosphorylated, and its phosphorylation was inhibited by STI571 in this cell line (Fig. 3 A). Concomitantly, the constitutive phosphorylation of FKHRL1 was inhibited by STI571 treatment. Collectively, these results suggested that FKHRL1 lies downstream of BCR-ABL signaling. To confirm this hypothesis, we used the TF-1/bcr-abl cell line ectopically expressing BCR-ABL (34Nakajima A. Tauchi T. Ohyashiki K. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2001; 15: 989-990Google Scholar). BCR-ABL was constitutively phosphorylated in TF-1/bcr-abl but not in the parent TF-1 cells (Fig. 3 B,1st and 2nd lanes), and its phosphorylation was inhibited after treatment with 1 μm STI571 (Fig. 3 B,3rd lane), indicating that 1 μm STI571 indeed inhibited the BCR-ABL activity in TF-1/bcr-abl cells. As expected, constitutive phosphorylation of FKHRL1 was observed in TF-1/bcr-abl but not in the parental TF-1 cells (Fig. 3 B,1st and 2nd lanes), and its constitutive phosphorylation was inhibited after STI571 treatment (Fig. 3 B,3rd lane). These results strongly supported our hypothesis that FKHRL1 lies downstream of BCR-ABL signaling. p27/Kip1 protein was down-regulated in TF-1/bcr-abl cells, compared with that in TF-1 cells (Fig.3 B,1st and 2nd lanes). In addition, STI571 induced inhibition of the BCR-ABL activity, accompanied by up-regulation of p27/Kip1 protein in TF-1/bcr-abl cells (Fig.3 B,2nd and 3rd lanes). These results strongly suggested that p27/Kip1 lies downstream of BCR-ABL signaling, as reported previously by other groups (29Jonuleit T. van Der Kuip H. Miething C. Michels H. Hallek M. Duyster J. Aulitzky W.E. Blood. 2000; 96: 1933-1999Google Scholar, 30Parada Y. Banerji L. Glassford J. Lea N.C. Collado M. Rivas C. Lewis J.L. Gordon M.Y. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23572-23580Google Scholar, 31Gesbert F. Sellers W.R. Signoretti S. Loda M. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39223-39230Google Scholar). We examined whether PI3K activity is involved in BCR-ABL-dependent phosphorylation of FKHRL1 using a specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002. As shown in Fig.3 C, 20 μm LY294002 completely suppressed the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, indicating that the phosphorylation of FKHLR1 is dependent on PI3K activity in BCR-ABL signaling. Considering that FKHRL1 is constitutively phosphorylated in BCR-ABL-expressing cells, FKHRL1 may be in an “inactive state” in CML, leading to oncogenic transformation. To clarify this hypothesis, we generated transfectants expressing FKHRL1-TM-ER which became the active form after the addition of 4-OHT. We selected three independent positive clones highly expressing ectopic FKHRL1-TM-ER (Fig.4 A). The transfectant cells or the parent KCL22 cells were treated with STI571 (1 μm) or 4-OHT (0.5 μm) for the indicated periods and then harvested for MTT incorporation assay or cell cycle analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 B, STI571 inhibited the proliferation of the transfectant cells to the same degree as the parent KCL22 cells. These results suggested that the transfectant cells have still retained the sensitivity to STI571 to the same degree as the parent KCL22 cells. Induced activation of FKHRL1-TM by 4-OHT treatment led to the suppression of MTT incorporation into the cells, whereas 4-OHT treatment had no effect on MTT incorporation into the parental control cells (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that FKHRL1-TM-ER is actually functional in our system. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase was significantly elevated 24 h after 4-OHT treatment, suggesting that FKHRL1-TM-ER induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Concomitantly, the expression level of p27/Kip1 protein was significantly elevated after 24 h of exposure to 4-OHT (Fig. 4 E).Figure 4Active FKHRL1 (FKHRL1-TM-ER) inhibits the proliferation of KCL22 cells via up-regulation of p27/Kip1. A, generation of transfectants expressing FKHRL1-TM-ER. After solubilization, cell extracts were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the antibodies directed against anti-FKHRL1 antibody. The parent KCL22 cells were used as a control (lane C). B, effect of STI571 on the proliferation of transfectants. The cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/well in IMDM supplemented with 10% FCS and cultured with various concentrations of STI571 (0.1–10 μm). MTT reduction assay was performed after 3 days of culture. The values represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate cultures and are expressed as a percentage of untreated transfectant cells. The parental KCL22 cells were used as a control. C, effect of 4-OHT on proliferation of transfectants. The cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/well in IMDM supplemented with 10% FCS and cultured with various concentrations of 4-OHT (0.01–1 μm). MTT reduction assay was performed after 3 days of culture. The values represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate cultures and are expressed as a percentage of untreated transfectant cells. The parental KCL22 cells were used as a control. D, effect of FKHRL-1-TM on cell cycle. The transfectant cells and the parent cells were treated with STI571 (1 μm) or 4-OHT (0.5 μm), sequentially cultured for the periods indicated, and harvested for cell cycle analysis. E, induction of p27/Kip1 or Bim protein after STI571 and 4-OHT treatment. The parent KCL22 and the transfectant cells were treated with STI571 (1 μm) or 4-OHT (0.5 μm), sequentially cultured for the periods indicated, and harvested for Western blotting analysis with antibody against p27/Kip1 or Bim protein. The blot was reprobed with β-actin antibody to confirm equal loading of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4 D, the ratio of sub-G1population representing apoptosis was increased after 4-OHT treatment in these three clones, especially in clones 10-9 and 24-3. To elucidate the mechanism by which the transfectant cells underwent rapid apoptosis after the addition of 4-OHT, we focused our attention on the expression of Bim, a member of the BH3-only subfamily of cell death activators, because it was recently reported that Bim is transcriptionally regulated by FKHRL1 (36Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 E, the expressions of BimEL, BimL, and BimS proteins were slightly up-regulated 24 and 48 h after the addition of 4-OHT. A high dose of STI571 up to 20 μm induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase but not apoptosis during the observation periods up to 72 h (Fig.5 A). However, up-regulation of Bim proteins was observed in the presence of STI571 in the range of 1–20 μm (Fig. 5 B). To further elucidate the functional role of FKHRL1 in STI571-induced cell cycle arrest of KCL22 cells, we generated transfectants expressing FKHRL1-DN but lacking the transactivation domain. Initially, we examined whether FKHRL1-DN functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor. For this purpose, we used a pGL3–7xIREs construct containing seven consecutive FKHRL1-binding sites, and we introduced this construct into 293 cells with FKHRL1-TM cDNA and then assayed the luciferase activity. As illustrated in Fig.6 A, FKHRL1-TM induced promoter activity, which was completely inhibited by FKHRL1-DN. These results indicate that FKHRL1-DN functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor on the transactivation activity of FKHRL1-TM. Based on this result, we transfected KCL22 cells with pcDNA3.1 containing FKHRL1-DN and selected three independent positive clones expressing FKHRL1-DN protein (Fig. 6 B). Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that STI571 treatment significantly enhanced the ratio of the sub-G1population in the transfectants expressing FKHRL1-DN but not vector alone (Fig. 6 C). The ratio of sub-G1 population was increased in proportion to the expression level of FKHRL1-DN protein (Fig. 6, A and C). Consistent with this finding, cell viability of the transfectants was much lower than that of the parent cells (Fig. 6 D). This suggested that the inhibition of endogenous FKHRL1 by FKHRL1-DN enhanced sensitivity to STI571 in KCL22 cells. In this study, we demonstrated that FKHRL1 is located downstream to the BCR-ABL signaling pathway as an inactive phosphorylated form and functions as an effector when FKHRL1 is converted to the dephosphorylated form by STI571 treatment in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. We found that FKHRL1 is constitutively phosphorylated in KCL22, KU812, and TF-1/bcr-abl cells and that STI571 induces down-regulation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity, dephosphorylation of FKHRL1, and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in KCL22 cells. This was accompanied by up-regulation of p27/Kip1 expression. Moreover, 4-OHT-inducible FKHRL1-TM induced the cell cycle arrest and induced up-regulation of p27/Kip1 proteins in the KCL22-derived transfectant cells. Taken together, our results suggested that STI571 inhibited the cell growth of BCR-ABL-expressing cells, at least in part via dephosphorylated FKHRL1-mediated up-regulation of p27/Kip1 proteins. Therefore, constitutive phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by BCR-ABL fusion protein may be an important mechanism in BCR-ABL-mediated cell cycle signaling (29Jonuleit T. van Der Kuip H. Miething C. Michels H. Hallek M. Duyster J. Aulitzky W.E. Blood. 2000; 96: 1933-1999Google Scholar, 30Parada Y. Banerji L. Glassford J. Lea N.C. Collado M. Rivas C. Lewis J.L. Gordon M.Y. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23572-23580Google Scholar, 31Gesbert F. Sellers W.R. Signoretti S. Loda M. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39223-39230Google Scholar). STI571 (1 μm) inhibited the proliferation of cells but did not induce apoptosis in KCL22 cells during the observation periods up to 72 h. Taken together with the previous reports that 1 μm STI571 was sufficient to induce cell death in BCR-ABL-transformed cell lines and primary leukemia cells from CML patient samples in chronic phase, KCL22 cells appear to be less sensitive to STI571. This may be explained by several lines of evidence that KCL22 was established from a patient with CML blastic crisis and that survival pathways other than BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase possibly operate in the blastic crisis cells. However, because phosphorylated FKHRL1 was detected in TF-1/bcr-abl but not the parental TF-1 cells, we concluded that FKHRL1 lies downstream of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The ectopic expression of active FKHRL1 did not induce cell cycle arrest as robustly as ST571. In fact, in clones 10-9 and 24-4, the changes in the ratio of G0/G1 population was about 10%, whereas treatment with STI571 routinely elicited 20–40% changes. Therefore, besides FKHRL1, other cell cycle-associated molecules such as FKHR and AFX may be also involved in STI571-induced cell cycle arrest, because these Forkhead family members commonly induce p27/Kip1 (27Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Google Scholar, 37Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar). p27/Kip1 is generally regulated at the post-translational level via a proteasome-dependent degradation pathway (38Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Google Scholar, 39Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Google Scholar, 40Shirane M. Harumiya Y. Ishida N. Hirai A. Miyamoto C. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13886-13893Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it was previously shown that BCR-ABL fusion inhibited the p27/Kip1 expression through the PI3K-Akt pathway and its down-regulation mainly occurred through a proteasome-dependent degradation pathway (31Gesbert F. Sellers W.R. Signoretti S. Loda M. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39223-39230Google Scholar). However, it was reported recently (28Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Google Scholar) that FKHRL1 elevated the p27/Kip1 promoter activity in Ba/F3 cells expressing a 4-OHT-inducible FKHRL1-TM-ER construct, suggesting that the transcriptional activity of FKHRL1 directly induced the p27/Kip1 gene expression. Thus, the mechanism of how FKHRL1 regulates p27/Kip1 expression was still controversial. To address this unresolved problem, we examined the mechanism by which FKHRL1 regulates the p27/Kip1 expression in KCL22 cells. In this study, we found that both STI571 treatment and ectopic expression of FKHRL1-TM induced the up-regulation of p27/Kip1 expression at the protein level but not at the mRNA level (Figs.1 D and 4 E and data not shown). In addition, a luciferase assay revealed that 4-OHT treatment did not enhance the promoter activity of the p27/Kip1 gene in the KCL22 transfectants having 4-OHT-inducible FKHRL1-TM (data not shown). Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the discrepancy among these results was dependent on the different cell lines used, our results suggested that the regulation of p27/Kip1 expression by FKHRL1 does not occur at the transcriptional level, at least in KCL22-derived transfectant cells. If so, FKHRL1 may indirectly up-regulate the p27/Kip1 expression via an unidentified target molecule of FKHRL1. Therefore, it would be of interest to identify the target molecules of FKHRL1. Previously, it was reported that the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor molecule controls cell cycle progression by regulation of p27/Kip1 at both the mRNA and protein levels (41Kim M. Katayose Y. Li Q. Rakkar A.N. Li Z. Hwang S.G. Katayose D. Trepel J. Cowan K.H. Seth P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 672-677Google Scholar). However, our preliminary data showed that 4-OHT did not induce VHL proteins in the KCL22 transfectants expressing FKHRL1-TM-ER (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that VHL is a target molecule for FKHRL1. Bim is a member of the BH3-only subfamily that inhibits the function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by binding to them, resulting in inhibition of release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol (42Strasser A. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Huang D.C. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Cullen L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 917: 541-548Google Scholar). Recently, Shinjyo et al. (43Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Google Scholar) reported that Bim lies downstream of cytokine signaling, and its down-regulation is a prerequisite for the survival of hematopoietic cells. In addition, Kuribara et al. (44Kuribara R. Honda H. Shnjyo T. Inukai T. Sugita K. Nakazawa S. Hirai H. Ozawa K. Blood. 2000; 96: 347aGoogle Scholar) reported that BCR-ABL induced deregulated hematopoiesis via the down-regulation of Bim expression in CML. These findings suggested that Bim expression is critical for the regulation of hematopoiesis, and its deregulated expression may contribute to leukemogenesis such as CML. In this study, we found that 4-OHT induced apoptosis, accompanied by up-regulation of Bim proteins (BimEL, BimL, and BimS) in BCR-ABL-positive KCL22 cells ectopically expressing FKHRL1-TM-ER. However, even a high dosage of STI571 (20 μm) did not induce apoptosis, irrespective of the up-regulation of Bim proteins (Fig. 5 B). These results suggested that the expression of Bim proteins is required but not sufficient for the induction of apoptosis, at least in KCL22 cells. This notion is supported by the evidence that STI571 induced G0/G1 arrest and up-regulation of p27/Kip1 and Bim proteins but not apoptosis in clone 24-4 (Fig. 4, D andE). It is noteworthy that although a dominant-negative form of FKHRL1 (FKHRL1-DN), though not completely, did significantly block the STI571-induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1phase, this mutant drastically enhanced STI571-induced apoptosis in KCL22 cells. These results strongly suggest that active FKHRL1 could protect the KCL22 cells from apoptosis via the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Considering the several lines of evidence that the C. elegans DAF2 pathway regulates a state of diapause called dauer, which is an arrested juvenile form triggered by food limitation, high temperature, and crowding, and that the DAF16 is the main target of the DAF2 pathway, it would not be surprising that active FKHRL1 protects cells from apoptosis via cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1phase in the presence of STI571. If so, FKHRL1 may play an important role in the acquisition of “dormancy” in leukemia cells after exposure to anti-leukemic agents. However, it should be stressed that 4-OHT-induced expression of FKHRL1-TM-ER also induced apoptosis in KCL22 cells. Previously, we established a tetracycline-inducible system in a human TPO-dependent cell line UT-7/TPO and showed that induced expression of FKHRL1-TM lacking ER led to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase but not to apoptosis in this cell line (19Tanaka M. Kirito K. Kashii Y. Uchida M. Toshima M. Endoh T. Sawada K. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15082-15089Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this discrepancy was due to the different cell lines used in the experiments, overexpression of FKHRL1-TM-ER fusion protein may in part act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Akt activity. This notion can be supported by several lines of evidence that overexpressed FKHRL1 binds to Akt (45Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39152-39158Google Scholar) and that overexpression of the FKHR mutant replacing Ser-256 with alanine strongly suppressed the phosphorylation of the endogenous Akt substrates FKHRL1 and GSK3α (46Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar). Alternatively, overexpression of FKHRL1-TM may deprive endogenous FKHRL1 of co-factors prerequisite for the transcription activity, and as a result, FKHRL1-TM might function as a dominant-negative inhibitor against anti-apoptotic effect of endogenous FKHRL1, although this concept is speculative at present. Thus, as proposed by Woods and Rena (47Woods Y.L. Rena G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 391-397Google Scholar), caution may be needed when considering any results of overexpression experiments with FKHRL1-TM. Very recently, Kops et al. (48Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M.

However, our preliminary experiments revealed that LY294002 up to 20 μm did not prevent 4-OHT-induced apoptosis in the KCL22 transfectant expressing FKHRL1-TM-ER. Therefore, it is unlikely that constitutive activation of PI3K activity by BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enhanced 4-OHT-induced apoptosis in the FKHRL1-TM-ER-expressing cells. The data presented here demonstrate that FKHRL1 is important in the oncogenic transformation of CML. PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor, at least in part, by antagonizing PI3K-Akt signaling (49Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de La Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar) that Forkhead transcription factors including FKHRL1 are critical effectors of PTEN-mediated tumor suppression, suggesting that FKHRL1 also functions as a tumor suppressor. Taken together with our results that FKHRL1 lies downstream of BCR-ABL signaling as an inactive phosphorylated form, and that FKHRL1-TM suppressed the cell growth of CML-derived cell line KCL22, active FKHRL1 may be a potent anti-proliferative molecule against BCR-ABL-induced tumorigenesis. In addition, our finding that FKHRL1-DN caused apoptosis in STI571-treated KCL22 cells suggests that FKHRL1 represents an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation in CML.

The VR1 agonist capsaicin induced Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and this release was inhibited by the VR1 antagonist capsazepine but was unaffected by the phospholipase C inhibitor xestospongins, indicating that Ca2+ mobilization was dependent on capsaicin receptor binding and was not due to intracellular inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate generation.

Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7048) Google Scholar). VR1 confers several sensory functions in these cells, including the transduction of chemical (vanilloids and pH) and physical (heat) stimuli resulting in the generation of action potentials in nociceptive nerve endings, which are ultimately responsible for the sensations of heat and thermal/inflammatory pain (2Tominaga M.

Although VR1 exhibits Ca2+-dependent desensitization and has been proposed to be modulated by protein kinase C (4Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 5Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), it is possible that this receptor is subject to many other regulatory mechanisms that may be of fundamental importance to its functioning in sensory neurons. Although the activation of certain members of the TRP family of cation channels is reliant on the state of filling of intracellular Ca2+ stores (6Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), with these channels being activated by intracellular Ca2+ store depletion, it remains controversial whether VR1 has an innate capacity to function as a store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOCC) in sensory neurons. To date, there is no published evidence to support this, a previous study failing to detect activation of expressed VR1 following Ca2+ store depletion by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin in Xenopusoocytes (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7048) Google Scholar). In addition to functioning as a plasma membrane cation influx channel, VR1 may also behave as a Ca2+ release receptor. It has recently been reported that the activation of a capsaicin receptor induces the release of Ca2+ from ryanodine receptor-linked intracellular Ca2+ stores of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (7Eun S.Y. Jung S.J. Park Y.K. Kwak J. Kim S.J. Kim J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1114-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, VR1 expressed in HEK-293 cells colocalizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and vanilloids induce Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in these transfected cells (8Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established whether VR1 is a functional component of ER in sensory neurons, which would be mandatory for the classification of this protein as a Ca2+ release receptor in these cells. Considering the above, it is possible that functional diversity for VR1 might account for the large and sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) observed in DRG neurons subjected to long term, high vanilloid concentration exposure. It is well established that this treatment results in profound ultrastructural changes in DRG neurons (9Jancso G. Karcsu S. Kiraly E. Szebeni A. Toth L. Bacsy E. Joo F. Parducz A. Brain Res. 1984; 295: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Kiraly E. Jancso G. Hajos M.

Kiraly E. Jancso-Gabor A. Nature. 1977; 270: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), although there is scant evidence of a causal link between cell pathology and a vanilloid-induced sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i involving detrimental Ca2+release from the ER in these cells. To reconcile whether VR1 is functionally multifaceted in its regulation of [Ca2+]i, this study endeavored to determine whether VR1 might act as a SOCC and a Ca2+ release receptor in DRG neurons. Data obtained from Ca2+ imaging, confocal microscopy, and electrophysiological experiments suggest that ER-associated VR1 may be predominantly localized to a thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ store in DRG neurons, which can be readily depleted by capsaicin receptor binding, and that plasma membrane VR1 is activated by Ca2+ store depletion in DRG neurons and transfected HEK-293 cells. These data therefore present a case for plasma membrane VR1 functioning as a SOCC and ER-associated VR1 functioning as a Ca2+ release receptor in DRG neurons. DRG neurons were prepared from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) by methods similar to those described previously (13Gavazzi S. Geissler H.S. Bassler E.L. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Isolated ganglia were incubated with 2 ml of modified Bottenstein's culture medium (BSF-2) consisting of 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 1% N-2 supplement, and 0.125% collagenase XI in Ham's F12 basal medium at 37 °C for 2 h and were triturated with a glass pipette to homogeneity. Dissociated cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min through a cushion of Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS) containing 15% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The dispersed cells were resuspended in Ham's F-12 basal medium containing 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor 7 S, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 1% N-2 supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) containing 0 thickness, 22-mm-diameter coverslips (BDH Chemicals) coated previously with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 1–2 days prior to use. HEK-293 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK) as a frozen culture. Cells were thawed and then grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured every third day and grown to 80–90% confluence. Cells were detached from plates using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution and subsequently neutralized by addition of 10 volumes of the above culture medium. Stock cell preparations were stored in 10% glycerol in liquid nitrogen until required for experiments. Transfection of HEK-293 cells (grown in 35-mm Petri dishes to ∼80% confluence) was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. For each dish, 1 μg of VR1 plasmid (pcDNA3.1/rVR1, a generous gift from Dr. Xuenong Bo, Sheffield University, Sheffield, UK) together with 0.3 μg of pEGFP (Clontech) were mixed with diluted lipid reagent (4 μl in 100 μl of Optimem 1) for 15 min at 22 °C. Cells were incubated with the above complexes in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2, and after 5 h, the volume of medium was increased to 2 ml. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 1–4 days prior to use. DRG neurons were incubated with either 0.6 μmER-tracker blue-white dapoxyl (Molecular Probes Inc) or 0.1 μm of the carbocyanine ER probe DiOC5 in HBSS (pH 7.2) for 20 min at 22 °C. Coverslips containing DRG neurons were washed in 3 × 5 ml aliquots of HBSS for 10 min and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 min at 22 °C. Coverslips were washed in 3 × 5 ml aliquots of PBS for 10 min and were incubated with 10% donkey serum at 22 °C for 1 h to block nonspecific binding sites. Cells were incubated with guinea pig polyclonal antibody to VR1 (1:400, diluted in antibody buffer comprising of 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) for 2 h, washed in 3 × 5 ml aliquots of PBS for 10 min, and then incubated with TRITC (tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate)-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (1:400) for 1 h. Following three final washes with PBS for 10 min, cultures were mounted in PBS glycerol supplemented with DABCO (1,4-diazobicyclo-(2, 2, 2)-octane). Small sized DRG neurons (15–30-μm diameter) labeled with fluorescent probes for ER and VR1 (as above) were examined using an upright Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope system (LSM 510) and a ×40 Plan Neofluor oil objective. To study the distribution and localization of intracellular fluorescence, cells were scanned in multitracking mode (to avoid channel cross talk) for TRITC (Ex = 543 nm, Em = 580 nm) and either ER-tracker blue-white dapoxyl (Ex = 351 nm, Em = 460 nm) or DiOC5 (Ex = 488 nm, Em = 515 nm). Increments in the Z plane were 0.2 μm with confocal images being acquired throughout the central portion of cells. Capsaicin-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were assessed in the soma of small sized (15–30-μm diameter) rat DRG neurons cultured for 1–2 days by a similar method as described previously (14Willmott N.J. Wong K. Strong A.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with Ca2+ indicator by incubation with HBSS containing 2 μm of the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 for 2 h. Intracellular fluorescence was imaged at 22 °C in a nominally Ca2+-free Hanks' buffered salt solution with no added Ca2+ and containing 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 7.2). The equipment used included an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) with a ×40 Plan Fluor oil-immersion objective (1.3 NA), coupled to a xenon arc lamp/fast filter switching device (Sutter DG4: Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA), and 12-bit interline CCD (Sensicam, PCO Computer Optics, Kelheim, Germany), which were both interfaced to a Pentium III computer. A low temperature (22 °C) was used for Ca2+ imaging experiments as fura-2 readily compartmentalizes into cellular organelles at higher, physiological temperatures in these cell preparations. All cultures were maintained in a static, open chamber throughout experiments. Free cytosolic Ca2+ was quantified by taking the ratio of fluorescence intensities at excitation wavelengths 340 and 380 nm, using an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Pairs of 340- and 380-nm images were captured every 8.0 s, and ratio images were calculated using Axon Imaging Workbench 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Standard CaCl2 solutions were used to calibrate the system for measurements with fura-2, and viscosity corrections were made. For comparative pharmacological experiments, naive and drug-treated DRG neurons were imaged on the same day, using the same batch preparation of cells. Response parameters (Δ[Ca2+]i) were compared for statistical significance using Student's ttest for unpaired observations. Whole-cell voltage clamp recording was carried out at 22 °C using an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes were typically of 2–5 megaohms resistance when filled with solution containing 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). In some experiments, K+ was replaced by Cs+ at the same concentration in the pipette solution. Cell series resistance was compensated to 40–80%. The membrane was voltage-clamped at −70 mV. Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 1 kHz using WinWCP V3.08 software. The recording chamber was perfused continuously (by gravity) with extracellular bathing solution at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and contained 135 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Drugs were applied to small sized rat DRG neurons (15–30 μm diameter) or transfected HEK-293 cells focally (by gravity) via a large bore pipette with a tip diameter of 100 μm, positioned within 200 μm of the cell body. Sustained inward currents induced by 1 μmthapsigargin (Tg) were continuously recorded. Capsazepine (1 μm) was applied to Tg-pretreated cells shortly after inward currents induced by Tg reached a plateau. Capsaicin sensitivity was tested in DRG neurons and transfected HEK-293 cells by measuring inward currents elicited by the addition of 1 μmcapsaicin to cells. The amplitudes of inward currents were compared for statistical significance using Student's t test for unpaired observations. HBSS (pH 7.2) contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 0.83 mm MgSO4, 0.42 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mm glucose. For Ca2+ imaging experiments carried out in nominally Ca2+-free medium, CaCl2 was omitted from the above, and 0.5 mmEGTA was added, yielding a free Ca2+ concentration of ∼10 nm. PBS (pH 7.4) contained 0.01 m sodium phosphate and 0.14 m NaCl. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, Ham's F-12 basal medium, N-2 supplement, bovine serum albumin, penicillin, streptomycin, LipofectAMINE 2000, and Optimem 1 were from Invitrogen. Guinea pig polyclonal antibody to VR1 was from Neuromics Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). GFP plasmids (pEGFP) were from Clontech, and VR1 plasmids (pcDNA3.1/rVR1) were a generous gift from Dr. Xuenong Bo, Sheffield University. Fura-2 AM, DiOC5, and ER-tracker blue-white dapoxyl were from Molecular Probes Inc. Thapsigargin, ruthenium red, and xestospongins were from Calbiochem. All other drugs and reagents were from Sigma. The lipid soluble VR1 agonist capsaicin and the ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor Tg mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores of small sized DRG neurons (15–30 μm diameter) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1). From the examination of dose-response curves, it was evident that 1 μm of either of these agents induced a maximal Ca2+ release (Δ[Ca2+]i) in cells, using our static incubation protocol (Fig. 1). Moreover, second bolus applications of Tg or capsaicin resulted in no further Ca2+ release in cells (Fig. 2 a), suggesting that 1 μm capsaicin or Tg induced a maximal depletion of the respective Ca2+ stores, which were sensitive to these agents. Although Tg (1 μm) induced Ca2+mobilization in glial cells (which could be clearly discriminated from phase-bright DRG neurons in cultures), capsaicin (1 μm) failed to increase [Ca2+]i in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ in glia (data not shown), indicating that capsaicin-induced responses were sensory neuron-specific. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin induced Ca2+ mobilization in Tg- and capsaicin-pretreated DRG neurons, indicating the presence of a releasable pool of Ca2+, which was insensitive to these agents (Fig. 2 a), whereas pretreatment of cells with ionomycin resulted in an anticipated elimination of both Tg- and capsaicin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Fig. 2 b). The VR1 antagonist capsazepine (10 μm) induced a slow release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and abrogated the capsaicin-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i(Fig. 2 c), suggesting that capsaicin-induced Ca2+ release was dependent on capsaicin receptor binding and that capsazepine probably acts as a partial agonist for this receptor-mediated Ca2+ release. Capsaicin-induced Ca2+ release was unaffected by the phospholipase C inhibitor xestospongins (Fig. 2 d) indicating that intracellular inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate generation was not responsible for the observed Ca2+ mobilization.Figure 2Capsaicin-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores of small sized DRG neurons is reliant on capsaicin-receptor binding and not IP3 generation.Each trace in this figure is a population mean ± S.D. of the [Ca2+]i of at least 10 cells from a single coverslip, which demonstrated Ca2+ mobilization in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and all traces are representative of at least three separate experiments. As shown ina, 1 μm capsaicin or 1 μm Tg induced a maximal depletion of the respective Ca2+ stores that were sensitive to these agents with second applications of Tg or capsaicin eliciting no further Ca2+ release. Ionomycin released Ca2+ from remaining stores, indicating the presence of a releasable pool of Ca2+ that was insensitive to capsaicin or Tg. As shown in b, both Tg- and capsaicin-sensitive Ca2+ stores of DRG neurons were depleted by ionomycin. As shown in c, addition of 10 μm capsazepine to the bath resulted in a slow release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the abrogation of the capsaicin-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i. As shown in d, capsaicin-induced Ca2+ release was unaffected by the phospholipase C inhibitor xestospongins (10 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Confocal microscopy revealed heterogeneous staining patterns for the TRITC-based VR1 probe in small sized DRG neurons. Although 74% of cells (31 out of 42 cells analyzed) demonstrated varying levels of plasma membrane and intracellular staining, the remainder did not stain significantly with the VR1 probe, suggesting negligible VR1 expression in these (Fig. 3 a). Evidence that intracellular VR1 is associated with the ER in a large proportion of small sized DRG neurons was derived from double-labeling experiments. In Fig. 3, b and c, the far right images are overlays of the left andmiddle images and highlight colocalization for ER and VR1 probes (yellow) to the same intracellular organelles in small sized DRG neurons. Approximately 70% of small sized cells (20 out of 28 cells analyzed) demonstrated similar intracellular colocalization for ER and VR1 as the cells of Fig. 3, b andc. In the remainder, intracellular VR1 staining was negligible, consistent with the single probe experiments of Fig. 3 a. A further examination of Tg- and capsaicin-sensitive Ca2+stores revealed that only a subset of these pharmacologically overlap in small sized DRG neurons (Fig. 4). Mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores was assessed by measuring the mean maximum change in [Ca2+]i(Δ[Ca2+]i) in response to a sequential challenge of Tg, capsaicin, and ionomycin (Fig. 4 a) or capsaicin, Tg, and ionomycin (Fig. 4 c). From these experiments, four pharmacologically distinct Ca2+ stores were identified in small sized cells. These included capsaicin-sensitive/Tg-insensitive (Fig. 4 a,middle response of the trace), Tg-sensitive/capsaicin-insensitive (Fig. 4 c,middle response of the trace), capsaicin-insensitive/Tg-insensitive/ionomycin-sensitive (Fig. 4,a and c, final responses of thetraces), and capsaicin-sensitive/Tg-sensitive (inferred from Fig. 4 e) Ca2+ stores. Although nearly all (>95%) small sized DRG neurons analyzed possessed a Tg-sensitive or a Tg-sensitive/capsaicin-insensitive store, only 74 and 65% of cells possessed a capsaicin-sensitive or a capsaicin-sensitive/Tg-insensitive Ca2+ store, respectively (Fig. 4 d). It is therefore notable that a similar proportion of small sized DRG neurons possessed capsaicin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (74%) as the proportion of cells that demonstrated significant VR1/ER colocalization (70%). From the experiments of Fig. 4 b, considerable heterogeneity was noted in the size of intrinsic Tg-sensitive and capsaicin-sensitive/Tg-insensitive Ca2+ stores in small sized cells (Fig. 4 b). Of the 65% of cells that possessed a capsaicin-sensitive/Tg-insensitive store, this store was apparently larger than an intrinsic Tg-sensitive Ca2+ store in 37% of cells (23 out of 62) and smaller in the remainder. For cells that possessed both capsaicin- and Tg-sensitive Ca2+ stores, the main part of these stores were Tg- and capsaicin-insensitive (Fig. 4 e), respectively. Although all small sized DRG neurons (n = 128) possessed a capsaicin-insensitive/Tg-insensitive/ionomycin-sensitive Ca2+ store, the amount of Ca2+ associated with this store appeared to be small (Fig. 4, a and c) as compared with the total ionomycin-releasable Ca2+ pool (Fig. 2 b). Δ[Ca2+]i associated with release from the former (25 ± 16 (128) nm; mean ± S.D. (n)) was only 9% of that associated with release from the latter (277 ± 92 (38) nm; mean ± S.D. (n)), indicating that nearly all sequestered intracellular Ca2+ was mobilized by a sequential treatment of cells with 1 μm Tg followed by 1 μm capsaicin (orvice versa). Although certain members of the TRP channel superfamily have been shown to be activated by Ca2+ store depletion, it remains controversial whether VR1 has an innate capacity to function as a SOCC. To determine whether VR1 might be regulated by the state of filling of intracellular Ca2+ stores, the effect of the VR1 antagonists ruthenium red (RR) and capsazepine (CPZ) on store depletion-activated Ca2+ influx and the effect of CPZ on store depletion-activated inward currents were assessed in small sized DRG neurons. Fura-2-loaded cells were transferred to a nominally Ca2+-free extracellular medium and were challenged with a bolus of Tg (1 μm) to deplete Ca2+ stores and activate store-operated Ca2+ influx (15Lupu-Meiri M.

The latter was assessed by measuring the maximum change in [Ca2+]i (Δ[Ca2+]i) on introducing 1.8 mm Ca2+ back into the static incubation bath in untreated control cells and cells pretreated with either 10 μm RR (Fig. 5,a–c) or 10 μm CPZ (Fig. 5, d ande). In these experiments, we found that a new steady-state level of [Ca2+]i was attained after ∼1000 s in the presence of 1 μm Tg, which was the minimal concentration required for maximal Ca2+ release from the dose-response curve of Fig. 1 b. In RR-treated cells, Δ[Ca2+]i associated with Ca2+introduction was significantly reduced, and cytosolic Ca2+oscillations were observed in all cells analyzed (n = 35) as compared with untreated control cells (n = 39), which displayed no oscillation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5, a–c). A similar reduction in Δ[Ca2+]i was observed in CPZ-treated DRG neurons as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 5, d ande), although unlike RR-treated cells, cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations were not apparent in any CPZ-treated cell (n = 67) following the introduction of Ca2+. The effect of CPZ on store depletion-activated inward currents induced by Tg was also assessed in capsaicin-sensitive small sized DRG neurons in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (10 mm). From previous work, it was found that an extracellular Ca2+concentration of 10 mm was required for a maximal store depletion-mediated inward current in rat basophilic leukemia cells (18Fierro L. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 2000; 522.2: 247-257Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to use this concentration of Ca2+ in our bathing medium to permit the easy detection of store depletion-mediated inward currents in subsequent electrophysiology experiments. No detectable currents were elicited in the absence of Tg (1 μm) when intracellular [Ca2+]i was buffered by 5 mm EGTA in the patch pipette. Three types of current traces were observed in the 58 cells analyzed in the presence of Tg (Fig. 6, a–c). A small, sustained inward current that was maintained throughout the period of Tg exposure was observed in 17 out of 58 cells (Fig. 6 a). About the same number of neurons (31%) failed to produce a detectable current in the presence of Tg (Fig. 6 c). In contrast, a larger outward current preceded by a small inward current was recorded in 23 out of the 58 cells (Fig. 6 b). Outward currents were abolished when Cs+ was substituted for K+ in the patch pipette. Therefore, the large Tg-induced outward conductance might be mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ channels following an increase in [Ca2+]i. To abolish the outward current induced by Tg, we replaced K+ with Cs+ in the patch pipette. Under these conditions, CPZ (10 μm) significantly reduced the Tg-induced inward current in all DRG cells tested (Fig. 6, d and e), in line with its effect on store depletion-activated Ca2+ influx in these cells (Fig. 5, d ande).

The synthesis concerns TMP analogues modified at the 5-position of the thymine ring as well as a novel compound with a six-membered sugar ring. The binding properties of the analogues are compared with the known inhibitor azido-TMP, which is postulated here to work by excluding the TMP-bound Mg2+ ion.

Looking for a role for Ser99, we have identified an unusual catalytic triad, or a proton wire, made of strictly conserved residues (including Glu6, Ser99, Arg95, and Asp9) that probably serves to protonate the transferred PO3 group.

The incidence of tuberculosis has been increasing during the last 20 years; it is now the first cause of mortality among infectious diseases in the world (1Stokstad E. Science. 2000; 287: 2391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The combination of four active drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin) is currently used in Mycobacterium tuberculosis treatment, but this has led to the appearance of resistant bacterial strains (2Cole S.T. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 411-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These resistant strains are alarming for two reasons. First, as there are only a few effective drugs available, infection with drug-resistant strains could give rise to a potentially untreatable form of the disease. Second, although only 5% of immunocompetent people infected with M. tuberculosis succumb to the disease, it is nevertheless highly contagious (3Tsuyuguchi I. Tuberculosis. 2001; 81: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, a large effort is necessary to identify potential new targets and inhibitors.

In the case of the herpes simplex virus (HSV), the most successful antiviral drug (acyclovir) available on the market is directed against thymidine kinase. Acyclovir is phosphorylated by several viral or host kinases into acyclovir triphosphate, which terminates DNA synthesis when incorporated into the viral DNA (5Dabry G.K. Antiviral Chem.

A similar approach might lead to potent antituberculosis agents. TMPK from M. tuberculosis is a homodimer with 214 amino acids per monomer (13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The x-ray three-dimensional structure has been recently solved at 1.95-Å resolution (14Li de la Sierra I.

Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Delarue M. J. Mol.

The global folding of the protein is similar to that of the others TMPKs and NMP kinases despite the low similarity of their amino acid sequences. The TMP kinase backbone is characterized by nine solvent-exposed α-helices surrounding a central β-sheet made of five β-strands, typical of the so-called Rossmann-fold (16Ostermann N. Lavie A.

Biol. 1997; 4: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the dimerization mode of the M. tuberculosis enzyme differs from that reported in the yeast, human, and Escherichia coli enzymes (15Li de la Sierra I. Munier-Lehmann H. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Delarue M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The active site of M. tuberculosis TMP kinase complexed with TMP differs from the other known TMPKs in the following ways (15Li de la Sierra I. Munier-Lehmann H. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Delarue M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is in a fully closed conformation with the ATP binding site being already preformed and the LID region well ordered into a α-helical conformation even though the second substrate ATP (or non-hydrolyzable ATP) is absent from the structure. In the TMP binding site, the protein-TMP interaction shows three specific features when compared with yeast, human, or E. coli enzyme structures. The first feature involves both a magnesium ion and Tyr39; they interact with two opposite non-bridging oxygens of the phosphate moiety of TMP. The second feature involves Asn100 in contact with atom N-3 of the base moiety (15Li de la Sierra I. Munier-Lehmann H. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Delarue M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The third feature, perhaps more amenable to the design of new inhibitors, is the interaction of the 3′-OH atom of TMP with both the side chain of Asp9 and a water molecule, W9, which is a ligand of the Mg2+ ion. In addition, there is a high concentration of positively charged side chains both from the LID region and from the P-loop with arginine residues 14, 95, 149, and 160 as well as Lys13 (15Li de la Sierra I. Munier-Lehmann H. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Delarue M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Examination of the structure therefore suggested the following targets for species-specific inhibitors. In target 1, the 3′-OH and 2′-OH groups of the ribose ring could be systematically replaced with different chemical groups; this has been recently reported (21Vanheusden V. Munier-Lehmann H. Pochet S. Herdewijn P. Van Calenbergh S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 2695-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In target 2, the 5-position of the thymine ring is another possibility that has also been considered in the past for HSV thymidine kinase inhibitors (e.g. Refs. 11Manallack D. Pitt W.R. Herdewijn P. Balzarini J. De Clercq E. Sanderson M.R. Sohi M. Wien F. Munier-Lehmann H. Haouz A. Delarue M. J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem. 2002; 17: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar and 12de Winter H. Herdewijn P. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Preliminary results of compounds modified at this position have already been reported (13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we report results on other compounds with the aim of adding an extra hydrogen bond with water molecule W12 detected in the three-dimensional structure. W12 is located close to Pro37 (which is in a cis conformation) and forms hydrogen bonds with residues building up the thymidine binding cavity, such as Phe70, Asp73, and Arg74. In target 3, the 2-position of the thymine ring could also be explored, and preliminary but encouraging results have been reported for one compound modified at this position (13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The aim here is to replace the inserted (space-filling) water molecules W2 and W3 that, if removed, give rise to a well defined cavity that can be readily materialized with computer programs such as VOIDOO (22Kleywegt G. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In this study we have synthesized five TMP analogues (1–5, Fig. 1), modified at the thymine moiety and focused on target 2. In addition, one member of a new class of nucleotide analogues has been tested (23Ostrowski T. Wroblowski R. Busson R. Rozenski J. De Clercq E. Bennett M.S. Champness J.N. Summers W.C. Sanderson M.R. Herdewijn P. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4343-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Vastmans K. Froeyen M. Kerremans L. Pochet S. Herdewijn P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3154-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), namely a 1,5-anhydrohexitol analogue (6) of TMP, where the 3′-OH and/or the 5′-O-phosphate positions are expected to depend on the sugar conformation. The inhibitory effect of these TMP analogues has been measured in vitro by a novel direct specific enzymatic activity test using HPLC and compared with the reference compound AZTMP, which is a good inhibitor (13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All compounds have been subjected to co-crystallization experiments as well as soaking experiments for exchange with TMP in TMP-TMPK crystals (M. tuberculosis TMPK does not crystallize in the absence of TMP). We solved the structure of one promising enzyme-inhibitor complex by x-ray diffraction and have determined the rearrangement of side chains in the active site and the concomitant modification of the water molecule network around the thymine moiety of the TMP substrate. In addition, we have co-crystallized and solved the structure of the complex between TMP kinase and the bisubstrate analogue Ap5T. Altogether, considerable new insight into the possible mechanism of phosphoryl transfer has been gained as described at the end of the “Discussion.” The M. tuberculosis (Mtub) TMP kinase was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The protein was stored at −20 °C in aliquots of 100 μl at 4 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, conditions at which it is stable over several months. Ap5T was purchased from Jena Bioscience (Germany). All other reagents used were purchased from Sigma, including the reference inhibitor AZTMP. All solutions were made with pyrolyzed water. Several methods have already been reported for the synthesis of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine. We found that hydroxymethylation of 2′-deoxyuridine with formaldehyde under acidic (25Cline R.E. Fink R.M. Fink K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 2521-2525Google Scholar) or basic (26Scheit K.H. Chem. Ber. 1966; 99: 3884-3891Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) catalysis gave only low yields. Therefore, we decided to couple 5-benzyloxymethyluracil with an appropriate sugar. In Ref. 27Tona R. Bertolini R. Hunziker J. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 1693-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, the base is coupled with 1,2,3,5-tetracetylribose. Since this method requires subsequent 2′-deoxygenation, we chose to glycosylate the silylated base with 2-deoxy-3,5-O-di-(toluoyl)-α-d-erythro-pentafuranosylchloride (28Gupta V.S. Bubbar G.L. Can. J. Chem. 1971; 49: 719-722Crossref Google Scholar). Unfortunately racemization of the sugar prior to coupling led to a hardly separable mixture of the α- and β-anomers of the protected nucleoside. After alkaline removal of the acyl groups, however, the anomeric mixture could be separated via column chromatography to give the α- and β-anomers 10 and 11 as white foams. Both isomers were then phosphorylated. We noticed that the 5-O-benzyl group got partly removed during this step. Thus phosphorylation of the β-nucleoside gave three compounds: 2′-deoxy-5-hydroxymethyl-5′-O-phosphoryluridine (1), its benzyl-protected analogue (2), and 2′-deoxy-5-hydroxymethyluridine (12). Phosphorylation of the α-nucleoside gave the corresponding benzylated and non-benzylated nucleotides 13 and 3 (Scheme 1). 2′-Deoxy-5-(2-furyl)uridine (15) and 2′-deoxy-5-(thien-2-yl)uridine (16) were synthesized according to a published procedure from unprotected 2′-deoxy-5-iodouridine (14) (29Wigerinck P. Pannecouque C. Snoeck R. Claes P. De Clercq E. Herdewijn P. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2383-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these two nucleosides yielded the two desired 5-heteroaryl-substituted nucleotides 4 and 5 (Scheme 2). NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian Mercury 300 or 500 spectrometer using the solvent signal of Me2SO-d 6 as a secondary reference. All signals assigned to amino and hydroxyl groups were exchangeable with D2O. Mass spectra and exact mass measurements were performed on a quadrupole/orthogonal-acceleration time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (qTof 2, Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a standard electrospray ionization interface. Samples were infused in a 2-propanol:water (1:1) mixture at 3 μl/min. If necessary, nucleoside 5-O-monophosphates were ultimately purified using a Gilson HPLC system with a Gilson 322 pump, a UV/VIS-156 detector on a C18 column (10 μm, Altech, Altima, 250 × 22 mm). Precoated Merck silica gel F254plates were used for TLC, and spots were examined with UV light at 254 nm and sulfuric acid-anisaldehyde spray or phosphomolybdic acid (0.5% in EtOH) solution. Column chromatography was performed on Uetikon 560 silica (0.2–0.06 mm) and Amersham Biosciences DEAE-SephadexTM A-25. The 1H (and 31P, if appropriate) NMR spectra allowed the characterization of all purified intermediates in the synthesis and final products and are available from the authors upon request. In all instances, mass spectra were found to give the calculated mass within experimental error. 5-Benzyloxymethyluracil (680 mg, 2.93 mmol) was suspended in a mixture of hexamethyldisilazane (62 ml), trimethylsilyl chloride (0.5 ml, 3.94 mmol), and pyridine (5 ml). The mixture was refluxed overnight. The resulting solution was evaporated and co-evaporated with toluene. The obtained residue was suspended in anhydrous CH3CN (3.5 ml), and 2-deoxy-3,5-O-di-(toluoyl)-α-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl chloride (1 g, 2.58 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. CH2Cl2 (25 ml) was added, and the organic layer was washed with a 7% solution of NaHCO3 (25 ml). The water layer was washed twice with CH2Cl2 (25 ml). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica, CH2Cl2:MeOH 98:2) to give a mixture of α- and β-anomers (0.932 g, 62%). The anomers were partly separated by a combination of precipitation (ether:MeOH 13:8) and column chromatography (silica, CH2Cl2:MeOH 100:0 → 99:1 → 98:2). The two mixtures, enriched in either anomer, were used without further purification in the next step. A mixture of 8 and 9 (932 mg, 1.70 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (60 ml), and 2 n NaOH (37 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min and evaporated. The obtained residue was dissolved in 5 ml of H2O and neutralized with HCl. The precipitate was filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated and co-evaporated with EtOH. The obtained residue was purified by column chromatography (silica, CH2Cl2:MeOH 93:7) to give 10 (261 mg, 44%) and 11 (284 mg, 48%) as white foams. A solution of 10 (261 mg, 0.75 mmol) in trimethyl phosphate (3.5 ml) was cooled to 0 °C, POCl3 (0.22 ml, 2.4 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred for 4 h at 0 °C. The mixture was poured into crushed ice-water (20 ml), neutralized with concentrated NH4OH, and evaporated to dryness. The residue was subjected to column chromatography (silica, iPrOH:NH4OH:H2O 77.5:15:2.5 → 60:30:5) yielding 12 (38.7 mg, 20%) as a white foam as well as an oily mixture of 1 and 2. This mixture was further purified by HPLC (C18, CH3CN:MeOH:0.05% HCOOH in H2O 45:45:10, 3 ml/min), and the fractions containing the nucleotides were lyophilized yielding 2 (47 mg, 14%) and1 (109 mg, 41%) as white powders. A solution of 11 (248 mg, 0.71 mmol) in trimethyl phosphate (3.5 ml) was cooled to 0 °C, POCl3 (0.21 ml, 2.3 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred for 4 h at 0 °C. The mixture was poured into crushed ice-water (20 ml), neutralized with NH4OH, and evaporated to dryness. 3 and 13 were separated by column chromatography (silica, iPrOH:NH4OH:H2O 77.5:15:2.5 → 60:30:5). Further purification was accomplished by HPLC (C18, CH3CN:MeOH:0.05% HCOOH in H2O 45:45:10, 3 ml/min). The fractions containing the principal nucleotides were lyophilized yielding 3 (106 mg, 42%) and 13(47 mg, 15%) as white powders. A solution of 15 (382 mg, 1.22 mmol) in trimethyl phosphate (5.8 ml) was cooled to 0 °C. POCl3 (0.4 ml, 4.29 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred for 4 h at 0 °C. It was poured into crushed ice-water (40 ml), neutralized with NH4OH, and evaporated to dryness. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography (silica, iPrOH:NH4OH:H2O 77.5:15:2.5 → 60:30:5). The obtained white powder was further purified on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (triethylammoniumbicarbonate 0 → 0.5m) yielding the triethylammonium salt of 4. This was converted to its corresponding sodium salt (NaI, acetone) (248 mg, 51%) as a white powder. A solution of 16 (320 mg, 1.03 mmol) in trimethyl phosphate (4.6 ml) was cooled to 0 °C, POCl3 (0.31 ml, 3.3 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred for 4 h at 0 °C. The mixture was poured into crushed ice-water (20 ml), neutralized with 28% ammonia, and evaporated to dryness. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography (silica, iPrOH:NH4OH:H2O 77.5:15:2.5 → 60:30:5). The obtained white powder was further purified on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (triethylammonium bicarbonate 0 → 0.5m) yielding the triethylammonium salt of 5. This was converted to its corresponding sodium salt (NaI, acetone) (240 mg, 57%) as a white powder. The TMP kinase activity was measured by HPLC separation of nucleotide substrates and products as described below. The major reason for using this test instead of the more rapid coupled spectrophotometric assay (30Blondin C. Serina L. Wiesmuller L. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) is that some inhibitors absorb light at 340 nm (4 and 5), thereby rendering difficult the evaluation of NADH concentration in the coupled reaction. Also, coupled enzymatic tests might be error-prone in the determination of the true value of K i and K m of inhibitors and substrate, respectively, through the recycling of some substrate or product during the reaction coupling (31Haouz A. Geleso-Meyer A. Burstein C. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1994; 16: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reaction is carried out in a 1-ml final volume of a solution of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol using different initial concentrations of ATP and TMP in the presence or absence of various inhibitors. To follow the enzymatic kinetics an aliquot of 100 μl is taken at different times after enzyme addition, and the reaction is quenched by adding 900 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7. The concentration of each nucleotide at different times during the reaction is measured at 260 nm by HPLC (isocratic mode) using a SephasilTM C18, 5-μm SC 2.1/10 (Amersham Biosciences) column. The buffer used for elution is 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 2.5% (v/v) ethanol, 40 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide with a flow rate of 250 μl/min. All the reaction velocities are calculated by monitoring the production of TDP expressed in terms of optical absorbance per minute at 260 nm. It was checked that all four sources of information (appearance of TDP or ADP, disappearance of ATP or TMP) can be used and lead to the same results (see also Ref. 11Manallack D. Pitt W.R. Herdewijn P. Balzarini J. De Clercq E. Sanderson M.R. Sohi M. Wien F. Munier-Lehmann H. Haouz A. Delarue M. J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem. 2002; 17: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Co-crystals of M. tuberculosis TMPK in complex with compound 1 (see Fig. 1) were obtained as described for crystals with the TMP substrate (14Li de la Sierra I. Munier-Lehmann H. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Delarue M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly a 6-μl drop of a 1:1 mixture of the protein solution (3.5 mg/ml) incubated overnight with 5 mm analogue 1 and the reservoir solution was equilibrated with 34% (w/v) ammonium sulfate solution, 100 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, containing 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Crystals grew in 1–3 weeks to bipyramids of 400 × 200 × 200 μm3. X-ray data were collected from cryo-cooled crystals using 25% (w/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. Soaking experiments were performed by first transferring TMP-TMPK co-crystals to a stabilizing solution containing 70% ammonium sulfate and 1 mm TMP and then to a fresh solution containing 70% ammonium sulfate and 10 mm inhibitor (but no TMP). This last solution was replaced three times, each soaking time lasting 24 h. Diffraction data were processed using the DENZO/SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) package. The CCP4 package (33CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) was used to calculate structure factors from the observed intensities (TRUNCATE). Reflections in the resolution ranges 2.28–2.22 and 2.70–2.64 Å had to be suppressed due to the presence of ice rings during data collection for the 1-TMPK complex. Refinement was performed up to 2.0-Å resolution with CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Standards protocols, including maximum likelihood target, bulk solvent correction, and isotropic B-factors, were used (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), and progress in the model refinement was evaluated by the decrease in the free R-factor. Manual rebuilding in the electron density maps was done with O (37Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). Stereochemistry of the final model was assessed using PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 21: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Coordinates of the1-TMPKMtub binary complex have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RSCB) Protein Data Bank (accession code 1MRS). Similar structural details apply to the Ap5T-TMPK complex where all the dictionaries necessary for O and CNS come from the data base of G. Kleywegt. 2HIC-Up, available at alpha2.bmc.uu.se/hicup/t5a. The coordinates have been deposited in the RSCB Protein Data Bank (accession code1MRN). In all experiments, the enzyme concentration was set to a value at least 200 times lower than the substrates concentrations, i.e.typically 5 × 10−8m. The reaction catalyzed by TMP kinase was found to follow the Michaelis model (39Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience Publications, John Wiley, New York1993Google Scholar). The initial velocity of the reaction at different fixed (saturating) concentrations of ATP and different concentrations of TMP allows for the determination of the apparent K m for TMP and for ATP. With this protocol we find an apparentK m = 40 μm TMP. For ATP, we measuredK m = 100 μm. Both values compare well with the values obtained with the coupled assay (13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). TheK m of 40 μm for TMP has been measured at the fixed concentration of ATP of 0.5 mm and shows some dependence upon ATP concentration. The K m value of TMP extrapolated at zero ATP concentration is 4–5 μm in agreement with results reported earlier (13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The role of ATP as the phosphoryl donor has been explored in Ref. 13Munier-Lehmann H. Chaffotte A. Pochet S. Labesse G.

Ubiquitylation is the process of attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein and is a multistep process that involves the action of at least three classes of enzyme: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1),1 a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3), which assists in substrate recognition and the transfer of ubiquitin to the target protein. There are two main types of E3 enzyme, those that contain a homology to E6 Cterminus (HECT) domain and those that have areally interesting newgene (RING finger or RING finger-like) domain (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar). The plant homeobox domain (PHD) is a RING finger-like domain defined by a series of cysteine and histidine residues with a characteristic spacing that mediates coordination of two zinc ions in a cross-brace structure (2Pascual J.

Recently, ubiquitylation of specific proteins has been shown to have functions independent of proteasome-mediated degradation (6Marx J.

For example, vesicular sorting and TRAF6 organization of the TAK1 signal transduction complex has been shown to involve ubiquitylation of proteins for the control of protein-protein interactions (7Katzmann D.J.

MEKK1 is a complex protein containing multiple identified domains that may serve to regulate function. The E3 activity of the PHD of MEKK1 was recently described by Lu et al.(13Lu Z., Xu, S.

Here we demonstrate that full-length MEKK1 requires an intact PHD for its own ubiquitylation, and this ubiquitylation impairs its ability to phosphorylate MKK1 and MKK4.DISCUSSIONMEKK1 is unique among MAPK kinase kinases in that it encodes a PHD in its NH2 terminus. The MEKK1 PHD has E3 ligase activity (13Lu Z., Xu, S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that is dependent on the kinase activity of the full-length 196-kDa MEKK1 protein. Lu et al. (13Lu Z., Xu, S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a GST fusion of the MEKK1 PHD had E3 ligase activity in vitro. Our work demonstrates that a functional PHD is required for MEKK1 poly/multiubiquitylation. Thus, activation of MEKK1 not only stimulates its ability to phosphorylate and activate MKK1 and MKK4 in the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways but also leads to the ubiquitylation of MEKK1 itself. This ubiquitylation consequently inhibits MEKK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of MKK1 and MKK4, thereby down-regulating the MEKK1 activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways. The inhibition of MEKK1 phosphorylation activity is independent of proteasome-dependent degradation of MEKK1. In fact, ubiquitylated MEKK1 seems to be a stable protein in cells. Although it is difficult to quantitate because of the poly/multiubiquitylation of MEKK1 and the consequent laddering in SDS-PAGE, it appears that ubiquitylated MEKK1 actually accumulates in cells and is not degraded significantly by the proteasome. We propose that the ubiquitylation-dependent uncoupling of MEKK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of MKK1 and MKK4 represents a novel function for protein ubiquitylation.It appears that the C441A MEKK1 protein has greater activity toward MKK1 and MKK4 than wild type MEKK1, based on the relative protein levels in the immunoprecipitations. This is consistent with the PHD having a negative regulatory function that correlates with its E3 ligase activity. Certainly, other proteins that interact with MEKK1 may be ubiquitylated by the PHD E3 ligase activity of MEKK1. The E3 ligase function of MEKK1 is likely to down-regulate MEKK1 activation of ERK1/2 and JNK and also ubiquitylate other proteins to regulate their function and/or targeting to the proteasome for degradation.How could MEKK1 ubiquitylation inhibit MKK1 and MKK4 phosphorylation? The ubiquitin modification of MEKK1 may simply block binding of MKK1 and MKK4. Adjacent to the COOH-terminal kinase domain are two UIMs that could interact with ubiquitins covalently bound to MEKK1 and induce a steric hindrance for substrate interaction. The fact that a full-length 196-kDa MEKK1 is required for MEKK1 ubiquitylation suggests that an intramolecular interaction is required for regulation of the MEKK1 E3 ligase activity. It should be noted that our studies were done using transfection. We must still define the role of ubiquitylation of endogenous MEKK1 in cells.The rapidly expanding functions for ubiquitin modification of proteins indicates that ubiquitin is used to regulate protein targeting, scaffolding, and activity. In regards to positive regulation of signal transduction, the polyubiquitylation of TRAF6 is involved in the organization of p38 and NFκB signaling complexes (8Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L.

It has also been shown in yeast that pheromone activation of the mating pathway involving the MAPK, Fus3, stimulates a feedback ubiquitylation and degradation of Ste11, a MAPK kinase kinase (23Esch R.K. Errede B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9160-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the PHD of MEKK1 is required for inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK activation by MEKK1. The C441A MEKK1 mutant protein stimulates the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways, and this activation is not down-regulated as is seen with wild type MEKK1, showing the requirement of the PHD of MEKK1 for ubiquitin-dependent inhibition of MEKK1 substrate phosphorylation. The regulation of Ste11 and MEKK1, both MAPK kinase kinases, by ubiquitylation appears different. Ste11 is degraded and MEKK1 substrate phosphorylation is inhibited when each is modified with ubiquitin. The function of the MEKK1 PHD is a previously unrecognized mechanism for controlling the activity of a MAPK kinase kinase and the turn-off of MAPK signaling in cells.

It should be noted that our studies were done using transfection. We must still define the role of ubiquitylation of endogenous MEKK1 in cells.The rapidly expanding functions for ubiquitin modification of proteins indicates that ubiquitin is used to regulate protein targeting, scaffolding, and activity. In regards to positive regulation of signal transduction, the polyubiquitylation of TRAF6 is involved in the organization of p38 and NFκB signaling complexes (8Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L.

It has also been shown in yeast that pheromone activation of the mating pathway involving the MAPK, Fus3, stimulates a feedback ubiquitylation and degradation of Ste11, a MAPK kinase kinase (23Esch R.K. Errede B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9160-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the PHD of MEKK1 is required for inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK activation by MEKK1. The C441A MEKK1 mutant protein stimulates the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways, and this activation is not down-regulated as is seen with wild type MEKK1, showing the requirement of the PHD of MEKK1 for ubiquitin-dependent inhibition of MEKK1 substrate phosphorylation. The regulation of Ste11 and MEKK1, both MAPK kinase kinases, by ubiquitylation appears different. Ste11 is degraded and MEKK1 substrate phosphorylation is inhibited when each is modified with ubiquitin. The function of the MEKK1 PHD is a previously unrecognized mechanism for controlling the activity of a MAPK kinase kinase and the turn-off of MAPK signaling in cells. MEKK1 is unique among MAPK kinase kinases in that it encodes a PHD in its NH2 terminus. The MEKK1 PHD has E3 ligase activity (13Lu Z., Xu, S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that is dependent on the kinase activity of the full-length 196-kDa MEKK1 protein. Lu et al. (13Lu Z., Xu, S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a GST fusion of the MEKK1 PHD had E3 ligase activity in vitro. Our work demonstrates that a functional PHD is required for MEKK1 poly/multiubiquitylation. Thus, activation of MEKK1 not only stimulates its ability to phosphorylate and activate MKK1 and MKK4 in the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways but also leads to the ubiquitylation of MEKK1 itself. This ubiquitylation consequently inhibits MEKK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of MKK1 and MKK4, thereby down-regulating the MEKK1 activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways. The inhibition of MEKK1 phosphorylation activity is independent of proteasome-dependent degradation of MEKK1. In fact, ubiquitylated MEKK1 seems to be a stable protein in cells. Although it is difficult to quantitate because of the poly/multiubiquitylation of MEKK1 and the consequent laddering in SDS-PAGE, it appears that ubiquitylated MEKK1 actually accumulates in cells and is not degraded significantly by the proteasome. We propose that the ubiquitylation-dependent uncoupling of MEKK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of MKK1 and MKK4 represents a novel function for protein ubiquitylation. It appears that the C441A MEKK1 protein has greater activity toward MKK1 and MKK4 than wild type MEKK1, based on the relative protein levels in the immunoprecipitations. This is consistent with the PHD having a negative regulatory function that correlates with its E3 ligase activity. Certainly, other proteins that interact with MEKK1 may be ubiquitylated by the PHD E3 ligase activity of MEKK1. The E3 ligase function of MEKK1 is likely to down-regulate MEKK1 activation of ERK1/2 and JNK and also ubiquitylate other proteins to regulate their function and/or targeting to the proteasome for degradation. How could MEKK1 ubiquitylation inhibit MKK1 and MKK4 phosphorylation? The ubiquitin modification of MEKK1 may simply block binding of MKK1 and MKK4. Adjacent to the COOH-terminal kinase domain are two UIMs that could interact with ubiquitins covalently bound to MEKK1 and induce a steric hindrance for substrate interaction. The fact that a full-length 196-kDa MEKK1 is required for MEKK1 ubiquitylation suggests that an intramolecular interaction is required for regulation of the MEKK1 E3 ligase activity.

EMILIN-1 is an adhesive extracellular matrix constituent associated with elastic fibers, detected also in the proximity of cell surfaces. To localize the cell attachment site(s), monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against EMILIN-1 or the gC1q-1 domain were used to inhibit cell attachment to EMILIN-1. Thus, one mAb mapping to the gC1q-1 domain caused complete inhibition of cell attachment. EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1 displayed a comparable dose-dependent ability to promote cell adhesion. Adhesion kinetics was similar to that of fibronectin (FN), reaching the maximum level of attachment at 20 min, but in the absence of cations adhesion was negligible. The relative adhesion strength to detach 50% of the cells was similar for EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1 (250–270 ×g) but lower than that for FN (≫500). Cell adhesion to EMILIN-1 or gC1q-1 was completely blocked by a function-blocking β1 integrin subunit mAb. In contrast, adhesion to the complement C1q component was totally unaffected. Among the various function-blocking mAbs against the α integrin subunits only the anti-α4 fully abrogated cell adhesion to gC1q-1 and up to 70% to EMILIN-1. Furthermore, only K562 cells transfected with the α4 integrin chain, but not wild type K562, were able to adhere to EMILIN-1 and were specifically inhibited by anti-α4 function-blocking mAb. Finally, cells attached to EMILIN-1 or gC1q-1, compared with cells plated on FN or vitronectin, which appeared well spread out on the substrate with prominent stress fibers and focal contacts, were much smaller with wide ruffles and a different organization status of the actin cytoskeleton along the cell periphery.

EMILIN-1 is composed of a cysteine-rich domain (EMI domain) at the N terminus (6Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Colombatti A. Volpin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13262-13267Google Scholar), a long segment of about 650 residues with a high potential for forming coiled-coil helices, a short uninterrupted collagenous stalk, and a C1q-like globular domain at the C terminus (gC1q-l), representing a structurally unique component. The gC1q-1 domain is necessary for the noncovalent formation of homotrimers that are then linked by disulfide bonds giving rise to very large extracellular aggregates (7Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17534-17540Google Scholar). EMILINs are members of the large C1q/tumor necrosis factor superfamily of proteins that are characterized by the presence of a gC1q domain; the superfamily (1Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Google Scholar) includes several collagens among which types VIII and X, the recognition component of the classical complement pathway C1q-C′, and AdipoQ. Elastic fibers and associated fibrillin-containing microfibrils (8Colombatti A. Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 18-26Google Scholar) are important structural components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of most connective tissues. EMILIN-1 forms a fibrillar network in vitro and in the ECM of several tissues including blood vessels, skin, heart, lung, kidney, and cornea (9Colombatti A. Bressan G.M. Volpin D. Castellani I. Collagen Relat. Res. 1985; 5: 181-191Google Scholar, 10Colombatti A. Poletti A. Bressan G.M. Carbone A. Volpin D. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 259-275Google Scholar, 11Doliana R. Bot S. Bonaldo P.

This glycoprotein codistributes with elastin in most sites and likely constitutes an associated component of elastic fibers. EMILIN-1 is localized mainly at the interface between amorphous elastin and the surrounding microfibrils, and it has been implicated in the correct deposition of elastin in vitro (14Bressan G.M. Daga-Gordini D. Colombatti A. Castellani I. Manigo V. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 201-212Google Scholar). In addition, EMILIN-1-reacting structures were often observed in vivo closely adjacent to the surface of cells (15Daga-Gordini D. Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Volpin D. Histochem. J. 1987; 19: 623-632Google Scholar, 16Daga Gordini D. Castellani I. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 260: 137-146Google Scholar), and thus it seemed likely that EMILIN-1 could also interact directly with cell membrane receptors. The constituents of elastic fibers and microfibrils not only display a repertoire of multiple interactions but are recognized by integrin cell surface receptors. Integrins are widely distributed heterodimeric glycoproteins that play a fundamental role in cell adhesion and migration, in cell differentiation, and in many different biological processes. In particular the integrin αvβ3, a promiscuous RGD-dependent integrin (17Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Google Scholar), was shown to mediate adhesion and spreading of many cell types on elastic fiber-associated constituents such as fibrillin-1 and -2, MAGP-2, and fibulin-5 (18Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I.

Nature. 2002; 415: 171-175Google Scholar). EMILIN-1 does not contain RGD motifs (1Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Google Scholar), but in preliminary studies it was shown to behave as a ligand for some tumor cells (1Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R.

Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 289-301Google Scholar), although the receptors involved had not been investigated. In this study with the use of purified EMILIN-1 and its fragments we addressed the adhesive function of EMILIN-1 and pinpointed the gC1q-1 domain as the major and sufficient domain responsible for cell adhesion. Our results suggest that the gC1q-1 domain of EMILIN-1, in addition to its proven function in the initial steps of the assembly of EMILIN-1 homotrimers and multimers (7/12), has a novel cell adhesive role and highlight that gC1q-1 is the first globular C1q domain that is a ligand for a β1 integrin, namely α4β1. Function-blocking anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were obtained as follows. Anti-α2(clone 12171) was from Virgil Woods (Lombardi Cancer Research Center, Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.). Anti-α3 clone F4 was from Luciano Zardi (Istituto Tumori Genova, Italy).

The mAb PS2 against the murine α4 chain was from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Anti-paxillin mAb was purchased from Chemicon. The human SW982 (synovial sarcoma), Hs913T, and HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma), SK-UT-1 (leiomyosarcoma), Jurkat and RAMOS (lymphoblastoid T cell), K562 (myeloid leukemia) cell lines, and the murine NIH3T3 (fibroblast) cells were purchased from ATCC. FLG 29.1 cells have been described previously (23Gattei V. Bernabei P.A. Pinto A. Bezzini R. Ringressi A. Formigli L. Tanini A. Attadia V. Brandi M.L. J.

The murine NQ22 and NQ29 (lymphoblastoid T cells) cell lines have been described (24Bogetto L. Gabriele E. Cariati R. Dolcetti R. Spessotto P. Doglioni C. Boiocchi M. Perris R. Colombatti A. Blood. 2000; 95: 2397-2406Google Scholar). Uterine smooth muscle cells were purchased from Biowittaker (Walkersville, MD). The cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. K562 cells stably transfected with the α4 integrin chain (α4/K562) were obtained from Dr. Joaquin Teixido (Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Department of Immunology, Madrid, Spain) and maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml G418. Before use in functional assays expression of α4 was evaluated by flow cytometry with specific anti-α4 mAbs, and the cells were found to be more than 80% positive. The C1q component of human complement was purchased from Sigma, and plasma fibronectin (FN) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Vitronectin (VN) was purified from human plasma as described by Yatohgo et al. (25Yatohgo T. Izurni M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Google Scholar). Integrins purified from human placenta were purchased from Chemicon (α1β1) or obtained from Dr. Martin J. Humphries (Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, University of Manchester, U. K.) (α4β1). Expression of various cell surface receptors was analyzed by single-color direct or indirect immunofluorescence by utilizing mAbs recognizing the following integrin chains: β1, CD29; α2, CD49b; α3, CD49c; α4, CD49d; α5, CD49e; α6, CD49f; β3, CD61 (Coulter/Immunotech S.A). As second step reagents, isotype-matched control mAbs and phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse Igs (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used. Viable, antibody-labeled cells were identified according to their forward and side scatter, electronically gated, and assayed for surface fluorescence on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry System, San Jose, CA). 293 cells, constitutively expressing the EBNA-1 protein (293-EBNA), were transfected with the constructs for EMILIN-1 or the LEU-COL-gC1q-1 as described previously (12Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Bot S. Mucignat M.T. Giacomello E. Doliana R. Colombatti A. J..Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25471-25480Google Scholar). The cells expanded to mass culture and were then maintained for 2 days in serum-free medium to allow accumulation of the polypeptides in the cell supernatant. Partial purification was achieved by dialysis of the conditioned medium at 4 °C against 0. 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCI, pH 6.8. A further purification step was achieved by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. The bound material was eluted with a NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Then the peak fractions containing the LEU-COL-gC1q-1 polypeptide were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1.2 mammonium sulfate, pH 8.8, and loaded onto a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences); bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The pooled fractions containing EMILIN-1 and obtained from the elution of the DEAE-cellulose column were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using Sepharose CL-4B (1.0 × 90.0-cm column;Amersham Biosciences). The sequence corresponding to the C-terminal domain of EMILIN-1 (gC1q-1) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from human aorta mRNA and was then ligated in-frame in the His6-tagged pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). 500 ml of liquid culture grown at 0.6 A 600 nm was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The culture was then centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 20 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3m NaCl, pH 8.0) at 5 volumes/g, wet weight. The sample was frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, thawed in cold water, and sonicated on ice (1-min bursts/1-min cooling, 2–300 watts), and cell breakage was monitored by measuring the release of nucleic acids atA 600 nm. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was collected, and purification of the His6-tagged recombinant fragment was performed by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen GmbH) under native conditions. The recombinant protein was eluted from the affinity column in sonication buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10% glycerol and 0.2m imidazole, and the native status of gC1q-1 was checked by circular dichroism. The EMILIN-1 proteins that were used in the present study, including the recombinant human full-length EMILIN-1 and the LEU-COL-gC1q-1 polypeptide produced in 293-EBNA cells as well as the gC1q-1 polypeptide produced in Escherichia coli cells (Fig.1 A), were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using 8% gels and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and are shown in Fig. 1 B. BALB/c mice were immunized with EMILIN-1 or with the recombinant gC1q-1 polypeptide. 0.1 mg of recombinant protein for each mouse was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected intraperitoneally. Four repeated injections every 10–14 days with the same amount of protein emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant were administered. Three days after the last booster injection, the spleens were removed and the splenocytes fused with the cell line P3X63Ag8/NS-1 (26Galfrè G. Howe S.C. Milstein C. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Nature. 1977; 266: 550-552Google Scholar). Culture fluids of the resulting hybridomas were screened for anti-EMILIN-1 activity in ELISA and Western blotting. Several hybridomas that recognized EMILIN-1 and reacted with the antigens in ELISAs were selected and subcloned twice before using. Rabbit antiserum against human EMILIN-1 obtained by immunization with purified recombinant protein was absorbed onto a CNBr-activated Sepharose resin saturated with mock-transfected cell proteins as described before (1Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Google Scholar). Polystyrene wells coated with gC1q-1 and saturated with 2% (w/v) BSA were first incubated for 1 h with 3-fold dilutions of unlabeled mAbs against EMILIN-1 purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by a 1-h incubation with 15–20 ng of different biotin-labeled mAbs. Purified mAbs were labeled by the biotin procedure as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). 100% binding was calculated as the binding obtained in the presence of an unrelated mAb as inhibitor. The quantitative cell adhesion assay used in this study is based on centrifugation and has been described previously (27Giacomello E. Neurnayer J. Colombatti A. Perris R. BioTechniques. 1999; 26 (764–766): 758-762Google Scholar, 28Spessotto P. Giacomello E. Perris R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 321-343Google Scholar). Briefly, six-well strips of flexible polyvinyl chloride denoted CAFCA (centrifugal assay for fluorescence-based cell adhesion) miniplates, covered with double-sided tape (bottom units), were coated with the different substrates. Cells were labeled with the vital fluorochrome calcein AM (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C, rinsed extensively in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS, followed by one rinse in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and then aliquoted into the bottom CAFCA miniplates at a density of 20 to 50 × 104 cells/ml. Cell adhesion to substrates was assayed in PBS containing 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 360, Sigma), 1 mm MgC12, and 1 mm/liter CaC12, and 2% India ink as a fluorescence quencher. CAFCA miniplates were centrifuged at 142 × g for 5 min at 37 °C to synchronize the contact of the cells with the substrate. The miniplates were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and subsequently mounted together with a similar CAFCA miniplate to create communicating chambers for subsequent reverse centrifugation. In some instances, cells were preincubated with blocking antibodies or nonblocking control antibodies for 30 min and then added to the miniplates coated with the various substrates. Another series of experiments, in which the CAFCA miniplate assemblies were centrifuged at 43, 170, and 380 × g, were also performed with the aim of determining the relative strength of cell adhesion to the various substrates. The relative number of cells bound to the substrate (i.e. remaining in the wells of the bottom miniplates) and cells that fall to bind to the substrate (i.e. remaining in the wells of the top miniplates) was estimated by top/bottom fluorescence detection in a computer-interfaced SPECTRAFluorPlus microplate fluorometer (TECAN). Fluorescence values were elaborated by the CAFCA software (TECAN) to determine the percentage adherent cells, of the total cell population analyzed, according to a previously published formula (28Spessotto P. Giacomello E. Perris R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 321-343Google Scholar, 29Tozer E.C. Hughes P.E. Loftus J.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 785-798Google Scholar). Statistical significance determined by Student's t test was set at p< 0.001. In experiments aimed at examining the effects of blocking antibodies, the various antibodies were added directly to the wells, just before plating the cells. In other experiments aimed at examining the effect of inhibition of cell adhesion by purified integrins, soluble α1β1 or α4β1 was added (5 μg/ml directly to the wells, just before plating the cells). Multiwell plates or acid-washed coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml FN, 10 μg/ml EMILIN-1, 20 μg/m1 gC1q-1, 10 μg/ml VN, 20 μg/ml C1q-C′, and the 20 μg/ml synthetic peptide CS-1 for 16 h at 4 °C, and nonspecific binding was blocked with 1.0% radioimmunoassay grade BSA (Sigma). Cells were then plated onto the various substrates for 30–40 min as indicated, then they were fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies in PBS, washed, and incubated further with the appropriate secondary antibodies and with 2 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After extensive washes, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) containing 2.5% (w/v) DABCO (Sigma). Images were acquired with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal system using Bio-Rad Lasersharp software and a 60× phase/fluorescence objective on a Diaphot 200 Nikon. Migration experiments involving haptotactic movement of the cells through a porous membrane were performed using Transwells (Corning Costar Corporation, Cambridge, MA). The underside of the insert membrane was coated with the various molecules in bicarbonate buffer at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were aliquoted into the upperside of each insert unit (1 × 105 cells/insert), and after 4 h the number of migrated cells/field was evaluated under the microscope. The potential cell adhesive capacity of recombinant EMILIN-1 had been already assessed using several cell lines and found to be of comparable potency but of distinct pattern with that of FN, a prototype adhesive molecule (2Colombatti A. Doliana R. Bot S. Canton A. Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Paron-Cilli S. Spessotto P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 289-301Google Scholar). To investigate further the site(s) of cell attachment, mAbs against the full sized recombinant EMILIN-1 or the gC1q-1 domain were generated and used in conjunction with recombinant proteins to localize the reactive epitopes by solid phase ELISA. The localization of the antibody epitopes is shown schematically in Fig. 2 A. MAb 837C was the only one that bound to the full sized EMILIN-1 and not to the other polypeptides, indicating that its epitope maps to the coiled-coil or the EMI domain region. Instead, several mAbs bound to both EMILIN-1 and the LEU-COL-gC1q-1 polypeptide, indicating that they map in the COL domain or in the short upstream region. Two mAbs (2F1 and 2C8) bound only to the LEU-COL-gC1q-1 polypeptide, suggesting that their epitopes are masked in full sized EMILIN-1 during its assembly process. Finally, seven mAbs recognized all three polypeptides and thus map to the gC1q-1 domain. Next, to determine which domain(s) would be necessary and sufficient to promote cell adhesion, cells were allowed to adhere to EMILIN-1 in the presence of mAbs directed against different epitopes of the EMILIN-1 molecule. Although the presence of antibody 1H2 (mapping to the gC1q-1 domain) caused complete inhibition of SW982 cell attachment (Fig.2 B), mAbs mapping to other domains were totally ineffective. Also, several mAbs mapping to the gC1q-1 domain were unable to block cell adhesion. Because by increasing the amounts of nonblocking antibodies added we could not obtain lower attachment levels (data not shown), it seems reasonable to conclude that blocking by 1H2 was highly specific. To investigate further the binding site specificity of mAb 1H2 on the gC1q-1 domain a competitive inhibition solid phase ELISA binding assay was performed using EMILIN-1 as a substrate and a number of mAbs as competitors. Binding of biotin-labeled 1H2 to EMILIN-1 was unaffected by several mAbs mapping on the gC1q-1 domain except 1H2 itself (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that this mAb detects a unique epitope involved in cell recognition and adhesion. Although EMILIN-1 promoted an effective cell adhesion, the very large disulfide-bonded aggregates of this protein produced by transfected 293-EBNA cells make it less suitable than gC1q-1 to investigate its role in cell adhesion phenomena further. As a preliminary analysis we sought then to compare the adhesive function of full sized EMILIN-1 with that of the gC1q-1 polypeptide on a larger spectrum of cells (Table I). The two ligands displayed a comparable ability to promote cell adhesion, with EMILIN-1 displaying a somewhat higher percentage of cell attachment. Only HT-1080 cells were found not to adhere to both ligands to the same extent, but clearly preferred EMILIN-1 (97% adhesion on EMILIN-1versus 45% on gC1q-1).Table ICell adhesion to EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1CellsFNEMILIN-1gC1q-1Hs913T691540SW982909095SK-UT-1969287HT-1080999745RAMOS7097NDaND, not determined.Jurkat869397FLG 29.19275HUVEC816391NIH3T392ND9NQ22ND9193NQ29ND8695a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Next, the kinetics of cell adhesion was investigated. Cell attachment on both EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1 showed a kinetics similar to that on FN, as 50% cell binding was observed within 10 min of plating, and the maximum level of attachment was reached with all ligands at 20 min (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, SW982 cells attached to both EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). Under the conditions used, adhesion reached plateau levels at a coating concentration of about 5 μg/ml for both substrates, although on a molar base full sized EMILIN-1 resulted at least 10 times more effective than the isolated gC1q-1 domain. However, the coating efficiency of the two ligands was verified to be similar on the type of plastic used for the CAFCA (data not shown). Divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ are generally necessary for integrin-ligand recognition (29Tozer E.C. Hughes P.E. Loftus J.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 785-798Google Scholar). To evaluate the integrin dependence of the EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1 adhesive activities, cell adhesion was determined in the absence of cations and found to be negligible (data not shown). Furthermore, cations regulated cell adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner, with Mg2+ showing a higher effect (data not shown). The cell adhesion assay used in this study permits the estimation of the relative adhesion strength displayed to a given substrate by varying the cell detachment force applied. Thus, we next examined the profile of cell attachment to EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1 compared with the adhesion strength obtained on FN (Fig. 3 C). The force necessary to detach 50% SW982 cells was ≫500 × g, 250 × g, and 270 × g for FN, EMILIN-1, and gC1q-1, respectively. Taken together these results indicate that the constitutively active receptors involved confer to these cells the capability of recognizing EMILIN-1 and gC1q-1 with a similar but lower relative avidity compared with the levels attained with FN. The above results suggested the potential for integrin-gC1q-1 interactions. In fact, consistent with the inhibition of cell attachment by EDTA and with the cation dependence of cell attachment (data not shown), the constitutive attachment of SW982 cells to gC1q-1 but also to EMILIN-1 was entirely mediated by a βl subunit-containing integrin (Fig.4). In fact, cell adhesion was completely blocked by 4B4, a neutralizing β1 integrin subunit mAb, whereas the αvβ3-blocking mAb failed to inhibit adhesion. C1q-C′ has been shown to support adhesion and spreading of endothelial cells (30Peerschke E.I. Smyth S.S. Teng E.I. Dalzell M. Ghebrehiwet B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4154-4158Google Scho"

Therefore, in addition to factors such as feeding behavior or mosquito longevity, vector competence is determined by the ability of the mosquito to support effectively the sporogonic development of a given Plasmodium species. The bird parasitePlasmodium gallinaceum, for example, normally fails to cross the midgut epithelium of the major human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, because its ookinete stages are lysed in the midgut cells of the vector through an unknown mechanism (1Vernick K.D. Fujioka H. Seeley D.C. Taudler B. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Even in naturally occurring, well adapted mosquito/parasite combinations the parasites experience severe losses. In fact, in the mosquito the parasite faces not only the cellular and humoral immune responses of hemocytes and the fat body but also the well documented local immune responses of the midgut and salivary gland epithelial barriers (2Dimopoulos G. Seeley D. Wolf A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6115-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the genetically selected A. gambiae strain L3–5 the antiparasitic mechanisms reach an extreme form, in which complete refractoriness is achieved through the melanotic encapsulation of early oocysts (3Collins F.H. Sakai R.K. Vernick K.D. Paskewitz S. Seeley D.C. Miller L.H. Collins W.E. Campbell C.C. Gwadz R.W. Science. 1986; 234: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).Because the mosquito's immune system was shown to react to the presence of the parasite, major efforts have been devoted to dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses (reviewed in Refs. 4Dimopoulos G. Muller H.M. Levashina E.A. Kafatos F.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 5Barillas-Mury C. Wizel B. Han Y.S. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Continuing efforts are guided by fundamental studies on invertebrate innate immunity performed either in model experimental systems such as Drosophila (6Khush R.S. Leulier F. Lemaitre B. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), or in systems that permit consistent biochemical studies such as the Lepidoptera Manduca sexta and Bombyx mori (7Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or the horseshoe crabLimulus (8Muta T. Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).Serine proteases play critical roles in the regulation of the invertebrate innate immune responses. In Limulus, for example, cascades of autocatalytically activated proteases triggered either by lipopolysaccharide or glucans converge to activate the hemolymph clotting system, which functions both in coagulation and in defense against pathogens (9Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Similarly in M. sexta, the prophenoloxidase cascade (which catalyzes the formation of melanin during the defense reaction and thus plays an important role in the encapsulation of pathogens) is also initiated by proteolytic processing (10Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Wang Y., Yu, X.Q., Ma, C. Zhu Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 484: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Not only serine proteases but also their associated regulatoryserine protease inhibitors of the serpin superfamily are important modulators of immune responses. The proteases underlying the activation of the clotting cascade inLimulus are known to be inhibited by regulatory serpins (11Bergner A. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Beisel H.G. Delotto R. Bode W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as are the Manduca and Hyphantria cuneaprophenoloxidase-activating proteases (12Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Park D.S. Shin S.W. Hong S.D. Park H.Y. Mol. Cells. 2000; 10: 186-192PubMed Google Scholar). The most dramatic evidence for the regulatory function of serpins comes fromDrosophila, where genetic dissection of complex pathways is feasible. The Toll pathway has important roles not only in early development but also in the antifungal response (14Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling is initiated through the binding of the extracellular ligand Spaetzle to the Toll receptor, after Spaetzle is proteolytically cleaved by Persephone (15Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This recently identified protease is thought to be the end point of an antimicrobial recognition cascade that controls activation of Spaetzle and, therefore, the Toll pathway-mediated antifungal response. In necrotic mutants (nec) the proteolytic cascade is deregulated, leading to the uncontrolled cleavage of Spaetzle and to constitutive expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin (16Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The necrotic(nec) phenotype is associated with two mutations in a serpin gene, the Spn43Ac locus (17Green C. Levashina E. McKimmie C. Dafforn T. Reichhart J.M. Gubb D. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1117-1127PubMed Google Scholar). Several immune-responsive serpins have been isolated from various insects, but their specific functions remain unknown (18Gan H. Wang Y. Jiang H.

These isoforms share homology to other insect serpins but also to intracellular cytoprotective mammalian serpins of the ovalbumin family. We characterize biochemically the inhibitory potential of three recombinant serpins and show that the isoforms are expressed in tissues that participate in insect defense reactions, such as hemocytes and the midgut epithelium. Finally, we present evidence that at least two isoforms are transcriptionally up-regulated during parasite passage through the midgut, suggesting that they may be implicated in antiparasitic action or, alternatively, parasite tolerance.DISCUSSIONThe present work reports the cloning and characterization of anA. gambiae serpin gene (SRPN10) that is transcriptionally regulated during ookinete midgut invasion. Four isoforms were derived from this gene by alternative splicing of exons encoding distinct reactive site loops. This kind of genomic architecture permits multiplication of the functionality of the gene by increasing the number of target-specific bait regions and resembles the organization found in some other insect serpin genes, such as theM. sexta serpin-1 (12 splice variants (12Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)), the B. mori serpin-1 (2 splice variants (21Sasaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), and theDrosophila serpin Sp-4 (4 alternatively spliced RSLs (40Kruger O. Ladewig J. Koster K. Ragg H. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 293: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)).Partial clones encoding serpin-like sequences were obtained recently in gene discovery projects, aimed to identify immune-responsive molecules in A. gambiae. Analysis of expressed sequence tags derived from a hemocyte-like cell line library revealed four clone clusters encoding putative serpins (41Dimopoulos G. Casavant T.L. Chang S. Scheetz T. Roberts C. Donohue M. Schultz J. Benes V. Bork P. Ansorge W. Soares M.B. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). One of these clusters, I10, corresponds to SRPN10 serpins. Similarly, a differential display search for immune-responsive genes in the adult females of A. gambiaeidentified a fragment (AF203339) with a predicted sequence homology to inhibitory serpins (42Oduol F., Xu, J.

Interestingly, in the salivary glands of the mosquito vector A. aegypti, a secreted 48-kDa serpin was identified, which possesses a hemostatic activity and is assumed to inhibit the clotting Factor Xa during mosquito blood feeding (43Stark K.R. James A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20802-20809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).We were able to show experimentally that at least three of the four SRPN10 serpin variants are functional inhibitors of serine proteases. This is consistent with features they share with inhibitory serpins, which can generally be recognized by a consensus pattern of residues in the hinge region: in inhibitory serpin P15 is usually glycine, P14 is threonine or serine, and residues with short side chains, such as alanine, glycine, or serine usually, occupy positions P12–P9. These residues are essential for inhibitory activity, because they permit a rapid insertion of the RSL into the A β-sheet, facilitating the conformational change that is necessary for the inhibitory activity of the serpin to be manifested (23Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In SRPN10 serpins these essential residues are conserved (shaded gray in Fig. 1 D), suggesting the potential for inhibitory activity, which in fact was demonstrated for all three variants that could be tested in vitro. We were unable to test the KRAL serpin isoform, because it is proteolytically cleaved, presumably by endogenous bacterial proteases, during the production and purification procedure. Consistent with the distinct composition of the RSLs, we also showed that the different isoforms exhibit specific protease inhibition spectrain vitro. These biochemical assays did not aim to identify the physiological target(s) of SRPN10 serpins but rather to establish their inhibitory potential. However, we detected high molecular mass complexes in immunoblots using a specific anti-serpin antibody, which are dissociated under harsh denaturing conditions, suggesting that alsoin vivo SRPN10 serpins are associated with target proteases.The similarity of SRPN10 serpins to mammalian ov-serpins, both in the whole protein sequence and in some cases in the RSL amino acid composition, leads to intriguing speculations as to their physiological role. Ov-serpins reside in the cytosol and/or in the nucleus of protease-secreting cells, including cytotoxic lymphocytes, monocytes, and epithelial and endothelial cells (44Bird P.I. Immunol Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The physiological role of ov-serpins is still emerging, but for many members of the family a cytoprotective role is envisaged and thought to be exerted through the modulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic proteases (24Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar).Midgut epithelial cells invaded by ookinetes show features indicative of apoptosis, such as loss of cell contacts, genomic DNA fragmentation, and sometimes caspase activation (45Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 46Zieler H. Dvorak J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11516-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this context, up-regulation of the inhibitory SRPN10 serpin gene may reflect the activation of anti-apoptotic or cytoprotective mechanisms during ookinete invasion.Alternatively, the inhibitory activity of the CAM isoform against two distinct bacterial subtilisin-like proteases may support another working hypothesis, according to which SRPN10 serpin isoforms may inhibit ookinete-derived proteases. It is known that ookinetes secrete Sub2, a subtilisin-like protease, during the midgut invasion process (45Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Because a pivotal role in red blood cell invasion is predicted for subtilisins secreted by the merozoite stages (47Chitnis C.E. Blackman M.J. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 411-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a similar role of Sub2 during ookinete midgut invasion is an intriguing hypothesis. Provided that functional, purified enzyme becomes available, it would be interesting to test the potential effect of all four SRPN10 serpins toward Sub2. Production and testing of the KRAL isoform would be of special interest, because it is strongly up-regulated during midgut invasion.In agreement with the lack of an obvious signal peptide, we demonstrated by immunofluorescence that Anopheles SRPN10 serpins have an intracellular nucleocytoplasmic localization, principally in midgut cells, i.e. scavenger pericardial cells and hemocytes, which are well known to mediate, respectively, epithelial and cellular immune responses in the mosquito. Bacterial challenge elicits only marginal up-regulation of serpin transcripts (particularly of the KRAL isoform), in contrast to the immune-responsive Spn43Ac Drosophila serpin (16Levashina E.A.

Reichhart J.M. Gubb D. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1117-1127PubMed Google Scholar) and to the hemocyte-specific Manduca serpin-2 (18Gan H. Wang Y. Jiang H. Mita K. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).A remarkable property of SRPN10 is that two of its isoforms are transcriptionally up-regulated upon ookinete midgut invasion. This differentiates SRPN10 serpins from other described markers such as, nitric-oxide synthase, defensin, and gram negative protein, which are transcriptionally regulated by both ookinete invasion and bacterial challenge (2Dimopoulos G. Seeley D. Wolf A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6115-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Barillas-Mury C. Wizel B. Han Y.S. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 48Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Muller H.M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).Marker genes that are specifically regulated during ookinete invasion are particularly valuable as tools to dissect and compare the physiological responses triggered in the vector when infected with different Plasmodium species or strains. A fragment encoding a gene with sequence similarity to α2-macroglobulin was shown to respond strongly to malaria parasite infection and not to bacteria (42Oduol F., Xu, J. Niare O. Natarajan R. Vernick K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11397-11402Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several genes that are differentially regulated and may be involved in the defense reaction of the A. gambiae midgut toward P. falciparum have been recently isolated by differential display (50Bonnet S. Prevot G. Jacques J.C. Boudin C. Bourgouin C. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Curiously, SRPN10 serpins were not among them. This might be due to the different combination of experimental organisms (A. gambiae and P. falciparum) or to the low midgut infection rates in that study (not exceeding 15 oocysts per infected midgut). In our experimental combination (A. gambiae and P. berghei), high infection rates were achieved. Additional studies are necessary to distinguish whether SRPN10 serpin up-regulation takes place only in cells that are invaded by the parasite or is a general response of the midgut after heavy infection. Our highly specific α-SRPN10 antibody is a very valuable tool for such studies.Only two of the serpin variants (the ones that utilize the most upstream alternative exons) are enriched during ookinete midgut invasion. Combined with the results of primer extension experiments that indicate lack of alternative promoters, these observations point to regulation at a step other than transcriptional initiation. The step in question may affect transcriptional termination, splicing, or relative stability of the mRNAs. The existence of distinct 3′-untranslated regions for each splice variant might be associated with differences in transcriptional termination or mRNA stability. Alternatively, ookinete invasion could result in preferential splicing of KRAL- and RCM-serpin variants: cells penetrated by the parasite show apoptotic phenotypes (45Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 46Zieler H. Dvorak J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11516-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that cell death can affect profoundly the splicing machinery, favoring maturation of distinct gene products through specific responsive elements present in their introns (51Forch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martinez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 52Forch P. Valcarcel J. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Understanding the complex regulation of SRPN10 serpin expression requires systematic studies, starting with the functional dissection of the promoter region, which is characterized by the presence of multiple regulatory elements, and proceeding with analysis of pre-mRNA transcription and in vivo processing and stability. In addition, the effects of purified SRPN10 serpin isoforms on in vitro cultured ookinetes, or ookinete invasion in transgenic midguts overexpressing or inhibiting specific isoforms, will be necessary to clarify whether SRPN10 promotes or inhibits ookinete invasion. Successful transmission of malaria parasites to vertebrate hosts requires completion of their sporogonic cycle within the mosquito vector. Therefore, in addition to factors such as feeding behavior or mosquito longevity, vector competence is determined by the ability of the mosquito to support effectively the sporogonic development of a given Plasmodium species. The bird parasitePlasmodium gallinaceum, for example, normally fails to cross the midgut epithelium of the major human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, because its ookinete stages are lysed in the midgut cells of the vector through an unknown mechanism (1Vernick K.D. Fujioka H. Seeley D.C. Taudler B. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Even in naturally occurring, well adapted mosquito/parasite combinations the parasites experience severe losses. In fact, in the mosquito the parasite faces not only the cellular and humoral immune responses of hemocytes and the fat body but also the well documented local immune responses of the midgut and salivary gland epithelial barriers (2Dimopoulos G. Seeley D. Wolf A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6115-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the genetically selected A. gambiae strain L3–5 the antiparasitic mechanisms reach an extreme form, in which complete refractoriness is achieved through the melanotic encapsulation of early oocysts (3Collins F.H. Sakai R.K. Vernick K.D. Paskewitz S. Seeley D.C. Miller L.H. Collins W.E. Campbell C.C. Gwadz R.W. Science. 1986; 234: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Because the mosquito's immune system was shown to react to the presence of the parasite, major efforts have been devoted to dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses (reviewed in Refs. 4Dimopoulos G. Muller H.M. Levashina E.A. Kafatos F.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 5Barillas-Mury C. Wizel B. Han Y.S. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Continuing efforts are guided by fundamental studies on invertebrate innate immunity performed either in model experimental systems such as Drosophila (6Khush R.S. Leulier F. Lemaitre B. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), or in systems that permit consistent biochemical studies such as the Lepidoptera Manduca sexta and Bombyx mori (7Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or the horseshoe crabLimulus (8Muta T. Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Serine proteases play critical roles in the regulation of the invertebrate innate immune responses. In Limulus, for example, cascades of autocatalytically activated proteases triggered either by lipopolysaccharide or glucans converge to activate the hemolymph clotting system, which functions both in coagulation and in defense against pathogens (9Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Similarly in M. sexta, the prophenoloxidase cascade (which catalyzes the formation of melanin during the defense reaction and thus plays an important role in the encapsulation of pathogens) is also initiated by proteolytic processing (10Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Wang Y., Yu, X.Q., Ma, C. Zhu Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 484: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Not only serine proteases but also their associated regulatoryserine protease inhibitors of the serpin superfamily are important modulators of immune responses. The proteases underlying the activation of the clotting cascade inLimulus are known to be inhibited by regulatory serpins (11Bergner A. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Beisel H.G. Delotto R. Bode W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as are the Manduca and Hyphantria cuneaprophenoloxidase-activating proteases (12Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Park D.S. Shin S.W. Hong S.D. Park H.Y. Mol. Cells. 2000; 10: 186-192PubMed Google Scholar). The most dramatic evidence for the regulatory function of serpins comes fromDrosophila, where genetic dissection of complex pathways is feasible. The Toll pathway has important roles not only in early development but also in the antifungal response (14Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling is initiated through the binding of the extracellular ligand Spaetzle to the Toll receptor, after Spaetzle is proteolytically cleaved by Persephone (15Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This recently identified protease is thought to be the end point of an antimicrobial recognition cascade that controls activation of Spaetzle and, therefore, the Toll pathway-mediated antifungal response. In necrotic mutants (nec) the proteolytic cascade is deregulated, leading to the uncontrolled cleavage of Spaetzle and to constitutive expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin (16Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The necrotic(nec) phenotype is associated with two mutations in a serpin gene, the Spn"

US28 induces migration of smooth muscle cells, a feature essential for the development of atherosclerosis, and may serve as a co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 entry into cells. Previously, we have shown that HCMV-encoded US28 displays constitutive activity, whereas its mammalian homologs do not. In this study we have identified a small nonpeptidergic molecule (VUF2274) that inhibits US28-mediated phospholipase C activation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. Moreover, VUF2274 inhibits US28-mediated HIV entry into cells. In addition, VUF2274 fully displaces radiolabeled RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) binding at US28, apparently with a noncompetitive behavior. Different analogues of VUF2274 have been synthesized and pharmacologically characterized, to understand which features are important for its inverse agonistic activity. Finally, by means of mutational analysis of US28, we have identified a glutamic acid in transmembrane 7 (TM 7), which is highly conserved among chemokine receptors, as a critical residue for VUF2274 binding to US28. The identification of a full inverse agonist provides an important tool to investigate the relevance of US28 constitutive activity in viral pathogenesis.

In contrast, primary infection or reactivation of the virus in immunocompromised hosts, such as transplant recipients and AIDS patients, can cause severe and even fatal disease (1Sweet C. The Pathogenicity of Viruses. Edward Arnold, London, UK1990Google Scholar). Moreover, different clinical studies have suggested that HCMV infection plays a role in the development of vascular diseases including vascular allograft rejection, restenosis, and atherosclerosis (2Melnick J.L. Hu C. Burek J. Adam E. DeBakey M.E. J. Med. Virol. 1994; 42: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Melnick J.L. Adam E. DeBakey M.E. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 1996; 44: 297-302PubMed Google Scholar).HCMV encodes four putative GPCRs, namely US27, US28, UL33, and UL78 (4Chee M.S. Satchwell S.C. Preddie E. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is interesting to notice that, like HCMV, various β- and γ-herpesviruses, such as human herpesviruses HHV-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8 (Kaposi's sarcoma associated Herpesvirus) also encode GPCRs in their genome (reviewed in Ref. 5Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These virally encoded GPCRs show homology to mammalian chemokine receptors, suggesting that these viruses exploit chemokine signaling pathways as a general mechanism to interfere with the host immune system (6Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).HCMV-encoded US28 shows high homology to CC-chemokine receptors and binds several CC-chemokines such as CCL5/RANTES, CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 with high affinity (7Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kuhn D.E. Beall C.J. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, US28 binds the membrane-bound CX3C-chemokine CX3CL1/fractalkine, which has been suggested to play a role in the cellular interaction with viral particles (9Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that US28 exhibits some HIV entry cofactor activity when coexpressed with CD4 (10Pleskoff O. Treboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study (11Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) has shown that expression of US28 after infection with HCMV induces smooth muscle cells migration, providing a potential link between CMV and progression of vascular disease.We have recently shown that US28 constitutively signals through a Gαq pathway leading to activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the transcription factor NF-κB when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). CC-chemokines such as CCL5/RANTES and CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 do not modulate the basal signal of this receptor, whereas the CX3C-chemokine CX3CL1/fractalkine inhibits ∼35% of the US28-mediated response and is therefore classified as a partial inverse agonist. The possible implications of the high constitutive activity of US28 in the pathogenesis of CMV infection have not been established yet. It can be hypothesized that expression of a GPCR that functions in the absence of ligands may aid the virus to alter the normal homeostasis of the host cell for its own benefit. Other viral-encoded GPCRs, such as KSHV-encoded ORF74 (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and RCMV-encoded R33 (14Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J. Broers J.L. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), show constitutive activity as well. KSHV-encoded ORF74 provides currently the best evidence for the link between constitutive activity and viral pathology. ORF74 has oncogenic potential (15Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Gerhengorn M.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) and transgenic mice expressing ORF74 develop angioproliferative lesions that morphologically resemble Kaposi sarcoma (15Bais C.

Invest. 2001; 108: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, viral GPCRs, including US28, can be regarded as putative new drug targets. In this study we report the identification of the first nonpeptidergic molecules able to bind a viral GPCR (US28) and to inhibit its basal signaling. These molecules provide valuable tools for the study of the role of US28 in HCMV-infected cells and serve as potential leads for the development of a new class of anti-HCMV agents.DISCUSSIONUsing the US28-mediated constitutive activation of PLC as a screening approach, we have identified the small nonpeptidergic molecule VUF2274 as a full inverse agonist at the HCMV-encoded chemokine receptor US28. Possible interferences of VUF2274 with G proteins or other downstream components in the InsP signaling cascade were ruled out using different GPCRs as controls. Several analogues of VUF2274 were subsequently tested. Several emerging points are noteworthy: the piperidine ring as well as the hydroxyl group and the chlorosubstituent at the phenyl ring represent important moieties for the activity of VUF2274. On the other hand, a higher degree of freedom is tolerated at the benzhydryl moiety, where an increase in the lyphophilicity or the removal of the cyano group is well accepted. We are currently synthesizing other analogues to develop more refined structure-activity relationships and obtain molecules with an increased affinity for the receptor.VUF2274 dose-dependently displaces 125I-RANTES binding to US28, apparently with a noncompetitive behavior, as shown by the marked decrease of the B max value of125I-RANTES in the presence of VUF2274. Chemokines are relatively large peptides that interact mainly with the extracellular part of the receptor, such as the N terminus and extracellular loops (21Gayle 3rd, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. Vanden Bos T. Beckmann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Monteclaro F.S.

On the other hand, small nonpeptidergic compounds typically have interaction points located in the TM domains of GPCRs. In fact, different studies have shown that nonpeptide antagonists for peptide receptors, such as the glucagon receptor (27Cascieri M.A. Koch G.E. Ber E. Sadowski S.J. Louizides D. de Laszlo S.E.

Similarly, mutational analysis performed on US28 suggests that chemokines and VUF2274 bind to different epitopes of the receptor. In fact, the N terminus deletion mutant Δ(2–22)-US28 does not bind any of the tested chemokines, whereas its constitutive signaling is still inhibited by VUF2274 with a similar potency as observed for WT-US28. Taken together, these data prove that the N terminus of US28 is a determinant for chemokine binding but not for the small compound VUF2274. These results, together with the noncompetitive behavior shown in saturation binding assays, suggest that displacement of the CC-chemokine RANTES is the result of a change in the conformation of the receptor allosterically induced by VUF2274, and not because of competition for the same binding site. This is further corroborated by the fact that RANTES cannot reverse the inverse agonistic effect of VUF2274 in the InsP assay.In line with these findings is our observation that mutation of the glutamic acid residue Glu277 in TM 7 of US28 is not important for RANTES binding, whereas it is a crucial interaction partner for VUF2274, possibly through an ion-pair interaction with the basic nitrogen of the piperidine moiety. A glutamic acid residue is highly conserved in this position within the seventh transmembrane domain of chemokine receptors (29Mirzadegan T. Diehl F. Ebi B. Bhakta S. Polsky I. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Weatherhead G.S. Lapierre J.M. Dankwardt J. Morgans Jr., D. Wilhelm R. Jarnagin K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25562-25571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas acidic residues are rare in this position in other GPCRs. A previous study (29Mirzadegan T. Diehl F. Ebi B. Bhakta S. Polsky I. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Weatherhead G.S. Lapierre J.M. Dankwardt J. Morgans Jr., D. Wilhelm R. Jarnagin K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25562-25571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) has indeed identified this conserved glutamic acid as a critical residue for high affinity binding to CCR2 of a class of small antagonists that share some common features with VUF2274, such as a piperidine moiety and bulky aromatic groups. Docking of VUF2274 in the US28 in silico model (Fig. 7) suggests various aromatic residues as potential interaction partners, such as Tyr40 in TM-1, Phe111 and Tyr112 in TM-3, Tyr244 in TM-6, and Phe281 in TM-7. Further mutagenesis of US28 needs to be performed to confirm these hypotheses and will help in refining our ideas on receptor-ligand interactions.To study the action of VUF2274 on viral activity, we investigated the effect of VUF2274 in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. HCMV infection is accompanied by activation of several signaling pathways in infected cells (30Shibutani T. Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Epstein S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2054-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Valyi-Nagy T. Bandi Z. Boldogh I. Albrecht T. Arch. Virol. 1988; 101: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), among which is a sustained increase in the intracellular levels of inositol phosphates.2 Indeed, US28 expression appears to be mostly responsible for activation of PLC, but is not the only player, because cells infected with the deletion mutant virus ΔUS28 still have inositol phosphate levels higher than mock infected cells (Fig. 5). We hypothesize that this residual activation could be mediated by one of the other GPCRs encoded by HCMV (namely US27, UL33, and UL78). At present there is increasing evidence that also UL33 displays constitutive activity in the InsP assay when transiently transfected in COS-7 cells (17Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) 4P. Casarosa and Y. Gruijthuijsen, manuscript in preparation. and is not affected by VUF2274. We are currently generating other deletion mutant viruses, such as Δ33 (lacking UL33), which will help to better understand the physiological relevance of these observations.Infection of fibroblasts with HCMV offers a relevant model for the pharmacological study of US28, because it closely resembles the pathophysiological situation. In this condition, US28 expression is regulated by the virus and its constitutive signaling is not a potential artifact because of overexpression. In line with data obtained in COS-7 cells, VUF2274 dose dependently inhibited US28-mediated signaling in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. These results confirm the action of VUF2274 as an inverse agonist at US28 in a physiologically relevant model system. It is, however, noteworthy that maximal inhibition produced by VUF2274 on virus-infected cells is less pronounced (maximal inhibition is 70% of HCMV-induced InsP accumulation) than observed in COS-7 cells transfected with US28 receptor cDNA. This discrepancy might be because of differences in US28 expression in the two systems, or possibly because of different US28 coupling to accessory proteins in the different cell lines. Moreover, it is possible that HCMV encodes some additional signaling partner for US28 that could alter US28 behavior and that would not be present in the transfected system.US28 is an early gene, being transcribed as early as 2 h after HCMV infection of permissive cells, such as fibroblasts (32Zipeto D. Bodaghi B. Laurent L. Virelizier J.L. Michelson S. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consequently, cells permissive to HCMV infection express a receptor that functions in the absence of any ligand and may influence the cellular machinery early after infection. Notably, US28 constitutively activates pathways such as PLC and NF-κB, which are important for viral replication (33Albrecht T. Boldogh I. Fons M. AbuBakar S. Deng C.Z. Intervirology. 1990; 31: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34AbuBakar S. Boldogh I. Albrecht T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Hiscott J. Kwon H. Genin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). US28 is transcribed not only in cells permissive to CMV infection, but also in latently infected cells, such as monocytes (36Beisser P.S. Laurent L. Virelizier J.L. Michelson S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5949-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that US28 may affect a wide range of cell types. In monocytes, the transcription factor NF-κB promotes expression of over 100 target genes, mostly involved in the regulation of the immune response (37Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). It is suggestive to propose that US28, through activation of PLC and NF-κB pathways, might alter expression of such proteins, resulting in alteration of the immune response in favor of viral survival and spreading.At present, the biological role of US28 in viral pathogenesis is still unclear. US28 has been suggested to act as a chemokine scavenger (38Bodaghi B. Jones T.R. Zipeto D. Vita C. Sun L. Laurent L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Michelson S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Moreover, US28 can induce smooth muscle cell migration (11Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Finally, the possible implications of the high constitutive activity of US28 in the pathogenesis of CMV infection have not been established yet. Studies conducted with a US28 deletion mutant virus have shown that US28 is not required for viral growth in culture (26Vieira J. Schall T.J. Corey L. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8158-8165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that its role is important for viral pathogenesis in vivo.The lack of in vivo systems because of the high species specificity of HCMV makes the direct analysis of the function of US28 difficult. Generation of US28 knock-in mice might represent a good system for the analysis of this receptor. This approach has been very successful for ORF74 (39Holst P.J. Rosenkilde M.M. Manfra D. Chen S.C. Wiekowski M.T. Holst B. Cifire F. Lipp M. Schwartz T.W. Lira S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recent discovery that chimpanzee CMV also encodes a US28 gene (NCBI accession number NP-612800) might offer an additional animal model. The small inverse agonist VUF2274 provides a tool to investigate a potential role of US28 and its constitutive activity in activating a cell to allow or enhance viral replication in vivo.Finally, different clinical studies (40Webster A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1991; 4: S47-S52PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kovacs A. Schluchter M. Easley K. Demmler G. Shearer W. La Russa P. Pitt J. Cooper E. Goldfarb J. Hodes D. Kattan M. McIntosh K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have suggested that HCMV infection is a co-factor in HIV disease progression. In for example, HIV-positive infants CMV infection increases the chances of progression to AIDS, impaired brain growth, and motor deficits (41Kovacs A. Schluchter M. Easley K. Demmler G. Shearer W. La Russa P. Pitt J. Cooper E. Goldfarb J. Hodes D. Kattan M. McIntosh K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cellular entry of HIV-1 is mediated via interaction of the viral glycoprotein 120 with CD4 and a co-receptor, which belongs to the chemokine receptor family. The best characterized co-receptors are CCR5, which mediates entry of monotropic (R5) HIV strains, and CXCR4, which mediates entry of lymphotropic (X4) HIV strains. The HCMV-encoded US28 can also enhance viral entry for both R5- and X4-tropic HIV strains in vitro(10Pleskoff O. Treboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), giving a molecular basis to the epidemiological link between HCMV and HIV-1 infection. Our results with 293T cells confirm US28 as a potential co-receptor for CCR5-tropic HIV strains. The inverse agonist VUF2274 at a concentration of 1 μm inhibits viral entry by 60%, suggesting that small ligands acting at US28 might have anti-HIV properties. Further studies must be undertaken to determine in detail how VUF2274 blocks HIV-1 entry. VUF2274 might inhibit glycoprotein 120 binding at US28, or inhibit a receptor conformational change necessary for viral fusion, or alternatively induce US28 internalization. The various mechanisms have been previously suggested for different inhibitors of HIV entry that target human chemokine (co)receptors (25Dragic T. Trkola A. Thompson D.A. Cormier E.G. Kajumo F.A. Maxwell E. Lin S.W. Ying W. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Moore J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5639-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 42Brandt S.M. Mariani R. Holland A.U. Hope T.J. Landau N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17291-17299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Similarly, the physiological relevance of US28 as co-receptor for HIV-1 still remains to be determined. There is evidence that cellular co-infection with HIV and CMV can occur in vivo, ine.g. the brain, retina, and lungs (43Nelson J.A. Reynolds-Kohler C. Oldstone M.B. Wiley C.A. Virology. 1988; 165: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 44Finkle C. Tapper M.A. Knox K.K. Carrigan D.R. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1991; 4: 735-737PubMed Google Scholar). CCR5 expression in the brain is very low (45van der Meer P. Ulrich A.M. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Lavi E. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 69: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), giving rise to the possibility that different co-receptors, among which US28, might serve for HIV entry and are related to the HIV-related progression of dementia.In conclusion, we show that the small nonpeptidergic molecule VUF2274 is a full inverse agonist at the HCMV-encoded chemokine receptor US28. Moreover, VUF2274 inhibits US28-mediated HIV-1 infection. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a small inverse agonist targeted against a viral encoded GPCR. We suggest that binding of VUF2274 locks the receptor US28 in an inactive conformation and allosterically modulates chemokine binding at US28. The identification of an inverse agonist provides a tool for further dissecting the role of US28 and its constitutive activity in HCMV infection. In addition, it might serve as a potential lead for innovative antiviral drug design.

In contrast, primary infection or reactivation of the virus in immunocompromised hosts, such as transplant recipients and AIDS patients, can cause severe and even fatal disease (1Sweet C. The Pathogenicity of Viruses. Edward Arnold, London, UK1990Google Scholar). Moreover, different clinical studies have suggested that HCMV infection plays a role in the development of vascular diseases including vascular allograft rejection, restenosis, and atherosclerosis (2Melnick J.L. Hu C. Burek J. Adam E. DeBakey M.E. J. Med. Virol. 1994; 42: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Melnick J.L. Adam E. DeBakey M.E. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 1996; 44: 297-302PubMed Google Scholar). HCMV encodes four putative GPCRs, namely US27, US28, UL33, and UL78 (4Chee M.S. Satchwell S.C. Preddie E. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is interesting to notice that, like HCMV, various β- and γ-herpesviruses, such as human herpesviruses HHV-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8 (Kaposi's sarcoma associated Herpesvirus) also encode GPCRs in their genome (reviewed in Ref. 5Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These virally encoded GPCRs show homology to mammalian chemokine receptors, suggesting that these viruses exploit chemokine signaling pathways as a general mechanism to interfere with the host immune system (6Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). HCMV-encoded US28 shows high homology to CC-chemokine receptors and binds several CC-chemokines such as CCL5/RANTES, CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 with high affinity (7Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kuhn D.E. Beall C.J. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, US28 binds the membrane-bound CX3C-chemokine CX3CL1/fractalkine, which has been suggested to play a role in the cellular interaction with viral particles (9Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that US28 exhibits some HIV entry cofactor activity when coexpressed with CD4 (10Pleskoff O. Treboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study (11Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) has shown that expression of US28 after infection with HCMV induces smooth muscle cells migration, providing a potential link between CMV and progression of vascular disease. We have recently shown that US28 constitutively signals through a Gαq pathway leading to activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the transcription factor NF-κB when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). CC-chemokines such as CCL5/RANTES and CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 do not modulate the basal signal of this receptor, whereas the CX3C-chemokine CX3CL1/fractalkine inhibits ∼35% of the US28-mediated response and is therefore classified as a partial inverse agonist. The possible implications of the high constitutive activity of US28 in the pathogenesis of CMV infection have not been established yet. It can be hypothesized that expression of a GPCR that functions in the absence of ligands may aid the virus to alter the normal homeostasis of the host cell for its own benefit. Other viral-encoded GPCRs, such as KSHV-encoded ORF74 (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and RCMV-encoded R33 (14Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J. Broers J.L. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J.

The key protein subunit of the telomerase complex, known as TERT, possesses reverse transcriptase (RT)-like motifs that directly mediate nucleotide addition. The RT motifs are located in the C-terminal region of the polypeptide. Sequence alignments also revealed the existence of four conserved motifs (named GQ, CP, QFP, and T) in the N-terminal region of TERT. The GQ motif of yeast TERT has been demonstrated previously to be essential for telomerase catalysis and may participate in RNP formation. In this report, we show that substitution of conserved residues in the CP, QFP, and T motifs of yeast TERT also impairs both telomere maintenance and telomerase activity, thus confirming the validity of the sequence alignment. The extent of telomere shortening correlates with the extent of reduction in the level of telomerase activity, TERT protein, and TERT-associated TLC1 RNA. Overexpression of the mutant proteins does not result in telomere shortening, implying that assembly rather than catalytic function was affected. This notion was further supported by comparing the efficiency of RNP formation in the wild type and the overexpression strains. Taken together, our results show that three of the four N-terminal motifs are required for efficient telomerase RNP formation in vivo but not for the enzymatic function of telomerase. We also show that the majority of telomerase-associated TLC1 RNA has a more upstream 3′ end than previously reported, consistent with additional processing events during RNP maturation.

It acts as an unusual reverse transcriptase, using a small segment of an integral RNA component as template for the synthesis of the dG-rich strand of telomeres (2Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H.

Telomerase RNAs found in ciliated protozoa, in addition to having a short templating region, share a common secondary structure. Telomerase RNAs from yeast and mammals are considerably larger, and within each group conserved structural elements can be identified based on phylogenetic and mutational analysis (5Tzfati Y.

The RT-like motifs are located in the C-terminal region of cloned TERTs. Extensive mutational analysis of these motifs in TERTs supports an overall conservation of basic catalytic mechanisms between telomerase and conventional RTs. For example, the TERT analogues of RT residues essential for catalysis are absolutely required for telomerase activity and telomere maintenance (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M.

In addition, the same tyrosine residue in conserved motif A allows both TERTs and RTs to discriminate against incorporating ribonucleotides (31Miller M.C. Liu J.K. Collins K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4412-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, some other crucial RT residues (e.g. a Gln in motif B′) appear to be less important or even dispensable for telomerase catalysis (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that despite the high degree of sequence divergence (<20% sequence identity), the RT domains in both classes of proteins are mechanistically quite similar. Detailed sequence analysis of nine cloned TERTs revealed, in addition to the RT motifs, four telomerase-specific motifs (named GQ, CP, QFP, and T) positioned N-terminal to the RT region (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The functions of selected TERT N-terminal residues have been analyzed by reconstituting mutated TERT protein with telomerase RNA either in vitro(Tetrahymena and human) or in vivo (S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and human) (18Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R., Ma, L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

Cell. 2000; 6: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to confirming the functional importance of many of the conserved residues, the results from Tetrahymenaindicate that the CP and T motifs may be required for TERT binding to telomerase RNA in vitro (33Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Lai C. Miller M. Collins K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have initiated a detailed structure-function analysis of the N-terminal region of S. cerevisiae TERT (Est2p). In an earlier report (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we showed that the most N-terminal GQ motif is required for telomere maintenance and, in some cases, for telomerase activity in vitro. Overexpression of some of the mutants resulted in telomere shortening, implying that telomerase catalytic function, rather than RNP formation, was impaired by the mutations. We now report an analysis of the remaining three N-terminal motifs using an extensive panel of mutations. Our results confirm the functional importance of the CP, QFP, and T motifs in both telomere maintenance and telomerase activity. In addition, for mutations in these motifs, the extent of telomerase activity loss correlates with the extent of reduction in the amount of TERT protein and TERT-associated TLC1 RNA. Overexpression of the mutant proteins does not result in telomere shortening, implying that assembly rather than catalytic function was affected. This notion was further supported by a comparison between the efficiency of RNP formation in the wild type and the overexpression strains. Taken together, our results imply that three of the four N-terminal motifs in TERTs are required for efficient RNP formation in vivo but not for the telomere extension function of telomerase. We also show that the majority of telomerase-associated TLC1 RNA has a more upstream 3′ end than reported previously, consistent with additional processing events during RNP maturation. The construction of anest2-Δ strain harboring the pSE-Est2-C874 plasmid (containing a protein A-tagged EST2 gene) has been described (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This fully functional Est2p is designated wild type telomerase throughout the text. The construction of the protein A-tagged C745 mutant has also been described (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All substitution mutations in the CP, QFP, and T motifs of EST2 were generated by using the Quick-Change protocol (Stratagene), appropriate primer oligonucleotides, and pSE-Est2-C874 as template. All point mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The oligodeoxynucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were purchased from Sigma-Genosys and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis prior to use. For overexpression of TERT mutants, a vector containing the triose-phosphate isomerase promoter (pYX232, Ingenious Inc.) was utilized. The NcoI site within the polylinker of pYX232 was converted to an NdeI site, and the NdeI-SalI fragments from the pSE-Est2-C874 series of plasmids were inserted between the NdeI andSalI site of the resulting vector (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All sequences used in comparative analysis were obtained from NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The final alignment was based on manual adjustment of a hidden Markov model as described previously (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The est2-Δ and W303 strain were transformed with the pSE and pYX series of plasmids, respectively. Independent clones were re-streaked twice on plates. Chromosomal DNAs were then isolated using the “Smash and Grab” protocol, digested with PstI, and electrophoretically separated on a 0.9% agarose gel. Following capillary transfer to nylon membranes, telomere-containing fragments were detected by hybridization with a 32P-labeled poly(dG-dT) probe (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts, DEAE fractions, and IgG-Sepharose-purified telomerase were prepared as described previously (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each primer extension assay was carried out using 20 μl of IgG-Sepharose pretreated with 4 mg of protein extract and was initiated by the addition of a 15-μl mixture containing 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm magnesium chloride, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, primer oligodeoxynucleotides, and varying combinations of labeled and unlabeled dGTP and dTTP. Primer extension products were processed and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described previously (36Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Lue N.F. Xia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotide primers used for telomerase assays were purchased from Sigma-Genosys and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis prior to use. The primers have the following sequences: TEL15, TGTGTGGTGTGTGGG; TEL66, TAGGGTAGTAGTAGGG. The levels of protein A-tagged yeast TERT in cells extracts were determined by Western blotting as described previously (30Bosoy D. Lue N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46305-46312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNase protection studies were carried out as follows. A PCR fragment that spans nucleotide 1–1301 of theTLC1 gene (38Singer M.S. Gottschling D.E. Science. 1994; 266: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) was generated and cloned between theBamHI and EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS+ to give pBS-TLC1. For the synthesis of labeled antisense probe, pBS-TLC1 was linearized by digestion with HinfI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 12 μm[α-32P]GTP as described (39Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of the 1–1300 and 1–917 sense transcripts, the same plasmid was digested with XhoI and AflII, respectively, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. For the protection assay, total RNAs from DEAE fractions or in vitro transcription reactions were combined with the probe (100,000 cpm), and the mixtures were precipitated with ethanol. The RNAs were then hybridized in 80% formamide, digested successively with RNase T1, RNase A, and proteinase K, and analyzed with gel electrophoresis as described (40Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Total RNAs from DEAE fractions or from in vitro transcription reactions were isolated by proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The RNAs were then polyadenylated using yeast poly(A) polymerase and reverse transcribed using a poly(dT)-containing primer (CCGGAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT) (41Chapon C. Cech T.R. Zaug A.J. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 1337-1351PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs spanning the 3′ end of TLC1 RNA were amplified by PCR using a TLC1-internal primer (CGGGATCCGATCAGTAACTGAACAATGAC) and the same poly(dT) primer. Following gel purification and restriction enzyme cleavage, the fragments were cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI site of pBluescript II KS+, and the TLC1-poly(A) junctions were determined by sequencing. Through the use of a hidden Markov model, we had earlier reported the identification of four conserved motifs in the N-terminal extension of TERTs from ciliates, fungi, mammals, and a plant (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Subsequently, sequences for 11 additional TERTs were reported, including those from Cryptosporidium parvum, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Giardia lamblia, Mesocricetus auratus, Moneuplotes crassus, Oryza sativa, Paramecium caudatum,Plasmodium yoelii, Plasmodium falciparum,Xenopus laevis, and Caenorhabditis elegans (42Carlton J.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Some of the newly discovered homologues manifest a surprising degree of evolutionary divergence. For example, the TERTs from P. falciparum and P. yoelii are more than twice the size of many other proteins of this family. Nevertheless, a realignment of the N-terminal extension suggests that, with the exception of CeTERT, the four N-terminal motifs are universally conserved (Fig. 1). Close inspection of the new alignment revealed the following two interesting features. First, even though there are very few absolutely conserved residues, many positions appear to tolerate only conservative substitutions. A great majority of these conserved positions favor hydrophobic or aromatic residues, which may correspond to key positions in the core of a domain or surface locations crucial for interactions with other domains or molecules. Second, the proposed linker region between the GQ and CP motif is even more variable in length than previously suspected, ranging in size from 19 residues to >500. Interestingly, the smallest TERT (E. cuniculi) also possesses the smallest linker. To extend our earlier functional analysis of the GQ motif, we created a series of substitution mutants of yeast TERT with alterations in the CP, QFP, and T motifs, and we tested their abilities to support telomere maintenance. A total of 18 mutants with substitution inconserved residues (SCR mutants) were generated, each with one or two residues (and in one case, three residues) changed to alanines: IL256, CP261, LE264, F286, IL290, LLP294, MF299, LL316, LL330, DF338, WL341, W367, LI372, II376, FF380, T384, Y394, and W400. Each mutant is designated by the identity and location of the altered amino acid residue. Where more than one residue is mutated, the number specifies the position of the first residue of the pair or triplet. For comparison, a mutant with substitutions in non-conserved residues was also made (GK307). Each mutant was tagged at the C terminus with tandem copies of the IgG-binding domain of proteins A, placed on a centromeric plasmid, and used to transform a yeast strain whose chromosomal EST2 (yeast TERT) gene has been disrupted. A similarly tagged wild type EST2 gene was analyzed in parallel as the control. All of the strains were first tested for telomere maintenance defects. As predicted and shown in Fig. 2, the majority of SCR mutants exhibited varying degrees of telomere shortening. Based on the degree of shortening, the mutant phenotypes were classified as mild (CP261, LE264, GK307, W367, T384, and W400; less than 50 bp shorter than wild type), intermediate (F286, IL290, MF299, LL316, DF338, WL341, LI372, and Y394; 50–200 bp shorter than wild type), or severe (LLP294, LL330, II376, and FF380; more than 200 bp shorter than wild type). The four strains with severe telomere shortening (LLP294, LL330, II376, and FF380) also exhibited reduced growth on agar plates as evidenced by reduced colony size (data not shown). In addition, these strains display evidence for amplification of the subtelomeric Y′ fragment (indicated by filled circlesin Fig. 2), which has been shown previously (51Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) to correlate with senescence and the generation of type I survivors. As predicted, the single non-SCR mutant (GK307) exhibited no defect in telomere maintenance. Surprisingly, five of the SCR mutants (CP261, LE264, W367, T384, and W400) showed either normal telomeres or very mild shortening. However, where it has been tested in other systems, the equivalent residues appear also to be relatively unimportant for telomerase enzyme activity or telomere maintenance (18Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R., Ma, L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

Cell. 2000; 6: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We conclude that sequence alignment in the CP, QFP, and T region is useful for identifying functionally important TERT residues. To determine whether the telomere maintenance defects can be explained by telomerase activity loss or alteration, we precipitated protein A-tagged telomerase from the wild type and mutant strains by adsorption to IgG-Sepharose, and we subjected the Sepharose beads to primer extension analysis. All of the mutant enzymes were tested side-by-side with wild type telomerase using a 16-mer oligonucleotide with non-canonical telomere repeats (TEL66) as the primer substrate (Fig. 3, A and B). In most cases, comparisons were also made using a 15-nt primer with canonical repeats (TEL15), which yielded very similar results (Fig. 3 B, and data not shown). As shown in representative assays and the summary plot (Fig. 3 C), there is an excellent correlation between the extent of telomere shortening and telomerase activity reduction. Mutant strains with the most severe telomere length defect contain essentially no telomerase activity (LLP294, LL330, II376, and FF380). For mutants with intermediate telomere defects, the reduction in telomerase activity ranges from ∼65% for F286 (which exhibits the least telomere length defect among the intermediate group) to ∼95% for DF338, WL341, LI372, and Y394 (which have the most length defect in this group). Mutant strains with mild or no defect had close to or more than 50% of the wild type level of telomerase activity (CP261, LE264, GK307, W367, T384, and W400). None of the mutants with detectable telomerase exhibited an obvious processivity defect (Fig. 3, A and B, and data not shown). Taken together, our results indicate that mutations in the CP, QFP, and T motif impair simultaneously telomere maintenance and telomerase activity but not telomerase processivity. To determine the basis for the activity loss manifested by the SCR mutants, we estimated the levels of TERT protein in wild type and mutant strains using antibodies directed against the protein A tag. The levels of TERT protein in the mutant strains were gauged by comparing the signal obtained from a fixed amount of mutant extract with those from varying amounts of wild type extract. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the mutants with significant telomere length defects consistently manifested a reduction in the amount of TERT protein. In addition, the extent of functional loss correlates loosely with the degree of protein reduction. For instance, the mutants with severe telomere shortening all had undetectable levels of TERT protein (LLP294, LL330, II376, and FF380), whereas those with intermedia"

We investigated the effect of the protein kinase Akt on IL-6-mediated transcriptional activation. The transient expression of constitutively active Akt inhibited the IL-6-dependent activity of the α2-macroglobulin promoter in HepG2 cells, whereas expression of an inactive mutant of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 had the opposite effect. Since Akt is known to regulate gene expression through inactivation of the transcription factor FKHR (forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma), we examined the effect of FKHR on STAT3-mediated transcriptional regulation. Indeed, the overexpression of FKHR specifically enhanced the activity of STAT3-dependent promoters but not that of a STAT5-responsive promoter. The effect of FKHR required the presence of functional STAT3 and was abrogated by the expression of dominant negative STAT3 mutants. Furthermore, FKHR and STAT3 were shown to coimmunoprecipitate and to colocalize in the nuclear regions of IL-6-treated HepG2 cells.

It exerts its actions through binding to the receptor complex consisting of a ligand-specific IL-6R α-chain (gp80) and two signal-transducing β-subunits (gp130). Activation of the gp130-associated Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the major mediator of IL-6-induced signaling (2Hirano T.

The STAT3-dependent action of IL-6 appears to be modulated by a variety of stimuli, including insulin and epidermal growth factor that have been reported to inhibit the APP production by cultured hepatic cells (4Campos S.P.

The potential inhibitory role of growth promoting signals on the IL-6-inducible Jak/STAT3 pathway corresponds well with the suppressed acute phase response in regenerating liver (6Milland J.

However, the mechanisms whereby growth factors mediate this effect remained unclear. One of the major effects of signaling via the insulin receptor and other growth factor receptors is the activation of PI 3-kinase (7Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Generation of PI 3-phosphorylated lipids in the plasma membrane leads to phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also called protein kinase B) by phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Activated Akt has been described to translocate to the nucleus (8Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigated a potential cross-talk between the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling and the IL-6-inducible Jak/STAT3 pathway.

The FKHR cDNA (a kind gift from Frank Rauscher) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/His C (Invitrogen) or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The pEGFP-FKHR expression plasmid was further digested with AccI, Van91I,BpiI, or HindIII in combination withBamHI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), filled in with Klenow, and religated to obtain FKHR Δ357, Δ505, Δ560, and Δ639, respectively. The FKHR point mutants (T24A, S256A, and S319A) were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting constructs were verified by sequencing. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected using FuGene6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (16Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C.

Luciferase activities were determined with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and the data were normalized according to co-expressed β-galactosidase (pCH110) or Renilla luciferase (pRLTK) activities. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Shown are the means ± S.D. of one representative experiment performed in triplicate. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells with the RNeasy kit from Qiagen. 10 μg of RNA were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membranes (Nytran; Schleicher and Schüll). Detection with the32P-labeled α2-macroglobulin (α2-M) probe was performed as described previously (18Siewert E. Bort R. Kluge R. Heinrich P.C. Castell J. Jover R. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the signals were detected using a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (13Kortylewski M. Heinrich P.C. Mackiewicz A. Schniertshauer U. Klingmuller U. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Horn F. Behrmann I.

Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 300 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The crude nuclei were incubated in lysis buffer B (1% (w/v) BRIJ-97, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Short sonication and centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C yielded the nuclear extracts. Total cellular lysates were prepared by direct lysis of the harvested cells in buffer B and processed as described above. Protein extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal antiserum against STAT3 (C-20), SMAD2/3 (N-19), or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (C-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or monoclonal antibodies against STAT5 (MGF; Transduction Laboratories). The precipitates were later collected with Protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences), washed three times with lysis buffer, and resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GelmanSciences), the blots were probed with the respective antibodies and detected for signals using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm ocadaic acid), and the Akt activity was assayed as described previously (19Barthel A.

The phosphopeptide spots were quantified using a Cyclone phosphor imager and the Optiquant software (Packard). Cells grown on coverslips to subconfluence were serum-deprived for the last 12 h, fixed, and permeabilized as described before (20Kortylewski M. Heinrich P.C. Kauffmann M.E. Bohm M. Mackiewicz A. Behrmann I. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For intracellular staining, polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibodies (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit antiserum against FKHR and then secondary donkey polyclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-coupled antibodies were used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After mounting, fluorescence images were visualized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM 510; Apochromat ×63 objective lens; Zeiss). Argon and helium-neon lasers were switched between the excitation wavelengths for fluorescein (λex = 488 nm) and rhodamine (λex = 543 nm) fluorescences, which were detected using a 505–530-nm band pass or 560-nm long pass emission filter, respectively. In agreement with previous studies (4Campos S.P. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Ripperger J. Fey G.H. Samols D. Kordula T. Wetzler M. Van Etten R.A. Baumann H. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 682-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we found that insulin inhibits the IL-6-induced expression of several acute phase plasma proteins, including α2-M in hepatoma cells. The levels of α2-M mRNA in IL-6-treated HepG2 hepatoma cells were significantly decreased in the presence of insulin (Fig. 1 A). One of the well known mediators of insulin signaling is PI 3-kinase, which further downstream activates the serine/threonine kinase Akt (7Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of insulin on α2-M expression could be partially relieved by an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, similar effects were also observed on the level of α2-M promoter activity using a fragment of the 5′-regulatory sequence of the rat α2-M gene, which is known for its high sensitivity to STAT3-mediated signaling (16Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T. Schindler C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate a potential cross-talk between the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and the IL-6-inducible Jak/STAT3 signal transduction cascade. Transfection of HepG2 cells with a constitutively active variant of Akt resulted in a significant reduction of the IL-6-mediated activation of a transfected α2-M promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (Fig. 2 A), comparable with the degree of inhibition by insulin (Fig. 1 B). Consistently, overexpression of a kinase-dead variant of PDK1 exerted the opposite effect and augmented the reporter gene activity. The effects observed using wild type forms of both kinases were less pronounced (data not shown). These results suggested that Akt kinase activity can negatively influence IL-6-dependent gene expression.Figure 2Activation of PDK1/Akt signaling inhibits the IL-6-mediated activation of the α2-M promoter through a FKHR-dependent mechanism. A, effect of constitutively active Akt (ca-Akt) and kinase-dead PDK1 (kd-PDK1) on the α2-M promoter activity in HepG2 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding constitutively active Akt or kinase-dead PDK1 and incubated with IL-6 (black bars) or left untreated (open bars). The IL-6-induced promoter activity of the mock-transfected controls was set as 100% in all experiments.B, dose-dependent effect of expressed FKHR-cDNA on the α2-M promoter activity in HepG2 cells. C, effect of PDK1 (left panel) and Akt (right panel) on the α2-M promoter activity in HepG2 cells overexpressing FKHR.

D, the effect of FKHR T24A, S256A, and S319A mutations on the α2-M promoter activity. HepG2 cells were transfected with reporter plasmids as above together with the expression vectors encoding wild type or point-mutated variants of green fluorescent protein-tagged FKHR (FKHR-T24A, FKHR-T24A/S256A, FKHR-T24A/S256A/S319A) or with an empty vector, and the relative luciferase activity was determined (left panel). The right panel shows a Western blot (WB) with total cell lysates (10 μg/lane) probed with anti-FKHR antibody to control the expression level of the different constructs.

Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether FKHR (FOXO1a), a forkhead transcription factor that has been reported to be regulated in an insulin-dependent manner in hepatic cells (22Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), is involved in α2-M promoter regulation. Transfection of HepG2 cells with increasing amounts of FKHR cDNA led to a marked and dose-dependent increase of the IL-6 responsiveness of the α2-M promoter (Fig. 2 B) without a significant effect on the promoter activity in untreated cells. In order to confirm that FKHR links Akt to IL-6 signaling, we examined whether its overexpression affects the inhibitory action of PDK1 and Akt. As shown in Fig. 2 C(left panel), wild type PDK1 decreased the IL-6-induced reporter gene activity by about 50% in FKHR-overexpressing cells, whereas the kinase-dead PDK1 mutant produced the opposite effect. In addition, overexpression of FKHR remarkably enhanced the effect of Akt. Whereas wild type Akt, similarly to wild type PDK1, decreased IL-6-mediated gene expression, expression of constitutively active Akt further reduced the reporter gene activity to about 25% of the control level (Fig. 2 C, right panel). The inactivation of FKHR by Akt results from a direct phosphorylation of three regulatory sites Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 (10Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), which in turn leads to cytoplasmic retention of FKHR (9Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

Dore J. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13402-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the influence of FKHR phosphorylation on α2-M promoter activity, we compared the effects of wild type FKHR and mutated FKHR variants lacking the first, the first two, or all three phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2 D). All three examined FKHR mutants were more efficient than wild type FKHR in augmenting the IL-6-induced α2-M promoter activity. Interestingly, mutation of threonine 24 to alanine was already sufficient for a nearly maximal effect; introduction of additional point mutations (S256A and S319A, respectively) did not lead to a significant further increase in promoter activity. These results indicate that PDK1/Akt signaling can modulate the transcriptional activation of IL-6-responsive genes by targeting FKHR. IL-6 has been reported to activate Akt in Hep3B and different cells from myeloma patients (25Chen R.H. Chang M.C. Su Y.H. Tsai Y.T. Kuo M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Tu Y. Gardner A. Lichtenstein A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6763-6770PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, IL-6 stimulation should result in nuclear translocation of activated STAT3 and concomitant repression and nuclear exclusion of FKHR. However, whereas insulin induced a robust and sustained activation of Akt, IL-6 did not significantly stimulate Akt kinase activity over its basal level in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 A). The low Akt activity after IL-6 stimulation was reflected by the lack of its phosphorylation on two critical regulatory residues, Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig. 3 B). This also correlated with the low phosphorylation status of Thr24 and Ser256, two residues of FKHR, which become directly targeted by Akt (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, Akt and FKHR were both strongly phosphorylated after treatment of the cells with insulin, and their activation was not significantly affected by the presence of IL-6. However, as expected, IL-6 strongly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, the major transcription factor mediating IL-6-dependent signal transduction (2Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 3Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 D). The pattern of Akt, FKHR, and STAT3 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells after 16 h of IL-6 and/or insulin treatment was qualitatively similar, although the phosphorylation of STAT3 was less prominent (data not shown). We conclude that in HepG2 cells, IL-6 cannot induce Akt activity and consequently does not repress FKHR. In order to clarify the role of FKHR for the regulation of the α2-M promoter, we investigated whether FKHR modifies the function of STAT3, the crucial mediator of IL-6 signaling (2Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 3Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Coexpression of STAT3 and FKHR in HepG2 cells indeed synergistically increased the responsiveness of the α2-M promoter to IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, FKHR expression had no effect on the transcriptional activation of the β-casein promoter by STAT5, another member of the STAT family of transcription factors (Fig. 4 B). Likewise, FKHR did not enhance the activity of transcription factors unrelated to STATs such as SMADS, the mediators of tumor growth factor-β signaling (data not shown). Hence, FKHR appears to be a specific transcriptional coactivator of STAT3-responsive promoters. The stimulatory effect of FKHR on the α2-M promoter activation essentially depends on the presence of functional STAT3, since overexpression of dominant negative STAT3 factors (STAT3F or STAT3D, respectively) (28Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) almost completely abrogated the FKHR-mediated induction of α2-M promoter activity (Fig. 4 C). This is also consistent with the observation that expression of FKHR efficiently up-regulates IL-6 responsiveness of an artificial promoter, comprising a tandem of isolated STAT3 consensus binding sites (Fig. 4 D). These results suggest that the transcriptional effects of FKHR are indirect and result from an enhanced activity of STAT3. The PAX3-FKHR fusion protein from alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma was shown to possess a strong transactivation domain localized in its C-terminal FKHR-derived part (29Lam P.Y. Sublett J.E. Hollenbach A.D. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Bennicelli J.L. Fredericks W.J. Wilson R.B. Rauscher III, F.J. Barr F.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the complete C-terminal part of FKHR was also required for its effect on the α2-M promoter activation (Fig. 4, E and F). FKHR was recently shown to interact in HepG2 cells with the coactivator p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), which is also essential for its transcriptional activity (31Nasrin N. Ogg S. Cahill C.M. Biggs W. Nui S. Dore J. Calvo D. Shi Y. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). STAT3 is also capable of recruiting p300/CBP, but this interaction and the level of transactivation are relatively weak in comparison with other STATs like STAT2 (32Paulson M. Pisharody S. Pan L. Guadagno S. Mui A.L. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25343-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that activating proteins like the STATs most often do not act alone but rather in combination with other site-specific or more general DNA-binding proteins as well as with coactivators of transcription (33Bromberg J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 34Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transcriptional function of STAT3 might be further enhanced by FKHR acting as an accessory factor that directs coactivator complexes to STAT3 sites in the promoter. In order to estimate if both proteins may interact in vivo, we assessed the localization of endogenous STAT3 and FKHR in HepG2 cells. We found by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy that in unstimulated cells the localization of FKHR (Fig. 5, right panels) was predominantly nuclear, whereas STAT3 (Fig. 5, left panels) was distributed equally in the nuclear and cytoplasmic regions. It is noteworthy that, although STAT3 was present in the nuclei of untreated HepG2 cells, it did not bind DNA as measured in gel shift experiments (data not shown). Consistent with our previous observations, IL-6 stimulation did not affect FKHR localization but induced STAT3 migration to the nucleus, so that both factors accumulated in the nuclear regions of IL-6-treated HepG2 cells. In contrast, insulin treatment with or without IL-6 costimulation led to partial nuclear exclusion of FKHR. However, this effect was significantly weaker in HepG2 cells than in HeLa cells used as positive controls (27Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that FKHR might associate with STAT3 in the nuclei of IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cells. Since FKHR specifically contributes to the activation of STAT3-dependent promoters, we investigated whether this effect reflects a physical interaction between these two proteins. Western blot analysis indicated that FKHR was expressed in HepG2 cells at a low level and could be visualized only in highly concentrated total cellular lysates (Fig. 3 C; compare to Figs.2 D and 6 A). In contrast, FKHR was easily detectable in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-STAT3 antibodies from total cell lysates of HepG2 cells (Fig. 6 A), indicating the association of both proteins. The reverse immunoprecipitation experiments performed using antiserum against FKHR yielded similar results and led to coprecipitation of STAT3 from total cellular lysates, confirming the previous results (Fig. 6 A). To further consolidate the specificity of the interaction between FKHR and STAT3, we carried out several additional control immunoprecipitations. As shown in Fig. 6 B, FKHR did not associate with STAT5 or other unrelated signaling molecules like SMAD2/3 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. This allows us to conclude that the functional interaction of FKHR and STAT3 reflects a specific binding of both proteins. Although STAT3 and FKHR were found to be associated also in total cell lysates from untreated cells, stimulation with IL-6 strongly enhanced the binding of both factors in the nuclear fraction of HepG2 cells (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, in agreement with our results on insulin-mediated inhibition of α2-M gene expression, costimulation with insulin abrogated the IL-6-induced interaction between STAT3 and FKHR in the nucleus. Therefore, the negative regulation of IL-6-dependent gene expression by the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway appears to result from the loss of cooperation bet"

Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), and hence this enzyme can act upon G:T mismatches that result from the deamination of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) at CpG sites. The importance of this enzyme for mutation avoidance in mammals is confirmed by an increase in 5mC to T mutations inMbd4 −/− Big Blue mouse and by increased occurrence of colon carcinoma in Mbd4 −/− Apc Min/+ mice (2Millar C.B. Guy J. Sansom O.J. Selfridge J. MacDougall E. Hendrich B. Keightley P.D. Bishop S.M. Clarke A.R. Bird A. Science. 2002; 297: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies of MBD4 (also called MED1) using the yeast two-hybrid system have shown that it interacts with MLH1 (a protein implicated in mismatch repair) and suggest a role for this enzyme in maintaining genome stability (3Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3969-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, it is found that MBD4 is mutated in 26–43% of human colorectal tumors that show microsatellite instability (4Riccio A. Aaltonen L.A. Godwin A.K. Loukola A. Percesepe A. Salovaara R. Masciullo V. Genuardi M. Paravatou-Petsotas M. Bassi D.E. Ruggeri B.A. Klein-Szanto A.J. Testa J.R. Neri G. Bellacosa A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MBD4 is not the only DNA glycosylase reported to excise thymines from G:T mismatches. Another enzyme, named thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), was identified earlier to have this ability (5Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Trung O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, TDG is unrelated to MBD4 and belongs to the same structural superfamily as the uracil-excising enzymes UDG (6Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and SMUG1 (7Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.E. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). MBD4 also differs from TDG in its substrate preference. Whereas the preferred substrates for TDG are N 4-ethenocytosine or uracil paired with a G (8Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), MBD4 prefers thymine overN 4-ethenocytosine (9Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32422-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recombinant MBD4 can also remove uracil, 5-fluorouracil, and 5mC at a low rate, particularly when these bases are opposite a guanine within CpG dinucleotides (1Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.-H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 9Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4157-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The MBD domain of MBD4 is similar to domains within four other mammalian proteins, MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD3 (reviewed in Refs. 11Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholarand 12Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The latter proteins are involved in suppressing transcription in regions of heavy CpG methylation, but no such role has been ascribed to MBD4. Whereas the NMR structures of the MBD domains from MBD1 (13Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J.-G. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,14Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Nakao M. Shirakawa M.

Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have been elucidated, no structural information regarding the glycosylase domain of MBD4 is available. Here we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal glycosylase domain of MBD4, and we show that it belongs to the helix-hairpin-helix DNA glycosylase superfamily. The glycosylase domain alone is active on DNA duplex containing a G:T mismatch within a CpG sequence context. The full-length mouse MBD4 was expressed as a His-tagged fusion protein in vector pET6H (16Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The four fragments of MBD4 (Fig. 1 A), amino acids 49–187 (MBD domain), 400–554 (glycosylase domain or Δ399), 49–554 (Δ48), and 429–554 (Δ428), were cloned into a modified pET28b (Novagen) vector, which contains an N-terminal tag of MGHHHHHH and accepts anNdeI-EcoRI insert. The Δ428 fragment was also expressed as a GST fusion in pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences).E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying respective plasmid was grown in LB media supplemented with appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.6, shifted to 22 °C, and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 22 °C, except that the full-length MBD4 was induced at 37 °C for 1 h. The full-length and Δ48 proteins were purified from cleared lysates using three successive chromatography steps as follows: a nickel chelate column, a HiTrap heparin column, and Superdex 200 (AmershamBiosciences). The proteins were stored in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 m NaCl. The MBD domain and the glycosylase domain were purified using nickel chelate, HiTrap Q, and Superdex 75 columns. The proteins were stored in a high salt buffer for crystallization (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 0.5m NaCl) or in a low salt buffer for activity assay (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl). The GST-Δ428 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) and HiTrap Q column. The protein was stored in the low salt buffer. Protease V8 was added, as described previously (17Dong A. Yoder J.A. Zhang X. Zhou L. Bestor T.H. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), to MBD4 for 15 min incubation at room temperature. Addition of the protease inhibitor 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone stopped the reaction, and two major MBD4 fragments were observed via SDS-PAGE. The mass of the two fragments was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to be 15,353.5 and 18,537.2 Da. The N-terminal sequences of the two fragments were also determined. Combining these results allowed us to deduce that the fragments represent residues 49–187 (the MBD domain) and residues 400–554 (the C-terminal glycosylase domain) (Fig. 1 A). Crystals of the MBD4 glycosylase domain stored in the high salt buffer were obtained in hanging drops under the conditions of 22–27% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 190–230 mm ammonium sulfate, 10–15% ethylene glycol, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.26. The initial drops were set up at 16 °C and moved to 4 °C after overnight incubation. Two crystal forms were observed, good looking diamond-shaped crystals appeared earlier at 16 °C but diffracted x-rays poorly. Rather unpromising colorless crystals appeared after 2–3 weeks only at 4 °C, but these diffracted x-rays strongly and belonged to space group P3121, based on the systematic absence of reflections along the z axis. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit, and unit cell dimensions were a = b = 48.58 Å and c = 146.57 Å. Selenomethionine-containing glycosylase domain Δ399 was expressed in a methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3) grown in LeMaster medium (18Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) supplemented with 25 μg/ml Se-methionine, and the protein was purified similarly to the native protein. X-ray diffraction data for the native and the single-site selenomethionine substitution crystals were collected (Table I), respectively, by an RAXIS-IV imaging plate detector equipped with a Rigaku rotating anode generator (50 kV, 100 mA) and a Brandeis B2 (1 × 1) CCD-based detector at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X12-C. The resulting images were processed using HKL (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). One surface selenium site (SeMet447 of αC) was determined by SOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) was then used to modify the electron density map at 2.5-Å resolution (overall figure of merit 0.54). The modified map was of excellent quality to place amino acids 411–554 of MBD4 into the recognizable densities by using the graphic program O (22Jones T.A. Kjeldgard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Electron density was not observed for the first 11 residues (400–410 of the full-length protein). The resulting model was refined to 2.09 Å resolution using X-PLOR (23Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) (Table I), with a final crystallographic R-factor of 0.213 and R-free of 0.263 (for 9% of total 21,552 reflections).Table IX-ray data collection and structural refinement statisticsCrystalNativeSeMetWavelength (Å)1.540.978900.978650.95Resolution (Å)20-2.1/2.14-2.120-2.1/2.15-2.120-2.1/2.15-2.120-2.1/2.15-2.1Completeness (%)99.5/99.880.4/29.180.2/28.785.1/39.6R-merge0.046/0.0980.028/0.0610.026/0.0610.025/0.066I/ς(I)42.751.250.747.9Unique reflections12,345/5859,965/2309,944/22810,531/314Total reflections107,77858,65455,02963,278Ramachandran plotMost favored regions (%)93.4Additionally allowed regions (%)6.6Root mean square deviation from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.01Bond angles (°)1.5Dihedrals (°)23.4Improper (°)1.4G-factorDihedrals0.21Covalent0.45Overall0.31Average thermal factor (Å2)Main chain19.7Side chain20.9 Open table in a new tab The His-tagged full-length MBD4, Δ48, MBD domain (amino acids 49–187), glycosylase domain Δ399, and Δ428 were all transformed into an E. colistrain BH161, which carries ung − and a copy of T7 RNA polymerase (24Beletskii A. Grigoriev A. Joyce S. Bhagwat A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ten milliliters of culture was grown from each clone in LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (full-length MBD4) or 50 μg/ml kanamycin (all MBD4 fragments) at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.6. The cultures were induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the cells were recovered by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were washed with a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 15 min. Finally, the cells were broken by sonication on ice, and cell-free lysate was recovered following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the extracts was determined using the Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad). The following oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen: T-oligo, 5′-GACTGGCTGCTCCTGGGCGAAGTGCC-3′; G-oligo, 5′-GGGCACTTCGCCCGGGAGCAGCCAGTC-3′. The oligonucleotides were gel-purified prior to their use. The T-oligo was labeled at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was terminated by heating it to 65 °C for 20 min. The labeled T-oligo was mixed with 3-fold molar excess of the unlabeled G-oligo in the STE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 3 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature over a period of 2–3 h to promote duplex formation. The unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed from the labeled duplex by passage through a G-50 micro column (Amersham Biosciences). Twenty nm labeled duplex was equilibrated with nicking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the reactions were initiated by adding 100 ng of purified MBD4 variants (Fig. 5 A) or 2 μg of cell-free extract (Fig. 5 B). Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by heating to 95 °C for 7 min in the presence of 0.1 m NaOH. Subsequently, 8 μl of gel loading dye (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue) was added to the samples which were then heated to 95 °C and electrophoresed in 20% sequencing gel. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences), and the reaction products were quantified using ImageQuant software. The overall structure of MBD4 glycosylase domain consists of 11 helices (αA to αK) (Fig. 1 B) forming a single domain with a cleft in the middle (Fig. 2). Structural comparison with other DNA glycosylases (Fig. 3, A and B) reveals that the MBD4 glycosylase domain belongs to thehelix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA glycosylase superfamily (25Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), named after a conserved structural motif αH-hairpin loop-αI (shown in red in Fig. 2 A). The six helices before the HhH motif (αB to αG in green) are highly conserved structural elements among family members, forming the bottom of the cleft in the orientation shown (Fig. 2 A). Among the known HhH enzymes, MBD4 has the shortest sequence following the HhH motif (Fig. 1 B). The C-terminal helices αJ and αK, the short N-terminal helix αA, and its 12-residue preceding loop, the HhH motif, come together to form a hydrophobic core (Fig. 2 C), forming the top of the cleft.Figure 3Structural comparison of HhH glycosylases.

E, the MBD domain of MBD4 has not yet been structurally characterized; however, the NMR solution structure of the MBD domain of MBD1 was shown to bind DNA from the major groove side (13Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J.-G. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The high degree of structural similarity among HhH glycosylases allowed us to create a model of the MBD4 glycosylase domain bound to DNA. By using the coordinates of the AlkA-DNA (26Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or hOGG1-DNA (27Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) complexes, we superimposed the protein components, and then the DNA was positioned over the surface of MBD4 with the cleft. Previous modeling studies of other HhH glycosylases MutY and EndoIII suggested that they bind to DNA in a manner similar to that of AlkA (26Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our modeling suggests that the MBD4 glycosylase domain also binds DNA similarly to AlkA and hOGG1, which bind DNA via the minor groove and bend it ∼70° at the damaged base (26Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The residues that contact the DNA backbone in the hOGG1 and AlkA structures occupy similar positions in the free MBD4 structure (Fig. 3 C), and the MBD4 glycosylase domain could contact bent DNA without major physical distortion of the protein component (Fig. 3 D). Two important DNA-binding loops are superimposed, the loop between helices αB and αC and the Gly-rich hairpin loop of HhH motif (Fig. 3 C). Arg442 of MBD4, as well as Arg47 of MIG (28Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Begley T.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is in the same position as Leu125 of AlkA (or Asn149 of hOGG1) that fills the space in the DNA duplex vacated by the flipped nucleotide. Thr443 of MBD4 is in the same position as Asn150 of hOGG1 that makes main chain contacts to the phosphate groups 3′ to the flipped nucleotide. Ser444 of MBD4 is in the position of Asn151 of hOGG1 that forms hydrogen bonds with the base 5′ immediate to the flipped nucleotide. It seems that the loop between helices αB and αC contains residues (Arg442–Thr443–Ser444) important for DNA binding and base flipping. First, where is the active site? In analogy to the AlkA-DNA (26Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and hOGG1-DNA (27Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) complexes, the MBD4 cleft defines the location of the active site (Fig. 4 A). The target nucleotide is likely to be flipped out from the DNA helix into the active-site cleft of the enzyme, in a similar manner to AlkA or hOGG1. The structural superimposition of the HhH glycosylase-DNA complexes and the unbound MBD4 reveals several informative features. Interestingly, the flipped base can only be docked into the active site by stacking the base between the side chains of Leu440 of αB and Lys536 of αK (Fig. 4 B). Although these residues are not conserved in HhH glycosylases, similar stacking appears to be conserved: in hOGG1 8-oxoguanine is between Cys253 and Phe319 (27Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) and in MutY adenine soaked into the crystal lies between Leu40 and Met185 (29Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Leu440 of MBD4 corresponds to Leu40 of MutY (Figs. 1 B and 4 E), whereas MutY Met185 corresponds to Phe319 of hOGG1. A second question is where the key catalytic residues are located. Asp534, the last residue prior to helix αK (Fig. 1 B), is in a position structurally equivalent to the catalytically important Asp238 of AlkA (26Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), Asp268 of hOGG1 (27Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), Asp138 of MutY (29Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and Asp138 of EndoIII (30Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been suggested for the function of this structurally conserved aspartic acid in HhH glycosylases: (i) it activates a catalytic nucleophile, which is either a water (29Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) or the ε-amino group of a lysine (27Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), for the attack on the deoxyribose C1′ carbon atom of the target nucleotide; or (ii) it directly assists base removal by protonating the leaving group of the substrate sugar (26Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the docking model of MBD4-thymine (Fig. 4 C), the C1′ position of a modeled substrate is in direct contact (∼3.0 Å) with the carboxylate of Asp534, which would favor the second (protonation) mechanism. A third question regarding the MBD4 action is how it distinguishes an A:T pair from a G:T. Although it is possible that the protein distinguishes G:T from an A:T because of their differing geometries, it is also possible that it may make specific contacts with the guanine in a manner similar to E. coli MUG (31Barrett T.E. Scharer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or hOGG1 (27Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L.

A detailed answer to this question must await the availability of a MBD4-DNA co-crystal structure. How does the flipped base specifically bound in the active site? In MutY the adenine soaked into the crystal are recognized by Glu37 and Gln182 (29Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D). Structural superimposition between MutY and MBD4 (Fig. 3 A) indicates the side chains of Gln-423 and Tyr514 of MBD4 are in the vicinity of the adenine-specific interacting side chains of MutY (Fig. 4 E). In MBD4, the two polar residues (Gln423 of αA and Tyr514 of αI) and three hydrophobic residues (Val422 prior to αA, Gly445, and Ile449 of αC) line in the cleft next to the catalytic Asp534 (Fig. 4 A). We suggest that these amino acids are the major determinants of specificity after docking the flipped thymine into the binding pocket. In the absence of the target nucleotide, the active site is occupied by ordered water molecules (Fig. 2 D), which lie almost in a plane and directly interact with Tyr514, Gln423, and Val422(Fig. 4 C). We docked a thymine with its Watson-Crick pairing edge (O-2, N-3, and O-4) occupying three water sites (Fig. 4 C). The OH group of Tyr514 can make one hydrogen bond with the O-2 atom, the side chain carbonyl C = O of Gln423 can make a hydrogen bond to the protonated N-3-H. In addition, the main chain N-H group of Val422 can make a hydrogen bond to the O-4 atom. Gly445 and Ile449 form a surface hydrophobic patch near the end of the cleft, in a perfect position to accommodate the methyl group of thymine. Of all contacts made to the thymine base (Fig. 4 F), the hydrophobic-methyl interaction will be absent for a uracil base. Interestingly, Glu, Gln, or Tyr are often found in the active site of the HhH glycosylases. A glutamate is found in MIG (Glu42; Ref. 28Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Begley T.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. J.

A tyrosine is proposed for interacting target thymine in MIG (28Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Begley T.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. J. Mol.

Among these diseases, diabetes and insulin resistance are epidemic worldwide and are expected to affect 300 million people by 2025 (1Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar). Recently, abnormalities of fatty-acid metabolism are recognized as key components of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance (2Moller D.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 3Kelley D.E. Goodpaster B.H. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 4Kelley D.E.

High fat diet and raised levels of circulating free fatty acids are sufficient to induce insulin resistance that is related to the fat content of skeletal muscle in rats (6Storlien L.H. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Pascoe W.S. Khouri S. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Accumulation of lipids inside muscle cells and, specifically, an increase in muscle long chain fatty acyl-CoA content are reported to cause insulin resistance. This suggests that abnormal fatty acid metabolism and the accumulation of lipid in skeletal muscle play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (7Krssak M. Falk Petersen K. Dresner A.

Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the relation between insulin resistance and muscle triglyceride content is independent of total adiposity. Although the details of the mechanisms connecting lipid accumulation and insulin resistance are still unclear, studies of insulin receptor signaling reveal that the accumulation of lipid products causes the phosphorylation of insulin receptor as well as insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 through protein kinase C activation. This results in the inhibition of insulin receptor signaling (4Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Recently identified molecules involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance act at least partially through the alteration of fatty acid metabolism. Adiponectin, whose secretion from white adipose tissue is reduced in insulin-resistant animal models, induces tissue fatty acid oxidation, leading to a reduction of tissue steatosis and reduced plasma glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acids concentrations (9Yamauchi N.

Here, we report a novel nuclear protein, termed diabetes-related ankyrin repeat protein (DARP),1 that is up-regulated in the heart of KKAy mouse, a type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance model animal. DARP-expressing CHO cells demonstrate significantly decreased [1-14C]palmitate uptake. Furthermore, DARP expression in skeletal muscle is altered by a change of energy supply both in vitro and in vivo. Also, DARP expression is altered in Zucker fatty rat, another insulin resistance model animal. These results suggest that DARP is a novel nuclear protein that is potentially involved in energy metabolism. Total RNA was extracted from the heart of 10-week-old KKAy and C57BL/6J mice (Nihon Crea) using ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Suppression-subtractive hybridization was performed using PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech) with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA purified from total RNA using the FastTrack 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturers. Subtracted cDNAs were subcloned into pT7 vector (Novagen) and sequenced. The 5′ end of DARP cDNA was cloned by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) (Invitrogen) against C57BL/6J mouse heart. The primers for 5′-RACE were designed according to the sequences obtained by the search of GenBankTM(5′-TTCACCAGCTGTCTGTGGCCCTTCAGACA-3′ for synthesis of first strand cDNA, 5′-CAGGTACTTGTCAATCAGGGCCTCCTGGT-3′ for first PCR, and 5′-TTTAGTTTCTCCCGGGGCCACAGCCTCTT-3′ for nested PCR). The full-length cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR as described (13Ikeda K. Emoto N. Raharjo S.B. Nurhantari Y. Saiki K. Yokoyama M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32469-32477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Human DARP cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using human skeletal muscle total RNA (Sawady Technology). The primers were designed according to the sequences obtained by the search of GenBank (forward primer: 5′-GGACCATGGACTTCATCAGCATTCAGCA-3′; reverse: 5′-TCAGCACCGGGTGCGGGGATGCGCCACGT-3′). For nucleotide sequencing, overlapping restriction fragments of the cDNA were subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. Both strands of cDNA were covered at least twice. 338-bp cDNA, corresponding to the 3′ end of mouse DARP coding region, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, was used for Northern analysis with QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. The washed blots were exposed to imaging plate analyzed by BAS analyzer (Fuji film). Rat skeletal myoblasts were isolated from rat soleus muscles as described (14Taylor D.A. Silvestry S.C. Bishop S.P. Annex B.H. Lilly R.E. Glower D.D. Kraus W.E. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent myoblasts were differentiated into myotube by incubating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum (differentiation medium) for 4 days. Differentiated myotube were cultured for another 24 h with or without 250 μm oleic acid-albumin (Sigma). CHO-K1 cells were cultured as previously described (15Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Oligo nucleotides that encode a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) were inserted at the end of the DARP coding region by PCR-based mutagenesis (DARP-FLAG cDNA). The primers used were 5′-GGACCATGGACTTCATCAGCATTGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-TCATTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCACCGGGTACGGGGATGGCCCAC-3′. The DARP-FLAG cDNA was subcloned into the pME18Sf expression vector (14Taylor D.A. Silvestry S.C. Bishop S.P. Annex B.H. Lilly R.E. Glower D.D. Kraus W.E. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfection of CHO cells and isolation of the transfectant clones were performed as described (14Taylor D.A. Silvestry S.C. Bishop S.P. Annex B.H. Lilly R.E. Glower D.D. Kraus W.E. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, DARP-FLAG expression construct was co-transfected with pSV2neo vector into CHO cells by lipofection. 24 h after transfection, cells were seeded sparsely and incubated in the medium containing 0.1% G418 for 1 week. Isolated colonies were picked up using a cloning cup, and we confirmed the expression of DARP-FLAG mRNA and protein. Transient transfection of DARP-FLAG into COS-7 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (1% zwittergent, 50 mm phosphate, and 150 mm NaCl), and the concentrations of which were measured by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) based on the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 30 μg of each protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with TBS containing 5% (v/v) skim milk for 30 min, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) followed by washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 three times for 5 min each. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h. After washing the membrane three times for 15 min each, signals were detected using ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. 30 μg of each fraction were subjected to Western blot analysis. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. After washing in PBS, PBS containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum (NGS/PBS) was added. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the NGS/PBS was replaced with buffer containing anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:300). After incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed with PBS three times for 10 min each and then incubated in NGS/PBS containing 1.7 μg/ml of RITC-goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (EY Laboratories) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells were washed six times with PBS for 10 min each. The coverslips were mounted on the slides with 90% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and 2.5% (v/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane and observed with a confocal fluorescent microscopy. [1-14C]Palmitate-BSA was prepared as described (16Luiken J.J. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. America G. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 745-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, [1-14C]palmitic acid dissolved in toluene (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated at 35 °C under nitrogen gas to evaporate toluene. After evaporation, the palmitic acid was dissolved in water containing KOH by incubating at 40 °C. Subsequently, palmitate solution was mixed well with BSA-containing solution in the ratio of 700 mg of BSA and 7.7 mg of palmitate. To examine the effect of DARP on [1-14C]palmitate metabolism, approximately an equal number of CHO cells with or without expression of DARP-FLAG were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 40 μm [1-14C]palmitate for 6 h. For determination of the palmitate uptake, cells were washed three times with PBS and harvested. After collection by brief centrifugation, the cell pellet was dissolved in scintillation fluid assayed for radioactivity. For determination of palmitate oxidation, cells were cultured in the sealed flask containing a suspended filter paper. The 14CO2 in the medium was liberated by addition of 1 ml of 6 n hydrochloric acid. The14CO2 collected overnight on the filter paper alkalized with 2 n sodium hydroxide was quantified by scintillation counting. Animal care and procedures were in accordance with guidelines and regulations of the institutional animal care committee. To examine DARP expression, 8-week-old Zucker fatty and lean rats (Charles River, Japan) were used. For fasting, 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups. One group was maintained on chow, a second was fasted for 48 h, and a third was fasted for 48 h followed by unrestricted access to chow for 48 h. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. as indicated. Statistical analyses of the characteristics of Zucker rats and Northern blot analyses were performed with a Mann-Whitney's U test. Differences between mean values obtained for palmitate metabolism studies were determined by a Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. In the heart, energy metabolism is appreciably active and dynamic. Alteration of heart energy metabolism is reported in diabetes and insulin resistance model animals (17Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Gibbs E.M. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E1104-E1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chatham J.C. Forder J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H52-H58PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate genes that are involved in energy metabolism, we have performed suppression-subtractive hybridization using the heart of the KKAy mouse, a model mouse of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Since the KKAy mouse shows obesity and insulin resistance due to polygene impairment, there is no authentic normal control mouse with same genetic background. Although the KK mouse is used as a control for the KKAy mouse in several studies, the KK mouse shows mild diabetic phenotype. Thus, KK mouse is not an appropriate control mouse for our experiments, and we used the C57 mouse as a control. We then successfully identified a novel gene, termed DARP, whose expression is up-regulated in KKAy mouse heart as compared with C57 mouse heart (Fig. 1). Nucleotide homology search of the GenBank and 5′-RACE using mouse heart total RNA allowed us to isolate a full-length DARP cDNA. DARP encodes 306 amino acids containing putative nuclear localization signals and four tandem ankyrin (ANK)-like repeats. The amino acid sequence of DARP showed high similarity to cardiac ankyrin-repeat protein (CARP) and ankyrin-repeat domain 2 (Ankrd2) with 45 and 36% identities, respectively (Fig. 2 A). We also isolated human DARP cDNA by RT-PCR using human skeletal muscle total RNA (Fig. 2 B). Searching the GenBank of human DARP gene revealed that it is located at chromosome 2p11.1–2q11.1 where no genetic diseases are reported.Figure 2Amino acid sequence of human and mouse DARP.A, amino acid sequence of mouse DARP aligned with mouse CARP and Ankrd2. Conserved residues are marked by closed boxes. Underlined residues are the four tandem ankyrin-like repeats. Putative nuclear localization signals are marked byasterisks.

The sequences are available under GenBank accession number AF492400 and AF492401.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues revealed that DARP is expressed most abundantly in skeletal muscle and also highly expressed in heart and brown adipose tissue (Fig. 3). All of these tissues are metabolically highly active. No signal was observed in other tissues, including brain, lung, liver, kidney, intestine, and white adipose. Since DARP contains putative nuclear localization signals, we investigated whether DARP is indeed a nuclear protein. We prepared CHO cells that stably express DARP with FLAG tag attached at its C terminus (CHO/DARP-FLAG). Western blot analysis of the cell lysate of CHO/DARP-FLAG demonstrated appropriate DARP expression in the size of ∼34.3 kDa, although nonspecific signals were observed in both CHO/DARP-FLAG and vector-transfected CHO cells (CHO/MOCK) (Fig. 4 A). Immunocytochemistry of CHO/MOCK demonstrated relatively strong immunoreactivities dispersed diffusely, presumably due to nonspecific cross-reaction with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). We then performed Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of CHO/DARP-FLAG as described. Appreciable amount of DARP-FLAG expression was observed in the nuclear fraction, although a significant amount of protein still remained in the cytoplasmic fraction, presumably due to ongoing protein synthesis (Fig. 4 B). To further confirm its nuclear localization, we performed Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of COS-7 cells in which DARP-FLAG was transiently transfected (COS/DARP-FLAG). In COS/DARP-FLAG cells, we also detected the appreciable amount of DARP-FLAG expression in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4 B). Immunocytochemistry of COS/DARP-FLAG cells demonstrated strong immunoreactivities in the nucleus, whereas no significant immunoreactivities were observed in vector-transfected COS-7 cells (COS/MOCK) (Fig. 4 C). These findings indicate that DARP is a nuclear protein. Recently, evidence that abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is increasing. Abundant expression of DARP in skeletal muscle and its altered expression in the KKAy mouse led us to investigate its function in fatty acid metabolism. We prepared three individual stable transfectants of CHO cells that stably express DARP-FLAG (CHO/DARP-1, 2 and 3) and compared their [1-14C]palmitate metabolism to that of parental CHO cells (CHO/control). The expression of DARP-FLAG mRNA and protein were confirmed by Northern blot and Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, A andB). After 6 h of incubation in medium containing 40 μm [1-14C]palmitate, palmitate uptake, measured as the amount of radioactivity in the cells, slightly but significantly decreased in all three stable transfectants that express DARP-FLAG compared with control (Fig. 5 C). On the other hand, palmitate oxidation in DARP-FLAG transfectants did not show significant differences from that of control cells (Fig. 5 D). We then examined the effect of exogenous energy supply on DARP expression. In skeletal myotube, addition of 250 μm oleate in differentiation medium containing glucose significantly increased DARP expression after 24 h of incubation, indicating that DARP expression is altered by exogenous energy supply in vitro(Fig. 6 A). There was no significant morphological change after addition of oleate, and the expression of acetylcholine receptor α subunit (AchRα), a marker of differentiated myotubes, did not change. These findings suggest that addition of oleate in the medium does not affect the differentiation state of skeletal myotube. To confirm the regulation of DARP expression by energy supply, we further examined the effect of fasting on DARP expression using the C57 mouse in vivo. After 48 h of fasting, DARP expression in skeletal muscle was significantly reduced. Interestingly, 48 h of re-feeding after 48 h of fasting increased DARP expression in skeletal muscle to an even higher level than that of control mice without fasting (Fig. 6 B). However, fasting showed no significant effects on DARP expression in either the heart or brown adipose tissue (data not shown). These observations indicate that DARP expression is, at least partially, regulated by the energy supply in skeletal muscle both in vitro and in vivo. We cannot exclude the possibility that enhanced DARP expression in KKAy mouse heart is due to the difference of genetic background between KKAy and C57 mice. Therefore, we examined DARP expression in another type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance model animal, Zucker fatty rats. Zucker fatty rats showed significantly higher body weight and plasma insulin level than those of Zucker lean control rats, whereas the blood glucose of both groups was not significantly different, indicating that they are appropriate model animal for insulin resistance (Table I). DARP expression in heart and skeletal muscle was significantly higher in Zucker fatty rats than Zucker lean control rats (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, DARP expression in brown adipose was significantly lower in Zucker fatty rats as compared with that of control rats (Fig. 7 C). These results indicate that DARP expression is indeed altered in insulin resistance animals.Table ICharacteristics of Zucker lean and fatty ratsBody weightBlood glucosePlasma insulingmg/dlng/mlZucker lean rat212.40 ± 2.68179.20 ± 34.422.00 ± 0.52Zucker fatty rat282.40 ± 2.11*185.80 ± 18.919.66 ± 2.03** Data are mean ± S.E.

We have described the cloning and characterization of DARP, a novel nuclear protein, whose mRNA expression is altered in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance model animals. From the data presented in this manuscript, we are unable to determine whether DARP has a clear function in free fatty acid metabolism. However, its restricted expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose and relevance to fatty acid metabolism suggest that analysis of DARP may reveal new insights in the energy metabolism. Amino acid sequencing of DARP revealed that it contains putative nuclear localization signals and four tandem ANK-like repeats, sharing high homology with CARP and Ankrd2. CARP was initially identified as a cytokine-inducible nuclear protein from human endothelial cells (19Chu W. Burns D.K. Swerlick R.A. Presky D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10236-10245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Later, CARP was reported to be a downstream molecule in the Nkx2–5 homeobox gene pathway in cardiomyocyte (20Zou Y. Evans S. Chen J. Kuo H.C. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R.

Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nagai R. Kurabayashi M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, its physiological function is still unclear. Ankrd2 was identified from mouse skeletal muscle as a gene putatively responsible for stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy (22Kemp T.J. Sadusky T.J. Saltisi F. Carey N. Moss J. Yang S.Y. Sassoon D.A. Goldspink G. Coulton G.R. Genomics. 2000; 66: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Moriyama M. Tsukamoto Y. Fujiwara M. Kondo G. Nakada C. Baba T. Ishiguro N. Miyazaki A. Nakamura K. Hori N. Sato K. Shomori K. Takeuchi K. Satoh H. Mori S. Ito H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Their identical structural features are nuclear localization signals and the ANK repeat motif. Although ANK repeats were initially reported to mediate protein-protein interactions, their function is more diverse. ANK repeat proteins carry out a wide variety of biological activities, and this motif has been recognized in more than 400 proteins including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, transcriptional regulators, cytoskeletal organizers, developmental regulators, and toxins (24Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Thus, the ANK repeat motif does not determine the specific function of DARP, although it may play key roles in DARP function. Immunocytochemistry of COS/DARP-FLAG cells and Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of COS/DARP-FLAG and CHO/DARP-FLAG demonstrated that DARP is a nuclear protein. Its nuclear localization suggests that DARP may play a role in the regulation of gene expression. It was reported that subcellular localization of CARP is altered by a change of circumstance of the cell, such as serum depletion in vitro (20Zou Y. Evans S. Chen J. Kuo H.C. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 793-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the function of protein is sometimes regulated by its subcellular localization (25Davies T.H. Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Mackem S. Baumann C.T. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45501-45504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), detailed analysis of DARP localization may provide important clues to clarify the physiological function of DARP. DARP expression in CHO cells caused a slight but significant decrease of palmitate uptake, suggesting that DARP may be involved in fatty acid metabolism. However, in CHO cells, it appeared that the effect of DARP on fatty acid metabolism was not enhanced proportionately to its expression level. Because DARP possesses ANK-like repeats that may mediate protein-protein interaction, DARP may functionally require partner molecule(s). Therefore, over-expression of DARP in CHO cells may not be sufficient. However, our results strongly suggest that DARP is potentially involved in fatty acid metabolism. Further experiments are required to elucidate the detailed mechanism of DARP effect on fatty acid metabolism. Because skeletal muscle is the principal tissue for insulin-mediated glucose disposal and a major site of peripheral insulin resistance, the correlation between skeletal muscle fuel handling and insulin resistance has been extensively investigated. Recent studies revealed that skeletal muscle in insulin resistance shows increased glucose oxidation and decreased fatty acid oxidation under basal conditions and decreased glucose oxidation and increased fatty acid oxidation under insulin-stimulated conditions. This is referred to as a state of “metabolic inflexibility” (4Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Decreased fatty acid oxidation under basal conditions could lead to lipid accumulation within skeletal muscle that is strongly associated with insulin resistance. Since DARP-expressing CHO cells demonstrated a significant decrease of palmitate uptake, DARP expression may be up-regulated in insulin-resistant animals to partially compensate for abnormalities in fatty acid accumulation in skeletal muscle. However, further analyses are required to address this point. DARP expression is altered by a change of energy supply and energy metabolic condition, induced by excess fatty acid treatment in vitro and fasting in vivo. Initially, we expected that fasting would enhance the expression of DARP as well as excess fatty acid treatment in vitro since fasting was shown to increase plasma fatty acid level (27Van der Lee K.A. Willemsen P.H. Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. Pelsers M.M. Glatz J.F. Van der Vusse G.J. Van Bilsen M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1752-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, fasting resulted in a decrease in DARP expression. This could be due to a significantly reduced glucose supply under fasted conditions. Although detailed mechanisms are unknown, our observations suggest that DARP expression is, at least partially, regulated by energy supply. Since energy supply appreciably affects energy metabolism (27Van der Lee K.A. Willemsen P.H. Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. Pelsers M.M. Glatz J.F. Van der Vusse G.J. Van Bilsen M. J.

Metab. 2001; 281: E975-E982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these findings further suggest that DARP is implicated in energy metabolism. To clarify the physiological function of DARP, gene targeting and transgenic animal studies will likely be required. Detailed analysis of DARP will provide new insights of energy metabolism and crucial information as to the molecular regulatory mechanisms of energy metabolism. We thank Dr. Cheryl E.

The endophilins B show the same domain organization as the endophilins A, which contain an N-terminal domain responsible for lipid binding and lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase activity, a central coiled-coil domain for oligomerization, a less conserved linker region, and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. The endophilin B1 gene gives rise to at least three splice variants, endophilin B1a, which shows a widespread tissue distribution, and endophilins B1b and B1c, which appear to be brain-specific. Endophilin B1, like endophilins A, binds to palmitoyl-CoA, exhibits lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase activity, and interacts with dynamin, amphiphysins 1 and 2, and huntingtin. However, in contrast to endophilins A, endophilin B1 does not bind to synaptojanin 1 and synapsin 1, and overexpression of its SH3 domain does not inhibit transferrin endocytosis. Consistent with this, immunofluorescence analysis of endophilin B1b transfected into fibroblasts shows an intracellular reticular staining, which in part overlaps with that of endogenous dynamin. Upon subcellular fractionation of brain and transfected fibroblasts, endophilin B1 is largely recovered in association with membranes. Together, our results suggest that the action of the endophilins is not confined to the formation of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane, with endophilin B1 being associated with, and presumably exerting a functional role at, intracellular membranes.

Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with other proteins, endophilin A1 has been shown to bind lipids. Thus, endophilin A1 binds to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)1and fatty acyl-CoA and, via its intrinsic lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase (LPA-AT) activity, condenses them to phosphatidic acid (8Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Söling H.-D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Moreover, endophilin A1 binds to liposomes and alone is sufficient to deform them into narrow tubules (15Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The latter observation provides direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that the role of endophilin A1 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis is related to its ability to generate membrane curvature (6Huttner W.B.

In contrast to the neuron-specific isoform endophilin A1, another member of the endophilins A, endophilin A2, shows a ubiquitous tissue distribution (2Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl.

We report here the molecular and cell biological characterization of a novel endophilin that is a representative of a new subgroup of endophilins, the endophilins B (6Huttner W.B. Schmidt A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While sharing many structural and functional properties with the endophilins A, endophilin B is distinct in that it does not appear to operate in endocytosis at the plasma membrane but, rather, is associated with intracellular membranes. While this work, which focuses on the brain-specific splice variant endophilin B1b, was prepared for publication, other investigators independently reported on other members of the endophilins B, which show a widespread tissue distribution (15Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 21Pierrat B. Simonen M. Cueto M. Mestan J. Ferrigno P. Heim J.

The full-length PACSIN 1 open reading frame was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pAS2–1 vector and confirmed by sequencing. The pAS2–1 PACSIN 1 plasmid was sequentially cotransformed with the Matchmaker mouse brain cDNA library into the yeast strain Y190. Transformed yeast cells expressing interacting Gal4 fusion proteins were selected by the ability to grow on minimal synthetic dropout medium lacking l-tryptophan,l-leucine, and l-histidine and checked for their ability to express the lacZ gene by β-galactosidase filter assays. Positive clones were isolated by re-streaking and growth on cycloheximide-containing medium and verified for the interaction with PACSIN 1 by mating with Y187 yeast cells transformed with pAS2–1 PACSIN 1. Plasmid DNA of positive clones was isolated and sequenced in both directions with universal and internal primers using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit, and products were resolved on an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems). DNA and protein sequence analyses were performed using the GCG software package (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), and multiple gene databases were searched using BLAST programs (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59448) Google Scholar). Four filters with dotted cDNA derived from a 9-day postcoitum murine embryo cDNA library (no. 559) were obtained from the Resource Center of the German Human Genome Project. Filter hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Ficoll 400, and 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 5× SSPE (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), and 5 mm EDTA), 1.5% SDS, and 300 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA with a 1831-bp probe specific for murine endophilin B1. The latter cDNA fragment was derived from the two-hybrid clone by EcoRI/XhoI digestion and radiolabeled by random priming (TaKaRa). The filters were finally washed with 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.5) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min and subjected to autoradiography. Positive clones and protein sequence analyses were performed as described above. Reverse transcription of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from various mouse tissues was performed with Superscript II (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each tissue tested 500 ng of poly(A)+ RNA was converted into first-strand cDNA using oligo(dT) primers in a 10-μl reaction mix. Endophilin B1 fragments were amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and specific primers (sense: 5′-AGA CTG GAT TTG GAT GCT GC-3′, antisense: 5′-AGG TCA TTG AGG TTA GAA GG-3′). The resulting PCR fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% TBE polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a Hybond XL membrane (AmershamBiosciences) by electrophoretic transfer (200 mA, 4 h) in 0.5× TBE (24Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd. Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed in a formamide mix with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to nucleotides 1–1831 of mouse endophilin B1b generated by using a labeling kit (TaKaRa). The blot was stringently washed and analyzed using autoradiography. A GST murine endophilin B1b fusion protein was produced by cloning the cDNA corresponding to the C-terminal 201 amino acids (residues 186–386) into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) followed by expression in Escherichia coli (BL21). The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and used as an antigen to immunize rabbits. Polyclonal antibodies against amphiphysin 2/BIN1 (EVA) were a generous gift of Dr. Pietro De Camilli (Yale University, New Haven, CT), and antibodies against synaptojanin 1 (1852) were a generous gift from Dr. Peter McPherson (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Polyclonal antibodies against synapsin 1 were purchased from Sigma, monoclonal antibodies against dynamin (clone 41) were from Transduction Laboratories, a monoclonal antibody against huntingtin was from Chemicon, a monoclonal antibody against amphiphysin 1 (clone 2) was from Oncogene Research Products, and a monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All monoclonal antibodies were derived from mouse except for anti-HA, which was from rat. For visualization of primary antibodies Alexa 488- and Cy3-conjugated goat antisera against rabbit and mouse immunoglobulins (IgG) were purchased from Molecular Probes and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, respectively. Proteins were extracted by mechanical disruption of freshly prepared mouse tissues or NIH 3T3 cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, 50 μl per gram of tissue) and subsequent centrifugation to remove detergent-insoluble material. Aliquots of the extracts corresponding to 80 μg of protein were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), rinsed with TBST, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with diluted antibodies. After three 5-min washes with TBST, bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Dako) and the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins of full-length murine endophilin B1b, full-length murine endophilin A1 (8Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Söling H.-D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal fragment of murine endophilin A3 (2Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS. Mouse brains were homogenized on ice in 2.5 ml/g wet weight PBS containing 1% deoxycholate supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, 50 μl per gram of tissue) using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 30 min at 21,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted and recentrifuged. After addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.05% to the supernatant, it was dialyzed against PBS buffer lacking deoxycholate for 48 h. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads saturated with GST-endophilins were incubated overnight with supernatant containing 1 mg of the protein extract in 400 μl at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed extensively with PBS/1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted with double-concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–10% gradient gel, and transferred to a PVDF membrane for subsequent immunodetection. PVDF membranes containing rat brain proteins were prepared as described above for immunoblotting, blocked, rinsed with TBST, and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins containing the murine endophilin B1 and rat endophilins A1–A3 SH3 domains. The latter were produced by cloning the cDNAs corresponding to the C-terminal SH3 domains into the pGEX-6p1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) followed by expression in E. coli(BL21) and purification by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Following incubation with the GST fusion proteins, the membranes were washed three times for 5 min, and bound GST fusion proteins were detected using an anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences), peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Dako), and the ECL kit (AmershamBiosciences). The complete open reading frame of murine endophilin B1b was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pHA-CMV (Clontech). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with HA-tagged endophilin B1b using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and subcellular fractions were prepared essentially as described previously (25Gray E.G. Whittaker V.P. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet was homogenized in 3 ml of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), using nine strokes of a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to produce a pellet (P1), which was washed by resuspension in an equal volume of homogenization buffer and recentrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. The original supernatant and wash were combined (S1) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min yielding pellet (P2) and supernatant (S2). The S2 fraction was centrifuged at 105,000 ×g for 60 min to give a high speed pellet (P3) and a high speed supernatant (S3). The subcellular fractions obtained by this method were analyzed by Western blotting. For the isolation and analysis of membrane fractions derived from mouse brain, a discontinuous sucrose gradient was used (26Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Finely chopped mouse brains were homogenized in 3 ml per gram of wet weight of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), using ten strokes of a glass homogenizer. Larger cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 500 × g. After adjusting the post-nuclear supernatant to 1.4m sucrose and 1 mm neutralized EDTA, 3 ml of the post-nuclear supernatant were underlaid with 2.5 ml of 1.6m sucrose/10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and overlaid with 4 ml of 1.2 m sucrose/10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2.5 ml of 0.8 m sucrose/10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 2 h, the various sucrose phases, interfaces, and the pellet were collected for analysis by immunoblotting. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts plated on 12-mm glass coverslips were transfected with the pHA-endophilin B1b expression vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized by incubation in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min, and blocked for 15 min in 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% horse serum in PBS. All antibody incubations and washing steps were performed in PBS containing 0.02% Triton X-100. Samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica). For flow cytometric analysis (FACS) of transferrin uptake, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with constructs containing the C-terminal SH3 domain of either murine endophilin A1, A2, or B1 fused to red fluorescence protein (DsRed), and with DsRed as negative control (27Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 20 min in serum-free medium followed by a 30-min incubation in medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 25 μg/ml FITC-conjugated human transferrin (Molecular Probes), washed three times in PBS, trypsinized with 1% trypsin, and finally washed once with PBS. A FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) was used to detect red fluorescence proteins (FL2) and FITC-transferrin (FL1) in 0.5–1.0 × 104 cells. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with HA-tagged endophilin B1b and harvested after 48 h. Cells were lysed in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by short sonication, and the lysates were centrifuged 20 min at 20,000 × g in a cooled centrifuge. The supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of palmitoyl-CoA-agarose (Sigma) overnight by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C, centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to remove unbound proteins, washed three times with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, and eluted with 4 mm free palmitoyl-CoA in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 or with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Aliquots of the lysates, bound and unbound material, supernatants, and the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using HA high affinity antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Recombinant murine endophilin B1b was produced by cloning the cDNA corresponding to the full-length protein into the pGEX-6P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) followed by expression in E. coli (BL21) and purification according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in PBS, incubated on ice for 20 min in the presence of lysozyme (20 mg/ml), sonicated, and incubated at 4 °C for another 20 min after adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. After centrifugation of the lysate at 20,000 × g for 15 min and of the resulting supernatant at 226,000 × g for 1 h, glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to the high speed supernatant followed by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C. GST fusion protein bound to the Sepharose was washed twice with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by three additional washes using PBS without detergent. For the LPA-AT assay, either the GST fusion protein or endophilin B1b without GST tag was used. In the first case, GST-endophilin B1b and, as control, GST were eluted according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the second case, endophilin B1b was liberated from GST by proteolytic cleavage with the PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant His-tagged mouse endophilin A1 was expressed and purified by poly(l-proline) affinity chromatography from the 280,000 × gsupernatant obtained from bacteria lysed by freezing/thawing in the absence of detergent, as previously described (8Schmidt A.

For the data shown in Fig. 5 B, the LPA-AT activity of endophilins was determined as described previously (8Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B.

For the data shown in Fig. 5 C, the LPA-AT activity of endophilins was determined by modifying the previously described assay (8Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Söling H.-D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) as follows. Aliquots of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (100 nCi, 56 mCi per mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 0.01 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6, were dried in a SpeedVac and dissolved by adding 100 μl of gel-filtered cytosol (GGA buffer) followed by sonication for 2 min. The tubes were then transferred to ice and brought to a final reaction volume of 150 μl by sequential additions of GGA buffer, LPA, and recombinant proteins. LPA was added from a 1 mm stock prepared in LPA buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) to a final concentration of 10 μm. For the incubations that did not contain LPA, an equivalent volume of LPA buffer was added. Recombinant endophilins A1 and B1 were added at a final concentration of 500 nm. Reactions were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C and terminated by addition of 150 μl ice-cold 0.8m KCl, 0.2 m H3PO4. Samples were mixed with 450 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The lower phase was collected, dried, redissolved in 35 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (2:1:0.1, v/v), subjected (along with a [14C]phosphatidic acid standard, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to thin layer chromatography using Silica Gel 60 and chloroform/pyridine/formic acid (50:30:7, v/v) as solvent, and analyzed by phosphorimaging.

We therefore further characterized this protein and named it endophilin B1 to distinguish it from the previously known members, which we propose to refer to as endophilins A1–A3 (6Huttner W.B. Schmidt A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using the two-hybrid clone as a probe, we obtained three clones on screening a mouse embryo cDNA library. Two contained the entire coding region (nucleotides 271–1431) and comprised a cDNA of endophilin B1 with a length of 4012 bp. The first in-frame ATG is located 271 nucleotides from the 5′-end and fulfills Kozak's criteria for a translation initiation site, showing conservation of 9 out of 10 bases in the consensus (30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In the mouse mRNA this putative initiator is not preceded by any in-frame stop codons, which in the two-hybrid system leads to the translation of additional 90 amino acids, including several prolines. These were sufficient to interact with the PACSIN 1 SH3 domain, resulting in the false-positive interaction (data not shown).

Analysis ofegghead and brainiac mutants has led to the suggestion that the two genes function in a common signaling pathway. Recently, brainiac was shown to encode a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:βManβ1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β3GlcNAc-transferase) tentatively assigned a key role in biosynthesis of arthroseries glycosphingolipids and forming the trihexosylceramide, GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer. In the present study we demonstrate that egghead encodes a Golgi-located GDP-mannose:βGlcβ1,4-mannosyltransferase tentatively assigned a biosynthetic role to form the precursor arthroseries glycosphingolipid substrate for Brainiac, Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer. Egghead is unique among eukaryotic gly- cosyltransferase genes in that homologous genes are limited to invertebrates, which correlates with the exclusive existence of arthroseries glycolipids in invertebrates. We propose that brainiac and egghead function in a common biosynthetic pathway and that inactivating mutations in either lead to sufficiently early termination of glycolipid biosynthesis to inactivate essential functions mediated by glycosphingolipids.

Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3863-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of brainiac oregghead in the germ line defects are observed in the overlying follicular epithelium, which is of somatic origin (1Goode S. Wright D. Mahowald A.P.

On one hand, these follicular epithelial defects resemble defects in epidermal growth factor receptor signaling between germ line and follicle cell layers. On the other hand, they resemble a subset of the follicular defects associated with Notch mutants (1Goode S. Wright D. Mahowald A.P.

The diversity of defects caused by brainiac and egghead mutants suggests that they may be involved in communication between cells at a fundamental level and that they can affect multiple signaling pathways. Brainiac and egghead mutants exhibit similar and non-additive phenotypes, leading to the proposal that they function in a common signaling pathway. Based on sequence analysis, Yuan et al. (5Yuan Y.P. Schultz J. Mlodzik M. Bork P. Cell. 1997; 88: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) originally proposed that brainiac together with the distant homologous gene fringe encoded glycosyltransferases. This hypothesis has subsequently proved correct and both represent glycosyltransferases with functionally conserved mammalian homologs (6Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S.

Brainiac was shown to catalyze addition of the third monosaccharide residue to form the trihexosylceramide glycolipid, GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer. Arthroseries glycolipids have only been found in invertebrates and differ fundamentally from mammalian glycolipids by having a core disaccharide structure based on Manβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer (MacCer) rather than Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer (LacCer) (10Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, brainiac was found to transfer β1–3 linked GlcNAc to both MacCer and LacCer, while mammalian homologs only transfer to LacCer (8Schwientek T. Keck B. Levery S.B.

Sequence analysis of eggheadindicates that it could encode a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase. Homologous genes appear limited to invertebrates, and no similar genes are found in the mammalian databases. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that egghead encodes a unique invertebrate glycosyltransferase activity in the same biosynthetic pathway as brainiac and present evidence thategghead indeed encodes a β1,4-mannosyltransferase predicted to form the MacCer precursor glycolipid substrate for brainiac. An expression construct of the full coding region of egghead was prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR using Drosophila melanogastermRNA and the sense primer Egh001 (5′-AGCAGATCTCAAGATGAACTCCACCACAAAG-3′) with a BglII restriction site and the antisense primer Egh002 (5′-AATAGTCTAGACAGTCTCCAGTACGCG-3′) with a XbaI restriction site.

Egghead exhibited strict donor substrate specificity for GDP-mannose and did not utilize other donor sugar nucleotides tested (UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc). Analysis of a panel of mono- and disaccharide derivatives showed that egghead exhibits strong preference for substrates containing terminal β-linked glucose (β-Glc) (TableI). Interestingly, some βMan monosaccharide derivatives also served as efficient substrates; however, no activity was found with the disaccharides Manβ1–4GlcNAc and Manβ1–4Glcβ1-n-Oct. Analysis of apparentK m for the most active substrates identified showed that n-octyl-β-Glc was the preferred acceptor substrate (apparent K m 0.67 ± 0.08 mm) with Glcβ1-pNph (apparent K m 1.10 ± 0.3 mm) being comparable and Manβ1-pNph (apparent K m 2.30 ± 0.5 mm) less preferred. The apparent K m for GDP-Man withn-octyl-β-Glc acceptor substrate was 58.0 ± 6.2 μm. Optimization of the enzyme assay using microsomal membranes demonstrated that Triton X-100, Triton CF-54, and Nonidet P-40 inhibited egghead activity at 0.1%, whilen-octylgalactoside at 3.4 mm (0.1%) and to a lesser extent CHAPS activated the enzyme. The pH optimum of egghead activity was pH 7–8. Addition of 5–10 mmMgCl2 and MnCl2 activated enzyme activity (Mg2+ being better than Mn2+), and CaCl2 had no effect, while addition of 10 mmEDTA destroyed the activity. Analysis of egghead activity in the established CHO transfectant cells showed the same properties as when egghead is expressed in insect cells (not shown). Attempts to visualize in vivo formed products by lectin staining with Vicia Faba (Sigma) was unsuccessful, and further characterization of the products formed await large scale production of cells for chemical analysis of glycolipids. Glycosphingolipids of the fruit fly are based on the arthroseries GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer core (10Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The finding that egghead exhibits β-mannosyltransferase activity with βGlc acceptor substrates strongly suggested that egghead transfers Man to Glcβ1–1Cer to form MacCer. As shown in Fig. 2 egghead utilizes Glcβ1–1Cer as an acceptor substrate, whereas LacCer does not serve as substrate. In addition, Galβ1–1Cer was found not to serve as a substrate (not shown). Based on this result it was predicted that egghead functions as the MacCer synthase. Evidence in support hereof was provided by showing that brainiac utilizes the product formed by egghead (Fig. 3). This assay was carried out withn-octyl-β-Glc as initial acceptor substrate because it served as a better substrate than GlcCer under the assay conditions used.Figure 3The product formed by egghead withn-octyl-βGlc serves as a substrate for brainiac. High performance thin-layer chromatography analysis of product developments (2 h) with combinations of microsomal fractions of egghead(Egh), polypeptide GalNAc-T4 (GT4), andbrainiac (Brn) expressing High FiveTMcells and combinations of sugar nucleotides GDP-Man and UDP-GlcNAc are shown. The upper panel is stained with orcinol, and thelower panel represents an autoradiography. Plates were run in chloroform-methanol-water (60/30/8, v/v/v), and the migration ofn-octyl-βGlc (NOG) and the disaccharide and trisaccharide products hereof are indicated in the margins. Man-Glc-Oct is formed only in the presence of egghead and GDP-Man, and GlcNAc-Man-Glc-Oct is formed only in the presence both of egghead and brainiac as well as GDP-Man and UDP-GlcNAc. In lane 7, theasterisks indicate that the autoradiography assay was carried out with non-labeled GDP-Man to confirm that the initial added sugar was Man.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the diglycosyl product formed with n-octyl-β-glucoside exhibited resonances consistent with ∼55% conversion to Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1-n-octyl, i.e. anomeric signals at 4.477 and 4.143 ppm (3 J 1,2 = ∼1 and 7.9 Hz, respectively), corresponding to H-1 of Manβ1–4 and Glcβ1–1 residues of this glycolipid. H-1 of unreacted Glcβ1–1 is observed at 4.080 ppm (3 J 1,2 = 7.6 Hz) (Fig. 4). Following complete assignment of1H resonances from all three monosaccharide spin systems present (see Table II) by two-dimensional1H-1H gCOSY and TOCSY experiments (not shown), the connectivity between the β-Man and the more abundant β-Glc (spin system originating from the H-1 at 4.143 ppm) was established as a 1→4 linkage by a two-dimensional ROESY experiment, which showed a dipolar cross-relaxation correlation between β-Man H-1 and β-Glc H-4. This is consistent with the substantial downfield shift of H-4 compared with that observed for unreacted n-octyl β-glucoside (3.350 versus 3.016). Although other β-Glc resonances are affected by the glycosylation, H-4 is shifted downfield by the largest increment (ΔδH-4 = 0.334 ppm; ΔδH-3 = 0.244 ppm; ΔδH-5 = 0.151 ppm).Table II1 H chemical shifts (ppm) and 3 J1,2 coupling constants (Hz, in parentheses) for Glcβ1-n-octyl substrate and biosynthetic Manβ4-Glcβ1-n-octyl product.Manβ4-Glcβ1-n-octylGlcβ1-n-octylManβ4Glcβ1n-OctGlcβ1n-OctH-14.4774.1433.40, 3.73 (2)4.0803.40, 3.71 (2)3 J 1,2(∼1)(7.9)(7.6)H-23.6772.9741.494 (2)2.9121.494 (2)H-33.2393.316∼1.24 (10)3.111∼1.24 (10)H-43.2753.3443.016H-53.0943.2153.059H-6a3.3953.5003.410H-6b3.6953.5973.636CH30.842 (3)0.842 (3)Data were obtained in Me2SO-d 6, 2% D2O at 35 °C.

Chemical shifts are referenced to internal tetramethylsilane (set to 0.000 ppm). The original prediction that the neurogenic genesbrainiac and egghead encoded proteins serving functions in a common pathway has been verified by demonstrating that both genes encode glycosyltransferases and that egghead can synthesize the immediate precursor glycolipid substrate for brainiac. The two enzymes function very early in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis at the second and third steps in build-up of the glycan chain, and it is likely that this reflects the severe phenotypes associated with inactivation of these genes. Glycosphingolipids ofDrosophila have been reported to be based on the arthroseries and exist as extended oligosaccharide structures such as Galβ1–3GalNAcα1–4GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer, which can be terminated by glucuronic acids and modified with phosphoethanolamine to give charged and zwitterionic glycolipids (10Seppo A.

Specific biological functions of distinct glycolipid structures have not been elucidated in Drosophila, but it is conceivable that termination of glycolipid biosynthesis at GlcCer and at MacCer could block biological activity of glycolipids to similar effect. Genetic approaches to studying glycosphingolipid functions in mammals have so far provided some insight into defined biological activities. In contrast to invertebrate glycolipids that appear to be based on one class, mammalian glycolipids are based on multiple classes. Mice deficient in ganglioseries glycolipids built on GalNAcβ1–4Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer have yielded significant information (17Inoue M. Fujii Y. Furukawa K. Okada M. Okumura K. Hayakawa T. Furukawa K.

While the biosynthesis of ganglioseries and globoseries glycolipids are carried out by unique single copy genes, each step in the biosynthesis of lacto- and neolactoseries glycolipids based on the fact that GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer is carried out by multiple isoenzymes, many of which serve functions in the synthesis of glycoproteins as well (24Amado M.

Drosophila and C. elegans may in this respect constitute simpler systems for studies of functions of glycolipids. Recently, the β4GalNAc-transferase acting in sequence after brainiac to form GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Manβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer was characterized (25Kawar Z.S. Van D.I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

An increasing number of genes involved in biosynthesis of glycoconjugates have been identified as essential or important for normal development of flies and nematodes. A number of genes involved in biosynthesis of the proteoglycan core region were identified through an elegant screen for defects in vulval invagination of C. elegans (26Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc.

To our knowledge, egghead and brainiac are currently the only available examples of essential genes in Drosophilawith functions in the biosynthesis of glycolipids. Glycolipids are known to serve important biological functions in mammals including modulation of receptor functions (29Hakomori S. Glycoconj.

https://openalex.org/W2022683706,"Human serum transferrin (hTF) is a bilobal iron-binding and transport protein that carries iron in the blood stream for delivery to cells by a pH-dependent mechanism. Two iron atoms are held tightly in two deep clefts by coordination to four amino acid residues in each cleft (two tyrosines, a histidine, and an aspartic acid) and two oxygen atoms from the “synergistic” carbonate anion. Other residues in the binding pocket, not directly coordinated to iron, also play critical roles in iron uptake and release through hydrogen bonding to the liganding residues. The original crystal structures of the iron-loaded N-lobe of hTF (pH 5.75 and 6.2) revealed that the synergistic carbonate is stabilized by interaction with Arg-124 and that both the arginine and the carbonate adopt two conformations (MacGillivray, R.

(1998) Biochemistry 37, 7919–7928). In the present study, we show that the two conformations are also found for a structure at pH 7.7, indicating that this finding was not strictly a function of pH. We also provide structures for two single point mutants (Y45E and L66W) designed to force Arg-124 to adopt each of the previously observed conformations. The structures of each mutant show that this goal was accomplished, and functional studies confirm the hypothesis that access to the synergistic anion dictates the rate of iron release. These studies highlight the importance of the arginine/carbonate movement in the mechanism of iron release in the N-lobe of hTF.

The hTF binds iron reversibly in blood plasma and transports it to cells requiring iron. Full-length transferrin molecules (∼80 kDa) consist of a single polypeptide chain folded into two similar lobes, the N-lobe and C-lobe. The two lobes display significant sequence similarity and appear to have evolved from the duplication of an ancestral gene coding for a protein with a single metal-binding site (3Williams J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 394-397Google Scholar). Each homologous lobe contains an iron-binding site deep within a cleft that subdivides it into two dissimilar domains (designated NI and NII domains for the N-lobe and CI and CII for the C-lobe). Iron is bound in a distorted octahedral coordination involving four amino acid ligands and two oxygen atoms from a synergistically bound carbonate ion. The synergistic relationship of metal and anion refers to the fact that neither binds tightly in the absence of the other (4Faber H.R. Baker C.J. Day C.L. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14473-14479Google Scholar). This synergy is a unique characteristic of the transferrin family and is not observed in other metal-binding proteins. Although hTF, oTF, and LTF share identical iron-binding ligands and display high sequence homology, substantial differences in the binding affinity for iron both within and between the TFs are found and are not well understood (5Bali P.K. Harris W.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 4457-4461Google Scholar, 6El Hage Chahine J.-M. Fain D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 581-587Google Scholar, 7Marques H.M. Walton T. Egan T.J. J. Inorg.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12463-12469Google Scholar). An obvious experimental approach to explore these differences involves the mutation of specific residues followed by assessment of the changes in function.A critical function of hTF in serum is to deliver iron to actively dividing cells. Diferric hTF binds with high affinity to specific receptors on the surface of cells (10Aisen P. Enns C. Wessling-Resnick M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 940-959Google Scholar). The apo- or iron-depleted hTF is poorly recognized by the receptor at physiological pH. The hTF-receptor complex is endocytosed; within the endosome, a proton pump results in a drop in the pH to ∼5.6, triggering iron release. This step is not well defined despite intensive research efforts. The entire cycle occurs in 2–3 min (11Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Google Scholar).Iron binding and release is characterized by a large conformational change. When iron is released, the two domains move away from each other by means of a hinge located in two antiparallel β-strands that lie behind the iron-binding site in each lobe. In the N-lobe of transferrin, one domain rotates 63° relative to the other about this hinge (12MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Chen J. Anderson B.F. Baker H. Luo Y.G. Bewley M. Smith C.A. Murphy M.E. Wang Y. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brayer G.D. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7919-7928Google Scholar, 13Jeffrey P.D. Bewley M.C. MacGillivray R.T.A. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13978-13986Google Scholar). The precise mechanism for this movement remains unclear, but protonation of several key amino acid residues appears to be critical to the release of iron (see below).Many studies have clearly demonstrated that an arginine located near the iron-binding site (Arg-124 in hTF/2N) stabilizes the synergistic carbonate anion. This arginine is highly conserved in each lobe of all mammalian TFs. As detailed previously (4Faber H.R. Baker C.J. Day C.L. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14473-14479Google Scholar), those lobes with amino acids other than arginine are unable to bind iron with high affinity and specificity. Mutational studies in both hTF and LTF further confirm the important role of the arginine in iron release (14Zak O. Aisen P. Crawley J.B. Joannou C.L. Patel K.J. Rafiq M. Evans R.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14428-14434Google Scholar, 15Peterson N.A. Anderson B.F. Jameson G.B. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6625-6633Google Scholar, 16He Q.Y. Mason A.B. Nguyen V.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14157-14166Google Scholar); all mutants feature accelerated rates of iron release.The two high resolution structures (1.6 and 1.8 Å) of the Fe(III) form of hTF/2N revealed the presence of electron density indicative of positional disorder near the metal-binding sites of both crystal forms. The density was fitted by placement of the synergistic carbonate and the side chain of Arg-124 into two positions. In the A or “near” conformer, the carbonate is fully engaged in binding to the iron and is stabilized by bonds to the NE and NH2 atoms of Arg-124, the OG1 atom of Thr-120, and the main chain amide nitrogen atoms of Ala-126 and Gly-127, which reside on helix 5 (Fig.1 A). This form is found in both lobes of oTF and LTF. In contrast, in the B or “far” conformer, the carbonate has rotated 30°, Arg-124 has moved away from the site, and the carbonate is detached from helix 5 (Fig.1 B). We hypothesized that protonation of the carbonate (resulting in bicarbonate) might be responsible for these changes in the position of the arginine and that this protonation could well be the first step in iron release, an idea originally suggested by Aisen and Leibman in 1973 (18Aisen P. Leibman A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 304: 797-804Google Scholar). Obviously, changes in access to carbonate could have a profound effect on the release rate. In the wild-type N-lobe of hTF, the carbonate is surrounded by a network of ordered water molecules that may function in the transport of protons from the outside of the protein into the iron-binding site. Of interest is that no heterogeneity has been observed in the position of the arginine and carbonate in either lobe of any of the other TF structures reported to date. These include many different LTF structures (19Baker E.N. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Peterson N.A. Shewry S.C. Tweedie J.W. Adv. Exp. Med.

Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA1993Google Scholar).The current study was undertaken to determine the significance of the alternate positions of Arg-124 in the function of the N-lobe of hTF. It is important to mention that the present study includes the structure of wild-type hTF/2N crystallized at pH 7.7 as a control and that it also features alternate positions for both the carbonate and Arg-124. This implies that the original observation was not directly due to the lower pH used in these earlier studies as postulated previously (12MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Chen J. Anderson B.F. Baker H. Luo Y.G. Bewley M. Smith C.A. Murphy M.E. Wang Y. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brayer G.D. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7919-7928Google Scholar). Tyrosine 45 resides at the lip of the iron-binding cleft and is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule; it was mutated to a glutamic acid residue (Y45E). We hypothesized that the presence of the negatively charged glutamic acid might force Arg-124 into a single position, namely the B or far conformer, allowing easier access to the site. By replacing the tyrosine with glutamic acid in the wild-type structure, the carboxyl head group is the proper distance from Arg-124 to produce a salt bridge (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Position of Y45E and L66W mutations. The structure of the hTF N-lobe showing the carbonate and Arg-124 in their far (green) (inset A) and near (purple) (inset B) conformations is shown. The Y45E and L66W mutations are shown in red in theinsets. The NI domain is depicted in dark blue, and the NII domain is depicted in blue. Note that the two mutants (Y45E and L66W) reside in the NI domain, whereas Arg-124 is in the NII domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Alternatively Leu-66, which in the closed iron-containing N-lobe resides near Arg-124 on the edge of the solvent cavity adjacent to the iron-binding site, was converted to a tryptophan (L66W) with the premise that substitution of the bulky, hydrophobic Trp residue would force Arg-124 into the A or near conformer and thus restrict access to the synergistic anion (Fig. 2 B). Functional and structural data appear to support these hypotheses and confirm the importance of the alternate conformations of carbonate and Arg-124 in the mechanism of iron release from the N-lobe of hTF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll chemicals used were of reagent quality. Stock solutions of HEPES, MES, and other buffers were prepared by dissolving the anhydrous salts in Milli-Q (Millipore) purified water, and adjusting the pH to the desired values with 1 n NaOH or HCl. EDTA was purchased from Mann Research Laboratories, Inc.; nitrilotriacetate was from Sigma, and Tiron was from Fisher. Tiron stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the Tiron in the appropriate buffers and adjusting the pH to the desired values with 1 n NaOH. Centricon 10 microconcentrators were from Amicon. Polyethylene glycol 3350 was from Hampton Research, Inc.Molecular BiologyThe mutant Y45E was introduced into the N-lobe of transferrin using a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis procedure (24Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Google Scholar). The following synthetic oligonucleotide was used to introduce the mutations (the mutagenic nucleotides are in bold type and underlined): Y45E: 5′-AAA GCC TCC GAA CTT GAT TGC-3′.The conditions for the PCR reactions were as follows: denaturation at 94° for 15 s, annealing at 50° for 30 s, and extension at 72° for 30 s. Step I of the PCR mutagenesis procedure consisted of 30 cycles, step II consisted of 1 cycle, and step III consisted of 30 cycles (24Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the insert confirmed the introduction of the specific mutation. The mutated hTF/2N cDNA was excised from the Bluescript vector, the ends were made blunt, and the fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of the pNUT expression vector. Restriction endonuclease mapping was used to confirm the correct orientation.The L66W mutation was introduced into the transferrin N-lobe using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutation was made directly in the transferrin N-lobe cDNA sequence cloned in the pNUT vector. Two complimentary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing the L66W mutation were used: primer 1, 5′-ACA CTG GAT GCA GGT TGG GTG TAT GAT GCT TAC TTG GC-3′, and primer 2, 5′-GCC AAG TAA GCA TCA TAC ACC CAA CCT GCA TCC AGT GT-3′. The mutagenic nucleotides are shown in bold type and underlined.The conditions for the PCR reaction were as follows: 95° for 30 s followed by 18 cycles with denaturation at 95° for 30 s, annealing at 55° for 1 min, and extension at 68° for 13 min. To determine the presence of the correct mutation and absence of other mutations, the complete sequence of the transferrin cDNA and flanking pNUT sequence was determined prior to the introduction of the plasmid into baby hamster kidney cells.Recombinant Protein Production and PurificationThe production and purification of hTF/2N and mutants of hTF/2N in baby hamster kidney cells using the pNUT expression vector system has been described previously in detail (25Mason A.B. Funk W.D. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 214-220Google Scholar, 26He Q.Y. Mason A.B. Lyons B.A. Tam B.M. Nguyen V. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 423-429Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant hTF/2N that is secreted into the tissue culture medium is saturated with iron and exchanged into 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, using a spiral cartridge concentrator. A Poros 50 HQ anion-exchange column is used to eliminate most of the serum albumin and all of the phenol red from the sample. Pooled fractions are concentrated and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (5 × 80 cm) equilibrated and run in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Following passage through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and concentration, the samples are stored at −20 °C in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Purity of the recombinant protein was determined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Kinetics of Iron RemovalIron removal from the wild-type N-lobe and the mutants (∼40 μm) was measured using the chelator Tiron (12 mm) in 50 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. The reaction was monitored by following an increase in absorbance at 480 nm for the iron-Tiron complex formation. For experiments at pH 5.6, the chelator EDTA was used to remove iron at a concentration of 4 mm in 50 mm MES. In this case, the reaction was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 470 or 293 nm, which follows the release of iron from the protein. For slower release rates, a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian) was used. For faster rates, iron release kinetics were measured using an OLIS RSM-1000 stop-flow spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrumentation Systems, Inc). One syringe contained the protein sample in water, and the other contained 8 mm EDTA in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.6. Absorbance spectra were collected 5 ms after mixing and continued for at least four half-lives.pH Dependence on Iron ReleaseThe retention of iron as a function of pH was measured for each mutant. Aliquots of iron-saturated protein (∼50 μm) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate were incubated in a buffer containing 33.3 mm HEPES, MES, and sodium acetate adjusted to the appropriate pH (between 3 and 8) with either 1n NaOH or 9 lacial acetic acid and maintained at 4 °C for a period of 1 week to allow each sample to reach equilibrium. The percentage of iron remaining bound to the transferrin samples was determined by measuring the absorbance at the visible absorption maxima and comparing this absorbance to the fully iron-loaded protein. The pH was measured on identical aliquots at the end of 1 week. The data were plotted and analyzed using Origin software (Microcal).Crystallization of hTF/2N and the Two MutantsRecombinant hTF/2N and both mutants were crystallized using the sitting drop method at 20 °C. Protein (35 mg/ml) in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution composed of 0.2 m potassium acetate (pH 7.7) and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350. In all cases, large red crystals (2.0 mm × 0.9 mm × 0.4 mm) formed in 5–14 days. All proteins were essentially isomorphous with wild-type hTF/2N (Protein Data Bank accession number 1A8E), showing similar cell dimensions and crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with one molecule in each asymmetric unit (Table I).Table IData collection and model refinement statisticshTF/2NY45EL66WSpace groupP212121P212121P212121Unit cell (Å)a = 45.02a = 43.92a = 45.18b = 57.88b = 56.57b = 57.92c = 135.66c = 135.84c = 135.51Resolution limits (Å)30–2.0530–2.130–2.1R sym(%)aData in parentheses are for the outermost shell (2.12–2.05 Å for hTF/2N, 2.18–2.10 Å for Y45E, 2.18–2.10 Å for L66W).7.7 (17.8)6.2 (13.9)9.3 (30.2)I/ςaData in parentheses are for the outermost shell (2.12–2.05 Å for hTF/2N, 2.18–2.10 Å for Y45E, 2.18–2.10 Å for L66W).19.5 (9.4)17.7 (11.0)17.5 (6.1)Completeness (%)aData in parentheses are for the outermost shell (2.12–2.05 Å for hTF/2N, 2.18–2.10 Å for Y45E, 2.18–2.10 Å for L66W).88.1 (91.6)92.6 (90.2)98.4 (96.0)Molecules in asymmetric unit111No. of unique reflectionsaData in parentheses are for the outermost shell (2.12–2.05 Å for hTF/2N, 2.18–2.10 Å for Y45E, 2.18–2.10 Å for L66W).20284 (2046)19129 (1813)21203 (2018)R-factor (R free) (%)19.8 (22.9)19.3 (24.2)19.6 (23.8)Model detailsNo. of protein atoms254825482548No. of solvent atoms14416733No. of ionsFe3+, 2CO32−Fe3+, 2CO32−Fe3+, CO32−Average B-factor (Å2)protein main chain atoms23.721.626.2protein side chain atoms26.824.532.3solvent molecules43.350.838.5r.m.s.br.m.s., root mean squared. deviation from ideal geometrybond distances (Å)0.0080.0060.008bond angles (deg)1.31.31.3Residues in favored Ramachandran regions (%)87.187.187.1a Data in parentheses are for the outermost shell (2.12–2.05 Å for hTF/2N, 2.18–2.10 Å for Y45E, 2.18–2.10 Å for L66W).b r.m.s., root mean squared. Open table in a new tab Data Collection, Structure Determination, and RefinementData for hTF/2N and the two mutants were collected at room temperature using a Mar345 image plate detector on a Rigaku RU-300 generator with a copper rotating anode. All data sets were indexed using DENZO (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 270A. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 270A. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Statistics are given in Table I. For all structures, the wild-type pH 5.75 structure (Protein Data Bank accession number 1A8E) was used with molecular replacement. In all cases Arg-124, carbonate, iron, and waters were removed from the search model to eliminate any bias from these atomsWild-type hTF/2N, pH 7.7Since the unit cell was identical to the previously solved wild-type hTF/2N, the rigid-body alignment routine of CNS (in which the NI and NII domains were also allowed to move independently) was used to solve the wild-type hTF/2N, pH 7.7, structure (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). This reduced the R-factor to 0.30 for data from 30 to 2.05 Å. The model was refined using successive rounds of simulated annealing, occupancy, and B-factor refinement. This was followed by revision of the model based upon map interpretation using an SGI work station with the graphics program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar, 30Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 270A. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1997: 208-230Google Scholar). In the later stages of refinement, Arg-124, carbonate, and solvent molecules were added and allowed to move freely. Conformations of Arg-124 and carbonate were determined by fitting observedF o − F c electron density maps. Only residues 3–331 from the polypeptide chain were observed in the electron density and deposited in the final model (Protein Data Bank accession number 1N84).Y45EThe structure of the Y45E mutant was solved by using the molecular replacement routines in CNS. The cross-rotation search yielded a single peak 8.8 ς above the mean, and the translational search found a peak 3.8 ς above the mean. Rigid-body refinement reduced the R-factor to 0.31 for data from 30 to 2.1 Å. Refinement was carried out as described above; again, only residues 3–331 were deposited in the final model (Protein Data Bank accession number 1N7X).L66WAs described for the wild-type pH 7.7 structure above, the rigid-body alignment routine of CNS was used to solve the L66W mutant; this reduced the R-factor to 0.29 for data from 30 to 2.1 Å. Refinement was carried out as described above, again with only residues 3–331 deposited in the final model (Protein Data Bank accession number 1N7W).

The hTF binds iron reversibly in blood plasma and transports it to cells requiring iron. Full-length transferrin molecules (∼80 kDa) consist of a single polypeptide chain folded into two similar lobes, the N-lobe and C-lobe. The two lobes display significant sequence similarity and appear to have evolved from the duplication of an ancestral gene coding for a protein with a single metal-binding site (3Williams J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 394-397Google Scholar). Each homologous lobe contains an iron-binding site deep within a cleft that subdivides it into two dissimilar domains (designated NI and NII domains for the N-lobe and CI and CII for the C-lobe). Iron is bound in a distorted octahedral coordination involving four amino acid ligands and two oxygen atoms from a synergistically bound carbonate ion. The synergistic relationship of metal and anion refers to the fact that neither binds tightly in the absence of the other (4Faber H.R. Baker C.J. Day C.L. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14473-14479Google Scholar). This synergy is a unique characteristic of the transferrin family and is not observed in other metal-binding proteins. Although hTF, oTF, and LTF share identical iron-binding ligands and display high sequence homology, substantial differences in the binding affinity for iron both within and between the TFs are found and are not well understood (5Bali P.K. Harris W.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 4457-4461Google Scholar, 6El Hage Chahine J.-M. Fain D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 581-587Google Scholar, 7Marques H.M. Walton T. Egan T.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 57: 11-21Google Scholar, 8Zak O. Tam B. MacGillivray R.T.A. Aisen P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11036-11043Google Scholar, 9Muralidhara B.K. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12463-12469Google Scholar). An obvious experimental approach to explore these differences involves the mutation of specific residues followed by assessment of the changes in function. A critical function of hTF in serum is to deliver iron to actively dividing cells. Diferric hTF binds with high affinity to specific receptors on the surface of cells (10Aisen P. Enns C. Wessling-Resnick M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 940-959Google Scholar). The apo- or iron-depleted hTF is poorly recognized by the receptor at physiological pH. The hTF-receptor complex is endocytosed; within the endosome, a proton pump results in a drop in the pH to ∼5.6, triggering iron release. This step is not well defined despite intensive research efforts. The entire cycle occurs in 2–3 min (11Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Google Scholar). Iron binding and release is characterized by a large conformational change. When iron is released, the two domains move away from each other by means of a hinge located in two antiparallel β-strands that lie behind the iron-binding site in each lobe. In the N-lobe of transferrin, one domain rotates 63° relative to the other about this hinge (12MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Chen J. Anderson B.F. Baker H. Luo Y.G. Bewley M. Smith C.A. Murphy M.E.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13978-13986Google Scholar). The precise mechanism for this movement remains unclear, but protonation of several key amino acid residues appears to be critical to the release of iron (see below). Many studies have clearly demonstrated that an arginine located near the iron-binding site (Arg-124 in hTF/2N) stabilizes the synergistic carbonate anion. This arginine is highly conserved in each lobe of all mammalian TFs. As detailed previously (4Faber H."

However, if cholesterol phase separates into crystalline cholesterol at such ratios, it is difficult to conceive how these microdomains effectively facilitate cholesterol transport, potocytosis, and signaling (2Schroeder F. Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. McIntosh A. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. Starodub O. Chao H. Yang H. Frolov A. Kier A.B. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 873-890Google Scholar,3Anderson R. Annu. Rev.

Therefore, it is important to determine the structural form of cholesterol within the plasma membrane, especially in lipid rafts/caveolae, as well as in other intracellular organelles and membranes. Unfortunately, relatively few noninvasive, nonperturbing techniques exist for real time visualization of cholesterol structures in biological membranes or in living cells (18Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Google Scholar, 25Guo W. Morrisett J.D. DeBakey M.E. Lawrie G.M. Hamilton J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1630-1636Google Scholar).The present investigation addresses these issues by taking advantage of two major technological advances. First, the spectral properties of a naturally occurring fluorescent sterol, dehydroergosterol (DHE), 1The abbreviations used are: DHE, dehydroergosterol or Δ5,7,9(11),22-ergostatetraen-3β-ol; SCP-2, sterol carrier protein-2; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DPH, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; MPLSM, multiphoton laser scanning microscopy; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PMT, photomultiplier tubes 1The abbreviations used are: DHE, dehydroergosterol or Δ5,7,9(11),22-ergostatetraen-3β-ol; SCP-2, sterol carrier protein-2; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DPH, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; MPLSM, multiphoton laser scanning microscopy; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PMT, photomultiplier tubes differ in monomeric and crystalline forms (26Schroeder F.

J. 1997; 72: 2226-2236Google Scholar). DHE consists of up to 20% membrane sterol in yeast and sponge membranes, is taken up from the culture medium of microorganisms and cultured fibroblasts, codistributes with endogenous sterol among intracellular membranes (replaces nearly 90% of endogenous membrane cholesterol), and does not alter cell growth, membrane structure, or function of sterol-sensitive membrane proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Schroeder F.

Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Google Scholar). The structural, transfer, and functional properties of DHE closely mimic those of cholesterol in lipoproteins and membranes (1Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R. Kier A.B. Knittell J. Scallen T.J. Wood W.G.

Second, the development of new fluorescence imaging technologies, i.e. multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM), now makes it possible to resolve multiple membrane and cellular forms of cholesterol in living cells (32Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P. Stolowich N.J. Scott A.I. Kier A.B. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12769-12780Google Scholar). Because DHE absorption occurs in the ultraviolet region, single photon excitation (used in conventional, video, and confocal imaging microscopy) results in significant photobleaching and phototoxicity (32Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P. Stolowich N.J. Scott A.I. Kier A.B. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking.

In contrast, MPLSM utilizes infrared radiation to overcome these problems (32Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P. Stolowich N.J. Scott A.I. Kier A.B. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12769-12780Google Scholar) and, as shown herein, now provides high resolution images of multiple structural forms of sterol within living cells.DISCUSSIONBecause of its influence on membrane fluidity, permeability, cell-cell recognition, transport, receptor-effector coupling, and microdomain (e.g. caveolae and rafts) function, the cholesterol content of cellular membranes must be tightly regulated (reviewed in Refs. 2Schroeder F. Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. McIntosh A. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. Starodub O. Chao H. Yang H. Frolov A. Kier A.B. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 873-890Google Scholar and 53Schroeder F.

Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1661-1667Google Scholar). This is especially important in view of the fact that abnormal regulation of membrane cholesterol content and/or distribution impairs membrane function (reviewed in Refs. 2Schroeder F. Gallegos A.M.

Despite these findings relatively little is known regarding the organization of membrane cholesterol, especially when cholesterol is present in molar excess over membrane phospholipid. Likewise, almost nothing is known regarding the real time, direct visualization of different structural forms of cholesterol in membranes or cells (reviewed in Refs. 18Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Google Scholar and25Guo W. Morrisett J.D. DeBakey M.E. Lawrie G.M. Hamilton J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1630-1636Google Scholar). The data presented here address these issues and provide the following new insights.First, crystalline and monomeric forms of sterol were differentiated spectroscopically. Monomeric DHE exhibited emission maxima near 354, 370, and 394 nm in anhydrous ethanol, whereas those of crystalline DHE were significantly red-shifted to 356, 403, and 426 nm. These emission characteristics of crystalline DHE were not due to the presence of impurities. The onset of the red-shift was concomitant with the formation of DHE microcrystals in aqueous buffers (27Fischer R.T. Cowlen M.S. Dempsey M.E. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3322-3331Google Scholar, 30Loura L.M.S. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2226-2236Google Scholar) at concentrations similar to that where cholesterol has been shown to form microcrystals in aqueous buffers (49Loomis C.R. Shipley G.G. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 525-535Google Scholar, 61Haberland M.E. Reynolds J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2313-2318Google Scholar, 62Renshaw P.F. Janoff A.S. Miller K.W. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 47-51Google Scholar, 63Small D.M. Shipley G.G. Science. 1974; 185: 222-229Google Scholar). Several techniques were applied to determine whether the change in spectral characteristics from ethanol to water was due to formation of microcrystals or of micelles. Observation by polarizing light microscopy revealed birefringent structures resembling those reported to be cholesterol monohydrate microcrystals (60Wood W.G. Schroeder F. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Lipids. 1999; 34: 225-234Google Scholar, 61Haberland M.E. Reynolds J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2313-2318Google Scholar, 62Renshaw P.F. Janoff A.S. Miller K.W. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 47-51Google Scholar, 63Small D.M. Shipley G.G. Science. 1974; 185: 222-229Google Scholar) and are therefore presumed to be dehydroergosterol monohydrate crystals. Filtration up to 0.5 μm eliminated all detectable emission, indicating that the fluorescence is derived from an aggregate with a lower size limit of >0.5 μm, most likely the observed microcrystals. In corroboration, the addition of DPH to μm concentrations of DHE in aqueous buffer did not reveal any incorporation into micelles of DHE, regardless of the possible occurrence of micellar agglomeration. These results compared favorably with the same experiments applied to cholesterol at similar concentrations and conditions.Although determination of the exact photophysical nature of crystalline DHE involves a complex discussion of exciton theory (64Pope M. Pope M. Swenberg C.E. Electronic Processes in Organic Crystals and Polymers. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 1-189Google Scholar), one can consider a simple interaction mechanism with a nearest neighbor in the form of a physical sandwich dimer, because steroid fused rings form α-face-to-α-face dimers as well as β-face-to-β-face dimers in crystals (65Martin R.B. Yeagle P.L. Lipids. 1978; 13: 594-597Google Scholar). For example, the crystalline absorption spectrum exhibited characteristics such as a bathochromatic shift accompanied by spectral broadening, some increase in intensity of higher order vibrational bands, and overall hypochromism. The crystalline spectral emission exhibited a red shift in the emission maxima (354 to 356 nm and 370 to 375 nm) whose intensities were decreased from those in the monomer, whereas the lower energy transitions (exhibiting maxima at 403 and 426 nm) were increased dramatically in intensity. This was indicative of enhanced Franck-Condon factors and fast relaxation times into the lowest energy level where there must be less nonradiative processes and stronger wave function overlap with higher vibrational levels in the ground state. A larger lifetime component consistent with a smaller nonradiative transfer rate was observed in the crystalline form (30Loura L.M.S. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2226-2236Google Scholar). The possibility that the enhanced emission could also be due to the formation of excited state dimers (excimers) was considered based on the fact that the conjugated triene double bonds in DHE are part of a planar, ring structure. Such structures, when stacked face-to-face, allow the overlap of the electron clouds of the two molecules and thereby facilitate excimeric interaction. Typically, excimer formation is concentrationdependent and fluoresces at longer wavelengths than monomers as well as exhibits higher quantum yield than the monomer. However, excimeric emission is usually broad and structureless because the excimer dissociates due to the strong repulsive force between the molecules in the ground state. As can be seen in Fig. 1 D, vibrational structural features were present in the subtracted spectrum. Regardless of whether the DHE formed physical dimers and/or excimers, these differences in the spectral emissive characteristics of the monomeric and crystalline DHE allowed the determination of their relative proportions in solvents, model membranes, biological membranes, and organelles (e.g. lysosomes).Second, these differences in the spectral emission characteristics of the monomeric and crystalline DHE permitted determination of their relative proportions in model membranes. The structural form of DHE in model membranes was primarily monomeric even at molar ratios of sterol:phospholipid substantially >1. This observation was surprising in view of previous studies on sterol packing in model membranes. While at low mol % the sterol is uniformly dispersed/solubilized in the membrane, and increasing the sterol:phospholipid molar ratio from 0.25 to 1 results in formation of interdigitated, transbilayer sterol dimers (66Sankaram M.B. Marsh D. Gierasch L.M. Thompson T.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1959-1968Google Scholar). Over the same concentration, DHE self-quenches in model membranes by Forster energy transfer (29Schroeder F. Barenholz Y. Gratton E. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2441-2448Google Scholar, 30Loura L.M.S. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2226-2236Google Scholar). The Forster energy transfer distance for this homotransfer between face-to-face oriented DHE molecules is 13.3 Å (30Loura L.M.S. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2226-2236Google Scholar). Because sterol and phosphatidylcholine are 6 (13Small D.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 103-129Google Scholar) and 8 Å (30Loura L.M.S. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2226-2236Google Scholar) thick, respectively, Forster homotransfer of energy is efficient even if the DHE molecules are separated by one phospholipid molecule. In contrast, at sterol:phospholipid molar ratios >1 an immiscible sterol phase forms in model membranes (reviewed in Refs. 13Small D.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 103-129Google Scholar, 67Rice P.A. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6445-6448Google Scholar, and 68Mantripragada B. Sankaram B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8689-8690Google Scholar). Based on x-ray and NMR data, it had previously been assumed that this immiscible sterol phase is identical to pure crystalline sterol monohydrate (reviewed in Refs. 13Small D.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 103-129Google Scholar, 67Rice P.A. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6445-6448Google Scholar, and 68Mantripragada B. Sankaram B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8689-8690Google Scholar). If massive formation of pure crystalline DHE had occurred in membranes with DHE:phospholipid molar ratios >1, the concomitant formation of face-to-face DHE dimers would have resulted in preponderant emission at longer wavelength. On the contrary, the data presented here with DHE clearly showed that even at sterol:phospholipid molar ratios >1 there was only a small amount of phase-separated DHE with properties identical to that in pure DHE crystals. The molecular basis for this apparent contradiction between results obtained by the various techniques (x-ray and NMR versus fluorescence) may be explained as follows.One possibility is that the different techniques detecting phase-separated immiscible sterol may not necessarily report on the same aspects of sterol structural packing in membranes. Although the x-ray and NMR techniques largely report on transbilayer thickness/distance between sterol molecules, it is unclear whether these techniques differentiate the multiple potential forms of lateral phase-separated sterol in membranes: pure cholesterol patches, ribbons of sterol, and/or sterol-sterol with different orientations (edge-to-edge, α-face-to-α-face, β-face-to-β-face, and α-face-to-β-face), etc. (reviewed in Refs. 65Martin R.B. Yeagle P.L. Lipids. 1978; 13: 594-597Google Scholar, 69Castanho M.A. Brown W. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1455-1461Google Scholar, and 70Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Konikoff F.M. Donovan J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11341-11345Google Scholar). In contrast, DHE emission characteristics detect the formation of face-to-face lateral interactions between sterols, which emit with greater quantum yield and at higher wavelength. As shown here over the DHE:phospholipid molar ratio ranging from 0.5 to 3, DHE detected only small amounts (1–10%) of immiscible DHE whose structure (identified by longer wavelength emission maxima) appeared identical to pure crystalline DHE or other face-to-face sterol packings.An alternative explanation of the different results obtained by the x-ray and NMR of cholesterol versus fluorescence of DHE is that the phase behavior of DHE may differ markedly from that of cholesterol in model membranes. Although it is important to recognize that DHE and cholesterol are not identical, this latter possibility was considered unlikely based on the very similar behavior of these sterols in a variety of model membrane systems (reviewed in Refs. 26Schroeder F.

Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 that increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho GTPases to accelerate the return of the proteins to the inactive state (5Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors that sequester the GDP-bound form of Rho GTPases and may also regulate their intracellular localization (7Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). One emerging theme from recent studies of Rho GTPase regulation is that a balanced act between the activation and the deactivation signals is required for effective signal flow through Rho GTPases, and this may involve concerted action of all classes of regulatory proteins (8Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Understanding how such a balance is achieved in various physiological situations represents a major challenge in elucidating the regulatory mechanism of Rho GTPases. Together with Rho family GTPases, RhoGAPs are found in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to human, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role in eukaryotic cell regulation. So far over 30 RhoGAP family members have been reported, and more are found in mammalian genomes (9McPherson J.D. Marra M. Hillier L. Waterston R.H. Chinwalla A. Wallis J. Sekhon M. Wylie K. Mardis E.R. Wilson R.K. Fulton R. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 934-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar,10Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W., Li, P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M. Evans C.A. Holt R.A. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10698) Google Scholar). RhoGAPs may therefore far outnumber their cellular substrates,i.e. the Rho family GTPases that stand with 20 members. The overabundance of RhoGAPs evidently suggests that each RhoGAP may play a specialized role in regulating individual Rho GTPase activity and/or in mediating their specific functions. Moreover, the biochemical GAP activities of each RhoGAP must also be fine-tuned in cells by tight regulation in a spacial and temporal manner such that Rho GTPases would not be turned off all the time. In neuronal systems, RhoGAPs and their substrate Rho GTPases have been implicated in regulating multiple processes of the morphological development of neurons, including axon growth, guidance, branch stabilization, and dendritic elaboration (6Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 11Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). For example, the Rho-specific RhoGAP p190 has been shown to dissolve actin stress fibers when introduced into fibroblasts (12Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and was found to be essential for exon stability in mushroom body neurons in Drosophila (13Billuart P. Winter C.G. Maresh A. Zhao X. Luo L. Cell. 2002; 107: 195-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Deletion of p190 in mice led to deregulation of Rho GTPase function and neuronal malfunction that is stemmed from Src kinase-regulated adhesion signaling defect (14Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Settleman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The discovery of a RhoGAP, oligophrenin-1, that is associated with X-linked mental retardation (15Billuart P. Bienvenu T. Ronce N. des Portes V. Vinet M.C. Zemni R. Crollius H.R. Carrie A. Fauchereau F. Cherry M. et al.Nature. 1998; 392: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), further underlines the significance of RhoGAP in the nervous system. Thus, it is of particular interest to examine what role each individual RhoGAP might play in complex biological systems and how the RhoGAP activity is controlled in response to cellular stimulation. In the present work, we describe the identification and initial characterization of a novel member of the RhoGAP family, p200RhoGAP. p200RhoGAP is brain-specific and acts as a GAP to down-regulate RhoA and Rac1 activities in vitro and in vivo. In N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells it is localized at the cortical actin site in the undifferentiated state and at the ends of the neurite extensions in the differentiated state. Overexpression of the RhoGAP domain or full-length p200RhoGAP in N1E-115 cells induced a differentiation phenotype. Moreover we found that p200RhoGAP binds to the SH3 domain of Src in vitro and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon association with active Src in cells. These results suggest that this novel RhoGAP may have a role in neuronal differentiation, and its cellular function may be subject to the regulation by Src or Src-like kinases. Rabbit antisera against p200RhoGAP were raised using an N-terminal polypeptide derived from p200RhoGAP (residues 11–25; KQRGILKERVFGCDL) that was conjugated to KLH as an immunogen. Immunization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis for the verification of the specificity of the antibody were performed by Sigma-Genosys. Antiserum was purified by protein A affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). The anti-GST monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, and the anti-HA antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies and rhodamine-conjugate phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes. Monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., anti-Rac1 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-Cdc42 was from BD Biosciences. Anti-phospho-tyrosine and anti-Src antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. A human cDNA clone containing a RhoGAP homology domain, KIAA0712, was obtained from Dr. Takahiro Nagase at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). The cDNA clone was sequenced to verify the reported sequences, and a missing guanine at the position 414 was detected and corrected. Genomic DNA searches were performed by using the BLAST program in NCBI genomic data base for the human p200RhoGAP and in the Celera genomic data base for the murine p200RhoGAP. The exon sequences were identified manually by the GT-AG rule (16Lewin B. Genes VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 688Google Scholar). Recombinant RhoGAP domain of p200RhoGAP (residues 1–251) was generated by polymerase chain reaction of the coding cDNA and subsequent subcloning of the PCR fragment into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T vector (AmershamBiosciences). GAP(R58K) that bears a mutation of arginine to lysine at the predicted catalytic arginine (residue 58) was generated by introducing a point mutation using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (17Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and was cloned into pGEX-2T vector similarly. GST fusion constructs of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA were described before (17Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,18Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GST fusion constructs of SH3 domains of Src, PLCγ, p85α, Crk, Abl, spectrin, and Grb2 (C) were kind gifts from Dr. Steve Taylor (University of California). Production and purification of the GST fusion proteins were as described (17Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The purity of the recombinant proteins was estimated at ≥90% by Coomassie Blue staining of the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified proteins. The cDNAs encoding RhoGAP domain (residues 1–251), the GAP domain containing the arginine mutation (GAP(R58K)), full-length p200RhoGAP, the full-length p200RhoGAP containing the arginine mutation (p200(R58K)), and the C-terminal region of p200RhoGAP (p200-C; residues 224–1738) were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCEFL-GST to be expressed as GST fusions and into the pKH3 vector to be expressed as (HA)3 fusions. The cDNAs were also cloned into a retroviral vector pMX-GFP that bicistronically expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) to be expressed by retroviral infection (19Zhu K. Debrecini B., Li, R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pKH3 constructs of the HA-tagged Rho GTPases were described before (19Zhu K. Debrecini B., Li, R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the pCDNA3 constructs expressing kinase-deficient Src (Src(K295R/Y527F)), wild type c-Src, or constitutively active Src (Src(Y527F)) were obtained from Dr. Steve Taylor (University of California). For Northern blot analysis, representative organs were harvested from two adult mice. Each organ was briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and was resuspended in RNAzol B solution (Tel-Test). The tissues were homogenated by using a Teflon homogenizer in gentle strokes, and the RNA extraction was performed by adding chloroform to 1/10 of the volume of the homogenate. After the extraction, the aqueous phase was taken for alcohol precipitation of RNA. Equal amount of RNA (∼30 μg) was loaded on each lane for gel electrophoresis and subsequent transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with32P radiolabeled cDNA probes prepared by the random priming method (Amersham Biosciences). A 668-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the residue's C terminus of the RhoGAP domain of p200RhoGAP (residues 758–1002) was used as a template for the random priming labeling. The hybridization conditions were as recommended byAmersham Biosciences. A human multiple tissue RNA blot was obtained from Clontech, Inc. for the Northern blot analysis following similar protocols. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates or co-precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h and probed with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for enhanced chemiluminescence analysis (Amersham Biosciences). The intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activities of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA were measured as described by the nitrocellulose filter-binding method (17Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant G-proteins were preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP (10 μCi, 6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 100-μl buffer containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mmEDTA for 10 min at ambient temperature before the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. An aliquot of the [γ-32P]GTP-loaded RhoA was mixed with GAP assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of GAP. At different time points the reaction was terminated by filtering the reaction mixture through nitrocellulose filters followed by washing with 10 ml of ice-cold buffer with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 10 mm MgCl2. The radioactivities retained on the filters were then subjected to quantification by scintillation counting. Swiss 3T3 cells and COS-7 cells were cultured and maintained as described previously (19Zhu K. Debrecini B., Li, R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were obtained from ATCC. The cells were cultured in dishes coated with 20 μg/ml laminin and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. For transient expression, COS-7 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes at a density of 5 × 105cells/dish. The next day, plasmid constructs were transfected into the cells by using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transient expression in N1E-115 cells, the cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes at a density of 6 × 105, and the transfections were carried out by using Cytofectin (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after the transfections, cells were either fixed for immunofluorescence analysis or washed with ice-cold PBS once, and the whole cell extracts were prepared in a cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmNaF, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The recombinant retroviruses expressing various p200RhoGAP constructs were generated by using the retroviral packaging Phoenix cell system (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) with a retroviral construct that bicistronically expresses green fluorescent protein as described (19Zhu K. Debrecini B., Li, R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 and N1E-115 cells were infected with the respective retroviruses according to an established protocol (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). To observe ligand-induced actin structural changes, Swiss 3T3 cells were serum-starved overnight and challenged for 10 min with 20 ng/ml lysophosphotidyl acid (Sigma), 10 ng/ml PDGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or 100 ng/ml Bradykinin (Sigma) before fixation. For immunofluorescence staining, Swiss 3T3 cells were fixed with 3.8% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min followed by incubation with the TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to visualize the actin filaments. In N1E-115 cells, endogenous p200RhoGAP was detected by staining the cells with anti-p200RhoGAP polyclonal antibody followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The actin filaments were stained with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The fluorescent images were obtained by using a Leica fluorescence microscope. The p21-binding domain (PBD) pull-down assays to determine the activation status of the Rho family GTPases were performed as described (19Zhu K. Debrecini B., Li, R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged Rho GTPases expressing plasmid and a vector expressing various GST-tagged p200RhoGAP cDNAs. 48 h post-transfection, the cell lysates prepared in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were incubated with GST fusion of the PBDs of PAK1, WASP, or Rhotekin that were bound on glutathione beads. The expression of each protein was confirmed on Western blots using either anti-HA or anti-GST antibodies. The amount of RhoA-GTP, Rac1-GTP, or Cdc42-GTP that was pulled down by the bead-associated PBD of PAK1, WASP, or Rhotekin was detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. Quantification of Western blots was carried out using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 digital imaging system. We have been interested in identifying novel RhoGAPs that display distinctive tissue distribution patterns. Data base searches using the conserved RhoGAP domain as a probe led us to a few previously uncharacterized protein sequences that show different extent of homology to the known RhoGAPs. Among these proteins, we identified a cDNA clone predicted to encode 1738 amino acids containing a RhoGAP domain at the N terminus (GenBankTM accession numbers AB018255 and KIAA0712; see Fig. 1 A). Comparison of this cDNA clone with the corresponding human genomic sequences in the NCBI data base (accession number AP000751) revealed that a guanine base at nucleotide position 414 was missing in the KIAA clone, resulting in a loss of 17 amino acids at the N terminus and a reading frameshift. This gene is located at chromosome 11q. We named this novel putative RhoGAP p200RhoGAP based on its predicted molecular mass. Using the human cDNA sequences, we further identified the mouse homolog of p200RhoGAP by searching the Celera mouse genome data base (GA_x5J8B7W6RL5; see Fig. 1 A). Both the human and the mouse cDNA sequences are composed of 12 exons, and mouse p200RhoGAP shows 86% sequence identity to human p200RhoGAP. A sequence comparison analysis indicated the existence of an N-terminal RhoGAP domain, as well as five C-terminal proline-rich domains in human p200RhoGAP (four proline-rich domains in the mouse homolog). In the N-terminal RhoGAP domain, the critical residues that are required for the GAP activity, including a highly conserved arginine (Arg-58), are well represented, suggesting that the GAP domain might be involved in the down-regulation of Rho GTPases (Fig. 1 B). The RhoGAP domain of p200RhoGAP is most similar to that of CdGAP with 70% sequence identity (21Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and less to that of other RhoGAPs (36% identity to n-chimaerin, 27% to Cdc42GAP, and 28% to p190). However, outside the RhoGAP region the sequences of p200RhoGAP diverge from other RhoGAPs. Moreover, the proline-rich sequences present in all five proline-rich regions of p200RhoGAP appear to confer to the class II SH3 domain binding consensus (21Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) that are found in other signaling RhoGAPs including p190, p85α, Cdc42GAP, Bcr, and 3BP-1 (Fig. 1 C). To examine the tissue expression pattern of p200RhoGAP, we prepared a multiple tissue Northern blot using various mouse organs harvested from a 6-week-old male C57/BL6 mouse. To ensure the specificity of the signal, a radiolabeled probe was designed from the sequences outside of the conserved N-terminal RhoGAP domain. The Northern blot analysis showed that p200RhoGAP is specifically expressed in the brain but not in other tissues examined (Fig. 2). Similar Northern blot pattern was seen in a human multi-tissue mRNA blot (data not shown). Because a single hybridization signal was observed in a number of repeated hybridization experiments, it seems that p200RhoGAP does not have closely related family members that cross-react with the probe. To determine the function of the N-terminal RhoGAP domain of p200RhoGAP, we performed an in vitro GTPase activity test using the RhoGAP domain, as well as a mutant RhoGAP domain carrying a point mutation (R58K) at the predicted catalytic arginine site. When incubated with RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42, the RhoGAP domain could significantly stimulate the GTPase activity of all three GTPases whereas the R58K mutant failed to do so (Fig. 3). The RhoGAP domain showed higher GAP efficiency toward RhoA compared with Rac1 or Cdc42. In addition, the presence of increasing concentrations of the RhoGAP domain further enhanced the stimulatory effect (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the RhoGAP domain of p200RhoGAP can function as a GAP for Rho GTPasesin vitro. A number of effector proteins are known to be able to form a tight complex exclusively with the active form of RhoGTPases through their PBD (3Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). We next examined the in vivo substrate specificity of p200RhoGAP toward Rho GTPases using the immobilized GST fusion PBDs of Rhotekin, WASP, and PAK1 as bait for selective binding of RhoA-GTP, Cdc42-GTP, and Rac1-GTP, respectively. In COS-7 cells, wild type RhoA, constitutively active mutant of RhoA (V14RhoA), or dominant negative mutant of RhoA (N19RhoA) was cotransfected with a plasmid expressing the RhoGAP domain of p200RhoGAP (GAP), the catalytic arginine mutant of the RhoGAP domain (GAP(R58K)), the full-length p200RhoGAP (p200), or the full-length containing the arginine residue mutation (p200(R58K)). The lysates of the transfectants were incubated with immobilized p21-binding domain of Rhotekin, and the co-precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-RhoA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, constitutively active RhoA (V14RhoA) readily associated with GST-Rhotekin in the presence or absence of the RhoGAP domain, whereas dominant negative RhoA (N19RhoA) did not interact with this probe. The amount of active RhoA was significantly reduced (a 76% reduction) by the presence of the RhoGAP domain in the cells in comparison to the conditions in which the RhoGAP was absent. Furthermore, the catalytic arginine residue mutant of the RhoGAP domain, GAP(R58K), was only partially (24% reduction) effective in down-regulating RhoA activity (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, RhoA-GTP was slightly reduced by the full-length p200RhoGAP (a 30% reduction) and by the full-length molecule bearing the arginine mutation, p200(R58K) (a 22% reduction). These results suggest that the RhoGAP domain is an active GAP toward RhoA, and the full-length p200RhoGAP can weakly deactivate RhoA in vivo. Similar sets of experiments were also performed to examine the in vivoGTPase-activating efficacy of the RhoGAP domain and full-length p200RhoGAP toward Rac1 and Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 4 B, neither the RhoGAP domain nor the full-length p200RhoGAP can inactivate Cdc42 effectively. In contrast, expression of the RhoGAP domain significantly reduced the Rac1-GTP species (a 67% reduction) whereas the full-length had only a minor effect (29% reduction) (Fig. 4 C). Again, mutation of the catalytic arginine residue in the RhoGAP domain, Arg-58, to lysine reduced the negative regulatory effect of the GAP (a 23% reduction of Rac1-GTP). Taken together, these results indicate that p200RhoGAP preferentially regulates RhoA and Rac1 activity through the catalytic GAP domain in cells. To investigate the cellular role of p200RhoGAP, the RhoGAP domain was expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells, and the effect on actin cytoskeleton was examined by staining actin filaments with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. An expression vector that bicistronically expresses GFP as a marker was used to track the RhoGAP expressing cells in the culture dish. As shown in Fig. 5, the cells expressing RhoGAP domain became insensitive to lysophosphatidic acid stimulation under conditions that readily induced heavy stress fibers in the GFP expressing cells. When the RhoGAP domain expressing cells were stimulated with PDGF, minimal membrane ruffles were observed under conditions at which the GFP expressing cells displayed significant membrane ruffles on the cell surface (Fig. 5). Further, the RhoGAP domain of p200 did not affect Bradykinin-induced actin microspike formation that is mediated by Cdc42 activation (Fig. 5). These effects are similar to those observed in the case of CdGAP (22Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), another RhoGAP family member, and are consistent with a negative role of the RhoGAP domain in the regulation of Rac and Rho activities in these cells, because one of direct consequences of the inactivation of RhoA and Rac1 in fibroblasts is loss of stress fibers or cell rounding (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 12Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The effects of the RhoGAP domain, i.e. disruption of actin stress fibers and membrane ruffles stimulated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or PDGF, suggests that it favor RhoA and Rac1 as a substrate in this cellular context. Because the p200RhoGAP mRNA was found exclusively in the"

On both the FVB/N (FVB) and C57BL/6J (B6) backgrounds, AZIP mice have a similarly severe lack of white adipose tissue and comparably increased insulin levels and triglyceride secretion rates. However, on the B6 background, the AZIP mice have less hyperglycemia, lower circulating triglyceride and fatty acid levels, and lower mortality. AZIP characteristics that are more severe on the B6 background include increased liver size and liver triglyceride content. A unifying hypothesis is that the B6 strain has higher triglyceride clearance into the liver, with lower triglyceride levels elsewhere. This may account for the observation that the B6 AZIP mice have less insulin-resistant muscles and more insulin-resistant livers, than do the FVB AZIP mice. B6 wild type, as well as B6 AZIP, mice have increased triglyceride clearance relative to FVB, which may be explained in part by higher serum lipase levels and liver CD36/fatty acid translocase mRNA levels. Thus, it is likely that increased triglyceride clearance in B6, as compared with FVB, mice contributes to the strain differences in insulin resistance and lipid metabolism.

They are caused by interactions among many genes and environmental factors. Each susceptibility gene is thought to make a relatively small contribution to the phenotype and it is likely that different populations carry overlapping, but distinct sets of susceptibility genes. In humans, a number of studies have identified chromosomal regions that contain diabetes or obesity loci, but the specific gene and responsible mutations/polymorphisms have been definitively identified in only a few cases (3Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J., Li, X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E. del Bosque-Plata L. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I. Colilla S. Polonsky K.S. Wei S. Concannon P. Iwasaki N.

A number of major diabetes and obesity genes have been identified in mice. Indeed, our current knowledge of the physiology of body weight regulation and obesity is the direct result of the study of mutant mice. Whereas most of the genes discovered cause monogenic disease, they identify the pathways that are likely to be affected in polygenic disease. Additionally, the background genotype has a profound effect on the phenotype of monogenic mutants. For example, homozygousob or db (now officiallyLepob and Leprdb, affecting leptin and leptin receptor, respectively) mutations on the B6 background cause obesity, mild hyperglycemia, and profoundly elevated insulin levels. The same mutations on the C57BLKS/J background produce severe diabetes and early mortality, with less obesity and hyperinsulinemia (4Hummel K.P. Coleman D.L. Lane P.W. Biochem.

We have been studying the transgenic A-ZIP/F-1 (hereafter, AZIP)1 mouse, which was produced by adipose-selective expression of a dominant-negative protein (6Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M. Krylov D.

These mice lack virtually all of their white adipose tissue (WAT). The lack of WAT causes severe insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, elevated serum triglycerides and fatty acids, and massively increased liver triglyceride levels (6Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M.

The syndrome is remarkably similar to that of patients with severe lipoatrophic diabetes (10Foster D.W. Fauci A.S. Braunwald E. Isselbacher K.J. Wilson J.D. Martin J.B. Kasper D.L. Hauser S.L.

Here we report the characterization of the AZIP phenotype on the B6 background and compare it to the FVB phenotype. The FVB and B6 backgrounds were chosen for practical reasons. The original AZIP transgenic mouse was generated on the FVB background, which, for technical ease, is commonly used to make transgenic mice (12Taketo M. Schroeder A.C. Mobraaten L.E. Gunning K.B. Hanten G. Fox R.R. Roderick T.H. Stewart C.L. Lilly F. Hansen C.T. Overbeek P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The other strain, B6, is arguably the best characterized mouse strain, particularly for metabolic phenotypes, and is among the first to have its genome sequenced. The FVB and B6 strains are genetically quite distant (13Beck J.A. Lloyd S. Hafezparast M. Lennon-Pierce M. Eppig J.T. Festing M.F. Fisher E.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Here we report that genetic background has a profound effect on many aspects of the AZIP phenotype, including opposite effects on muscle and liver insulin resistance. Furthermore, we have observed differences in triglyceride clearance between wild type FVB and B6 mice that may explain some of the AZIP differences. All AZIP mice were studied as hemizygotes, produced by breeding hemizygous males with wild type females. B6 AZIP mice were obtained by at least 13 generations of backcrossing AZIP males with B6 (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) females. Although referred to as B6, all of the B6 AZIP and control males have the FVB Y chromosome. The B6 AZIP mice may carry advantageous FVB alleles, selectively retained during the backcrossing, because some AZIP mice die before reaching breeding age (see “Results”). FVB mice were originally obtained from the Veterinary Resources Program, the National Institutes of Health, and Harlan Sprague-Dawley. Mice were typically housed 3–5 per cage, on a 12-h light/dark cycle (0600–1800), and fed NIH-07 rodent chow (12.9 kcal % fat, Zeigler Brothers Inc., Gardners, PA) and waterad libitum. Wild-type controls were generally littermates. Animal experiments were approved by the NIDDK Animal Care and Use Committee. Blood was obtained by tail bleed from unaesthetized mice and was immediately analyzed for glucose concentration. Glucose was measured using a Glucometer Elite (Bayer Corp., Elkhart, IN). Triglycerides (number 339-11; Sigma), nonesterified fatty acids (number 1383175; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cholesterol (number 401; Sigma), and insulin (number SRI-13K; Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO) were assayed according to the assay suppliers' procedures. Tissue triglycerides were measured as follows (14Burant C.F. Sreenan S. Hirano K. Tai T.A. Lohmiller J. Lukens J. Davidson N.O. Ross S. Graves R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2900-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Tissue (∼100 mg) was homogenized in 3 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol and shaken at room temperature for 4 h. Next, 1.5 ml of 0.1 m NaCl was added, mixed, centrifuged, and the lower organic phase containing triglycerides was transferred to a new glass tube and air-dried. The residue was hydrolyzed (70 °C, 1 h) in 200 μl of 3m KOH in 65% ethanol and the released glycerol was quantitated using a radiometric glycerol kinase assay (15Bradley D.C. Kaslow H.R. Anal.

The clamp protocols are based on those of Kim and Shulman (17Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Youn J.H. Kim J.K.

The target plasma insulin level was 4 ng/ml and the target plasma glucose was 110–120 mg/dl. Triglyceride secretion was studied by measuring the increase in circulating triglycerides after lipase inhibition by WR1339 (21Borensztajn J. Rone M.S. Kotlar T.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Tietge U.J. Bakillah A. Maugeais C. Tsukamoto K. Hussain M. Rader D.J. J.

Briefly, mice were given ad libitum access to a fat-free diet (Frosted Flakes, Kellogg, Battle Creek, MI) for 4 h then anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Phoenix Scientific, St. Joseph, MO). WR1339 (Sigma, number T-8761, 100 μl of a 1:10 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline) was injected via warmed tail vein and blood samples were withdrawn at 0, 1, and 2 h. Plasma triglycerides were measured colorimetrically. Data are expressed as milligrams of triglyceride/kg of body weight/h, assuming plasma volume is 3.5% of body weight. Clearance of triglyceride (400 μl of peanut oil, delivered by gavage) from the circulation was measured in mice previously fasted for 4 h. Blood was taken hourly via tail vein for 6 h and plasma triglycerides were measured as described above. Total RNA was prepared, hybridized, and quantitated by PhosphorImager as described previously (9Chao L. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Moitra J. Vinson C. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. J. Clin.

Data were analyzed using SigmaStat (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) byt test or two-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test for pairwise multiple comparisons. To follow up on preliminary observations suggesting an effect of genetic background on the AZIP phenotype, we quantitated multiple characteristics of the AZIP mice. No significant white adipose depots were found in AZIP mice on either the B6 or FVB genetic background. The brown adipose tissue phenotype of the B6 AZIP and FVB AZIP mice was also similar, with relatively normal amounts and appearance at birth followed by reduction in size (TableI) and an inactive gross and histological morphology in adulthood (data not shown).Table IAnatomical characterization of male AZIP mice at 28 weeks of ageStatisticsFVB WTFVB AZIPFVB: AZIP/WTB6 WTB6 AZIPB6: AZIP/WTn = 9n = 4n = 9n = 9Body weight (g)‡‡*33.1 ± 1.231.2 ± 0.99438.4 ± 1.731.5 ± 0.782Body length (cm) **8.20 ± 0.068.05 ± 0.11987.86 ± 0.127.74 ± 0.1098BMI (g/cm2)‡ ** +0.492 ± 0.0130.481 ± 0.009980.620 ± 0.0310.526 ± 0.01185BAT weight (%)‡‡ ** ++0.62 ± 0.040.08 ± 0.01140.41 ± 0.030.08 ± 0.0120Heart weight (%)‡‡ **0.47 ± 0.070.57 ± 0.021210.37 ± 0.020.49 ± 0.01131Spleen weight (%)‡‡ *0.38 ± 0.020.83 ± 0.172210.27 ± 0.010.53 ± 0.07198Kidney weight (%)‡‡ ** ++1.48 ± 0.062.00 ± 0.071351.10 ± 0.041.22 ± 0.03111Liver weight (%)‡‡ ** ++4.1 ± 0.29.1 ± 0.22234.4 ± 0.219.3 ± 1.8435Liver TG (μmol/g)‡‡ ** +14 ± 2166 ± 4438 ± 4295 ± 24Muscle TG (μmol/g)11.1 ± 0.68.7 ± 0.8The body mass index (BMI) is the body weight/(length squared).

FVB AZIP mice are the same size at birth as wild type littermates, but rapidly fall behind in growth, later catching up (males) or growing larger (females) than their littermates (6Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M. Krylov D. Gavrilova O. Marcus- Samuels B. Feigenbaum L. Lee E. Aoyama T. Eckhaus M. Reitman M.L. Vinson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). B6 AZIP males have a different growth pattern, remaining smaller than their littermates (Fig. 1). The growth patterns of B6 AZIP and FVB AZIP females are comparable (data not shown). FVB AZIP mice are severely hyperglycemic, averaging 542 mg/dl in males, compared with 164 mg/dl in controls (Fig. 1). In marked contrast, male B6 AZIP mice have a transient hyperglycemia, peaking at ∼300 mg/dl at 8–12 weeks of age, followed by near normal glucose levels thereafter. The blood glucose levels in female B6 AZIP mice averaged 60 mg/dl higher than the wild type controls and did not show the multiphasic pattern of the male AZIP mice (data not shown). Serum insulin levels were greatly and similarly elevated in B6 and FVB AZIP mice (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the lower, more normal glucose levels in B6 AZIP mice are not because of more insulin secretion, but rather to less insulin resistance. Serum triglyceride levels are also affected by background genotype (Fig. 1). Wild-type male FVB mice had higher triglyceride levels (172 mg/dl) than B6 mice (91 mg/dl). In the FVB mice the AZIP transgene caused a remarkable increase in the triglyceride levels (to ∼750 mg/dl) in young mice (the decrease in triglycerides with aging was not seen in other mice at up to 17 weeks of age). In contrast, in male B6 AZIP mice, serum triglyceride levels averaged only 121 mg/dl. Female B6 wild type and AZIP mice had triglyceride levels of 59 and 51 mg/dl, respectively. Thus, the AZIP transgene barely affects the B6 triglyceride levels, but causes a remarkable increase in FVB triglyceride levels. Serum fatty acid levels were similar in B6 wild type and AZIP mice. Fatty acid levels in FVB wild type and AZIP mice were higher than in B6 mice, with the younger FVB AZIP mice tending to be higher than the wild type FVB mice (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate no background genotype effect on serum insulin levels, but appreciable background genotype effects on body weight, blood glucose, serum triglyceride, and fatty acid levels. In each case the B6 background gives a milder phenotype. To see if the biochemically milder phenotype affects clinical outcome, survival was scored, and indeed was markedly greater in the B6 AZIP mice. At weaning (n = 292) B6 AZIP male and female mice were present at 60 and 96% of the expected levels, respectively. For comparison, FVB AZIP male and female mice were present at only 36 and 47% of the expected levels, respectively (6Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M. Krylov D. Gavrilova O. Marcus- Samuels B. Feigenbaum L. Lee E. Aoyama T. Eckhaus M. Reitman M.L. Vinson C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Mortality between weaning and 6 months of age was also less in the B6 than the FVB AZIP mice, although this was not studied quantitatively. When AZIP mice were studied anatomically, the B6 AZIP mice showed remarkably greater hepatomegaly (4.4-fold enlarged in males and 5.2-fold in females) than did the FVB AZIP mice (2.2-fold in males) (Table I, Fig. 2). (The weights of other organs, brown adipose tissue, heart, spleen, and kidney, also showed significant effects of background genotype, with the AZIP changes generally greater on the FVB background, Table I.) The increased liver weight reflected massively increased liver triglyceride content, giving the livers a lighter color and characteristic histology. Interestingly, in the wild type mice liver triglyceride content was also greater (∼3-fold) in the B6 background. Because organ triglyceride content correlates with insulin resistance, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed to evaluate the individual tissue insulin responsiveness of the AZIP mice. Wild-type B6 and FVB mice were similar in all clamp parameters whereas the B6 AZIP and FVB AZIP mice were quite different (Table II, Fig. 3). The endogenous glucose production of the FVB AZIP mice was suppressed almost as well as in the wild type FVB mice (53 versus 69%, p = nonsignificant; in other studies the difference reached significance (24Kim J.K. Gavrilova O. Chen Y. Reitman M.L. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8456-8460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar)). However, the endogenous glucose production in B6 AZIP mice did not suppress at all during the clamp (Table II, Fig. 3 A). Because endogenous glucose production is chiefly a measure of liver glucose production, these data demonstrate that the B6 AZIP mice have more severe liver insulin resistance than do the FVB AZIP mice.Table IIEuglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp measurementsStatisticsFVB WTFVB AZIPB6 WTB6 AZIPn = 6n = 6n = 6n = 5Body weight (g) *20.9 ± 0.721.3 ± 1.019.2 ± 0.619.1 ± 0.5Basal blood glucose (mg/dl)‡‡ * ++144 ± 14254 ± 15160 ± 11175 ± 9Basal insulin (ng/ml)0.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.1Clamp blood glucose (mg/dl)111 ± 7110 ± 3114 ± 5128 ± 4Clamp insulin (ng/ml)3.2 ± 0.53.3 ± 0.43.1 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.4Glucose infusion rate (μmol/kg BW/min)‡‡235 ± 3141 ± 9294 ± 2167 ± 23Whole body glycolysis (μmol/kg BW/min)‡‡ *237 ± 4276 ± 9279 ± 21182 ± 17Whole body glycogen synthesis (μmol/kg BW/min)38 ± 1123 ± 742 ± 1035 ± 16Muscle glycolysis (μmol/kg muscle/min)‡‡ +213 ± 2184 ± 13202 ± 10160 ± 27Muscle glycogen synthesis (μmol/kg muscle/min)‡‡31 ± 57 ± 124 ± 416 ± 5Suppression of EGP (%)‡‡ * ++69 ± 1353 ± 581 ± 11−8 ± 9Female mice were fasted beginning at 1800 the day before the clamp.

During the clamp, whole body glucose uptake in FVB AZIP mice was only 32% of wild type controls, indicating severe muscle insulin resistance (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, B6 AZIP whole body glucose uptake in mice was 66% of control levels. Direct measurement of muscle glucose uptake with [14C]2-deoxyglucose gave similar results: in FVB AZIP mice the rate was 22% of FVB wild type and in B6 AZIP mice it was 63% of B6 wild type (Fig. 3 C). This pattern was also observed for whole body and muscle glycolysis and for glycogen synthesis (Table II). Thus, the muscles of the FVB AZIP mice are more insulin resistant than those of the B6 AZIP mice, the opposite of the pattern observed for liver. Liver triglyceride levels were determined by triglyceride synthesis, uptake, and secretion rates. To quantitate triglyceride secretion, the rate of increase in circulating triglycerides was measured after inhibiting clearance with Triton WR1339 (21Borensztajn J. Rone M.S. Kotlar T.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Wild-type B6 and FVB mice had similar secretion rates, which were increased significantly by the AZIP transgene (increased 3.1- and 3.6-fold in the B6 and FVB backgrounds, respectively) (Fig. 4 A). Triglyceride clearance was studied by measuring serum triglyceride levels after an oral lipid load. In wild type FVB mice, serum triglycerides peaked at 2 h (382 mg/dl) and then decreased gradually (Fig. 4 B). The increase was accentuated (980 mg/dl) and occurred later (4 h) in FVB AZIP mice, demonstrating that triglyceride clearance on FVB background is greatly impaired in the absence of WAT. Surprisingly, a totally different result was found for the B6 mice. Serum triglycerides rose only minimally in wild type and transgenic mice, peaking at 82 and 128 mg/dl in B6 wild type and B6 AZIP mice, respectively. This was not because of poor triglyceride uptake from the intestine in B6 mice because, in the absence of triglyceride clearance, serum triglyceride levels increased equally in B6 and FVB mice after an oral lipid load (Fig. 4 C). Thus, B6 mice show much more efficient clearance of circulating triglyceride than do FVB mice. Increased lipase activity should increase triglyceride clearance. Serum lipase activity (without heparin), which in mice is largely a measure of hepatic lipase (25Peterson J. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was higher in B6 than FVB mice (TableIII). Post-heparin plasma showed modest increases in both hepatic and lipoprotein lipase activity in wild type B6 as compared with FVB mice, but no striking effect of the AZIP transgene (Table III). Hepatic lipase mRNA levels were not different between the groups, whereas endothelial lipase mRNA levels were lower in the wild type FVB livers than in the other groups (Fig. 5). Liver lipoprotein lipase mRNA levels were <1/20 the level of adipose tissue levels, too low to determine whether differences exist between the groups (data not shown). These data suggest that increased lipase activity may contribute to the increased triglyceride clearance.Table IIISerum chemistries of male miceStatisticsFVB WTFVB AZIPB6 WTB6 AZIPn = 9n = 4n = 8n = 9Glucose (mg/dl)‡‡ ** ++178 ± 11713 ± 87208 ± 16225 ± 27Triglyceride (mg/dl)‡‡ **135 ± 18278 ± 11579 ± 8108 ± 13Cholesterol (mg/dl)‡‡ ** ++117 ± 5124 ± 28129 ± 12245 ± 22Albumin (g/dl)‡ **2.8 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.23.9 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.1Protein (g/dl)‡‡ **4.8 ± 0.15.4 ± 0.35.5 ± 0.26.8 ± 0.2BUN (mg/dl) **39 ± 552 ± 1329 ± 128 ± 1ALT (units/liter)‡‡ ** ++12 ± 172 ± 1727 ± 12285 ± 48AST (units/liter)‡ +148 ± 31146 ± 3581 ± 16275 ± 41Lactate dehydrogenase (units/liter)‡‡ * ++726 ± 1631003 ± 161440 ± 1422550 ± 451Alkaline phosphatase (units/liter)‡‡ **43 ± 3148 ± 3287 ± 14232 ± 25Creatine kinase (units/liter) **18 ± 240 ± 11175 ± 61232 ± 44Lipase (units/liter) **22 ± 124 ± 231 ± 235 ± 4n = 6n = 6n = 6n = 6Postheparin lipoprotein lipase (mmol of fatty acid/ml/h) *38 ± 645 ± 464 ± 854 ± 5Postheparin hepatic lipase (mmol of FA/ml/h) **12 ± 115 ± 220 ± 118 ± 1Chemistries at 28 weeks of age were determined in nonfasting mice anesthetized with avertin and bled between 0900 and 1400.

Comparing AZIP to wild type mice, the lipogenic gene (SREBP1, PPARγ, acyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and SCD-1) mRNA levels were higher in the AZIP mice.

https://openalex.org/W2044954335,"Previous work has shown that small DNA loop heterologies are repaired not only through the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway but also via an MMR-independent pathway in human cells. However, how DNA loop repair is partitioned between these pathways and how the MMR-independent repair is processed are not clear. Using a novel construct that completely and specifically inhibits MMR in HeLa extracts, we demonstrate here that although MMR is capable of bi-directionally processing DNA loops of 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, or 12 nucleotides in length, the repair activity decreases with the increase of the loop size. Evidence is presented that the largest loop that the MMR system can process is 16 nucleotides. We also show that strand-specific MMR-independent loop repair occurs for all looped substrates tested and rigorously demonstrate that this repair is bi-directional. Analysis of repair intermediates generated by the MMR-independent pathway revealed that although the processing of looped substrates with a strand break 5′ to the heterology occurred similarly to MMR (i.e. excision is conducted by exonucleases from the pre-existing strand break to the heterology), the processing of the heterology in substrates with a 3′ strand break is consistent with the involvement of endonucleases.

Functional in vitro MMR assays have shown that the human MMR can repair DNA loops with at least 8 unpaired nucleotides (20Parsons R., Li, G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N.

However, the upper limits of loop size that can be processed by the human MMR system have not been adequately defined.

First, in vitro functional repair assays have been used to demonstrate that human cells have a pathway or pathways that can carry out strand-specific repair of looped heterologies using an MMR-independent mechanism. Umar et al. (21Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and Littman et al.(24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have identified a vigorous 5′-nick-directed loop repair activity of this type using MMR-deficient extracts and DNA substrates containing 5–16 (21Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or ≥27 (24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) nucleotides in the loop. Although the first study found that a 3′ nick could direct repair of 2–5-nucleotide loops via an MMR-independent mechanism (21Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the later study observed no significant repair of this type for 27- or 216-nucleotide loops (24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Functional assays have also identified a vigorous MMR-independent, 5′-nick-directed loop repair in yeast cells. This activity was identified using yeast lysates to affect repair on a 27-nucleotide looped substrate but, unlike what has been observed for human extracts, a very weak 3′-nick-directed activity (at least 2-fold less than the 5′-nick-directed repair) was also identified (25Corrette-Bennett S.E. Parker B.O. Mohlman N.L. Lahue R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17605-17611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Corrette-Bennett S.E. Mohlman N.L. Rosado Z. Miret J.J.

Thus, the limits and requirements of MMR-independent loop repair in eukaryotes still need to be clarified. To understand the nature of DNA loop repair in human cells, we constructed DNA loop heteroduplexes containing a strand break (either 3′ or 5′ to the heterology) and a loop of 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, or 12 unpaired nucleotides and characterized their repair in MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient cell extracts. We demonstrate here that all these substrates can be processed by both MMR-dependent and -independent pathways in a strand-specific manner regardless of the nick orientations and that the MMR-independent repair of the heterologies with a strand break 3′ to the loop appears to involve endonuclease(s). HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 4 mm glutamine. HCT15 and NALM6 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT116 and HEC-1A cells were grown in McCoy's 5A media with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures contained 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 6 liters of suspension cultures (HeLa, NALM6) or 25–30 roller bottles of monolayer cultures (HCT15, HCT116, HEC-1A) using a previously published procedure (27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The DNA used to create the 5-, 8-, and 12-nucleotide looped substrates is the same as described (22Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) although the derivative phage was separately constructed in our lab. The phages used to create the 10-nucleotide looped substrate were constructed using the oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTGCAGCCAGCTCGAGTGTGTCTGTGTGTGGC-3′ and 5′-CTAGGCCACACACAGACACACTCGAGCTGGCTGC-3′ as described (20Parsons R., Li, G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Heteroduplex DNA substrates were prepared using DNA derived from f1MR phage series as described (27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 28Su S.-S. Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates with a 5′ nick were created by digesting double-stranded phage DNA with Sau96I (see Fig. 1), whereas the 3′ nick was made by the gpII protein as described (29Fang W.-H., Li, G.-M. Longley M. Holmes J. Thilly W. Modrich P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fd:M13 hybrid and fd:fd homoduplex were constructed in the same manner as the looped heteroduplexes, as described previously (30Wu J., Gu, L. Wang H. Geacintov N.E. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8292-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Repair assays were performed as described previously (20Parsons R., Li, G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) in 15 μl-reactions containing 75 μg of nuclear extract and 100 ng of heteroduplex DNA substrate at 37 °C for 15 min. DNA samples were isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The amount of repair was quantified either by the restriction enzyme sensitivity assay (27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) or by Southern blot analysis (20Parsons R., Li, G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). For the first assay, the DNA samples were digested with two restriction enzymes: BspDI to linearize all DNA in the sample and either XhoI or XcmI to score the amount of repair. The 5, 8, 10 and 12-nucleotide looped sequences contain the XhoI recognition sequence, and the non-looped strand contains the XcmI sequence (see Fig. 1). If, for example, repair of the strand containing the loop occurs such that the loop sequence is retained in the product, then the product becomes sensitive to XhoI digestion, and the doubly digested repaired products can be separated from the singly digested unrepaired products on an agarose gel. Ethidium bromide stained-repair gels were quantitated using digital photography and Kodak's Image 2.0.2 image analysis software. Repair was defined as the percent conversion of the starting substrate from a single 6.4-kb species (cut only byBspDI) to the doublet of 3.1- and 3.3-kb species (cut byBspDI and either XhoI or XcmI). The Southern blot analysis used to score repair was similar to one described previously (20Parsons R., Li, G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Isolated DNA was digested with 2 units each of Sau96I and NheI (New England Biolabs), and the digestion products were separated through a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel (7 m urea, 19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide, 1× TBE) and then transferred to a nylon membrane. Southern blot analysis was performed essentially as described (31Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S.

Autoradiographs were scanned into Kodak Image 2.0.2 image analysis software for quantitation. Repair was defined as the percent conversion of a strand from the starting substrate length to the length of the opposite strand (i.e. long to short or short to long for loop removal or loop addition, respectively). MMR-inhibited loop repair assays were performed as described above using 250 ng of loop substrate and 75 ng of either fd:fd homoduplex (nonspecific inhibitor) or fd:M13 hybrid DNA (MMR-specific inhibitor). Repair to the nicked strand was monitored by restriction enzyme sensitivity using 2 units each of BseRI and the appropriate scoring enzyme as described (30Wu J., Gu, L. Wang H. Geacintov N.E. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8292-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Repair of 5′GT, 5′-2V, and 3′-4C was scored by restriction digestions as described (20Parsons R., Li, G.M.

Quantitation was performed as described for normal repair assays. Loop repair reactions were performed in the absence of exogenous dNTPs for intermediate analysis as described (31Fang W.H. Modrich P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All other reaction conditions were identical to those listed for regular DNA loop repair assays. DNA products were digested with either 2 units of SspI (Fig. 5) or 2 units of SspI and Sau96I (Fig. 6) and subjected to Southern blot analysis as described above using a 6% acrylamide gel. The probes used were V5216–5235 (5′-ATTGTTCTGGATATTACCAG-3′), C5259–5235 (5′-GAAGAACTCAAACTATCGGCCTTGC-3′), and C5746–5765 (see above).Figure 6Processing of 3′-nicked substrates does not occur by excision from the pre-existing nick. DNA resynthesis-inhibited loop repair reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Symbols in the schematic are defined as described in the legend for Fig. 5. DNA products were purified and digested with SspI andSau96I, separated through a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel, and then electrotransferred to nylon membranes. The probe used was C5746–5765, which binds in between the nick and loop site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the upper limits of loop size that MMR can process, MMR-proficient HeLa extracts were examined for repair of circular heteroduplexes with different loop sizes either in the complementary strand or in the viral strand. In addition to loops, these substrates also contain a strand break either 5′ (in the C strand) or 3′ (in the V strand) to the loop (Fig. 1). This set of substrates allowed us to test for bi-directional nick-directed repair of DNA loops. Repair of these substrates was scored either by the commonly used restriction enzyme assay (27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) or by Southern blot analysis (20Parsons R., Li, G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, HeLa nuclear extracts were capable of correcting all looped substrates in a strand-specific manner with repair being targeted in each case to the nicked strand regardless of whether the nick was 5′ or 3′ to the heterology. The levels of repair were fairly constant between substrates containing from 5 to 12 unpaired nucleotides (nt), although there were a few variations (Fig. 2). The repair exhibited a ∼30-fold bias toward the nicked strand, as judged by the fact that the repair rate to the nicked strand was around 15% but only 0.5% to the continuous strand. These results suggest that the repair of 5–12-nt loops has nick-directed, bi-directional processing characteristics similar to that seen for mammalian base-base MMR (31Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the loop heterologies were processed by the MMR system, an MMR-specific inhibitor (30Wu J., Gu, L. Wang H. Geacintov N.E. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8292-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was used in our loop repair assay to block all MMR activity in HeLa extracts. This inhibitor was derived from hybridization of bacteriophages fd and M13 DNA and contains ∼200 mismatches per molecule. We have previously shown that this hybrid can completely inhibit in vitro MMR (30Wu J., Gu, L. Wang H. Geacintov N.E. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8292-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). If the loop repair observed was indeed conducted by MMR, addition of the fd:M13 hybrid in the reaction would completely block HeLa extracts from repairing looped heteroduplexes. These experiments are summarized in Fig. 3 and Table I. As expected, repair of a G/T mismatch was completely blocked by addition of fd:M13 heteroduplex DNA. This inhibition was not due to the presence of extra DNA in the reaction since addition of the same amount of fd:fd homoduplex DNA did not alter the amount of repair (Fig. 3). However, the repair of loop substrates of 2–12 nucleotides, although reduced, was not completely abolished under the same conditions regardless of whether the substrates contained a 5′ or a 3′ strand break (Fig. 3; Table I). These results suggest that the repair of loops of 2–12 nucleotides in HeLa extracts contains both MMR-dependent and -independent components. Although the amount of MMR-independent repair remained fairly constant (at about 10%, Fig. 3 and Table I) for all 2–12-nt substrates tested, the amount of MMR-dependent repair was gradually reduced as the loop size increased (from ∼33% for 2 nt down to ∼3% for 12 nt, Table I).Table IRelative loop repair by MMR-dependent and -independent pathwaysSubstrateTotal repair +fd:fdMMR-independent repair +fd:M13MMR-dependent repairInhibition by fd:M13%%%%5′-G-T52.2052.21005′-2V41.28.233.0803′-4C40.29.131.1775′-5C20.310.210.1515′-8V17.410.27.2423′-8C21.012.88.2395′-12V14.511.33.2223′-12C10.17.42.727Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 3. MMR-dependent repair was obtained by subtracting the MMR-independent repair (in the presence of fd:M13) from the total repair (in the presence of fd:fd). Percent of repair inhibited by fd:M13 was calculated by dividing the MMR-dependent repair with the total repair (+ fd:fd). Open table in a new tab Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 3. MMR-dependent repair was obtained by subtracting the MMR-independent repair (in the presence of fd:M13) from the total repair (in the presence of fd:fd). Percent of repair inhibited by fd:M13 was calculated by dividing the MMR-dependent repair with the total repair (+ fd:fd). A previous study has shown that MMR-independent repair of a DNA loop that is 27 nucleotides in length or larger in human cells can be only directed by a 5′ nick (24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P.

Our results, however, suggest that both 5′ and 3′ nicks can direct loop repair using an MMR-independent mechanism. To confirm that MMR-independent loop repair of 2–12-nt heterologies is bi-directional, we performed loop repair in nuclear extracts derived from several well characterized MMR-defective cell lines; MLH1-deficient HCT116, PMS2/MSH6-deficient HEC-1A, andMSH6-deficient HCT15. The results (shown in Fig. 4) indicate that, as seen for HeLa extracts (Fig. 3 and Table I), all MMR-deficient extracts efficiently repaired all looped heterologies tested with no significant differences in the repair rate between the 5′ and the 3′ substrates. Repair in all cases was only detected in the nicked strand but not in the continuous strand (data not shown), indicating that the MMR-independent processing of the looped substrates is dependent on a nick and can occur in both 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′ orientations. A subset of these substrates were also tested for repair by extracts derived from anMSH2-deficient lymphoblastoid cell line, NALM-6 (33Gu L. Cline-Brown B. Zhang F. Qiu L. Li G.-M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5758-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Again, nick-directed and bi-directional loop repair was observed in thisMSH2 mutant cell line (data not shown). It is worth mentioning that the repair rate in these MMR-deficient cells is comparable with that observed in HeLa extracts supplemented with fd:M13 (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. 3). In sum, we demonstrate using either MMR-deficient or MMR-inhibited nuclear extracts that 5′ and 3′ nicks direct nearly equivalent amounts of repair for several of our loop substrates. These results strongly suggest that MMR-independent repair of 2–12-nt looped substrates occurs bi-directionally. To understand how DNA loops are removed by the MMR-independent pathway, loop repair was carried out using both MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient extracts under conditions of limited DNA synthesis, e.g. in the absence of dNTPs. By blocking repair DNA synthesis, repair events prior to DNA resynthesis are trapped, and the reaction intermediates can be visualized by Southern blot analysis (24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the repair intermediates of four looped substrates (5′-8C, 3′-8C, 5′-12V, 3′-12V) by HeLa or HCT116 nuclear extracts in the absence of dNTPs. For the 5′-nicked substrates, intermediates accumulated over a broad range (from the nick to loop to several points beyond the loop) in both MMR-proficient and -deficient extracts (Fig. 5 A), a phenomenon observed for MMR intermediates (31Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the removal of the heterology in 5′-looped substrates occurs through exonucleolytic excision starting from the pre-existing nick and proceeding toward the loop. However, for the 3′-nicked substrates, the patterns of repair intermediates in HeLa and HCT116 cells are significantly different. As shown in Fig. 5 B, repair intermediates in HCT116 cells were confined to an area immediately surrounding the loop site (lanes 6 and 8), and this occurs regardless of whether the loop is on the nicked (lane 8) or continuous (lane 6) strand. In comparison with the results shown in Fig. 5 A, it appears that the MMR-independent pathway uses different mechanisms to process 3′- and 5′-nicked substrates. Interestingly, the bands corresponding to repair intermediates that immediately flank the loop site were less intense from reactions that utilized HeLa extracts (lanes 5 and7) as compared with reactions that utilized MMR-deficient HCT116 extracts (lanes 6 and 8). In HeLa extracts, MMR-dependent repair likely dominates MMR-independent repair such that fewer MMR-independent repair intermediates appear in the reactions carried out in these extracts. In addition, some intermediates were recovered between the loop and the probe in the HeLa extracts, indicative of excision proceeding beyond the heterology, as seen previously for MMR-dependent repair (24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also apparent that the HeLa extracts produced bands that flank the loop for the substrate 3′-8C (Fig. 5 B, lane 5) that are less intense as compared with those made from the 3′-12V substrate (Fig. 5 B, lane 7). This observation supports our conclusion made from the functional repair assay that loop repair activity by the MMR pathway decreases as the loop size increases (Table I). Thus, reduced processing of the larger loop by the MMR pathway appears to lead to more repair of the substrate by the MMR-independent pathway. The pattern of repair intermediates produced by the MMR-deficient HCT116 extracts when processing 3′ substrates suggest that removal of 3′-looped heterology by the MMR-independent pathway is a short patch repair and may involve endonucleases. To further determine the nature of excision on the 3′-nicked substrates, repair intermediates generated under conditions of limited DNA resynthesis were double-digested with Sau96I and SspI and subjected to Southern hybridization using a 32P-labeled probe located between the nick and the loop site (Fig. 6). If excision occurs from the nick to the loop, the probe would lose its corresponding binding sequence, andSau96I will not be able to digest the repair intermediates since the region containing its recognition sequence (located between the nick and the loop) will be single-stranded. The results, shown in Fig. 6, indicate that this is not the case. Fragments with end points that flank the loop site are again evident in both the 3′-8C and 3′-12V substrates (Fig. 6), supporting the idea that incisions were made around the loop site. These fragments were only detected on the nicked strand, regardless of which strand the loop is on. It is worth noting that reactions utilizing HeLa extracts (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and3) again show reduced intensity of bands as compared with those utilizing HCT116 extracts (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and4). Clearly, the processing of these substrates by the MMR pathway (from the strand break to the heterology) in HeLa cells left less substrate available for repair via the MMR-independent pathway. In this study, we examined MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient cells for their ability to process heteroduplexes containing a loop of 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, or 12 nucleotides, which are believed to be substrates for both MMR-dependent and -independent pathways. We demonstrate that both pathways can repair these substrates in a strand-specific manner and rigorously show that DNA loop repair by MMR-independent pathway occurs bi-directionally. Mechanistic studies revealed that the MMR-independent pathway processes looped heteroduplexes with a 3′ strand break in a way distinct from that of MMR. Previous studies in human cells have suggested that both MMR-dependent and MMR-independent pathways are capable of repairing DNA loop structures with small insertion/deletion DNA loops being processed by MMR and large loops being processed by an MMR-independent system (20Parsons R., Li, G.M.

In E. coli, it has been documented that MMR can correct unpaired heteroduplexes containing no more than 7 nucleotides (8Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In yeast, the upper limit of the loop size increases to 13 nucleotides (18Sia E.A. Kokoska R.J. Dominska M. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Wierdl M. Dominska M. Petes T.D. Genetics. 1997; 146: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the overlapping activities of DNA loop repair in human cells, it is difficult to distinguish loop repair activity conducted by MMR from that conducted by an MMR-independent pathway. Using fd:M13 hybrid as an MMR inhibitor, we successfully separated DNA loop repair activities in human cells. Interestingly, when the loop size increases, the ability of MMR to process looped heteroduplexes decreases proportionally (TableI and Fig. 7). Our data show that the MMR pathway in human cells can process DNA loops containing at least 12 unpaired nucleotides. Although we did not test loop substrates containing more than 12 nucleotides in this study, the data in Table I suggest that the MMR system is capable of processing DNA loops more than 12 nucleotides long. When the percent of repair inhibited by fd:M13 (i.e. the percent of repair contributed by the MMR-dependent pathway, Table I) was plottedversus loop size, we can extrapolate that the loop repair activity by MMR will drop to zero when the loop size reaches 17 nucleotides (Fig. 7). Therefore, the largest loop size that MMR can process is likely to be 16 nucleotides with larger loops being processed by entirely MMR-independent pathways. Our data are consistent with a previous observation by Wilson et al. (17Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that although human MutSβ can recognize DNA loops up to 24 nt, only those with ≤16 nt can activate the ATPase activity of MutSβ. Another important finding in this study is the identification and characterization of 3′-nick-directed loop repair by an MMR-independent pathway. Previous studies have shown that MMR-independent loop repair in human cells can be certainly directed by a 5′ strand break (21Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar,24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but whether or not a 3′ nick can be used for loop repair was less clear. Whereas repair of heteroduplexes containing up to 5 unpaired nucleotides can be directed by a 3′ nick (21Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), large looped heteroduplexes with a strand break 3′ to the heterology are processed poorly with little strand bias (24Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we clearly show that both MMR-depleted HeLa extracts and MMR-deficient extracts can efficiently process looped heteroduplexes containing 5–12 unpaired nucleotides regardless of whether the strand break is 5′ or 3′ to the heterology (Figs. 3 and 4, Table I). It is clear that there are at least two types of MMR-independent loop repair pathways in human cells: one that is specific for large loops (possibly 17 nucleotides or more) and occurs only through a 5′ to 3′ orientation and the other that is responsible for repairing small loops (16 nucleotides or less) and can work bi-directionally. Our analysis of repair intermediates under the condition in which DNA synthesis is blocked revealed that the MMR-independent repair pathway processes 3′- and 5′-nicked substrates differently. In MMR, strand-specific excision of the mispaired base is oriented from the strand break toward the mismatch, regardless of whether the strand break is 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (31Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, intermediates recovered from DNA synthesis-blocked reactions span a broad range, normally from the strand break to a point ∼200 nucleotides beyond the heterology (31Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intermediates detected in 5′-looped substrates processed by either MMR or the MMR-independent pathway are similar to those observed in mismatched substrates (Fig. 5 A). However, in the case of 3′-nicked substrates, repair intermediates were recovered in an area immediately flanking either side of the loop (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the removal of the heterology in this type of substrate involves endonucleases. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that excision from the nick to the loop did not occur since the intermediates produced in DNA synthesis-inhibited reactions were sensitive to Sau96I (∼50 nucleotides 5′ to the nick site, Fig. 1) and since probe C5746–5765 (located between the nick and the loop) could hybridize to the nicked strand and detect repair intermediates (Fig. 6). These results imply that some portion of DNA loop repair may be conducted by nucleotide excision repair or a pathway similar to nucleotide excision repair in which damaged DNA is removed through double endonucleolytic cleavage (37Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 317-366Google Scholar). However, our preliminary experiments using nuclear extracts from cell lines mutated in XPA, XPB, or XPG ruled out the involvement of nucleotide excision repair in loop repair. 2S. D. McCulloch and G.-M. Li, unpublished results. Therefore, the repair of DNA loops with a 3′ nick is likely conducted by an activity independent of not only MMR, but also nucleotide excision repair. However, how the heterology in the 3′ substrate is removed remains to be elucidated.

These features include extensive heterogeneity of the ester and amide-linked fatty acids, particularly on the proximal 2-aminogluconate residue, the absence of ester-linked acyloxyacyl groups, and the presence of a single amide-linked acyloxyacyl residue, containing a unique long chain fatty acid (LCFA, e.g.27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid), carried as the secondary acyl group. These unique structures can be rationalized by considering their possible role in bacteroid survival and symbiotic infection. It has been proposed, for example, that replacement of phosphate with less acidic, negatively charged residues could help attenuate stimulation of the plant defense response to the invading rhizobia (27Que N.L.S.

The occurrence of the C28 LCFA is particularly interesting, because its presence (but not specific location) has been demonstrated in a variety of bacteria that survive within intracellular host membrane-derived compartments, including all of the Rhizobiaceae studied to date, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium, and the phylogenetically related intracellular animal pathogen Brucella (29Bhat U.R.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C28 LCFA is long enough to span the entire lipid bilayer and has been suggested to promote membrane stability during the critical stages of symbiotic infection, when the bacterial and plant membranes appear to be in close proximity (i.e. during endocytosis-symbiosome formation and during the synchronized cell division of the bacterium-symbiosome (31Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)). In contrast to R. etli-R. leguminosarum, there is no detailed information on the structures of any of theSinorhizobium LPS. Compositional studies have indicated that sinorhizobial LPS core regions are substantially different from those of R. etli (8Reuhs B.L. Geller D.P. Kim J.S. Fox J.E. Kolli V.S.K. Pueppke S.G. Appl.

Plant-Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), at least on vegetative cells. A single study on the lipid A moiety from the Sinorhizobium meliloti mutant 10406 indicated the presence of a bisphosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide backbone; however, detailed structures, component heterogeneity, and the locations of some fatty acids, including the LCFA, were not characterized (34Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Seydel U. Greck M. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 527-532Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, acyloxyacyl residues were not detected in the S. meliloti mutant lipid A, possibly because effective solvents for NMR analysis of underivatized lipids A were unavailable at the time. In this report we describe structural analysis of the lipid A moiety from the LPS produced by Sinorhizobium sp. NGR234 grown in vegetative culture. Our results demonstrate several structural features that are shared with Rhizobium etli-Rhizobium leguminosarum lipid A, which may be important in establishing or maintaining symbiosis. These features include a remarkable similarity in the type and location of acyloxyacyl residues containing the LCFA, when compared with R. etli- R. leguminosarum (24Que N.L.S. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28017-28027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to R. etli lipid A, the NGR234 lipid A also shares certain features with the enterobacterial lipids A, constituting a “hybrid” structure that may prove useful in endotoxin-elicitor studies. Structural information on the NGR234 lipid A will provide additional insight on the biosynthesis of rhizobial and sinorhizobial lipids A and facilitate comparisons with bacteroid-derived and other structurally altered lipids A. Agar slants of Sinorhizobiumsp. strain NGR234 were provided by Dr. Peter van Berkum at the National Rhizobium Germplasm Collection Center in Beltsville, MD. The bacteria were transferred to liquid media (tryptone/yeast extract supplemented with Ca2+) and grown in fermentor culture at 28 °C as described previously for related species (8Reuhs B.L.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3570-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at late log phase (A 600 = 2.70) yielding 500 g (wet weight) of cells/100 liters of culture. LPSs were extracted by the hot phenol/water procedure (5Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) and analyzed by deoxycholate-PAGE (37Krauss J.H. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1988; 38: 157-163Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Tsai C.

Water layer extracts containing LPS were dialyzed and treated sequentially with ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, and proteinase K (5Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and then redialyzed and subjected to size exclusion chromatography under dissociative conditions (0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 m NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.2) on a column of Sephadex G-150 (2.2 × 100 cm). This procedure separates the R-LPS from the S-LPS. 60 mg of water layer extract yielded ∼23 mg of R-LPS and 1 mg of S-LPS per run. Portions (2–3 mg) of the G-150 purified R-LPS were subjected to further purification on Superose-12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) under associative conditions (50 mm ammonium formate) at 0.3 ml/min. The R-LPS was hydrolyzed in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 1% SDS, following a published procedure (40Caroff M. Tacken A. Szabó L. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 175: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), to yield the free lipid A (R-lipid ASDS). For comparison, lipid A was also isolated by hydrolyzing R-LPS in 1.0% acetic acid (pH 2.8, 105 °C, 2½ h), and the precipitated lipid A (R-lipid AHOAc) was recovered by ultracentrifugation at 160,000 × g for 1 h (16Forsberg L.S. Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18851-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The resulting lipids A were analyzed by TLC, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and GC-MS analysis of derivatives as described below. Selected lipid A species were isolated by preparative TLC (described below) and analyzed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF-MS, and GC-MS of derivatives. Glycosyl compositions of LPS and the intact and de-O-acylated lipid A samples were determined by GC-MS analysis (electron impact) of the TMS methyl glycosides (41York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) using a 30-m DB-5 fused silica capillary column (J & W Scientific). Neutral and amino sugars were also determined by GC-MS analysis of the alditol acetates using a 30-m SP2330 capillary column (Supelco) (42Stevenson T.T. Furneaux R.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 210: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Total fatty acids were released by hydrolysis of lipid A in 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 4 h (43Wollenweber H.-W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The liberated fatty acids were converted to methyl esters using methanolic 1 m HCl at 80 °C for 2 h, followed by trimethylsilylation and analysis by GC-MS using the DB-5 column. Ester-linked fatty acids were selectively released by de-O-acylation of intact lipid A with sodium methoxide (0.5m) at 35 °C for 16 h (26Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); liberated fatty acids were then methyl-esterified, trimethylsilylated, and analyzed by GC-MS. Amide-linked fatty acids were analyzed by hydrolyzing the de-O-acylated lipid A in 4 m HCl; the liberated fatty acids were then analyzed as the TMS methyl esters by GC-MS. Amide-linked fatty acids were also determined by mild methanolysis of the intact lipid A, followed by preparation and GC-MS analysis of theN-acylglucosamine TMS methylglycoside derivatives (44Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Chemical analysis of amide-linked acyloxyacyl groups was performed on lipid ASDS by methylation with silver oxide/methyl iodide (Kraska methylation), following the procedures of Wollenweber and Rietschel (43Wollenweber H.-W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). TLC of lipid A was performed on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) using two solvent systems as follows: A, chloroform/methanol/water/triethylamine (30:12:2:0.1, v/v) (45Fukuoka S. Kamishima H. Nagawa Y. Nakanishi H. Ishikawa K. Niwa Y. Tamiya E. Karube I. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 311-318Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar); and B, chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, methanol, water (60:35:10:5:2, v/v) (27Que N.L.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Lipids A were visualized by spraying with 15% ethanolic sulfuric acid and charring, and by a molybdenum blue spray reagent (Sigma). Preparative TLC was performed in the same manner except bands were localized by misting the plate lightly with water and holding the plate under UV light, under which conditions the hydrophobic lipid A bands were readily visible. Individual bands containing lipid A were removed by scraping, and the lipid A was solubilized in chloroform/isopropyl alcohol/water (5:3:0.25 v/v). Silica gel and particulates were removed by passage through a small column (5 × 8 mm) of Sephadex LH-20 equilibrated in the same solvent. 1H spectra and all two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear spectra of the intact lipid ASDS were recorded at 30 °C on a Varian Inova 500 NMR spectrometer using standard Varian software. The lipid ASDS was dissolved and analyzed in the ternary solvent CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O (2:3:1 v/v) (24Que N.L.S. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

COSY data were recorded in the absolute value mode with a 5.0-kHz spectral width, collecting 512 increments at 16 scans per increment. 1H-1H TOCSY was recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms and 2 sets of 512 time increments at 24 scans per increment. Phase-sensitive NOESY was recorded with a 500-ms mixing time using 2 arrays of 256 increments at 80 scans per increment. 1H-13C HSQC was performed with an acquisition time of 0.199 s by collecting 2 arrays of 200 increments at 80 scans per increment.1H-31P HMBC correlation spectra were recorded without 31P decoupling on the R-lipid ASDS in the ternary solvent system. Direct observed 1H-decoupled31P spectra of intact lipid ASDS and lipid AHOAc were obtained by dissolving the lipid A in D2O containing 2% sodium deoxycholate and 5 mmEDTA; pH adjustments were made with triethylamine. Spectra were recorded on a Varian 300 instrument at 121.51 MHz, and 31P chemical shifts were recorded relative to an external standard of 85% phosphoric acid at 0.00 ppm. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Kratos Analytical Kompact SEQ instrument using delayed extraction, in both positive and negative ion modes. Samples were desorbed with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) and extraction voltage of 20 kV. Lipid A samples were dissolved in CHCl3/isopropyl alcohol/water (5:3:0.25 v/v) and desodiated by treating with OnGuard-H cation exchange resin (H+) (Dionex) for 20 min with shaking. The resin was removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g), and the supernatant containing lipid A was dried, adjusted to a concentration of 2 μg/μl in fresh solvent, and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with matrix solution (2,4,6-trihydroxyaceto-phenone, 0.5m in methanol). 1 μl was applied to the MALDI stage. Mass calibration was performed with malto-oligosaccharides (positive ion mode) and with R. etli CE3 lipid A (negative ion mode). The predicted molecular weights of the various lipid A species were calculated from the average incremental masses of subunits, based on the atomic weights of the elements: 2-amino-2-deoxyhexose, 161.1577; phosphate, 79.9799; β-hydroxybutyrate, 86.0904; 3-OH-14:0, 226.3592; 3-OH-16:0, 254.4130; 3-OH-17:0, 268.4399; 3-OH-18:0, 282.4667; 3-OH-18:1, 280.4509; 3-OH-18:2, 278.4351; 3-OH-19:0, 296.4935; 3-OH-19:1, 294.4777; 27-OH-28:0, 422.7355; 29-OH-30:0, 450.7891; and free reducing end, 18.0153. Total phosphorus was determined by a colorimetric procedure (47Lowry O.H. Roberts N.R. Leiner K.Y., Wu, M.L. Farr A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 207: 1-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Column eluants were monitored by colorimetric assays for neutral carbohydrate (41York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P.

NGR234 is a rough LPS (R-LPS), which lacks the polysaccharide O-chain (8Reuhs B.L. Geller D.P. Kim J.S. Fox J.E. Kolli V.S.K. Pueppke S.G. Appl. Environ.

In the case of strain NGR234, the majority of the total LPS (consisting of the major R-LPS and a minor S-LPS) was recovered in the water layer during hot phenol/water extraction. In Fig. 1, fractionation of the water layer by size exclusion chromatography under dissociative conditions afforded separation of the R-LPS and S-LPS, as well as other cell surface components, the capsular polysaccharides (K-antigens), extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), cyclic glucans, and derived fragments. The recovery of total LPS (R-LPS + S-LPS) was 340 mg per 40 g of dry cell weight (compare R. etli strain CE3, which yields ∼600 mg of LPS from the same amount of cells (25Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). Of the total LPS, over 96% consisted of R-LPS. Final purification of R-LPS was achieved by size exclusion chromatography under associative conditions on Superose-12 (Fig. 1). This step removed a low molecular weight population of K-antigen/EPS fragments which co-migrated with the R-LPS during dissociative chromatography. In previous studies on the lipid A from R. etli and the closely related R. leguminosarum, mild hydrolysis in 1% acetic acid was routinely used to cleave the core-lipid A ketosidic linkage, and the free lipid A was isolated without extensive degradation (26Bhat U.R.

Here, we have biochemically determined the length of the TMD of C99 in microsomal membranes. Using a single cysteine mutagenesis scan of C99 combined with cysteine modification with a membrane-impermeable labeling reagent, we identified which residues are accessible to modification and thus located outside of the membrane. We find that in endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes the TMD of C99 consists of 12 residues that span from residues 37 to 48, which is N- and C-terminally shorter than predicted. Thus, the γ-cleavage sites are positioned around the middle of the lipid bilayer and are unlikely to be accessible to cytosolic proteases. Moreover, the center of the TMD is positioned at the γ-cleavage site at residue 42.

The 4-kDa peptide Aβ is a product of the complex proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (for a review, see Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Some features of the APP processing are shared with the processing of the cell surface receptor Notch (for a review, see Ref. 2Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Both are type I membrane proteins that undergo a first proteolytic cleavage within their ectodomain, leaving a C-terminal fragment within the membrane. These C-terminal fragments may then undergo proteolytic cleavage within their transmembrane domains (TMD), a process termed intramembrane proteolysis (for a review, see Ref. 3Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Upon intramembrane proteolysis, the cytosolic portions of these proteins may move to the nucleus and stimulate the transcription of target genes (4Cao X. Sudhof T.C.

In the proteolytic pathway that leads to the generation of Aβ, APP is first cleaved within its lumenal domain by the recently identified aspartyl protease, β-amyloid-converting enzyme (for a review, see Refs. 10De Strooper B.

The resulting 99-residue-long C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) can then be cleaved intramembranously by a protease activity called γ-secretase, which leads to the release and secretion of the Aβ peptide (for a review, see Ref. 1Selkoe D.J.

Despite its importance for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, γ-secretase has not yet been unequivocally identified. However, the γ-cleavage of C99 depends on the presence of the membrane protein presenilin 1, which itself could be γ-secretase or part of a larger γ-secretase complex (for reviews, see Refs. 2Wolfe M.S.

Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). γ-Cleavage occurs predominantly after residue 40 of C99 and to a minor extent after residue 42, thus generating the 40- and 42-residues-long peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42(13Haass C.

Little is known about the mechanism of γ-cleavage and the factors that determine whether the cleavage takes place after residue 40 or 42 of C99. Intensive mutagenesis of amino acid residues within the TMD of C99 has shown that the generation of Aβ is not sequence-specific (17Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

In contrast, the specific position where γ-cleavage takes place (i.e. cleavage after residue 40 or residue 42) strongly depends on the length of the TMD of C99 (18Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B.

In addition to its broad substrate specificity, γ-cleavage is remarkable because it occurs within the predicted TMD of C99. Recently, an increasing number of proteins have been reported to be cleaved intramembranously, but so far no protease has been proven to cleave within the membrane. Nevertheless, the metallo-protease S2P, the putative serine protease rhomboid, and presenilin 1 have their active site residues within their predicted TMDs (24Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D.

Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of direct experimental proof for the γ-cleavage taking place within the lipid bilayer, alternative structures and membrane boundaries for the TMD of C99 have been proposed. These models suggest that the C-terminal half of the putative TMD and the γ-cleavage site are not buried within the membrane but instead are exposed to the cytosol and accessible for a soluble or membrane-associated protease (18Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19.Tischer, E., and Cordell, B. J.

However, the true mechanism remains elusive because a thorough characterization of the length of the TMD of C99 in biological membranes is still lacking. To resolve these controversies and to better understand the mechanism of γ-cleavage, we biochemically determined the length and the position of the TMD of C99. In a cysteine mutagenesis scan, we created several single cysteine mutants of C99 with a cysteine placed within or adjacent to its predicted TMD. In vitro, the single cysteine mutants of C99 were translated directly into microsomal membranes, which derive from the endoplasmic reticulum. The C99-containing microsomes were incubated with IASD (4-acetamido-4′-((iodoacetyl) amino) stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate), which specifically labels cysteine residues. Because IASD is membrane-impermeable (29Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), only those cysteine residues are labeled that are located outside the membrane. Our results show that the apparent TMD of C99 inserted into ER-derived membranes is significantly shorter than previously assumed and comprises only 12 amino acids instead of the 24 residues that are predicted by computer algorithms. Importantly, we found that the γ-secretase cleavage site after residue 42 is positioned exactly at the center of the newly defined TMD. These data indicate that the exact positioning of the APP TMD with respect to the membrane may determine the cleavage site and, thus, that the cleavage may occur at the exact center of the lipid bilayer. The single cysteine mutants of C99 were generated by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam), suitable oligonucleotides, and the plasmid pBS/SPC99 as template (17Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The experiments described were performed with C99 mutants expressed from the SP-C99 encoding plasmids by in vitro transcription and translation using the RiboMAX large scale RNA production system (Promega) for transcription and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) for translation. Alternatively, coupled transcription and translation reactions were performed with the TnT T7 master mix system (Promega). Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C with [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of canine microsomal membranes (Promega). 5 μl of the in vitrotranslation reaction before or after labeling with IASD were diluted in 500 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 2 h with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (100 mg/ml, AmershamBiosciences) and 5 μl of the polyclonal antibody 22/13, which was raised against the C-terminal 13 residues of C99. For the analysis on isoelectric focusing (IEF) gels, 40 μl of the in vitrotranslation reaction were used and immunoprecipitated as described above but in a volume of 1 ml. Protein was recovered in 40 μl of sample buffer for PAGE or in 30 μl of denaturing buffer for IEF gel analysis (according to the IPGphor system instructions; AmershamBiosciences). For the IASD labeling of the C99 mutants with a cysteine placed at the N-terminal lumenal side of the membrane, the microsomal vesicles were converted into membrane sheets prior to IASD reaction (30Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). 30–50 μl of the in vitro translation reaction were mixed with 750 μl of 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and incubated at 0 °C for 30 min. Membranes were recovered by ultracentrifugation in the Beckman 45 TLi rotor at 50,000 rpm and 4 °C for 45 min. For the subsequent IASD labeling reaction, the membrane pellets were rinsed once with ice-cold distilled water and then dissolved in 5–10 μl of 0.5 m sodium phosphate. Each radiolabeled single cysteine mutant of C99 (6 μl of the in vitro translation reaction) was incubated in 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (6 μl) for 5 min at room temperature. Then 100 mm IASD (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm IASD and 4 mm dithiothreitol (31Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the remaining IASD was inactivated with 40 mm dithiothreitol. For each labeling experiment a negative control, in which water was used instead of IASD, was run in parallel. C99 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed on expanded Tris/Tricine gels or on isoelectric focusing gels with an immobile pH gradient (pH 3–10, 13 cm, IPGphor isoelectric focusing system; Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled proteins separated by electrophoresis were visualized using phosphorimaging (BAS 1000), whereas those separated by isoelectric focusing were subjected to autoradiography with the help of the Kodak intensifying screen (BioMax TranScreen LE). For IASD labeling after membrane disruption, the in vitrotranscription/translation reactions were incubated in an equal volume of 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 2% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at room temperature. To biochemically determine the TMD length of C99, we performed a single cysteine mutagenesis scan of C99. Because C99 does not contain any cysteine residue, we replaced individual residues within and just outside of the TMD of C99 by a cysteine, such that each of the 23 C99 mutants contained one cysteine (Fig. 1). In a coupled in vitro transcription/translation experiment, these mutants were inserted into canine microsomes that derive from the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The C99-containing microsomes were then incubated with the membrane-impermeable cysteine-labeling reagent IASD. Because of its hydrophilic character, IASD cannot diffuse into the lipid bilayer and therefore only labels cysteine residues that are located outside the membrane (29Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). IASD labeling was subsequently analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. To ensure the correct insertion of C99 into the microsomal membranes, an N-terminal signal peptide (SP) was fused to the C99 constructs (SP-C99, Fig. 1). The signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase upon membrane integration, thus converting SP-C99 into C99 (32Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Salbaum J.M. Lemaire H.G. Kang J. Muller-Hill B. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 33Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Lichtenthaler S.F. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The C99 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the solubilized membranes with antibody 22/13 that binds to the C terminus of C99 and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A single band with the expected apparent molecular mass of 12 kDa was detected (Fig. 2). In a control experiment without membranes, the signal peptide of SP-C99 was not cleaved and the immunoprecipitated SP-C99 had an apparent molecular mass of 11.5 kDa (Fig. 2). Furthermore, SP-C99 showed extensive aggregation, as seen by the numerous high molecular mass bands (Fig.2). Because of the presence of the signal peptide, SP-C99 contains 17 more amino acids than C99. Nevertheless SP-C99 showed a lower apparent molecular mass than C99, which might be because of a more compact secondary structure of SP-C99 induced by the presence of the hydrophobic signal peptide. This observation is in agreement with previous studies (32Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Salbaum J.M. Lemaire H.G. Kang J. Muller-Hill B. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 35Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). The difference in molecular mass between SP-C99 and C99 was observed for C99 wt and all cysteine mutants (shown in Fig. 2 for representative mutants). This verifies that all C99 proteins were completely inserted into the microsomal membranes and that the signal peptide was cleaved. In addition to the 12-kDa band of C99, a 6.5-kDa protein could be detected (Fig. 2) that is likely to be the result of an internal transcription starting point at methionine 35. As a further control for the correct membrane integration of the mutants, we verified that the C99 proteins translated in the presence of microsomal membranes could be recovered by sodium carbonate treatment and subsequent membrane sedimentation of the microsomes. This method allows the recovery of integral membrane proteins, whereas soluble proteins and peripheral membrane proteins do not sediment together with the microsomes (30Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). C99 wt and the C99 mutants were mainly detected in the integral membrane protein fraction (data not shown), demonstrating efficient membrane integration of the C99 mutants. To determine whether the individual cysteine residues of the C99 mutants are located within or outside of the microsomal membrane, we used IASD, a reagent that specifically reacts with free sulfhydryl groups, i.e.the single cysteine residues in the C99 mutants. IASD contains two sulfonate groups (pKa ∼-6.5), which are fully ionized under our reaction conditions (pH 7.5), preventing diffusion into the membrane (29Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, cysteine residues of C99 that are buried within the lipid bilayer are not labeled. Because the N terminus of C99 is located in the lumen of the microsomal vesicles, those residues located on the N-terminal (lumenal) side of the TMD are not directly accessible to the membrane-impermeable IASD. Therefore, when analyzing the mutants C99/24C–40C the membrane vesicles were converted to membrane sheets by sodium carbonate treatment prior to IASD treatment. To verify that this method did not change the positioning of C99 within the membrane, we controlled that the sodium carbonate treatment did not interfere with the C-terminal (cytosolic) borderline of the IASD-inaccessible domain (data not shown) as we have identified it in this study. IASD modification adds a mass of 450 Da to C99, which may change the electrophoretic mobility of C99, as has been reported previously for other proteins (29Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After incubation with and without IASD, the different C99 mutants were immunoprecipitated and the electrophoretic mobility was compared. Under these conditions only a minor, not significant, fraction of the negative control (C99 wt) showed unspecific labeling (Fig. 3). IASD treatment of the C99 mutants with a cysteine positioned N-terminal of residue 33 and C-terminal of residue 49 led to a clear shift to a higher apparent molecular mass (Fig. 3 and TableI). This demonstrates that the individual cysteine residue in these mutants (at positions 24–32 and 50–57) had been labeled by IASD and thus was located outside the microsomal membrane. In contrast, for cysteines at positions 33–49 and C99 wt no gel shift was observed (Fig. 3 and data not shown). For the mutants with a cysteine between residue 33 and 40, an IASD-induced shift could not even be detected in a control experiment in which the mutants were IASD-treated in a non-membrane-embedded state (data not shown but summarized in Table I). Therefore, we considered the possibility that IASD modification at these residues may have occurred without an alteration in the apparent electrophoretic mobility.Table IResults of the IASD labeling analysis of all C99 single cysteine mutants and C99 wt with (middle column) and without membrane insertion (left and right column) by molecular mass (MW) and by isoelectric point (IEP) Open table in a new tab To answer this question we used IEF. The two negative charges added to C99 upon IASD modification lower its isoelectric point (IEP) from an IEP of 6.09 to 5.52 (as calculated by the computer program DNAStar), which should be detectable as a shift on isoelectric focusing gels with an immobilized, linear pH gradient. To validate IEF as a method for determining the IASD modification of C99, we first analyzed as positive controls C99 mutants that had shown a shift in molecular mass (C99-V24C, V50C, and M51C, Fig. 3) and as negative control C99 wt. C99 wt with or without IASD treatment showed a single band at the expected calculated IEP of pH 6 (Fig. 4) and thus was not modified by IASD. In contrast, IASD treatment of C99/V24C, -V50C, and -M51C led to a clear shift from an IEP of 6 to 5.5, as expected (Fig. 4). This shows that IASD labeling can be detected well on IEF gels. In some experiments an additional band with an IEP of 5.8 was observed for unknown reasons. However, a protein with an IEP of 5.8 carries only one additional negative charge compared with C99, which therefore cannot be because of IASD labeling. This is further confirmed by the fact that this protein band with an IEP of 5.8 did not occur consistently in identically performed experiments and even in the absence of IASD (see Fig. 4, C99/L34C as an example). This verifies that this IEP isomer of C99 is irrelevant for our analysis because it does not interfere with the analysis of IASD modification. The identity of the protein bands for C99 was confirmed by two-dimensional gels on which the proteins showed the expected molecular mass of 12 kDa (without IASD modification) and 12.5 kDa (after IASD modification; data not shown, but compare Fig. 2). The clear shift seen on IEF gels after IASD treatment of C99 mutants validates IEF as a method for determining whether IASD modification of C99 has occurred. We next analyzed whether those C99 mutants that did not show a gel shift in their molecular mass upon IASD treatment showed a shift in their IEP. IASD incubation of the C99 mutants L34C, M35C, V36C, and L49C (Fig. 4) resulted in a clear shift in the IEP from 6 to 5.5, indicating that IASD modification had occurred and that this modification can be detected on IEF gels. These data suggest that the corresponding cysteine residues at positions 34, 35, 36, and 49 were located outside the microsomal membrane. In contrast, C99 mutants with cysteines at positions 37, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 47, and 48 did not show a shift in IEP on IEF gels (Fig. 4), suggesting that they are buried within the membrane bilayer. Moreover, when the microsomal membranes were disrupted by the addition of a detergent (1% Nonidet P-40, for 10 min), the mutants showed the expected shift upon IASD labeling, revealing that they can be labeled with IASD when no longer shielded by the membrane. This finding confirms that IASD does not label membrane-inserted protein portions, which is in good agreement with previous work of Krishnasastry et al. (29Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that showed that a cysteine mutant of α-hemolysin could not be labeled with IASD when embedded into membranes, although it was rapidly labeled in the absence of membranes. Therefore, the absence of a shift in the IEP for a membrane-inserted single cysteine mutant indicates that this cysteine is located within the microsomal membrane. This experiment further shows that IEF provides a method to overcome problems in the detection of IASD labeling that sometimes occur with analysis on conventional PAGE and that IEF can be used to analyze IASD labeling of all our C99 single cysteine mutants. In summary, the IASD labeling analysis of all membrane-inserted C99 mutants shows that only 12 of the 24 residues of the putative TMD of C99 (residues at position 37 to 48) are not accessible to IASD modification and thus constitute that part of C99 that is buried in microsomal membranes and constitute the TMD of C99 in ER-derived membranes (schematically shown in Fig.5). The γ-secretase cleavage of the C-terminal APP fragments is a remarkable proteolytic mechanism as it occurs around the center of the putative TMD of APP (for a review, see Ref. 2Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because direct evidence is lacking that the γ-cleavage takes place within the lipid bilayer, alternative boundaries for the TMD of C99 have been proposed such that a cytosolic or membrane-associated protease could cleave C99 (18Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19.Tischer, E., and Cordell, B. J. Biol. Chem., 271,21914–21919.Google Scholar,28Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, these studies only analyzed one half but not the total length of the TMD. Thus it remained unclear whether the γ-cleavage occurs within the membrane. To analyze whether the γ-cleavage sites of APP are indeed located within the membrane or are exposed to cytosolic cleavage, we biochemically determined the whole length of the TMD of C99 in microsomal membranes. For this analysis, we carried out a cysteine mutagenesis scan of C99, which is a widely employed technique for topology studies of membrane proteins (for a review, see Ref. 36van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cysteine mutants of C99 were inserted into membranes and labeled with the membrane-impermeable, cysteine-specific reagent IASD. In our analysis we found that IASD modification occurred for all cysteine residues of C99 located N-terminal of residue 37 and C-terminal of residue 48, but cysteine residues at positions 37–40, 44, 45, 47, and 48 were not modified with IASD. We conclude from this that the 12 residues, 37 to 48, of C99 are shielded from IASD modification by the microsomal membrane and thus represent the actual domain of C99 or APP, respectively, that is embedded within the ER-derived membrane. This domain is significantly shorter on both sides than the 24 hydrophobic residues that are predicted by computer algorithms (37Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Mueller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). IASD is highly charged and therefore cannot diffuse into or through the lipid bilayer, but it might enter the region of the polar head groups of the lipids on the surface of the membrane. Furthermore, the thiol-reactive iodoacetyl group of IASD is a few Å apart from the charged sulfonate groups. Although the sulfonate groups are supposed to stay outside the membrane and confer membrane-impermeability to IASD, the hydrophobic thiol-reactive group may slightly dip into the membrane and react with a cysteine positioned just below the membrane boundary. This suggests that the exact border of the membrane-embedded protein portion may slightly differ, depending on the hydrophilicity, charge, and structure of the molecule interacting with the protein. The 12 amino acids that are IASD-inaccessible are flanked on both sides by hydrophobic residues and may permit a perpendicular movement of the TMD with respect to the membrane, such that over a given time more than the 12 residues are in contact with the membrane. In such a scenario it would be expected that a partial IASD labeling of the neighboring residues occur. Because labeling with IASD is supposed to be a very fast reaction, this effect may be visible only under less severe labeling conditions. However, we never detected such partial labeling, not even with reduced IASD concentrations and very short incubation times (data not shown). Accordingly, our study clearly shows that C99 inserted into an ER-derived membrane has a domain of 12 residues (37 to 48) that is never accessible to IASD-modification and therefore represents the effective TMD of C99, which is expected to be inaccessible to cytosolic proteases. This result is in good agreement with theoretical considerations of the expected number of residues needed to span the ER membrane as well as with previous experiments analyzing the membrane integration of APP. The thickness of cellular membranes, and thus the number of residues needed to span the membrane, increases along the secretory pathway from the ER toward the plasma membrane because of increasing cholesterol and sphingolipids in the corresponding membranes (38Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A comparison of proteins typically localized at the Golgi or plasma membrane shows that the minimum number of hydrophobic residues in plasma membrane TMDs is 20 residues whereas that in Golgi TMDs is 15 (39). Because the ER membrane is thought to be even thinner than the Golgi membrane (38Munro S.

Because the bilayer thickness increases along the secretory pathway, presumably all 24 hydrophobic residues of the predicted TMD of C99 are used to span the plasma membrane (39Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 40Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C215-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are also in agreement with previous mutagenesis studies that suggested that the TMD of APP might be shorter than predicted on its C-terminal side (18Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B.

One of these studies showed that the introduction of negatively charged aspartyl residues into the putative TMD of APP interfered with membrane integration and γ-secretase processing, whereas aspartyl residues introduced into the C-terminal half of the putative TMD did not (19.Tischer, E., and Cordell, B. J. Biol. Chem., 271,21914–21919.Google Scholar). The authors concluded that the C-terminal membrane boundary is placed around residues 46 or 47. Given that the introduction of a negatively charged residue near the membrane may easily shift the position of C99 with respect to the membrane, their finding is nearly identical to our biochemical analysis, which identifies the TMD boundary to be after residue 48. We demonstrate in this study that in the relatively thin membrane of the ER residues 37 to 48 of C99 are shielded by the membrane. This has important implications for the mechanism of γ-cleavage. Because the major γ-cleavage sites after residues 40 and 42 of C99 are positioned around the middle of the IASD-inaccessible domain, they are also expected to be inaccessible to cytosolic or membrane-associated proteases, which had been considered a possibility in previous studies (18Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19.Tischer, E., and Cordell, B. J.

This suggests that C99 undergoes intramembrane cleavage by a membrane protein having its active site residues within its TMD. A candidate for such a protease is the polytopic membrane protein, presenilin 1, which is required for γ-cleavage (for review, see Refs.2Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 12Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this context it would be interesting to know whether the aspartate residues in the putative active site of presenilin 1 are indeed located in an appropriate position. Alternatively, presenilin 1 may be an essential cofactor for γ-secretase activity,e.g. by activating γ-secretase or providing a channel for the addition of water during proteolysis. Moreover, this effective TMD of 12 IASD-inaccessible residues is not located directly in the middle of the stretch of 24 hydrophobic residues that were predicted as TMD of APP by hydropathy plot (37Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Mueller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Instead, on the N-terminal side the TMD is 8 residues shorter, whereas on the C-terminal side it is only 4 residues shorter than previously predicted. This implies that the center of the newly determined TMD is exactly between residues 42 and 43. In contrast, in the predicted 24-residue-long TMD of C99, which may represent the TMD of C99 at the plasma membrane, the center is located between residues 40 and 41. This observation is striking because the center of these TMDs coincides with the C terminus of the major Aβ species found in the corresponding compartments: at the plasma membrane (and the trans Golgi network) mostly Aβ40 is found, whereas in the ER Aβ42 is observed almost exclusively (41Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with a model in which γ-cleavage always takes place at the center of the actual transmembraneous part of C99. In agreement with this model, we and others have recently shown that in C99 mutants with an altered length of the TMD the preferred γ-cleavage site is determined by the location of the γ-cleavage site with respect to the hydrophobic domain (18Murphy M.P.

Recently, it has been found that presenilin 1 is required not only for γ-cleavage but also for an additional cleavage of C99 between residues 49 and 50 close to the C terminus of the predicted TMD (ε-cleavage), leading to the release of the APP intracellular domain (42Sastre M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This C-terminal ε-cleavage site is at a similar position within the TMD to the so-called S3 cleavage site of the cell surface receptor Notch, which also is presenilin 1-dependent (46Ray W.J. Yao M. Mumm J. Schroeter E.H. Saftig P. Wolfe M. Selkoe D.J. Kopan R. Goate A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36801-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The position of the ε-cleavage site of C99 is located just outside the IASD-inaccessible, membrane-embedded TMD in microsomal membranes. Thus, it is topologically different from the γ-cleavage site in the middle of the TMD and could be envisaged to be accessible to cytosolic or membrane-associated proteases. However, as the membrane thickness increases along the secretory pathway, the ε- and S3 cleavage sites of C99 and Notch could be shielded by a thicker membrane typical for later compartments of the secretory pathway and thus become inaccessible to cytosolic cleavage. Nevertheless, a comparison of the newly defined TMD of APP with the TMD predicted for Notch shows that the APP intracellular domain and S3 cleavage sites are topologically more related to each other than to the γ-cleavage site in the middle of the TMD (8Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). This would account for different or modified cleavage mechanisms of γ-cleavage, on the one hand, and APP intracellular domain and S3 cleavage on the other. In summary, our study strongly supports the existence of a real intramembrane cleavage for APP. Furthermore, it suggests a model of the mechanism of γ-secretase that uses membrane thickness and thereby lipid composition to explain the mechanism of γ-cleavage site selection.

Extracellular amyloid deposits in brain, a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease, is a result of proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound amyloid precursor protein by two enzymes, β-secretase and γ-secretase.

Although aspartyl proteases have been studied for more than 4 decades, new aspects of catalysis and inhibition continue to emerge. A substantial number of these enzymes have been identified as useful targets for chemotherapeutic intervention in human diseases (5McGregor G.A. Markandu N.D. Roulstone J.E. Jones J.C. Nature. 1981; 291: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Huff J.R. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 7Citron M. Mol. Med.

Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), yet there has been limited success in identifying clinically relevant inhibitors; hence, it is important to explore alternative drug design approaches. An understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the target enzyme is a powerful tool in the search for new inhibitors, and this has motivated us to study BACE more carefully in an attempt to find determinants that could lead the way to more successful drug design. The proposed chemical mechanism for aspartyl proteases involves activation of the attacking water molecule by the general base Asp-COO− with concomitant protonation of the substrate carbonyl by a general acid Asp-COOH, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate amide hydrate (9Suguna K.

Kinetic mechanism studies suggest that pepsin and HIV protease undergo isomerization steps during catalysis (10Hyland L.J. Tomaszek T.A. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8454-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Cho Y.K. Rebholz K.L. Northrop D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and some evidence was obtained that this iso-step might be rate-limiting (12Rebholz K.L. Northrop D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Inhibitors binding to the form of the enzyme that accumulates because of the slow interconversion between enzyme isomers would be expected to display higher affinity and greater selectivity for the target enzyme. 2A non-competitive inhibition constant for an iso-mechanism reflects inhibitor binding to all enzyme isomers appearing during the catalysis. Expression of the K iin this case is not a simple dissociation constant between the enzyme isomers and inhibitor but rather a complex parameter, which is affected by the isomerization rate constant (kinetic contribution) and steady-state concentration of the isomeric form of enzyme. Thus, the conformer preceding a slow isomerization step will accumulate, and inhibitors, which bind to this particular entity, will yield more inhibition compared with compounds binding to the short lived enzyme forms.

Identifying unique conformers for the specific aspartyl proteases might render more specific inhibitors in spite of high amino acid sequence homology at the active site and commonly shared ground state enzyme structures. A recent proposal for the mechanism suggests that aspartyl proteases undergo multiple conformation states, which differ in geometry, protonation state, and proton localization (13Northrop D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The coplanar geometry of the aspartyl groups in the protease active site (14Piana S. Carloni P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the pK values of the catalytic aspartates allow for the possibility that aspartyl proteases hydrolyze peptide bonds using cyclic proton transfers and reactant state hydrogen tunneling, featuring a low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) (13Northrop D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). If so, ligands, attracted and preserving this particular feature, would yield very tight and specific inhibitors (15Cleland W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we performed product and statine-based peptide inhibition analysis, proton NMR of the free and inhibitor-bound enzyme, as well as solvent isotope effect studies to address the kinetic mechanism catalyzed by BACE and to dissect possible rate-limiting segments and dominating enzyme forms. The cDNA for the catalytic domain of human BACE (residues 1–460) was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pTV1.6, upstream of a thrombin cleavage site linked to cDNA encoding human IgG1 heavy chain. This construct, pTV1.6-BACE-T-IgG, was used to produce stably transfected dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary DG44 cells, which were then scaled up using methotrexate for selection. Multiple rounds of selection were used, with a final expression level of ∼10 mg/liter based on quantitation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BACE-T-IgG was scaled up to 35–80 liters of bioreactor production runs, and the secreted fusion protein was purified as described below. The clarified growth media harvested from a bioreactor run was concentrated using tangential flow filtration fitted with a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off unit to a smaller volume, typically from 35–80 down to 4 liters to facilitate purification. The fusion protein was captured on rProtein A-SepharoseTM column (5 × 20 cm, AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C. The column was washed with PBS, pH 7.1, until base-line absorbance was observed, and BACE-T-IgG was eluted with 0.10m citrate, pH 3.0, into tubes containing 0.5 volumes of 4m Tris, pH 8. Fractions containing the fusion protein were dialyzed extensively against PBS, pH 7.1, at 4 °C. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing (not shown) showed the presence of a mixture of two forms, consistent with published results from Amgen. The protein was sterile-filtered (0.2 μm) and stored at 4 °C for long term storage with no significant loss of activity observed even after ∼1 year. BACE-T-IgG was treated with human α-thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories) at a ratio of 1:500 in PBS, pH 7.1, at 37 °C for 2 h. Thrombin was removed by passing the sample over benzamidine-Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences), and IgG was captured with rProtein A-SepharoseTM. Finally, the protein sample was further purified by applying onto Superdex 200 (26/60) gel filtration column washed with PBS, pH 7.1, at room temperature. Fractions containing BACE were combined, sterile-filtered (0.22 μm), and stored at 4 °C. The protein was characterized by SDS-PAGE, and a variety of biophysical techniques, including isothermal titration calorimetry, to demonstrate that it was glycosylated, monomeric, catalytically active, and fully competent to bind BACE active site inhibitor OM99-2 (16Ghosh A. Shin D. Downs D. Koelsh G. Lin X. Ermolieff J. Tang J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3522-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Two BACE substrates were employed in this study: Ac-EIDL↓MVLDWHDK-DNP-OH (synthesized in-house) and MCA-EVNL↓DAEF(K-DNP)-COOH (Biosource International), where MCA is 7-methoxycoumarin. The first substrate (low K m) was used in experiments where substrate saturation was needed. The second substrate (high K m) was used in fluorescence assays to perform experiments at substrate concentrations well below the K m value. Product inhibition studies were performed using Ac-EIDL-OH (corresponding to the N-terminal part of the cleaved substrate, referred to as product P) and Ac-MVLDWHDK-OH (corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the substrate, referred to as product Q). The peptidomimetic inhibitor OM-99 and statine-valine inhibitor (Stat(V)) (Fig. 1) were purchased from Bachem and Enzyme Systems Inc., respectively. All substrate, product, and inhibitor stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO and stored at 4 °C for about a month. The concentration of the low K msubstrate was calculated using the extinction coefficient for DNP (ε360 = 17,700m−1·cm−1 at neutral pH). Assays with the low K msubstrate were performed in 200-μl reaction mixtures containing the substrate (1–40 μm) in 50 mm acetate buffer with 0.25 mg/ml BSA, pH 4.5, at 25 °C. Me2SO content was adjusted in all assays to be the same and not to exceed 6% (no loss of enzyme activity was observed at this Me2SO concentration). Reactions were initiated by addition of 10 or 20 nm BACE and quenched at various time points (depending on the experiment) by either boiling for 2 min or by addition of 200 μl of 3% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The quenched reaction mixtures were subject to HPLC separation (Waters Associates) monitoring absorbance at 360 nm. Product and residual substrate peaks were well resolved with an increasing gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, allowing precise integration of the peak areas. The area units were converted into molar concentration using a standard curve of known substrate concentrations. Because of nonspecific adsorption of product during the separation step, the calibration curves were non-linear. Therefore, sums of product and substrate peak areas after the reaction were plotted against the known substrate concentrations at the beginning of the reaction, and non-linear calibration curves were constructed. These calibration curves showed best fitting to the quadratic Equation 1, y=a+bx+cx2Equation 1 where y is sum of the product and substrate peak areas after the reaction; x is substrate concentration in μm before the reaction; and b and care coefficients derived from these data (a is assumed to be zero, at zero substrate concentration). Then the coefficientsb and c were used to calculate product concentration from the product peak area. All measurements with the fluorescently labeled, high K m substrate were performed as described in detail elsewhere (17Marcinkeviciene J. Luo Y. Graciani N. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23790-23794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The IC50 for steady-state inhibition of BACE by Stat(V) was determined at several fixed substrate concentrations in a reaction mixture (200 μl) containing buffer, lowK m substrate, and varying amounts of Stat(V) (0–5 μm). As in all assays, Me2SO content was constant in all mixtures and did not exceed 6% of the final volume. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 nm BACE and stopped after 15 min by boiling the reaction mixtures for 2 min. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. The HPLC method was applied to separate product and residual substrate peaks and to calculate their molar concentrations as described above. IC50 values were determined by fitting the data to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (18Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12221) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 2, Y=100%1+xIC50sEquation 2 where Y is percent of inhibition at xconcentration of the inhibitor, and s is the Hill slope. Product inhibition was studied in reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing fixed concentrations of one of the products, varying amounts of substrate (1–30 μm), Me2SO (to adjust its content to 6% final), and standard buffer (50 mm acetate with 0.25 mg/ml BSA, pH 4.5). After mixing the assay components, BACE (20 nm final) was added to initiate the reaction, and after 15-min 200 μl of 3% trifluoroacetic acid was used to stop it. By this method the reaction velocities were determined as a function of substrate and inhibitor concentration. These data were analyzed by fitting them globally to the equations for competitive (Equation 3), non-competitive (Equation 4), or mixed type (Equation 5) inhibition, respectively, ν=Vmax·[S]Km·(1+[I]/Kis)+[S]Equation 3 ν=Vmax·[S](Km+[S])·(1+[I]/Ki)Equation 4 ν=Vmax·[S]Km·(1+[I]/Kis)+[S]·(1+[I]/Kii)Equation 5 where [S] and K m are the concentration and Michaelis constant of the low K m substrate;V max and ν are the values for maximal and initial velocities; [I] corresponds to the inhibitor (one of the products) concentration; K is is the dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex; and K iiis the dissociation constant for ternary enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex. The goodness of fit was inspected visually and then evaluated statistically by the F-test (GraFit, Erithacus) as shown in Equation6, F=(χ12−χ22)/(ν1−ν2)χ22/ν2Equation 6 where χ n2 is the smallest possible sum of squares deviations of the experimental values from the calculated ones (n denotes the number of paired fits being compared), and ν is the number of degrees of freedom (defined as ν = N − n − 1, whereN is the number of data points, and n is the number of variables in the equation). Solvent kinetic isotope effects were investigated by parallel measurements of initial velocities of substrate cleavage in 50 mm acetate with 0.25 mg/ml BSA prepared in H2O and D2O. To derive pH/pD profiles for BACE activity, 10-fold concentrated buffers (without BSA) were first prepared in H2O; the pH was adjusted to the desired values, and these solutions were diluted in either H2O (pH buffer) or in D2O (pD buffer). Lyophilized BSA was added after reading the pH of the diluted buffers with a pH meter and calculating pD as pD = pHmeasured+ 0.33 for 88% D2O (19Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The enzyme stock solutions were then prepared in the same buffers to match the desired pH/pD. Substrate and inhibitor stock solutions were prepared in deuterated Me2SO, which yielded 90% of the label in the final reaction mixtures. Reactions were initiated by BACE addition (20 nm) into mixtures of specific pH (or pD) buffer and lowK m substrate (1–30 μm in 200 μl of final volume). After 5 min the reactions were quenched by adding 200 μl of 3% trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixtures were analyzed by HPLC as described above. Solvent kinetic isotope effects on the inhibition by cleavage products (P and Q) were performed using the same strategy. Buffer (prepared by 10-fold dilution into H2O or D2O) containing variable concentrations of products P or Q and substrate were mixed with the enzyme (prepared as well either in H2O or D2O) and quenched (by adding trifluoroacetic acid) after 15 min of reaction. Product formation and substrate contents were analyzed by HPLC as described earlier. Data for thek cat/K m dependence on the pH(D) were fitted to the Equation 7, Y=Ymax(1+H/Ka+Kb/H)Equation 7 where Y is the experimentally derivedk cat/K m value;Y max refers to the observed maximum of that experimental value; and K a and K bare the lower and higher K a values for the two titratable groups. Kinetic solvent isotope effects on k cat(D2O k cat) andk cat/K m(D2O k cat/K m) were calculated using Cleland's program (20Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation8, Y=kcat·[S]Km·(1+Fi·Ekcat/Km)+[S]·(1+Fi·Ekcat)Equation 8 where Y is the initial velocity; [S] is the substrate concentration; k cat andK m refer to the maximal turnover number and Michaelis constant, respectively; and F i is fraction of heavy atom label.E k cat/K m= ((D2O k cat/K m) − 1) and E k catx= ((D2O k cat) − 1). Solvent kinetic isotope effects on the inhibition by cleavage products (P and Q) were studied by using the same strategy. Buffer (prepared by 10-fold dilution into H2O or D2O) containing variable concentrations of products P or Q and substrate were mixed with the enzyme (prepared as well either in H2O or D2O) and quenched (by adding trifluoroacetic acid) after 15 min of reaction. Product formation and substrate contents were measured by the HPLC method described above, and the data were analyzed by fitting to Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5. Stat(V) exhibited a time-dependent onset of the inhibition during the catalysis, and we attempted to measure solvent kinetic isotope effects on the k on of this inhibition. The fluorescence intensity change upon cleavage of the high K m substrate was monitored in parallel experiments in 50 mm acetate with 0.25 mg/ml BSA at pH 4.5 and pD 5.05 (buffers were prepared from the same 10-fold concentrated buffer with pH 4.5 as described above) using the same concentrations of substrate (25 μm), enzyme (20 nm), and different fixed concentrations of the inhibitor (0–90 nm). Progress curves analysis was performed as described (17Marcinkeviciene J. Luo Y. Graciani N. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23790-23794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to derivek obs values for the approach to the steady-state. Data were fit to Equation 9, [P]=νs+(νi−νs)·(1−γ)kobs·γ·ln1−γ·e−kobs·t)1−γEquation 9 where [P], [E], and [I] are the product, enzyme, and inhibitor concentrations, respectively; νi is the initial velocity; νs is the steady-state velocity, andk obs is the pseudo-first order rate constant for the approach to the steady state. γ = [E]/[I]·(1 − νs/νi)2. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance 5-mm probe with triax gradients. Spectra were recorded using the 1–1 sequence to suppress the water signal with minimal saturation (21Hore P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 293-300Google Scholar). Signals were acquired over 10,000 scans with a sweep width of 30 kHz, 8192 time domain points, and a relaxation delay of 4 s. Spectra were collected at 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C. All BACE solutions were 50 μm protein in either Buffer A (10 mmphosphate, pH 7.0, 3 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl), Buffer B (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3), or Buffer C (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5). 1.5 equivalents of OM99-2 (10 mm in d 6-Me2SO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.)) were added to the BACE solution yielding a final ligand concentration of 75 μm. Me2SO concentration did not exceed 0.75%. The D/H fractionation factors were determined at 20 °C by integrating the peak intensities of the downfield resonances in a series of samples containing different D2O/H2O solvent compositions. In these experiments BACE solutions were prepared in Buffer C, pH 4.5, as both 100% H2O and 100% D2O (99.9%, Isotec) stock solutions. For D2O stock solutions, the observed pH (at 20 °C) was lowered by 0.4 units. Appropriate volumes of the H2O and D2O stock solutions were mixed to yield the desired D2O/H2O composition. Corrections to the signal intensity for mole fraction H2O were made as described by Markley and Westler (22Markley J.L. Westler W.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11092-11097Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The fractionation factor (φ) was determined by fitting the data to the Equation 10, (yC)−1=φ(1−X)/X+1Equation 10 where y is the signal intensity; C is a constant, and X is the mole fraction of H2O (23Loh S.N. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies of BACE using the fluorogenic substrate described previously (24Mallender W.D. Yager D. Onstead L. Nichols M.R. Eckman C. Sambamurti K. Kopcho L. Marcinkeviciene J. Copeland R.A. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharm. 2000; 59: 619-626Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were severely limited because of the inner filter effects and the high K mof this substrate. Another peptidic substrate with a much lowerK m has been reported recently (25Turner III, R.T. Koelch G. Hong L. Castenheira P. Ghosh A. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and we were able to advance mechanistic studies using this substrate and HPLC-based detection method. Under our assay conditions, the latter substrate was cleaved by BACE with k cat of 0.32 ± 0.02 s−1 and K m of 5.2 ± 0.7 μm. A number of peptides, based on the amino acid sequence around the amyloid precursor protein β-cleavage site and containing a hydroxyethylene (including OM99-2 (16Ghosh A. Shin D. Downs D. Koelsh G.

Both of the above-mentioned inhibitors showed tight binding behavior with K i, calculated using Morrison's quadratic equation, of 2 and 20 nm for OM99-2 and Stat(V), respectively. The observed K i (IC50) for competitive inhibitors, which bind exclusively to the free enzyme, should be linearly dependent on substrate concentration (27Chou T.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 235-247PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon varying Stat(V) (0–5 μm) and substrate concentrations (5–25 μm), we found that the IC50 was independent of substrate concentration (Fig. 2). Similar inhibition pattern was observed for a number of hydroxyethylene-containing peptides (data not shown). This type of pattern has traditionally been characteristic of non-competitive inhibitors that bind to both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. To follow up on this unexpected finding we conducted product inhibition studies. Initial velocity was measured varying substrate and one of the two cleavage products (Ac-EIDL or Ac-MVLDWHDR). Data collected using Ac-EIDL as an inhibitor were best fit globally (reconfirmed by F-test, Grafit, Erithacus) to a noncompetitive inhibition pattern (Fig. 3 A) withK is = K ii = 3.2 ± 0.4 mm. The second product, Ac-MVLDWHDR, likewise displayed a noncompetitive inhibition pattern (Fig. 3 B) with the values of K is = K ii = 1.48 ± 0.08 mm. Kinetic parameters for the BACE-catalyzed reaction were measured over th"

We found that ATP binding to the first NBD of MRP1 increases binding and trapping of ADP at the second domain (Hou, Y., Cui, L., Riordan, J. R., and Chang, X. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 5110–5119). These results were interpreted as indicating that the binding of ATP at NBD1 causes a conformational change in the molecule and increases the affinity for ATP at NBD2. However, we did not distinguish between the possibilities that the enhancement of ADP trapping might be caused by either ATP binding alone or hydrolysis. We now report the following. 1) ATP has a much lesser effect at 0 °C than at 37 °C. 2) After hexokinase treatment, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, adenyl 5′-(yl iminodiphosphate), does not enhance ADP trapping. 3) Another nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate, whether hexokinase-treated or not, causes a slight enhancement. 4) In contrast, the hexokinase-treated poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogue, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), enhances ADP trapping to a similar extent as ATP under conditions in which ATPγS should not be hydrolyzed. We conclude that: 1) ATP hydrolysis is not required to enhance ADP trapping by MRP1 protein; 2) with nucleotides having appropriate structure such as ATP or ATPγS, binding alone can enhance ADP trapping by MRP1; 3) the stimulatory effect on ADP trapping is greatly diminished when the MRP1 protein is in a “frozen state” (0 °C); and 4) the steric structure of the nucleotide γ-phosphate is crucial in determining whether binding of the nucleotide to NBD1 of MRP1 protein can induce the conformational change that influences nucleotide trapping at NBD2.

Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, in their interpretation the ATP binding/hydrolysis sites of P-gp are recruited in a random manner during hydrolysis (23Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol.

Therefore, how events at NBD1 and NBD2 of P-gp cooperate during drug transport is still not clear. Considerable evidence has accumulated indicating that the two NBDs of some other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) (26Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T.

For example, in the case of MRP1, the following points clearly indicate that its two nonequivalent NBDs have different properties and functions. First, modifications of the consensus Walker motifs in the two NBDs do not inactivate the protein completely and have different effects on solute transport (30Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E.

Biophys. 2001; 392: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Second, photoaffinity labeling experiments with 8-azido-ATP also revealed an asymmetry between NBD1 and NBD2, with NBD1 preferentially labeled by 8-N3[γ-32P]ATP (30Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17626-17630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Third, the ATP binding/hydrolysis sites of MRP1 seem not to be recruited in a random manner because photolabeling by the nonhydrolyzable 8-N3[α-32P]AMP-PNP occurred predominately at NBD1 (34Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the NBD1 fragment was labeled predominantly with 8-N3[α-32P]ATP on ice in the dual-expressed N- and C-halves of MRP1 (30Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Fourth, ADP trapping at NBD2 enhances ATP binding at NBD1 (31Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and ATP binding at NBD1 allosterically enhances ADP trapping or AMP-PNP binding at NBD2 (34Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), implying that ATP binding at NBD1 or ADP trapping at NBD2 induces conformational change of the MRP1 molecule. It seems likely that the conformational changes of the MRP1 molecule caused by ATP binding/hydrolysis provide mechanical force to pump drug out of the cell. However, experiments to date have not directly determined whether ATP binding alone or hydrolysis at NBD1 can cause conformational change of the MRP1 protein and enhance ADP trapping at NBD2. We have now done this and found that ATP hydrolysis is not required to enhance ADP trapping, and ATP binding alone is sufficient to enhance ADP trapping. In addition, the steric position of the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide is a crucial factor in determining whether or not the binding of the nucleotide to NBD1 of MRP1 protein can enhance ADP trapping.

These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 150 μmmethotrexate (the original colonies expressing MRP1 were selected in 500 μm methotrexate and decreased to 150 μmmethotrexate because the lesser amount of this drug did not affect the expression of MRP1 protein) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells for membrane vesicle preparations were grown in roller bottles (Bellco) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 150 μm methotrexate at 37 °C. MRP1-containing membrane vesicles were prepared according to the procedure described previously (31Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells grown in roller bottles were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in membrane vesicle preparation buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mmsucrose, 0.2 mm MgCl2 and 1× protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 121 μg/ml benzamidine, 3.5 μg/ml E64, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml Pefabloc) and equilibrated on ice for 20 min at 800 p.s.i. in a Parr N2 cavitation bomb. After pressure release, the cell homogenate was adjusted to 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was diluted 5-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 25 mm sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was overlaid on a 35% sucrose solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes at the interface were collected, diluted 5-fold with a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 250 mm sucrose, and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mmsucrose, and 1× protease inhibitors. After passage through a Liposofast™ vesicle extruder (200-nm filter, Avestin, Ottawa, Canada), the membrane vesicles were aliquoted and stored in −80 °C. To remove the trace amount of contaminating ATP in ATP analogues, 5 mm AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, or ATPγS solutions were treated with hexokinase as described previously (36Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, each nucleotide at 5 mm in a 1-ml solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 units of hexokinase was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Hexokinase in the solution was removed by passing the solution through a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, molecular weight cut-off 10,000). Vanadate preparation and photoaffinity labeling of MRP1 protein were performed according to procedures described previously (31Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, the photolabeling experiments were carried out in a 10-μl solution containing 10 μg of membrane vesicles from MRP1 expressing cells, 10 μm8-N3[α-32P]ADP (1.2 μCi), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ouabain, 800 μm vanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA. The amounts of other nucleotides added, incubation time, and temperature are indicated specifically in the figure legends. The samples were then transferred to ice and diluted with 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-EGTA buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5). The membranes were pelleted in a microcentrifuge in a cold room (4 °C), resuspended in 10 μl of Tris-EGTA buffer, placed on ice, and irradiated for 2 min in a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (λ = 254 nm). The labeled proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel (7%) electrophoresis and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The previous procedure (35Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) used to purify MRP1 protein from BHK cells was modified slightly. Cells collected from roller bottles were washed with a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.2 mm MgCl2, and the cell pellet was kept in a −80 °C freezer overnight. The cell pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mmEDTA, and 1× protease inhibitors, and then the cells were transferred to a Dounce homogenizer. After seven strokes in this homogenizer, the same volume of a solution containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm sucrose was added to the homogenizer, and then another six strokes were performed. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Membranes were collected at 33,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 25 mm imidazole, 1% DDM, 0.4% sheep brain lipid, and 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol and sonicated for a short time on ice. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied onto a His-Bind Resin column that had been pre-equilibrated with the binding buffer. The column was washed with 6 column volumes of modified binding buffer containing 0.1% DDM and 25 mm imidazole (first wash), 6 column volumes of modified binding buffer containing 0.1% DDM and 40 mm imidazole (second wash), and 6 column volumes of modified binding buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH7.4, 0.1% DDM and 40 mm imidazole (third wash). The bound protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 300 mm imidazole, 0.1% DDM, 0.4% sheep brain lipid, and 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol. The eluate was dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, and 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol. The experiments were performed in a 15-μl solution containing 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm[γ-35S] ATPγS (3 μCi), and 0.5 μg of purified MRP1 protein. The same amount of protein-free sheep brain lipid (26 μg) solution as in the 0.5 μg of purified MRP1 protein was used as a negative control. The reaction mixture was brought back to ice, and 10% aliquots were spotted immediately on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate. The samples were chromatographed with 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid as the solvent. The amounts of intact [γ-35S]ATPγS and [35S]phosphate in each reaction mixture were determined by electronic autoradiography using a Packard Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). We found that photolabeling of MRP1 protein with 8-N3[α-32P]ADP was enhanced 4-fold mainly at NBD2 (34Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATP binding or hydrolysis at NBD1 caused conformational change of the protein and increased affinity for ATP at NBD2. However, these experiments were performed at 37 °C and did not distinguish whether ATP binding or hydrolysis caused the conformational change of the protein. To distinguish these two possibilities, the same photolabeling experiments were performed on ice. Fig. 1, A andB, showed that the trapping of ADP to the protein was enhanced ∼30–40% in the presence of 5 to 20 μm ATP. The trapping was inhibited almost 70% in the presence of 640 μm ATP, simply because of competition between ATP binding and ADP trapping. These results were interpreted in the following two ways: 1) ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 may be required to induce the conformational change of the molecule to enhance ADP trapping at NBD2 and limited ATP hydrolysis on ice greatly diminishes the enhancement effect; 2) ATP binding alone can cause a conformational change that increases ADP trapping at NBD2 at higher temperature, such as 37 °C, and the smaller augmentation of trapping by ATP on ice may reflect a membrane structure and/or MRP1 protein that are in a “frozen state.” Therefore these results cannot be used to distinguish the two possibilities mentioned above. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, enhanced ADP trapping by MRP1 protein (34Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that nucleotide binding alone can cause the conformational change of the protein. However, this could be misleading if there is a trace amount of hydrolyzable nucleotide contaminant. This can be removed efficiently by treating the solution with hexokinase (36Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2 show that AMP-PNP, after hexokinase treatment, did not enhance ADP trapping by MRP1 protein, but instead it inhibited ADP trapping. Previous results clearly indicated that 8-N3[α-32P]AMP-PNP bound to NBD1 of MRP1 (34Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore it seems likely that nucleotide binding alone, at least in the case of AMP-PNP, cannot enhance ADP trapping by MRP1. If nucleotide binding alone cannot cause the conformational change leading to increased trapping, then the binding of other nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, such as AMP-PCP, should also not enhance ADP trapping. To test this hypothesis, both hexokinase-treated and untreated AMP-PCP were utilized in the ADP trapping experiments. Fig. 3,A and B, shows that AMP-PCP, which was not treated with hexokinase, enhanced ADP trapping ∼50%, whereas the hexokinase-treated AMP-PCP did so by ∼20% (Fig. 3, C andD). The enhancing effect of the untreated AMP-PCP is slightly greater than the treated compound, presumably reflecting the removal of a trace amount of ATP. These results may mean that nucleotide binding at NBD1 alone can induce the conformational change required to enhance ADP trapping at NBD2. However, this interpretation is not consistent with the conclusion derived from Fig. 2. Therefore we postulated that in some nucleotides, such as ATP or AMP-PCP, binding alone without hydrolysis can induce this conformational change, whereas in other nucleotides, such as AMP-PNP, binding cannot induce this change. To further test the above hypothesis, ATPγS was utilized in the ADP trapping experiments. Fig. 4, A and B, show that ATPγS enhanced ADP trapping to MRP1 protein almost 3-fold. Similarly, hexokinase-treated ATPγS also increased the trapping ∼3-fold (Fig. 4, C and D). Because the enhancing effect of ATPγS is much greater than that of AMP-PCP (Fig. 3) and slightly less than that of ATP (34Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), ATPγS may have an effect on ADP trapping similar to that of ATP under other conditions, such as at 0 °C. The experiments in Fig. 4 E were performed on ice and showed that ATPγS stimulated ADP trapping by MRP1 protein ∼20–30% (Fig. 4 F). These results imply that ATPγS binding alone can cause the underlying conformational change. Thus far, we have not ruled out the possibility that the poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS, might be hydrolyzed to some extent during the 10-min incubation period at 37 °C. Therefore we estimated how long it would take to hydrolyze one ATPγS molecule. Table I shows that it took ∼20 min for one MRP1 molecule at 37 °C to hydrolyze one ATPγS. Therefore, ∼50% of the ATPγS bound to MRP1 protein should be hydrolyzed during the 10-min of incubation at 37 °C. Hence, some hydrolysis did occur.Table ITime required to hydrolyze one [γ- 35 S]ATPγS by one MRP1 moleculeTemperatureTimeSample1-a0.5 μg of purified MRP1 protein was in 26 μg of sheep brain lipid (SBL).

Vanadate, an environmental toxicant, causes developmental defects in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrated that vanadate induced apoptosis in cultured cerebellar granule progenitors (CGPs). Treatment of cultured CGPs with vanadate activated ERKs and JNKs but not p38 MAPK and also induced c-Jun phosphorylation. In addition, vanadate induced FasL production, Fas (CD95) aggregation, and its association with the Fas-associated death domain (FADD), as well as the activation of caspase-8. Furthermore, vanadate generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CGPs; however, ROS was not involved in vanadate-mediated MAPK activation. Vanadate-induced FasL expression was ROS-dependent but JNK-independent. In contrast, vanadate-elicited Fas aggregation and Fas-FADD association, as well as caspase-8 activation, were dependent on JNK activation but were minimally regulated by ROS generation. The hydrogen peroxide scavenger, catalase, blocked vanadate-induced FasL expression and partially mitigated vanadate-induced cell death. On the other hand, dominant negative FADD and caspase-8 inhibitor completely eliminated vanadate-induced apoptosis. Thus, JNK signaling plays a major role in vanadate-mediated activation of the Fas-FADD-caspase-8 pathway that accounts for vanadate-induced apoptosis of CGPs.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an important role in shaping the developing nervous system, removing unwanted neurons, and establishing correct synaptic connections with the targets they innervate (1Cowan W.M.

Understanding the mechanisms that govern neuronal apoptosis could lead to more effective therapies for these disorders.

Three major MAPKs have been identified: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNKs), and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). ERKs are mainly activated by growth factors and are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar, 10Blanchard D.A. Mouhamad S. Auffredou M.T. Pesty A. Bertoglio J. Leca G. Vazquez A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4184-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unlike ERKs, JNKs and p38 MAPK are most potently activated by environmental stresses. JNKs are identified through their ability to phosphorylate the N-terminal stimulatory sites of c-Jun (11Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Along with JNKs, p38 MAPKs are implicated in the regulation of cell death. JNKs and p38 MAPK may regulate apoptosis positively or negatively depending on cell type (12Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol.

The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of vanadate-induced damages to the developing central nervous system and define the role of MAPKs in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis. The developing cerebellum is one of the regions that is most susceptible to environmental insults, and vanadium compounds are deposited in the human cerebellum (41Yukawa M. Amano K. Suzuki-Yasumoto M. Terai M. Arch. Environ. Health. 1980; 35: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cerebellum granule neurons, the major cerebellar neuronal population, are generated in the proliferative external germinal layer of the cerebellum during the first 2–3 postnatal weeks in the rat (42Miale I.L. Sidman R.L. Exp. Neurol. 1961; 4: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 43Altman J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1972; 145: 353-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). During the early postnatal period, cells in the external germinal layer undergo extensive proliferation to generate a large pool of cerebellar granule progenitors (CGPs). The developing CGPs then exit the cell cycle and migrate inward past Purkinje cell bodies to their final destination in the internal granule layer, where they differentiate into cerebellar granule neurons (42Miale I.L. Sidman R.L. Exp. Neurol. 1961; 4: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 43Altman J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1972; 145: 353-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The CGPs isolated from 3–5-day (a time when CGPs are being generated and proliferating in vivo)-old rat pups retain their proliferative capability in vitro and are able to differentiate into neurons (44Cui H. Bulleit R.F. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 106: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 45Wechsler-Reya R.J. Scott M.P.

This in vitrosystem offers an excellent model for study of neuronal development. Here, we demonstrate that vanadate induces apoptosis of CGPs. JNK signaling and the death receptor Fas (CD95) play a central role in vanadate-mediated neuronal death. Sodium metavanadate (vanadium (V), NaVO3, or vanadate, catalog no. 2839-1) was purchased from Sigma. Caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DMQD-CHO, caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, and caspase-9 inhibitor ZlEHD-FMK were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-Fas antibodies, SM1/23 and FL-335, were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Fas-Fc fusion protein was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-Fas ligand (FasL) (N-20) and anti-FADD antibodies (H-181) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human recombinant FasL was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Deferoxamine, superoxide dismutases, and sodium formate were purchased from Sigma. Catalase was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The inhibitors for protein tyrosine phosphatase (α-bromo-4-hydroxyacetophenone), p38 MAPK (SB202190), and MEK1 (PD98059) were purchased from Calbiochem, and a selective JNK inhibitor (D-JNKI1) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. The CGPs were isolated from the cerebella of 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Hilltop Laboratory Inc., Scottsdale, PA) using a previously described procedure (47Li Z. Lin H. Zhu Y. Wang M. Luo J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 48Luo J. West J.R. Pantazis N.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 1108-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The purity of CGPs generated using this procedure is greater than 95.0%. Isolated CGPs were plated into poly-d-lysine (50.0 μg, Sigma)-coated culture wells or dishes at a density of 3.2 × 104/cm2. The cultures were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing the following supplements: 10.0% fetal bovine serum, 25.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm glutamine, 33.0 mmglucose, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100.0 μg/ml). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified environment containing 5.0% CO2. The number of viable cells in culture was determined by the MTT assay (catalog no. 1 465 007, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, the CGPs were plated into 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 3.2 × 104/cm2. 10 μl of MTT labeling reagent was added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After MTT incubation the cultures were solubilized, and spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was detected by a microtiter plate reader. The wavelength to measure the absorbance of formazan product was 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 750 nm. We have demonstrated that the MTT assay is an accurate method to determine the number of viable cells (47Li Z. Lin H. Zhu Y. Wang M. Luo J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 49Sun Y. Lin H. Zhu Y. Ma C. Ye J. Luo J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was determined by pulse labeling of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (47Li Z. Lin H. Zhu Y. Wang M. Luo J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 50Luo J. Miller M.W. Brain Res. 1997; 770: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated into wells of removable chamber slides at the density of 3.2 × 104/cm2 and exposed to 20.0 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 12 h. BrdUrd positive cells were visualized immunohistochemically using an anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The numbers of BrdUrd positive and negative cells within an area of 0.5 × 0.5 mm were counted. Five fields were chosen at random in each slide and counted. A BrdUrd labeling index (the number of labeled cells divided by the total number of cells counted) was calculated. This assay is based on quantification of accumulation of DNA fragments in the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. Accumulation of cytosolic histone-bound DNA fragments was quantified using a commercial ELISA kit (catalog no. 1 544 675, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The measurement of apoptosis, which was demonstrated previously, was sensitive, and the outcome was consistent with morphometric indices of apoptosis or the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling assay (47Li Z. Lin H. Zhu Y. Wang M. Luo J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 51Ye J. Ding M. Leonard S.S. Robinson V.A. Millecchia L. Zhang X. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 202: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death was also determined by counting the amount of cells containing condensed or fragmented nuclei in a blinded manner (52Morishima Y. Gotoh Y. Zieg J. Barrett T. Takano H. Flavell R. Davis R.J. Shirasaki Y. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7551-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Cell membranes were permeabilized by treating the cells with 0.10% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and then stained with a DNA dye, TOTO-3 iodide (3.0 μg/ml; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), for 30 min at 37 °C to visualize nuclear morphology. After being washed with PBS, the cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Apoptotic neurons were determined by counting the cells containing condensed or fragmented nuclei in 4–5 fields/well. At least 200 cells were counted. Caspase activity was determined using commercial fluorometric protease assay kits. Kits for assaying caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and the caspase-9 activity kit from R&D Systems. The activation of caspases was determined for their protease activity by the addition of a caspase-specific substrate peptide that is conjugated to the fluorescent reporter molecule 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin. The cleavage of the substrate peptide by specific caspase releases the fluorochrome that emits fluorescence at 505 nm when excited by light with a 400-nm wavelength. The level of caspase enzymatic activity is directly proportional to the fluorescence signal detected with a fluorometer. Cell lysates (40–100 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8–12% polyacrylamide gels, and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5.0% nonfat milk in TPBS (0.010 m PBS, pH 7.4, and 0.10% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h, the membranes were probed with various antibodies directed against activated MAPKs or phosphorylated tyrosine. These antibodies include anti-phospho-c-Jun, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho ERK, anti-JNK1, anti-c-Jun, anti-p38, and anti-ERK, which were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-JNK antibody was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were stripped and reprobed with an anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The variation in loading was normalized against the amount of actin expression in each lane. Each experiment was repeated three to four times for each primary antibody. The relative amount of specific protein imaged on the films was quantified using a Sigma Gel program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). Fas was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (200.0 μg of total protein) by an anti-Fas antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using a previously described method (53Luo J. Miller M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10014-10025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were electrophoretically separated and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. FADD associated with Fas was examined by immunoblotting using an anti-FADD antibody. Fas aggregation was determined using a previously described method (54Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 55Ruiz-Ruiz C. Robledo G. Font J. Izquierdo M. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4737-4746PubMed Google Scholar). Basically, when antibody is limiting (0.1–0.5 μg/ml), more molecules of the Fas will be immunoprecipitated if aggregation occurs after vanadate treatment. In contrast, when antibody is not limiting (5–10 μg/ml), equal amounts of Fas should be immunoprecipitated. Briefly, cells were treated with vanadate (25.0 μm, 6 h), resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and then incubated with 2.0 mm cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis-[sulfosuccinimidyl propionate] (Sigma) for 15 min on ice. The reaction was quenched with 10.0 mm ammonium acetate for 10 min and the cells were washed with PBS and then lysed. Fas was immunoprecipitated using either limiting or excess amounts of anti-Fas antibody and detected by immunoblot. The pcDNA3.0/DN-FADD vector (kindly provided by Dr. V. M. Dixit, Genetech, San Francisco, CA) carries a truncated FADD cDNA lacking the death effector domain (DED) region (56Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

The cells were transfected with pEGFP-C3 (0.30 μg) and DN-FADD (1.0 μg) or an empty pcDNA3.0 vector (1.0 μg) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after the transfection the CGPs were treated with vanadate (25.0 μm) for 24 h. Nuclei were stained with TOTO-3 iodide, and apoptotic neurons in total transfected (green fluorescent protein-positive) cells were determined as described above. The ESR spin trapping technique with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trap was used to detect free radical generation. This technique involves the formation of an adduct of a short-lived radical with a diamagnetic compound (spin trap) to generate a relatively long-lived free radical product (spin adduct), which can be studied by conventional ESR. The intensity of the spin adduct signal corresponds to the amount of short-lived radicals trapped, whereas the hyperfine couplings of the spin adduct are characteristics of trapped radicals. The spectra were recorded using a Varian E9 ESR spectrometer and a flat cell assembly as described previously (58Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hyperfine couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) directly from magnetic field separation using potassium tetraperoxochromate (K3CrO8) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl as reference standards. 500.0 μl of cell suspension (1 × 106/0.5 ml) was mixed with 500.0 μl of PBS containing 100.0 mm DMPO and 1.0 mmvanadate with/without ROS scavengers. The reaction mixture (500.0 μl) was transferred to a flat cell for ESR measurement. Treatment groups were compared using analysis of variance. In cases where significant differences (p < 0.05) were detected, specific post hoc comparisons between treatment groups were examined with the Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Vanadate exposure reduced the number of viable cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). Concomitantly, vanadate increased apoptotic death, which was determined by a cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). At a concentration of 25.0 μm, vanadate treatment (24 h) increased death rate by 3.4-fold. Vanadate-induced apoptosis was verified with an analysis of nuclear morphology by TOTO-3 iodide staining; it showed a 3.1-fold increase in apoptotic rate after vanadate treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Time course analysis revealed that maximal apoptosis occurred 24–48 h after vanadate treatment (Fig. 1 E). Because CGPs proliferate in culture, we sought to determine whether vanadate affects the proliferation of CGPs. As shown in Fig. 1 F, vanadate (25.0 μm) produced a small but statistically significant decrease (−19%; p < 0.05) of BrdUrd positive cells. In contrast, at this concentration vanadate decreased the number of CGPs by more than 70%. When these facts are taken together, it can be concluded that vanadate-induced depletion of cell number was mainly caused by the cell death. Vanadate produced a sustained activation of JNK1 but did not affect JNK1 expression (Fig. 2 A). The antibody applied reacts with both JNK1 and JNK2 (Promega, catalog no. V7932), but only phosporylated JNK1 was detected. The activation lasted for at least 12 h. As a result of JNK activation, vanadate induced phosphorylation of c-Jun, a main target of JNKs, in a pattern similar to that of JNK1 (Fig. 2 A). Vanadate had little effect on c-Jun expression. Vanadate also produced a transient activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2 B). The activation of ERK1/2 was evident 15 min after vanadate treatment, and the effect diminished after 2 h. Vanadate had little effect on the expression of ERK1/2. We also examined the effect of vanadate on p38 MAPK. Vanadate did not significantly alter either the expression or the activation of p38 MAPK in CGPs (data not shown). Vanadium compounds may serve as protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor and subsequently enhance protein tyrosine phosphorylation (59Krejsa C.M. Nadler S.G. Esselstyn J.M. Kavanagh T.J.

We then examined the effect of vanadate on protein tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular extracts. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, vanadate treatment increased tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of proteins including JNK1 as determined by immunoprecipitation. Because vanadate induced apoptotic death of CGPs (Fig. 1), we sought to determine the mechanisms of vanadate-induced damage. Death receptor Fas is an apoptotic sensor that transmits a death signal (61Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar, 62Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The adapter molecule FADD couples with the death receptor Fas to procaspase-8 (63Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, vanadate produced a concentration-dependent up-regulation in the expression of FasL. Although vanadate did not alter the expression of Fas and FADD, it induced an association between these proteins (Fig. 3 B). Vanadate-induced activation of Fas was further confirmed by the evidence showing an increase in Fas aggregation (Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig. 3 C, vanadate induced a JNK-dependent Fas aggregation. Because caspases play a critical role in the initiation of apoptosis, we sought to determine whether vanadate activates caspases. As shown in Fig. 4, vanadate treatment significantly (p < 0.05) activated caspases-3 and -8, but had little effect on caspase-9 (Fig. 4).Figure 4Effects of vanadate on caspase activity.The CGPs were treated with vanadate (25.0 μm) for 24 h.

To determine whether vanadate-induced apoptosis of CGPs is mediated by ROS, we first examined the ROS generation in the vanadate-treated cells. The ability of vanadate to generate ⋅OH radicals was examined using an ERS spin trapping method with DMPO as the spin trap. As shown in Fig. 5, vanadate treatment generated a typical ESR spectrum of free radicals. The spectrum consists of a 1:2:2:1 quartet with splittings of aH = aN = 14.9 G, where aN and aH denote hyperfine s"

The longest complete cDNA sequence determined so far contains a full-length hTPO (TPO1) encoding a 933-amino acid polypeptide. Several mRNA species encoding for hTPO isoforms are present in normal thyroid tissues, including TPO2 with exon 10 deleted and TPOzanelli with exon 16 deleted. In the present study, we established the existence of two new single-spliced transcripts, TPO4 and TPO5, lacking exons 14 and 8, respectively. Upon transfecting the TPO4 cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells, it was observed that TPO4 is able to reach the cell surface, is enzymatically active, and is able to be recognized by a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies directed against hTPO, whereas TPO5 does not fold correctly and is unable to reach the cell surface. In normal tissues, the expression of TPO4 mRNA was examined by performing quantitative reverse transcription PCR. This deleted TPO mRNA amounted to 32 ± 11% of the total TPO mRNAs. In the same tissues, the TPO2, TPOzanelli, and TPO5 amounted to 35 ± 12%, 36 ± 14%, and ∼10%, respectively. The sum of these four species (not including TPO1) was more than 100%, possibly due to the presence of multispliced mRNAs. This possibility was tested, and three new variants were identified: TPO2/3, lacking exons 10 and 16, TPO2/4, lacking exons 10 and 14, and an unexpected variant, TPO6, corresponding to the deletion of exons 10, 12, 13, 14, and 16. In conclusion, these results indicate the existence of five new transcripts. One of them, TPO4, codes for an enzymatically active protein, whereas TPO5 is unable to fold correctly. The functional significance of the other newly spliced mRNA variants still remains to be elucidated, but these results might help to explain the heterogeneity of the hTPO purified from the thyroid gland.

After being purified from the human thyroid gland, TPO is known to show up in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as a double band of 105 and 110 kDa.

Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), certainly because it is too rapidly degraded after its synthesis (7Niccoli P. Fayadat L. Paneels V. Lanet J. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29487-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The difference in molecular weight between TPO1 and TPO3 (four amino acids) does not explain the existence of two bands, and glycosylation is not responsible for this heterogeneity either (11Giraud A. Franc J.L. Long Y. Ruf J. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 132: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The presence of other isoforms and/or the occurrence of endoproteolysis might explain the existence of these different species. The aim of the present study was to search for the presence of new TPO transcripts that might help to explain this heterogeneity. Reverse transcription was carried out from the total RNAs, and PCRs were performed with various pairs of primers. Two new single spliced species (TPO4 and TPO5) were identified. After quantification of the four spliced isoforms TPO2, TPO3, TPO4, and TPO5 in normal thyroid tissues, the possible existence of multispliced isoforms was hypothesized. The existence of two isoforms with double splicing and one isoform with five spliced exons was established. Frozen normal thyroid tissue was used in these experiments. Tissues were homogenized and prepared using thePromega kit (SV total RNA isolation system) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the preparation was then treated with DNase. The RNA concentration was determined from the spectrophotometric absorption at 260 nm, and the RNAs were aliquoted and stored in water at −80 °C until further use. The absorption ratio (260/280) was between 1.7 and 2.0 with all the preparations. Depending on the experiments, reverse transcription was carried out using either 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18, 1 μg of random hexamers, or 2 pmol of gene-specific primer (GSP). A 40-μl reverse transcription reaction mixture containing hexamers, GSP, or oligo(dT)12–18, 0.9 μg of RNA, 0.25 mm dNTP mix, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 4 units of RNase recombinant inhibitor (Invitrogen) was incubated at 42 °C for 2 min when GSP and oligo(dT)12–18 were used, or at 25 °C for 10 min when random hexamers were used. Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (0.2 units) (Invitrogen) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction was inactivated by heating the preparation at 70 °C for 15 min. The mixture then treated with 2 units of RNase H (Escherichia coli) at 37 °C for 20 min. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) consisted of 2 units of Fast Start Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Taq buffer, 0.3 μmoligonucleotide primers, 300 μm dNTP, 2 mmMgCl2, and 5 μl of GC-rich solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A DNA sample was added to this mixture, and PCR was performed with the following profile: 5 min at 95 °C for an initial denaturation followed by 35 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at temperatures depending on the primers, and a 45-s extension at 72 °C, ending with a 5-min final extension at 72 °C and a soak at 4 °C. The products obtained were electrophoresed on agarose gel in TAE (40 mm Tris-acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. When necessary, the various PCR products were extracted from the gel using Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sequence analysis (Genomexpress, Grenoble France) or subcloning were then performed. Subcloning of the purified PCR products was performed using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Size analysis of the fragment inserted and sequence analysis of this insert in the vector were performed with the various clones obtained. To study the relative levels of expression of the various hTPO mRNA variants, RT-PCR was performed as described in Ref. 12Spencer W.S. Christensen M.J. Biotechnique. 1999; 27: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar with some modifications. PCR reactions were performed as described above except that the volume of the mixture was 100 μl, and 9-μl aliquots were taken from the reaction after each consecutive cycle and loaded onto 2% agarose gel. After staining the products with ethidium bromide, bands were detected, and their intensity was quantified using an Image Station 440 (Kodak). To correct the difference in nucleotide length, the density of the smaller size band was multiplied by a factor corresponding to this difference. To determine whether the detection of a variant was really dependent on its initial proportion within the cDNA population, we performed PCR amplifications with various quantities of the three cloned variants, pcDNA3-TPO2, pcDNA3-TPO3, or pcDNA3-TPO4 in relation to that of pcDNA3-TPO1 (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3, respectively). In all the cases that were tested, the ratio between the isoforms after their amplification corresponded to their initial proportions. Full-length 3060-kb TPO1 cDNA kindly provided by B. Rapoport was cloned into the HindIII andXbaI sites of the eukaryotic transfer vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The internal deletion of the cDNA corresponding to exon 14 or exon 8 was performed using a single PCR procedure (13Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. Biotechnique. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Wang J. Wilkinson M.F. Biotechnique. 2000; 29: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primer pair used was P-TPO4F or P-TPO5F (sense) and P-TPO4R or P-TPO5R (antisense) (see TableI). The PCR mixture contained 160 ng of each primer, 50 ng of the pcDNA-TPO1, 200 μm dNTPs, 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the corresponding buffer in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was performed under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s followed by 17 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and an extension at 68 °C for 17 min. PCR products were incubated with 10 units of DpnI for 2 h, and 5 μl of this solution was then transformed into 50 μl of MAX efficiency DH5α (Invitrogen). Parts of this transformant were spread onto LB agar plates. Correct pcDNA3-TPO4 and -TPO5 clones were evidenced by sequencing. pcDNA3-TPO4 and -TPO5 pure plasmid DNA preparations were obtained with the Wizard Midipreps kit (Promega, Madison, WI).Table IPrimer sequences for RT-PCRPrimerExonPositionSequencePE2F253–735′-CCTTCTTCCCCTTCATCTCGA-3′PE9Fa91392–14135′-GCAGTACGTGGGTCCCTATGAA-3′PE9Fb91382–14015′-AGGCCTTCCAGCAGTACGTG-3′PE9R91416–13975′-GGGATGTAATCCCTCAGGGTG-3′PE11F111833–18625′-AGCCATCGCCAGCAGGAGCGTGGCCGACAA-3′PE11R111794–17735′-GCAGAACTCCCTCCACTCATTG-3′PE12F122111–21405′-TGCCCATGGATGCCTTCCAAGTCGGCAAAT-3′PE15F152577–26065′-CGGAGGCTTCGCAGGTCTCACCTCGACGGT-3′PE15R152573–26035′-TCGAGGTGAGACCTGCGAAGCCTCCGATCA-3′PE17Ra172881–28515′-TTTGCCTGTGTTTGGAAAAGAGTCGTACGG-3′PE17Rb172793–27735′-TCTCGGCAGCCTGTGAGTATC-3′P-TPO4-F13-155′-GATGGGATTTCCAGCCTCCCCTCTGCAAAGACTCCGGGAGGCTCCCTCGG-3′P-TPO4-R15-135′-CCGAGGGAGCCTCCCGGAGTCTTTGCAGAGGGGAGGCTGGAAATCCCATC-3′P-TPO5-F7-95′-AACCCATGTTTTCCCATACAAATCATCACCCTGAGGGATTAC-3′P-TPO5-R9-75′-GTAATCCCTCAGGGTGATGATTTGTATGGGAAAACATGGGTT-3′ Open table in a new tab CHO cells (ECACC no. 85050302) were kept in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with pcDNA3-TPO4 or pcDNA3-TPO5. Cells were incubated in a saturated atmosphere (5% CO2/95% air) at 37 °C. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of geneticin (400 μg/ml) and subcloned using limiting dilutions. Positive TPO4 and TPO5 expressing cell lines were identified by performing Western blotting or immunoprecipitation after [35S](Met + Cys) labeling (EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A significant level of TPO1, TPO4, and TPO5 expression was obtained by growing TPO1-CHO, TPO4-CHO, and TPO5-CHO cell lines as described previously (15Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in cysteine- and methionine-free MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mmsodium butyrate, and 100 μCi/ml [35S](Met + Cys). The incubation was carried out for 5, 16, or 48 h. In the pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h in Cys- and Met-free MEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 10 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were then pulsed for 30 min in the presence of 100 μCi/ml [35S](Met + Cys). After the pulse, the labeling medium was removed, and the cell surface was washed three times with PBS and then replaced by Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 mm Met, and 5 mm Cys. Chases were performed for 30 min and 1, 3, 5, 16, and 24 h. After being metabolically labeled, cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested on ice by scraping them into 1 ml of PBS, and centrifuged at 200 ×g for 7 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 600 μl of TPO extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), vortexed every 2 min for 20 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Radiolabeled supernatants were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a pair of mAbs recognizing either a sequential region (mAb 47) or a conformational epitope (mAb 15) of the TPO molecule (16Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These mAbs were previously complexed with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) by incubating them overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then retrieved by performing a brief centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 s) and washed 4 times with 1 ml of TPO extraction buffer and once with 1 ml of PBS. Immunoprecipitated TPO was recovered from mAb-protein A-Sepharose 4B complexes by boiling the complexes for 5 min in 80 μl of electrophoresis buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol), and it was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Protein-associated radioactivity was detected and quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Fudjix BAS 1000). TPO was also immunoprecipitated with a panel of mAbs directed against various antigenic domains of the TPO1 molecule (16Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this experiment, [35S](Met + Cys)-radiolabeled CHO-TPO cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 25 °C with 50 μg of each of the TPO-mAbs previously complexed with protein A-Sepharose 4B. TPO1-, TPO4-, and TPO5-CHO confluent monolayers were metabolically labeled for 18 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S](Met + Cys) in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate, and cell surfaces were biotinylated as described previously (15Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and exposed to a 0.5 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 20 min at 4 °C. The cross-linker was removed, and the procedure was repeated once. The biotin reagent was quenched by incubating the preparation with 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested. To recover the immunoprecipitated antigens, the complexes were supplemented with 10 μl of 10% SDS, boiled for 5 min, diluted with 600 μl of TPO-extraction buffer, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 3 min). Supernatant containing the total TPO was incubated for 2 h with avidin-agarose (Pierce). Biotinylated surface TPO and intracellular TPO were separated by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 s). The beads were washed four times with TPO-extraction buffer and once with PBS, resuspended in electrophoresis buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Microsomal fraction pellets, prepared as described previously (7Niccoli P. Fayadat L. Paneels V. Lanet J. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29487-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), were solubilized by resuspending them in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm potassium iodide. Microsomes prepared from CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 were used as a negative control. Microsomal fractions were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 2 min), and the supernatant was used for the enzymatic assay. Extracts containing approximately the same amount of protein were added to 1 ml of 40 mm guaiacol (Fluka Chimie, St. Quentin-Fallavier, France) and 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was performed at room temperature and initiated by adding H2O2 to obtain a final concentration of 0.25 mm. Guaiacol oxidation was measured by absorbance at 470 nm and monitored spectrophotometrically every 15 s for 3 min. Cell surface enzymatic activity was assayed as in Ref. 17Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10533-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, with slight modifications. TPO1- and TPO4-CHO cells were incubated in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate and 20 μm hemin for 48 h. CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 alone or TPO1-CHO cells were used as a negative or positive control, respectively. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS before being incubated with BSA (5 mg/ml in PBS) and Na125I (106 cpm/ml), with or without 2 mm2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole, as the control medium. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2 to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The medium was then transferred to cold reaction tubes; the cell surface was washed out with 0.5 ml PBS, and the wash was added to the medium. Each tube was filled with 1 ml of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid supplemented with 10−4m KI, and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C before being centrifuged (2000 × g, 6 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the acid-insoluble iodinated material obtained was washed three times with 2 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The radioactivity remaining in the pellet was counted. A strategy was developed to search for new isoforms of hTPO. It is known that the various transcripts resulting from alternative splicing can have different lengths of the poly(A) tail (18Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, consequently, some isoforms cannot be detected by using oligo(dT)12–18during the RT experiments. In the present study, after extracting the total RNA from normal thyroid tissues, three different kind of primers were thus used in the first strand cDNA synthesis reaction depending on the experiment, namely random hexamers, GSPs, and oligo(dT)12–18. Random hexamers lead to the production of short cDNA fragments and can therefore be used to avoid secondary structure problems or when the mRNA has a short poly(A) tail. In the latter case, GSP can also be used. In the first set of experiments, which was designed to detect any alternative splicing between exons 9 and 17, reverse transcriptions were performed using random hexamers, and several different pairs of primers were then used in the PCR experiments. Two PCR products were obtained with one of these pairs located in exons 12 and 15, a band with an apparent size of 499 bp corresponding to the predicted full-sized mRNA of 493 bp and a smaller 375-bp band (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of the latter band showed that this was a 362-bp species from which exon 14 had been specifically deleted. This new variant of hTPO was named TPO4 (GenBankTM accession number AY136822). Exon 14 codes for an extracellular part of the protein near its transmembrane domain. This part of the protein corresponds exactly to its EGF-like domain (3Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Juxtaposing exons 13 and 15 did not induce any changes in the reading frame and the corresponding full-length cDNA codes for a protein consisting of 889 amino acids. To detect any alternative splicing occurring between exons 2 and 9, reverse transcription was performed using a GSP located in exon 9 (PE9R), and a PCR experiment was then performed using a pair of primers located in exons 2 and 9 (PE2F and PE9R). Two bands were obtained, one with an apparent size of 1330 bp corresponding to the predicted full-size cDNA of 1311 bp, and a smaller one with an apparent size of 785 bp (Fig. 2). This band was purified and sequenced and found to correspond to a 793-bp species from which exon 8 had been deleted. This variant was named TPO5 (GenBankTM accession number AF533528). Exon 8 codes for an extracellular part of the protein located in its myeloperoxidase-like domain. Juxtaposing exons 7 and 9 did not lead to any changes in the open reading frame, and the corresponding full-length protein codes for a protein of 760 amino acids. Two hypothetically crucial residues are spliced out in TPO5, namely Arg-396, which may participate in the catalytic mechanism underlying the formation of compound I, and Glu-399, which may covalently bind to the heme prosthetic group through ester linkage (19Taurog A. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Two potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-307 and Asn-342) are also spliced out. Contrary to what occurs in TPO5, the deleted exon in TPO4 mRNA codes for a whole domain (the EGF-like domain) that is not included in the main catalytic part of the molecule. It therefore seemed possible that this isoform might be active. We therefore examined the properties of the proteins corresponding to these two transcripts, focusing in particular on TPO4.Figure 2Identification of exon 8 deletion.Reverse-transcription was performed using the gene-specific primer PE9R, and TPO cDNAs were amplified by performing PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures” using PE2F and PE9R with an annealing temperature of 55 °C.

CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3-TPO4 or pcDNA3-TPO5, and several clones expressing significant levels of TPO4 or TPO5 were then isolated. After a metabolic labeling step using [35S](Met + Cys), immunoprecipitation was performed using the pair mAb15 + mAb47, and TPO4 and TPO5 showed up as bands with the predicted molecular weight on the SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3,A and B). To determine whether TPO4 has a modified three-dimensional structure in comparison with TPO1, we used a panel of 12 mAbs directed against hTPO. All of these mAbs except one, mAb47, were directed against conformational epitopes. TPO1- and TPO4-CHO cells were labeled for 16 h with [35S](Met + Cys), and, after the extraction step, immunoprecipitations were performed with each of the 12 mAbs (Fig. 4, A andB). TPO1 as well as TPO4 immunoreactivity was observed with all the mAbs. However, mAbs 1, 24, and 59 showed a slight decrease in immunoreactivity with TPO4 as compared with TPO1 (Fig. 4 C). This seems to indicate that most of the TPO4 fold correctly in comparison with TPO1 and that none of the mAbs used were directed against the EGF-like domain. To determine whether the small differences observed affect the global half-life of the TPO4 synthesized in CHO cells, we performed a pulse-chase experiment. Cells were pulsed for 30 min with [35S](Met + Cys) and then chased for various times. Immunoprecipitation of TPO was performed, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Quantification of these bands (Fig. 5) showed that TPO4 has a shorter half-life than TPO1, i.e. 5 versus 7.5 h. All of these events may affect the intracellular trafficking of TPO4 and hence its level of expression at the cell surface. To check whether TPO4 can reach the cell surface of the CHO cells, the cell surface expression of the two isoforms was determined after labeling CHO cells with [35S](Met + Cys) for 48 h and performing cell surface biotinylation (Fig. 6 A). Quantification of the bands obtained showed that 25% of the TPO1 and only 12% of the TPO4 were present at the cell surface (Fig. 6 B).Figure 5Rate of degradation of TPO1 and TPO4.Cells were pulsed for 30 min in the presence of 100μCi/ml of [35S](Met + Cys) in a Cys- and Met-free MEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

At the times indicated, after the extraction step, TPO from radiolabeled cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using the pair mAb 15 + mAb 47. Immunoprecipitated TPO1 (A) and TPO4 (B) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bands corresponding to TPO1 (○) and TPO4 (●) were quantified by phosphorimaging.

https://openalex.org/W2141199733,"Most peroxisomal enzymes are targeted to peroxisomes by virtue of a type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) at their extreme C terminus. PEX5 binds the PTS1 through its C-terminal 40-kDa tetratricopeptide repeat domain and is essential for import of PTS1-contining proteins into peroxisomes. Here we examined the PTS1-binding activity of purified, recombinant, full-length PEX5 using a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay. Like its C-terminal fragment, full-length tetrameric PEX5 exhibits high intrinsic affinity for the PTS1, with a K d of 35 nm for the peptide lissamine-Tyr-Gln-Ser-Lys-Leu-COO−. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by the fact that PEX5 had no detectable affinity for a peptide in which the Lys was replaced with Glu, a substitution that inactivates PTS1 signals in vivo. Hsp70 has been found to regulate the affinity of PEX5 for a PTS1-containing protein, but we found that the kinetics of PEX5-PTS1 binding was unaffected by Hsp70, Hsp70 plus ATP, or Hsp70 plus ADP. In addition, we found that another protein known to interact with the PTS1-binding domain of PEX5, the PEX12 zinc RING domain, also had no discernable effect on PEX5-PTS1 binding kinetics. Taken together, these results suggest that the initial step in peroxisomal protein import, the recognition of enzymes by PEX5, is a relatively simple process and that Hsp70 most probably stimulates this process by catalyzing the folding of newly synthesized peroxisomal enzymes and/or enhancing the accessibility of their PTS1.

Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Google Scholar). Peroxisomal matrix protein import is initiated when newly synthesized peroxisomal enzymes are bound by the peroxisomal matrix protein import receptors, PEX5 or PEX7 (2Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 623-652Google Scholar). These interactions usually require the presence of peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS)1 in the enzymes. Two classes of PTS are known, the PTS1 and PTS2, either of which is sufficient to direct proteins into the peroxisome lumen (3Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar, 4Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3244-3262Google Scholar). Most peroxisomal enzymes contain the PTS1, a 3-amino acid-long signal that functions only when present at the extreme C terminus of a protein. The canonical PTS1 is Ser-Lys-Leu-COO−, though conservative variants of this motif can also direct proteins into the peroxisome. While the vast majority of peroxisomal enzymes use the PTS1, a few use the PTS2, a nonapeptide of the sequence RLX 5HL, or a conservative variant that is found at or near the N terminus of these proteins.PEX5 binds the PTS1 and is thought to act as an import receptor, directing PTS1-containing proteins into the import pathway (5McCollum D. Monosov E. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 761-774Google Scholar). PEX5 is a predominantly cytoplasmic, partly peroxisomal protein that appears to shuttle between these compartments as it mediates the import of PTS1-containing proteins (6Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-124Google Scholar, 7Dodt G. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1763-1774Google Scholar). The dynamic behavior of PEX5 suggests a model of peroxisomal matrix protein import that involves receptor-docking factors, translocation factors, and receptor-recycling factors. Several other lines of evidence support this model, including the identification of other peroxins (peroxisomal import factors) that have specific roles in receptor docking, enzyme translocation, and receptor recycling (8Gould S.J. Valle D. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 340-344Google Scholar).A clear understanding of the initial molecular events in peroxisomal matrix protein import is likely to reveal important features of subsequent steps in the process (9Gould S.J. Collins C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 382-389Google Scholar). Toward this end, we recently determined the structure of a 40-kDa, C-terminal fragment of PEX5 bound to a PTS1-containing peptide (10Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Google Scholar). PEX5 uses nearly its entire C-terminal half to bind the PTS, with two triplets of the tetratricopeptide repeat making all of the contacts with the PTS1. This structure, combined with our biochemical analysis of PEX5-PTS1 binding, established that this fragment of PEX5 acts as a monomer and binds the PTS1 peptide with a 1:1 stoichiometry, displays an apparent affinity (K d) for the PTS1 peptide lissamine-Tyr-Gln-Ser-Lys-Leu-COO− of ∼20 nm, and binds the PTS1 in the absence of any cofactors (10Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Google Scholar). 2G. Gatto, E. L. Maynard, A. L. Guerrrio, B. V. Geisbrecht, S. J. Gould, and J. M. Berg, manuscript submitted.2G. Gatto, E. L. Maynard, A. L. Guerrrio, B. V. Geisbrecht, S. J. Gould, and J. M. Berg, manuscript submitted.Although the C-terminal half of PEX5 has intrinsic PTS1-binding activity, there is clearly a potential for accessory factors to promote or disrupt the PEX5-PTS1 interaction. For example, Harano et al. (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar) reported that Hsp70 binds to PEX5 and enhances the PEX5-PTS1 interaction. Furthermore, PEX5 appears to act catalytically, which implies the existence of a PEX5-PTS1 dissociation event and factors that promote PEX5-PTS1 dissociation. PEX12 is an integral peroxisomal membrane protein that is essential for peroxisomal matrix protein import and is one of only two peroxins known to interact with the ligand-binding domain of PEX5 (13Chang C.C. Warren D.S. Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 761-773Google Scholar). The other is PEX8, a peroxisomal membrane protein that terminates with a PTS1 even though it does not use the PTS1 for targeting to peroxisomes (14Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Google Scholar, 15Liu H. Tan X. Russell K.A. Veenhuis M. Cregg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10940-10951Google Scholar, 16Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W. Voorn-Brouwer T. Franse M.M. Distel B. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3593-3602Google Scholar). These properties suggest that PEX12 and PEX8 might also be regulators of PEX5-PTS1 binding. Although there are many possible mechanisms by which a regulator may alter the PEX5-PTS1 interaction, the simplest is that they bind to PEX5 and alter the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1. Here we characterized the interaction between full-length PEX5 and the PTS1. Our results demonstrate that full-length, tetrameric PEX5 has high intrinsic affinity for the PTS1. In addition, we show that Hsp70 and PEX12 have no effect on PEX5- PTS1 binding.DISCUSSIONMost peroxisomal matrix proteins contain the PTS1, are bound by PEX5 prior to their import, and are then released from PEX5 at some point during their translocation. It is therefore likely that peroxisomal protein import involves accessory factors that regulate the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1. Furthermore, full-length PEX5 is a homooligomeric protein (19Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Google Scholar) that displays intramolecular interactions (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar), making it possible that PEX5-PTS1 interactions are regulated, in part, by cooperativity in the binding reaction (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar). The present study extends our understanding of PEX5-PTS1 interactions by providing a detailed molecular analysis of the interactions between full-length PEX5 proteins and PTS1-containing peptides.We have shown here that full-length forms of PEX5 from both humans and the yeast P. pastoris have intrinsic PTS1 binding activity. These results eliminate the possibility that accessory factors are required for PEX5-PTS1 binding. We have also established that full-length PEX5 binds PTS1 peptides specifically and with high affinity. Full-length PEX5 proteins bind the PTS1 peptide with an affinity similar to that of the isolated ligand-binding domain of human PEX5 (K d of ∼35 nm). The actual avidity of PEX5 for PTS1-containing proteins is even higher since many peroxisomal enzymes are oligomeric and oligomerize prior to import (23McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1245-1257Google Scholar, 24Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10541-10545Google Scholar, 25Walton P. Hill P. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 675-683Google Scholar), and multidentate interaction may occur between tetrameric PEX5 and folded, oligomeric PTS1-containing proteins.One disadvantage of studying the interactions between PEX5 and PTS1-containing peptides is that it eliminates potentially important PEX5-protein interactions that occur outside of the PTS1-binding pocket. However, this is also an advantage, since it allows a quantitative assessment of whether and how different factors affect the affinity of PEX5 for just the PTS1. The power of this approach is evident from our analysis the effects of Hsp70 on PEX5-PTS1 binding. Harano et al. (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar) established that Hsp70 promotes the interaction of PEX5 with a PTS1-containing protein. However, Haranoet al. (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar) did not determine whether this was due to an effect on the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1 or the accessibility of the PTS1 on the PTS1-containing protein. Using our assay of PEX5-PTS1 peptide binding, we observed that PEX5 maintains the same affinity for the PTS1 regardless of whether Hsp70 is present and regardless of whether the reaction mixtures contain ATP or ADP. Taken together, our results and those of Harano et al. (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar) suggest that Hsp70 acts on the PTS1-containing protein, presumably to increase the accessibility of its PTS1, which is subsequently bound by PEX5 in an Hsp70-independent manner. This model is also consistent with the well established role for Hsp70 proteins in the initial folding of many proteins.The presumption that PEX5 acts catalytically predicts that the dissociation of PEX5-PTS1 complexes is an important and perhaps critical step in peroxisomal matrix protein import. It is possible that the PEX5-PTS1 interaction could be disrupted or inhibited by one or more PEX5-binding proteins, which might stabilize a form of PEX5 unable to bind the PTS1. Six peroxins are known to bind PEX5 (PEX7 (26Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S. Tanaka A. Kawai A. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21703-21714Google Scholar, 27Dodt G.

Here we found that a 4-fold molar excess of PEX12 did not alter the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1. Thus, if PEX12 does regulate PEX5-PTS1 interactions in vivo, the mechanism must involve additional factors not present in our in vitro assay. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess the effect of PEX8-PEX5 interactions on the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1 because we were unable to generate a form of soluble, recombinant PEX8 that would bind to purified PEX5. Although the present study has failed to identify a regulator of PEX5-PTS1 binding, it will be interesting to see if genetic screens and selections might be sensitive to such an activity and help us identify the factors that participate in this critical step in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Peroxisomes lack nucleic acids and import all of their protein content (1Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Google Scholar). Peroxisomal matrix protein import is initiated when newly synthesized peroxisomal enzymes are bound by the peroxisomal matrix protein import receptors, PEX5 or PEX7 (2Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 623-652Google Scholar). These interactions usually require the presence of peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS)1 in the enzymes. Two classes of PTS are known, the PTS1 and PTS2, either of which is sufficient to direct proteins into the peroxisome lumen (3Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar, 4Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3244-3262Google Scholar). Most peroxisomal enzymes contain the PTS1, a 3-amino acid-long signal that functions only when present at the extreme C terminus of a protein. The canonical PTS1 is Ser-Lys-Leu-COO−, though conservative variants of this motif can also direct proteins into the peroxisome. While the vast majority of peroxisomal enzymes use the PTS1, a few use the PTS2, a nonapeptide of the sequence RLX 5HL, or a conservative variant that is found at or near the N terminus of these proteins. PEX5 binds the PTS1 and is thought to act as an import receptor, directing PTS1-containing proteins into the import pathway (5McCollum D. Monosov E. Subramani S. J.

We have shown here that full-length forms of PEX5 from both humans and the yeast P. pastoris have intrinsic PTS1 binding activity. These results eliminate the possibility that accessory factors are required for PEX5-PTS1 binding. We have also established that full-length PEX5 binds PTS1 peptides specifically and with high affinity. Full-length PEX5 proteins bind the PTS1 peptide with an affinity similar to that of the isolated ligand-binding domain of human PEX5 (K d of ∼35 nm). The actual avidity of PEX5 for PTS1-containing proteins is even higher since many peroxisomal enzymes are oligomeric and oligomerize prior to import (23McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1245-1257Google Scholar, 24Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10541-10545Google Scholar, 25Walton P. Hill P. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 675-683Google Scholar), and multidentate interaction may occur between tetrameric PEX5 and folded, oligomeric PTS1-containing proteins. One disadvantage of studying the interactions between PEX5 and PTS1-containing peptides is that it eliminates potentially important PEX5-protein interactions that occur outside of the PTS1-binding pocket. However, this is also an advantage, since it allows a quantitative assessment of whether and how different factors affect the affinity of PEX5 for just the PTS1. The power of this approach is evident from our analysis the effects of Hsp70 on PEX5-PTS1 binding. Harano et al. (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar) established that Hsp70 promotes the interaction of PEX5 with a PTS1-containing protein. However, Haranoet al. (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar) did not determine whether this was due to an effect on the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1 or the accessibility of the PTS1 on the PTS1-containing protein. Using our assay of PEX5-PTS1 peptide binding, we observed that PEX5 maintains the same affinity for the PTS1 regardless of whether Hsp70 is present and regardless of whether the reaction mixtures contain ATP or ADP. Taken together, our results and those of Harano et al. (12Harano T. Nose S. Uezu R. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 157-165Google Scholar) suggest that Hsp70 acts on the PTS1-containing protein, presumably to increase the accessibility of its PTS1, which is subsequently bound by PEX5 in an Hsp70-independent manner. This model is also consistent with the well established role for Hsp70 proteins in the initial folding of many proteins. The presumption that PEX5 acts catalytically predicts that the dissociation of PEX5-PTS1 complexes is an important and perhaps critical step in peroxisomal matrix protein import. It is possible that the PEX5-PTS1 interaction could be disrupted or inhibited by one or more PEX5-binding proteins, which might stabilize a form of PEX5 unable to bind the PTS1. Six peroxins are known to bind PEX5 (PEX7 (26Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S. Tanaka A. Kawai A. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21703-21714Google Scholar, 27Dodt G.

Here we found that a 4-fold molar excess of PEX12 did not alter the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1. Thus, if PEX12 does regulate PEX5-PTS1 interactions in vivo, the mechanism must involve additional factors not present in our in vitro assay. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess the effect of PEX8-PEX5 interactions on the affinity of PEX5 for the PTS1 because we were unable to generate a form of soluble, recombinant PEX8 that would bind to purified PEX5. Although the present study has failed to identify a regulator of PEX5-PTS1 binding, it will be interesting to see if genetic screens and selections might be sensitive to such an activity and help us identify the factors that participate in this critical step in peroxisomal matrix protein import.

These results suggested a model in which the chaperone-like role of β2m is dependent on initial binding to the α3 domain interface of MHC1 with β2m. Such a model predicts that a mutant β2m molecule with an intact MHC1 α3 domain interaction but a defective MHC1 α1α2 domain interaction would block β2m-driven folding of MHC1. In this study we generated such a β2m mutant and demonstrated that it blocks MHC1 folding by normal β2m at the expected micromolar concentrations. Our data support an initial interaction of β2m with the MHC1 α3 domain in MHC1 folding. In addition, the dominant negative mutant β2m can block T-cell functional responses to antigenic peptide and MHC1.

Bodmer H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 601-624Google Scholar). The heavy chain of the MHC1 molecule can interact noncovalently with a number of other molecules in the formation of a CTL activating complex. These include the MHC1 light chain or β2m, the antigenic peptide fragment, the T-cell receptor (TCR), and the CD8 molecule (2Jones E.Y. Tormo J. Reid S.W. Stuart D.I. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 121-128Google Scholar). The specificity of the CTL response resides in the selective MHC1 binding of specific antigenic peptide fragments and in the TCR recognition of these antigenic peptides and MHC1 (3Germain R.N. Margulies D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 403-450Google Scholar, 4Ljunggren H.G. Thorpe C.J. Histol. Histopathol. 1996; 11: 267-274Google Scholar). The MHC1 contact surface for TCR and peptide binding is formed by the α1 and α2 domains of the three-domain MHC1 heavy chain (2Jones E.Y. Tormo J. Reid S.W. Stuart D.I. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 121-128Google Scholar, 5Ozato K. Evans G.A. Shykind B. Margulies D.H. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2040-2043Google Scholar, 6Bjorkman P.J.

Immunol. 1998; 16: 523-544Google Scholar). The MHC1 heavy chain α1 and α2 domains, as well as the immunoglobulin-like α3 domain, have been shown by x-ray crystallography (8Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Google Scholar) to interact with β2m, the nonpolymorphic component of the MHC1 complex. Mutations in the α1 (9Santos-Aguado J. Biro P.A. Fuhrmann U. Strominger J.L. Barbosa J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 982-990Google Scholar, 10Ribaudo R.K. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3481-3493Google Scholar) or α3 (11Salter R.D. Hum. Immunol. 1992; 35: 40-49Google Scholar) domains of the MHC1 heavy chain lead to changes in β2m binding. These studies demonstrate that the functional interaction of the MHC1 heavy chain with β2m occurs at multiple surfaces on different domains. In the absence of β2m, most MHC1 molecules are not expressed efficiently on the surface of cells (12Seong R.H. Clayberger C.A. Krensky A.M. Parnes J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 288-299Google Scholar, 13Zijlstra M. Bix M. Simister N.E. Loring J.M. Raulet D.H. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1990; 344: 742-746Google Scholar). Although some MHC1 molecules, such as murine H-2Ld and H-2Db, are transported to the cell surface without β2m, they have diminished levels of expression (14Allen H. Fraser J. Flyer D. Calvin S. Flavell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7447-7451Google Scholar, 15Bix M. Raulet D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 829-834Google Scholar). This decreased MHC1 expression is not simply because of an export requirement for fully assembled MHC1 complexes. Transfection of β2m-negative cells with ER-retained β2m was able to salvage MHC1 cell surface expression (16Solheim J.C. Johnson N.A. Carreno B.M. Lie W.R. Hansen T.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3011-3016Google Scholar). MHC1 folded in the presence of this ER-retained β2m was exported to the cell surface without bound β2m. Thus β2m, which promotes protein folding through a transient interaction, fits the definition of a chaperone (17Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Google Scholar). Therefore, β2m plays two roles in MHC1, first, as a structural subunit of the assembled complex and second, as a chaperone for the folding of the MHC1 heavy chain. A possible mechanism for β2m as a chaperone is facilitation of the interaction of MHC1 heavy chain with other chaperones, such as calreticulin, tapasin, transporter associated with antigen processing, and Erp57 (18Solheim J.C. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 11-19Google Scholar, 19Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Google Scholar). However, because β2m has been shown to promote stabilization or folding of MHC1 on the cell surface in the absence of ER chaperones (20Rock K.L. Gramm C. Benacerraf B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4200-4204Google Scholar, 21Otten G.R. Bikoff E. Ribaudo R.K. Kozlowski S. Margulies D.H. Germain R.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3723-3732Google Scholar), it is likely that β2m also has a direct effect on MHC1 folding. Although high concentrations of high affinity peptides can promote the folding of MHC1 in the absence of β2m (15Bix M. Raulet D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 829-834Google Scholar), these same peptides can stabilize MHC1 folded with β2m at significantly lower concentrations (22Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Elvin J. Townsend A. Nature. 1991; 351: 402-406Google Scholar, 23Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2085-2091Google Scholar). Therefore, with physiologic concentrations of high affinity peptides or any concentration of lower affinity peptides, β2m levels are limiting for the folding of MHC1 molecules. The two roles of β2m, as structural subunit and chaperone, do not depend equally on β2m concentration. β2m binds to MHC1 heavy chain with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) in the nanomolar range (24Hyafil F. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5834-5838Google Scholar, 25Parker K.C. Strominger J.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5543-5550Google Scholar, 26Hochman J.H. Shimizu Y. DeMars R.

Immunol. 1994; 39: 64-72Google Scholar) while it folds or stabilizes cell surface MHC1 at micromolar concentrations (20Rock K.L. Gramm C. Benacerraf B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4200-4204Google Scholar, 21Otten G.R. Bikoff E. Ribaudo R.K. Kozlowski S. Margulies D.H. Germain R.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3723-3732Google Scholar, 28Shields M.J. Moffat L.E. Ribaudo R.K. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 919-928Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously (29Whitman M.C. Strohmaier J. O'Boyle K. Tingem J.M. Wilkinson Y. Goldstein J. Chen T. Brorson K. Brunswick M. Kozlowski S. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 141-149Google Scholar) that human β2m (hβ2m) binds the isolated α3 domain of the MHC1 heavy chain with a K d in that same micromolar range and this binding has the same species dependence and thermodynamics as the β2m-driven refolding of the MHC1 heavy chain (30Hebert A.M. Strohmaier J. Whitman M.C. Chen T. Gubina E. Hill D.M. Lewis M.S. Kozlowski S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5233-5242Google Scholar). This suggested that β2m folding of the complete MHC1 heavy chain may be nucleated by a β2m-α3 interaction. Although the biochemical characteristics of folding match those of the predicted limiting initial β2m-α3 interaction (30Hebert A.M. Strohmaier J. Whitman M.C. Chen T. Gubina E. Hill D.M. Lewis M.S. Kozlowski S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5233-5242Google Scholar), it is formally possible that the similar binding characteristics of β2m-α3 binding and β2m folding of MHC1 are coincidental. To resolve this issue, we have generated β2m mutants with predicted defects in interactions with MHC1 α1/α2 domains and evaluated the mutant β2m effects on native β2m-driven folding of MHC1. Because the β2m-driven folding of the α1 and α2 domains is likely to be dependent on the β2m-α1/α2 interaction, many possible models would predict poor folding of MHC1 by these mutants. However, if the initial limiting interaction of β2m were with the α3 domain, these β2m mutants would still have an intact initial interaction and be able to compete with native β2m for this initial interaction. Thus β2m mutants with diminished α1/α2 interactions would be competitive inhibitors of native β2m-driven MHC1 folding. Although such a mutant β2m protein would be predicted to inhibit extracellular MHC1 folding, its design and mode of inhibition are similar to dominant negative mutations used in the study of intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal structures (31Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Google Scholar, 32Perlmutter R.M. Alberola-Ila J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 285-290Google Scholar). It would be expected that this dominant negative effect on MHC1 folding would have a concentration dependence similar to that of the β2m-α3 interaction. The H-2Dd α3 domain sequence was generated by PCR amplification of an H-Dd cDNA as described previously (29Whitman M.C. Strohmaier J. O'Boyle K. Tingem J.M. Wilkinson Y. Goldstein J. Chen T. Brorson K. Brunswick M. Kozlowski S. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 141-149Google Scholar) with the upper primer ACTCCATGGCAACAGATCCCCCAAAGGCCC and the lower primer GATGAATTCGACCCGGAAGGAGGAGGTTC. The α3 domain sequence was inserted between the NcoI andEcoR1 sites of a modified pET21d vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The vector was modified by ligating a synthetic oligonucleotide (GAGGAATTCTGGAATTTCGCAAGCTGTACATGCTGCACACGCTGAAATTAACGAAGCAGGAAGAGCACTCGAGCAC) between the EcoR1 and XhoI sites of the pET21d bacterial expression vector. The completed construct had the correct sequence and when transfected and induced, generated a 15-kDa fusion protein consisting of the H-Dd α3 domain fused to vector expressed sequence, a 17-amino acid peptide sequence from ovalbumin, and a polyhistidine tag. The expression construct was transfected into BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen, Madison, WI). 400-ml cultures of transfected bacteria in LB broth with 200 μg/ml carbenicillin (Sigma) were grown to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. The cultures were then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), and the cells were harvested by centrifugation after overnight induction at 28 °C. The bacteria were washed with PBS, and the pellet was frozen at −70 °C. The frozen pellet was thawed in 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). After addition of imidazole (Sigma) to a concentration of 5 mm and Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to a concentration of 1%, the bacteria were sonicated in a Brinkmann homogenizer (Brinkmann, Westbury, CT) for 3 × 30 s at a setting of 4. The homogenate was treated with ∼500 units of Benzonase (Sigma) in the presence of 5 mm MgCl. Inclusion bodies were pelleted by spinning at 15,000 × g, and the soluble fraction was loaded on to buffer-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was washed three times with 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X 100, 5 mm imidazole buffer and then three times with 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, buffer. The fusion protein was eluted with high concentration imidazole (150 to 500 mm). The imidazole was removed by dialysis, and the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. The protein concentration was measured by 280-nm absorbance. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was calculated from the primary amino acid sequence (33Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). The recombinant native hβ2m was expressed using a construct in a PET21d vector generously supplied by Randall K. Ribaudo (34Shields M.J. Assefi N. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307Google Scholar, 35Shields M.J. Kubota R. Hodgson W. Jacobson S. Biddison W.E. Ribaudo R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28010-28018Google Scholar). Mutant hβ2m genes were generated by PCR with the Pfu-1 polymerase (Stratagene) using splice overlap extension (36Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535Google Scholar) with mutant oligonucleotides. The D53K mutation was generated with the upper GGAGCATTCAAAATTGTCTTTCA oligonucleotide primer (the base pairs in mutated codons are underlined) and a complementary lower primer. The D53R mutation was generated with the upper GGAGCATTCAAGATTGTCTTTCA oligonucleotide primer and a complementary lower primer. The W60A mutation was generated with the upper ATAGAAAGACGCGTCCTTGCT oligonucleotide primer and a complementary lower primer. The hβ2m upper GACGGAGCTCGAATTCGGATC primer and hβ2m lower AGGAGATATATCATGATCCAGCGT primer were used with the corresponding mutant oligos to amplify the mutated gene fragments in the first amplification step and for generating an intact gene the second amplification step. The intact gene fragments were digested withBspHI and BamHI and ligated into PET21d vector that was digested with NcoI and BamHI. Double mutants such as W60A/D53K were sequentially generated using the same process. The mutant genes were verified by sequencing. The constructs were transfected into BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen). 100-ml cultures of transfected bacteria in LB broth with 250 μg/ml carbenicillin with were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and washed and resuspended with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, with 2 mmEDTA. Lysozyme (Sigma) was added at 0.5 mg/ml, and the bacteria were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Deoxycholate was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the mixture was sonicated on a Brinkmann homogenizer for 4 × 30 s. The inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, and the soluble fraction was discarded. Inclusion bodies were washed three times with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, with 2 mm EDTA and 0.1% deoxycholate followed by a wash with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA. The pellet was resuspended with 2 ml of 6m guanidine HCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA. The dissolved protein was added to 50 ml of pre-chilled 0.4 m arginine, 0.1 m Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmoxidized glutathione, 0.5 mm reduced glutathione and left to refold in the cold room with gentle agitation for a minimum of 3 days. The protein was then dialyzed against 1 liter of HEPES-buffered saline, 3 mm EDTA three times and then concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell and MicroSep 3K omega filters (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). The concentrated β2m was then purified by size exclusion chromatography. Both native and mutant β2m were purified in the same manner. The protein concentrations were measured by 280-nm absorbance. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was calculated from the primary amino acid sequence (33Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). For β2m and for H-2Dd α3 domain purification, 500–1000 μl of protein was loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia LKB, AmershamBiosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) using the P-500 pump (Pharmacia LKB) at 0.5 ml/min buffer. Half-ml fractions were collected, and the protein concentration was determined by 280-nm absorbance. Protein used for surface plasmon resonance experiments was purified in HBS-EP buffer (HEPES-buffered saline with 3 mm EDTA and 0.005% polysorbate 20) or PBS. Proteins used in flow cytometry and functional experiments were purified in PBS. Anti-tetra His antibody was purchased from Qiagen. An anti-H-2Dd antibody (34.5.8S), an anti-H-2Kd antibody (SF1–1.1), and an IgG2aκ control antibody were purchased from Pharmingen. The LKD8 cell line, a peptide transport-deficient EE2H3 embryonic cell line transfected with H-2Dd (37Bikoff E.K. Otten G.R. Robertson E.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1997-2004Google Scholar), was the generous gift of David H. Margulies (NIH, Bethesda, MD). RMAs-Kd, a peptide transport-deficient cell line transfected with H-2Kd (38Chen W.

The B4.2.3 T-cell hybridoma (reactive with gp160 p18-I10 in the context of H-2Dd) and H-2Dd L-cell transfectant cell lines were also used (39Kozlowski S. Takeshita T. Boehncke W.H. Takahashi H.

Houghten R. Cornette J.L. DeLisi C. Moss B. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3105-3109Google Scholar), 15–12, and its control cell line, 18neo, were generously provided by Jay A. Berzofsky (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The p18-I10 peptide (RGPGRAFVTI) (41Kozlowski S. Corr M. Takeshita T. Boyd L.F. Pendleton C.D. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Margulies D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1417-1422Google Scholar, 42Takeshita T. Takahashi H. Kozlowski S. Ahlers J.D.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 1973-1986Google Scholar) was obtained from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Facility for Biotechnology Resources (Bethesda, MD). The peptide was synthesized on an ABI 433 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis (Voyager; Applied Biosystems). All SPR experiments were performed on the BIAcore 3000 biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Anti-His antibody, diluted in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, was covalently coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix on a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB) by using the amine coupling kit as described previously (43Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in HBS-EP buffer, and regeneration of the anti-His surface was achieved with 20 mm HCl. Equilibrium binding data for β2m were obtained by averaging a 5–10-s interval of normalized signal after reaching equilibrium. The normalized signal was obtained by subtracting the control surface signal from α3 surface signal. The equilibrium binding data was analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting of the Langmuir isotherm to the data. The curve fitting was performed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB). β2m and β2m mutants were titrated at the indicated concentrations in 24- or 12-well tissue culture plates containing 1 or 2 ml of OPTI-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with 0.5% BSA (Sigma) and 0.5 × 106LKD8 cells (for H-2Dd folding) or 0.5 × 106 RMAs-Kd cells (for H-2Kdfolding) per well. The assay was carried out in a 7.5% CO2incubator at 26–28 °C for low temperature-induced folding or at 37 °C, with the indicated concentration of peptide, for peptide-induced folding. After an overnight incubation, the cells were spun down at 4 °C. One-half μg of the biotinylated anti-H-2Dd antibody, 34.5.8S (Pharmingen), or biotinylated anti-H-2Kd antibody, SF1–1.1 (Pharmingen), was added to the cells. Cells receiving no primary antibody or a biotinylated isotype-matched antibody (Pharmingen) were used as controls. After an hour of incubation on ice, the cells were washed with 0.5% BSA/OPTI-MEM medium and then 50 μl of streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pharmingen), diluted 1:50 in 0.5% BSA/OPTI-MEM, was added to the cells for an additional 30-min incubation on ice. The cells were then washed with 0.5% BSA/OPTI-MEM and analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. The cells were size-gated, and generally 2,500 to 10,000 cells were counted for each data point. Data analysis was performed using Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences). β2m and β2m mutants were added at the indicated concentrations to wells in 96-well round bottom tissue culture plates with 3.6 × 105 of the APC. The p18-I10 peptide was added as indicated to wells. The final volume was 200 μl/well of three parts 5% BSA/OPTI-MEM and one part PBS. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2, the cells were washed two times with 5% BSA/OPTI-MEM and resuspended in 150 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml penicillin), and 5 × 10−5m β-mercaptoethanol (complete medium). Fifty μl of washed APC were titrated by threes into 100 μl of complete medium in 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates as indicated. B4.2.3 T-cells were added at the indicated concentrations in 50 μl of complete medium, and the plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2. For IL2 cytokine determinations, 25 μl of culture supernatants were assayed with commercially available kits (Endogen, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and tetramethylbenzidine (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) were used as developers. The absorbance was read on a Bio-Rad model 3550 microplate reader (Hercules, CA) at 655 nm with background subtraction. Cytokine standards were run with each experiment. A linear fit of these IL2 standard values was used to extrapolate the scales for IL2 levels. In some experiments the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3–6 h and harvested and counted to assess growth inhibition (44Ashwell J.D. Cunningham R.E. Noguchi P.D. Hernandez D. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 173-194Google Scholar). Human and murine β2m are ∼70% homologous (34Shields M.J. Assefi N. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307Google Scholar), and critical β2m contact residues with MHC1 heavy chain are conserved (8Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Google Scholar). Human β2m is more effective than murine β2m at folding murine MHC1 heavy chain and at binding an MHC1 α3 domain (30Hebert A.M. Strohmaier J. Whitman M.C. Chen T. Gubina E. Hill D.M. Lewis M.S. Kozlowski S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5233-5242Google Scholar). Because hβ2m has a higher affinity for an MHC1 α3 domain than murine β2m, we chose to mutate hβ2m. This higher affinity for MHC1 α3 would predictably lower the concentration necessary to observe a mutant dominant negative effect. We limited our mutation of β2m residues to those that interact with the α1 and α2 interface of the MHC1 heavy chain in MHC1 crystal structures. HLA-A2 and H-2Dd MHC1 crystal structures (8Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Google Scholar, 45Li H. Natarajan K. Malchiodi E.L. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 179-191Google Scholar) implicate the tryptophan at position 60 of β2m as a critical residue for multiple contacts between β2m and the α2 domain of the MHC1 heavy chain. Mutations of β2m at position 60 have also been shown to interfere with β2m exchange onto MHC1 (46Fukazawa T. Hermann E. Edidin M. Wen J. Huang F. Kellner H. Floege J. Farahmandian D. Williams K.M. Yu D.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3543-3550Google Scholar). To create a defect in β2m folding of MHC1, we mutated the tryptophan at β2m position 60 to an alanine residue, a non-conservative change. The HLA-A2 MHC1 crystal structure also predicts a number of interactions between the aspartate at position 53 of β2m and residues of the α1 domain of the MHC1 heavy chain. However, crystal structures of H-2Dd (45Li H. Natarajan K. Malchiodi E.L. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 179-191Google Scholar, 47Achour A. Persson K. Harris R.A. Sundback J. Sentman C.L. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Karre K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 199-208Google Scholar, 48Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Google Scholar, 49Shields M.J. Hodgson W. Ribaudo R.K. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 561-573Google Scholar) suggest weaker interactions between the aspartate at position 53 of β2m and the α1 domain. Despite this, a previous study (34Shields M.J. Assefi N. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307Google Scholar) has demonstrated that changing the negatively charged aspartate residue at position 53 to a neutral valine decreased the ability of hβ2m to fold murine MHC1 molecules, including H-2Dd. Based on this study, we generated charge reversal mutants, changing position 53 of β2m to positively charged lysine or arginine, predicting that these mutants would have greater defects in MHC1 folding than the neutral D53V mutation. In addition, we generated a β2m mutant with non-conservative changes at both positions, 60 and 53. Based on amino acid sequence data, these residues are conserved across murine and human β2m molecules (8Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Google Scholar). The locations of the two sites we mutated in β2m, as related to an example MHC1 crystal structure (50Garboczi D.N. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 581-587Google Scholar), are illustrated in Fig.1. Based on structural data, our β2m mutants at positions 60 and 53 are likely to be defective in their interactions with MHC1 α1/α2 and not MHC1 α3. However, to rule out an unexpected global effect of the mutations, we verified that the mutant β2m-α3 interactions were not compromised. We expressed the β2m proteins using constructs in bacterial expression vectors (34Shields M.J. Assefi N. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307Google Scholar, 35Shields M.J. Kubota R. Hodgson W. Jacobson S. Biddison W.E. Ribaudo R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28010-28018Google Scholar). Purified mutant β2m molecules were evaluated for binding to isolated MHC1 H-2Dd α3 domain molecules using a biosensor for SPR (30Hebert A.M. Strohmaier J. Whitman M.C. Chen T. Gubina E. Hill D.M. Lewis M.S. Kozlowski S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5233-5242Google Scholar). Antibody to the polyhistidine tail of the α3 protein was directly coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a biosensor chip, allowing for the capture of α3 protein on this surface. β2m molecules were injected across the surface of the immobilized α3 protein, and the binding was assessed by mass-related changes in the sensor chip matrix refractive index and quantified as response units (RU). β2m was also injected across a control surface consisting of the directly coupled capture antibody without α3 protein. We injected a control protein, ovalbumin, and there was no detectable α3 domain binding (data not shown). This experimental system was sensitive to a 2-fold difference in affinity between human and mouse β2m (30Hebert A.M. Strohmaier J. Whitman M.C. Chen T. Gubina E. Hill D.M. Lewis M.S. Kozlowski S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5233-5242Google Scholar). This allowed protein concentration effects on the refractive index response to be subtracted out. An example of such an SPR experiment with the W60A/D53K double mutant β2m is shown in Fig.2 A. The responses of the α3 domain and control surfaces were normalized to each other immediately prior to the injection of the β2m to allow comparison of the active and control surfaces in this figure. Increasing concentrations of β2m were then evaluated for binding to purified monomeric α3 domains. The binding curves after subtraction of the control surface are shown in Fig. 2 B. Equilibrium values taken from the subtracted data were used to generate the plot in Fig. 2 C. This plot was fit with the nonlinear Langmuir isotherm for calculation of the equilibrium binding constant. The equilibrium constants for α3 binding were generated in this manner from three experiments with each of the β2m proteins and are shown in TableI."

Oncogenic v-Myb alterations include N- and C-terminal deletions as well as point mutations. Whereas truncations in Myb cause loss of various protein modifications, none of the point mutations in v-Myb has been directly linked to protein modifications. Here we show that the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb can be phosphorylated on serine 116 by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Phosphorylation of Ser116 differentially destabilizes a subtype of c-Myb-DNA complexes. The V117D mutation of the AMV v-Myb oncoprotein abolishes phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser116 residue. Modification of Ser116 was also detected in live cells in c-Myb, but not in AMV v-Myb. Phosphorylation-mimicking mutants of c-Myb failed to activate the resident mim-1 gene. Our data imply that protein kinase A or a kinase with similar specificity negatively regulates c-Myb function, including collaboration with C/EBP, and that the leukemogenic AMV v-Myb version evades inactivation by a point mutation that abolishes a phosphoacceptor consensus site. This suggests a novel link between Myb, a signal transduction pathway, cooperativity with C/EBP, and a point mutation in the myboncogene.

The c-Myb protein consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD),1 a central transactivation domain, and a C-terminal negative regulatory domain. The DBD of c-Myb is composed of the three imperfect repeats R1, R2, and R3, each related to the helix-turn-helix motif (5Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P.

R1 is deleted in v-Myb, and the R2 and R3 repeats are sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding (hereafter termed the minimal DNA-binding domain (mDBD)). This prototype Myb mDBD is highly conserved throughout evolution in the animal and plant kingdoms (8Rosinski J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol.

The c-Myb protein has also been reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues in developing embryos and/or in adult tissues such as tooth buds, retina, and epithelium of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and skin (16Ess K.C. Witte D.P. Bascomb C.P. Aronow B.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Desbiens X. Queva C. Jaffredo T. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B.

Consistent with this expression pattern, c-Myb was found to be required for colon development in mice (20Zorbas M. Sicurella C. Bertoncello I. Venter D. Ellis S. Mucenski M.L. Ramsay R.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5821-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Activated forms of c-Myb have been associated with cancer in animal models (21Introna M. Golay J. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In mice, retroviral insertions may result in N-terminal truncation of the c-Myb protein and deregulated expression, leading to myeloid leukemia (22Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In chickens, the two retroviruses AMV and E26, which carry truncated Myb proteins, elicit myeloid leukemia and erythroblastosis/stem cell leukemia, respectively (reviewed in Ref.23Lipsick J.S. Wang D.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These viruses encode the v-Myb proteins p48v- myb (AMV-derived) and the Myb-Ets fusion protein p135 gag-myb-ets (E26-derived), respectively. Both v-Myb proteins are truncated in the N- and C-terminal ends. In addition, the p48v- myb protein carries 10 point mutations relative to c-Myb (23Lipsick J.S. Wang D.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).AMV v-Myb has been an instructive model for understanding oncogenic activation and the normal function of c-Myb. AMV v-myb is a potent oncogene that induces monocytic leukemia after very short latency (24Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of AMV v-Myb is its cell type specificity, inducing transformation of the macrophage lineage (23Lipsick J.S. Wang D.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since the oncogenic alterations include both N- and C-terminal deletions as well as point mutations, AMV v-Myb probably utilizes multiple mechanisms that synergize in oncogenicity and cell type specificity.Although the cellular phenotypes induced by AMV v-Myb are well characterized, much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanisms involved. Several studies have attempted to define oncogenic determinants of v-myb. These studies have revealed that the N- and C-terminal deletions remove several sites of protein modification. The v-Myb protein lacks N-terminal CK2 phosphorylation sites (Ser11 and Ser12) present in the wild type protein. Phosphorylation of these sites reduced specific DNA binding (25Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Substitution of the two serines to alanines increased the transcriptional activity on both the mim-1 and neutrophil elastase promoters (26Oelgeschlager M. Krieg J. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, loss of the CK2 sites is not sufficient to turn myb into an oncogene (27Dini P.W. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7334-7348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Jiang W. Kanter M.R. Dunkel I. Ramsay R.G. Beemon K.L. Hayward W.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site (Ser528) in the C-terminal negative regulatory domain is also deleted in AMV v-Myb. Substitution of this serine to alanine increased the transcriptional capacity of c-Myb on some promoters but not on others (29Aziz N. Miglarese M.R. Hendrickson R.C. Shabanowitz J. Sturgill T.W.

PKA phosphorylation of Ser8 in the N terminus resulted in partial inhibition of DNA binding (32Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2235-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of Ser116 in the DNA-binding domain was suggested to have no effect on DNA binding (33Ramsay R.G. Morrice N. Van Eeden P. Kanagasundaram V. Nomura T., De Blaquiere J. Ishii S. Wettenhall R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2113-2120PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, c-Myb was found to be acetylated within the C-terminal negative regulatory domain by the histone acetyltransferases p300 and CREB-binding protein both in vitro and in vivo(34Tomita A.

The modification sites were mapped to positions Lys438 and Lys441 in mouse c-Myb and to Lys471, Lys480, and Lys485 in human c-Myb. The corresponding residues in chicken c-Myb (Lys443and Lys446 and Lys472, Lys481, and Lys486) are all deleted in AMV v-Myb. The truncations in AMV v-Myb may also cause changes in protein-protein interactions. The N-terminal deletion permitted cyclin D to inhibit transcriptional activation in a CDK-independent fashion (36Ganter B., Fu, S.L. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The AMV-specific point mutations in the second repeat R2 of the v-Myb DBD perturb normal Myb functions through altered protein-protein interactions (37Tahirov T.H.

In addition, the point mutations determine the target genes Myb regulates and the proteins it interacts with (39Introna M. Golay J. Frampton J. Nakano T. Ness S.A. Graf T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1289-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A.

Cell. 1998; 1: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the v-Myb DBD has accumulated gain- and loss-of-function mutations to escape regulation during proliferation and differentiation (40Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A. Cell. 1997; 91: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Although point mutations in the AMV v-Myb DBD have been linked to alterations in function and protein-protein interactions, none of them has been found to affect Myb protein modifications. The fact that one of the mutations, V117D, is located adjacent to a reported phosphorylation site for protein kinase A (PKA) (33Ramsay R.G. Morrice N. Van Eeden P. Kanagasundaram V. Nomura T., De Blaquiere J. Ishii S. Wettenhall R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2113-2120PubMed Google Scholar) led us to reexamine phosphorylation at Ser116. We found that Ser116 was phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and that this modification strongly affected the ability of c-Myb to bind to a subgroup of Myb recognition elements (MRE) in vitro. Phosphorylation of the Ser116 site is abrogated in oncogenic AMV v-Myb, due to the V117D mutation adjacent to Ser116. We developed a phospho-c-Myb (Ser116)-specific antibody to demonstrate the presence of this modification in c-Myb and its absence in AMV v-Myb in cells. Furthermore, a mutant c-Myb protein (S116D, phosphorylation mimic) failed to cooperate with NF-M (C/EBPβ) in the activation of the resident mim-1 gene. These findings implicate PKA or a kinase with similar specificity in a novel type of regulation of c-Myb function from which v-Myb has escaped.DISCUSSIONHere we show that c-Myb is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA on Ser116 in the DNA-binding domain. Phosphorylation of wild type (Ser116) mDBD severely affects binding of Myb to DNA. Phosphorylation of Myb at Ser116 by PKA or by a kinase with similar specificity may link the proto-oncoprotein to a novel regulatory signal transduction pathway. A specific point mutation of the AMV oncogene (V117D) abolishes phosphorylation at Ser116, implying that escape from such a pathway contributes to leukemogenicity.AMV v-Myb carries 10 point mutations in comparison with c-Myb (23Lipsick J.S. Wang D.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Four of these mutations are conservative replacements (I181V, V267I, V270I, and R438K) and hence not primary candidates for altered structure or function. Two mutations (L199P and L207P) introduce additional prolines in a P-rich putative linker region between the DBD and transactivation domain. Of the remaining four mutations (I91N, L106H, V117D, and N285T), those located in the DBD all have been identified as important for the transformed phenotype (39Introna M. Golay J. Frampton J. Nakano T. Ness S.A. Graf T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1289-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of c-Myb DBD, AMV DBD, C/EBPβ, and DNA complexes confirm the importance of both the I91N and L106H mutations. These mutations break specific contacts with the C/EBPβ transcription factor, contribute to a shift in the α2 helix in the R2 domain, and weaken the interaction with the DNA phosphate backbone (37Tahirov T.H. Sato K. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Sasaki M. Inoue-Bungo T. Shiina M. Kimura K. Takata S. Fujikawa A. Morii H. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Ishii S. Ogata K. Cell. 2002; 108: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The question about the significance of the third point mutation at position 117, however, remained to be solved.The concerted function of the three mutations has been linked to both gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes of AMV v-Myb and to signaling pathways (40Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A. Cell. 1997; 91: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis showed that position 117 lies in a consensus site (RRX(S/T)Y) for PKA phosphorylation and that this consensus site actually represents a high affinity substrate for PKA with a K m of ∼10 μm (45Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 61Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the PKA consensus sequence and the phosphoacceptor function are lost in v-Myb, due to the adjacent V117D mutation. A similar PKA consensus site in A-Myb (KRWS111L) differs from the c-Myb Ser116 site (KRWS116V) only in the +1-position and was not efficiently phosphorylated by PKA (56Bergholtz S. Andersen T.O. Andersson K.B. Borrebaek J. Luscher B. Gabrielsen O.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3546-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the amino acid present in the neighboring residues outside of the established consensus PKA site (45Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) influences the ability to function as a bona fidePKA target site.Ramsay et al. (33Ramsay R.G. Morrice N. Van Eeden P. Kanagasundaram V. Nomura T., De Blaquiere J. Ishii S. Wettenhall R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2113-2120PubMed Google Scholar) located two PKA phosphorylation sites in c-Myb by phosphopeptide mapping of a C-terminal truncated c-Myb protein, revealing Ser8 and Ser116 as substrates for PKA in vitro. However, in contrast to our observations, no functional effects of the phosphorylation of Ser116 were reported. Our data show that phosphorylation of Ser116 has biochemical and functional consequences. Phosphorylation of Ser116 destabilizes Myb binding to DNA, and a S116D phosphorylation mimic protein failed to activate the resident mim-1 gene. Whether this effect is due to destabilization of DNA interaction or loss of cooperativity with C/EBP is currently difficult to resolve. However, we can infer that the loss of function of AMV v-Myb to cooperate with C/EBP is at least in part due to the mutation at V117D. Back-mutation of D117V in AMV v-Myb regained some of the functional C/EBP/Myb-dependent gene activation, while constitutive activation of GBX2 was severely diminished (40Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A. Cell. 1997; 91: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This back-mutation also changed the transformed phenotype toward the granulocytic lineage and displayed reduced leukemogenicity in retroviral transformation studies (39Introna M. Golay J. Frampton J. Nakano T. Ness S.A. Graf T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1289-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the reciprocal single mutation V117D in the wild type Myb setting was not sufficient to abrogate C/EBP collaboration entirely or to induce constitutive GBX2 activation. 2E. Kowenz-Leutz and A. Leutz, unpublished observations. This is in keeping with the recent structural data, where Ile91 and Leu106 in wild type c-Myb directly interacted with C/EBPβ, whereas Val117 indirectly affects C/EBP interaction (37Tahirov T.H. Sato K. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Sasaki M. Inoue-Bungo T. Shiina M. Kimura K. Takata S. Fujikawa A. Morii H. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Ishii S. Ogata K. Cell. 2002; 108: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the point mutation at V117D required the other R2 v-Myb mutations to achieve the complete v-Myb phenotype. Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphorylation at Ser116 or abrogation of this phosphoacceptor site by the AMV v-Myb-specific mutation has multiple effects on Myb function, including a direct influence on the interaction of the DBD of Myb with its co-factors.Our data show that phosphorylation at Ser116 leads to decreased binding of Myb to MREs. The destabilization of the Myb-DNA complex upon PKA phosphorylation could be a consequence of electrostatic repulsion, since the Ser116 residue is in close proximity to the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone (Fig. 1 C). However, additional effects of the introduced phosphate may be postulated, since a substitution of Ser116 with aspartic acid or glutamic acid to mimic a negative charge in this position showed a less profound inhibition of DNA binding compared with phosphorylated mDBD. Additional effects of the phosphate group could be either steric hindrance and/or an effect on the conformational transition that occurs upon DNA binding.PKA has been reported to exert a negative effect on the DNA binding activity of several transcription factors that contain a PKA-phosphorylation site located within or close to their DNA binding domain, such as the transcription enhancer factor TEF-1 (62Gupta M.P. Kogut P. Gupta M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3168-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the Wilms' tumor gene product WT1 (63Sakamoto Y. Yoshida M. Semba K. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2001-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A peculiar feature of the negative effect on complex stability observed with c-Myb was that the severity of the inhibition depends on the particular MRE sequence. The experiments were performed with mDBD domains due the inaccessibility of purified full-length c-Myb. Nevertheless, we have previously reported that there are only subtle differences observed in in vitroassays between the DNA sequence preference of the mDBD and full-length c-Myb expressed in COS cell lysates (48Andersson K.B. Berge T. Matre V. Gabrielsen O.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21986-21994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that conclusions drawn from experiments with the mDBD are applicable to the full-length protein. Hence, our data are consistent with the notion that Ser116 phosphorylation might down-modulate Myb target genes in a differential fashion and thus alter the spectrum of genes activated by c-Myb in vivo. We showed that the accessibility of the Ser116 phosphorylation site depends on the interaction of Myb with specific target sites, a phenomenon consistent with a reported conformational transition of the DBD upon binding to DNA (43Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that only the pool of c-Myb that is not bound to DNA is accessible to specific phosphorylation on Ser116. This could severely limit the window in which c-Myb acts as a kinase substrate.The development of a specific phospho-c-Myb (Ser116) antibody demonstrated that a fraction of c-Myb is phosphorylated at this particular site in live cells. In an approach to determine the consequences of Myb Ser116 phosphorylation in cells, we cotransfected an expression vector encoding the catalytic subunit of PKA. However, overexpression of PKA has effects on Myb as well as on C/EBP target genes (data not shown), making such experiments difficult to interpret. It should be emphasized, however, that although PKA phosphorylates Ser116 in vitro and although phospho-Ser116 can be detected in vivo, we do not imply that PKA is the relevant kinase in vivo. It is equally conceivable that different kinases with similar recognition peptide specificities are involved in regulating c-Myb functionsin vivo. Such kinases still have to be identified.The AMV v-Myb displays both gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes due to the combined action of the DBD mutations (40Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A. Cell. 1997; 91: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Induction ofGBX2 expression by the c-Myb protein requires activation of an upstream signaling cascade, whereas the mutations in the DNA binding domain of AMV-Myb render the protein independent of such signaling events (40Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A. Cell. 1997; 91: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although there is currently no evidence that phosphorylation of Ser116 is involved directly in GBX2 activation, it is possible that stabilization of v-Myb DNA binding contributes to the activation of distinct Myb target genes. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Ser116 might affect protein-protein interactions such as with co-activators or co-repressors. Finally, this phosphorylation might affect other processes linked to gene regulation such as removal of transcriptional activation to prevent constitutive gene expression (64Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 65Husi H. Grant S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 259-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 66Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).What could be the role of PKA regulation of c-Myb in the hematopoietic system? It is well known that whereas cAMP usually is mitogenic and a stimulator of hormone secretion in endocrine cells, it generally delivers an “off”-signal for proliferation in cells of the immune system (67Kammer G.M. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 222-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 68Naderi S. Gutzkow K.B. Christoffersen J. Smeland E.B. Blomhoff H.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, a PKA-induced decrease in the activity of c-Myb, a factor associated with proliferation, would be a consistent response in immune cells. Among the targets of c-Myb in T-cells is the RAG-2 (69Wang Q.F. Lauring J. Schlissel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9203-9211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a protein required for recombination of B and T cell antigen receptor chains. It is intriguing that the rearrangement of the TCRαβ locus is completely inhibited upon activation of the cAMP signaling pathway (70Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Ceredig R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that one of the components of the V(D)J recombinase is also a bona fide Myb target, having an MRE sequence of the PKA-sensitive type (TAACTG) (69Wang Q.F. Lauring J. Schlissel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9203-9211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Whether PKA inhibition of c-Myb contributes to this effect and whether and how other genes are affected by Ser116 phosphorylation, however, remains to be investigated. The v-myb oncogene and its cellular progenitor c-myb both encode transcription factors that are implicated in the switch between growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 223-235PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ganter B. Lipsick J.S. Adv.

The c-Myb protein consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD),1 a central transactivation domain, and a C-terminal negative regulatory domain. The DBD of c-Myb is composed of the three imperfect repeats R1, R2, and R3, each related to the helix-turn-helix motif (5Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Frampton J. Gibson T.J. Ness S.A. Doderlein G. Graf T.

Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). R1 is deleted in v-Myb, and the R2 and R3 repeats are sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding (hereafter termed the minimal DNA-binding domain (mDBD)). This prototype Myb mDBD is highly conserved throughout evolution in the animal and plant kingdoms (8Rosinski J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence supports a central role for c-Myb in regulating cell growth and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 4Oh I.H.

DNA replication in RB69 (a T4-like bacteriophage) is similar to those of eukaryotes and archaea and has been a prototype for studies on DNA replication and assembly of the functional replisome. To examine protein-protein interactions at the DNA replication fork, we have established solution conditions for the formation of a discrete and homogeneous complex of RB69 DNA polymerase (gp43), primer-template DNA, and RB69 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gp32) using equilibrium fluorescence and light scattering. We have characterized the interaction between DNA polymerase and single-stranded DNA-binding protein and measured a 60-fold increase in the overall affinity of RB69 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) for template strand DNA in the presence of DNA polymerase that is the result of specific protein-protein interactions. Our data further suggest that the cooperative binding of the RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB to the primer-template junction is a simple but functionally important means of regulatory assembly of replication proteins at the site of action. We have also shown that a functional domain of RB69 single-stranded DNA-binding protein suggested previously to be the site of RB69 DNA polymerase-SSB interactions is dispensable.

The data from these studies have been used to model the RB69 DNA polymerase-SSB interaction at the primer-template junction. single-stranded DNA-binding protein single-stranded DNA The replisome is a dynamic macromolecular machine that must constantly respond to changes within the cell that may affect the rate and accuracy of DNA replication (1Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The complex topology of the chromosome, together with the fact that DNA is constantly accessed for transcription, recombination, and repair, suggests that the replication of DNA cannot be static, but rather must maintain a great deal of structural flexibility (1Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The interaction of the replicative DNA polymerase with its cognate SSB1 is an example of this dynamic process. During DNA replication, ssDNA is cooperatively and non-specifically bound by the SSB family of proteins to protect template strand DNA from nucleases and facilitate the removal of adventitious secondary structures (2Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The length of available template strand during lagging strand synthesis can be variable and depends, in part, on the particular organism and its metabolic state (3Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The problem of how to efficiently bind available ssDNA is solved by the highly cooperative and non-sequence-specific interaction of the SSB family proteins for single-stranded DNA. In contrast, the interaction of the replicative DNA polymerase is, of necessity, confined to the primer-template junction. The polymerase has a high affinity for this unique structure over either ssDNA or double-stranded DNA (4Guest C.R. Hochstrasser R.A. Dupuy C.G. Allen D.J. Benkovic S.J. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8759-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,5Allen D.J. Darke P.L. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4601-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The processivity of the polymerase is further enhanced by the sliding clamp family of proteins that tether the polymerase to the DNA (6Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Bruck I. O'Donnell M. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS3001)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the SSB, DNA polymerase, and sliding clamp (once the sliding clamp has been loaded) are able to extend DNA at nearly in vivo rates (8Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and thus, efficient DNA replication depends on making specific protein-protein contacts within the context of the expanding DNA replication bubble. We have determined conditions that allow us to accurately measure the association of a replicative DNA polymerase for its cognate SSB and apply this information to our understanding of the functional replisome. T4 bacteriophage has proven to be a productive system to study DNA replication because of its simplicity and organizational similarity to eukaryotic and archaeal systems (9Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage RB69 is closely related to T4, and thus, insights from the well characterized T4 system are readily applicable to RB69. RB69 and T4 DNA polymerases (gp43) share 74% amino acid similarity and are members of the polα family of replicative DNA polymerases (11Yeh L.S. Hsu T. Karam J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies on the T4/RB69 system have been successful in determining high resolution x-ray structures for the DNA polymerase (gp43) (12Wang J. Sattar A.K.M. Wang C.C. Karam J.D.

Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and provide an excellent starting point for the study of replisome assembly. In bacteriophage T4, specific association of gp32 with gp43 has been qualitatively demonstrated using affinity chromatography of radiolabeled crude extracts (17Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis has shown that the T4/RB69 gp32 can be divided into three distinct domains. The N-terminal B-domain (residues 1–21) is essential for the cooperative binding of RB69 SSB to ssDNA. Loss of this domain reduces affinity for ssDNA by over a thousand-fold (19Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal A-domain (residues 255–301 for T4 and residues 255–299 for RB69) is highly acidic and mediates interactions with other proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (18Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Hosoda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11484-11493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The core domain (residues 22–254) is the DNA-binding domain and has the same intrinsic affinity as the intact protein for short single-stranded DNA (19Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon proteolysis studies performed in the presence or absence of DNA, it has been suggested that T4 SSB undergoes a conformational change upon binding to ssDNA (21Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Current models suggest the conformational changes during binding facilitate T4 SSB interactions with other proteins in replication, recombination, and repair. To date, quantitative studies on the interaction between DNA polymerase and SSB protein have been limited because of difficulties in establishing conditions that favor formation of a discrete homogeneous complex (22Munn M.M.

Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) have allowed us to design conditions and DNA substrates to form a discrete RB69 DNA polymerase, a primer-template DNA, and RB69 SSB complex for quantitative analysis. The composition and stoichiometry of the complexes were validated using light scattering. Once we had established solution conditions that favored formation of a 1:1:1 RB69 DNA polymerase·SSB·primer-template DNA complex, we were then able to study the interactions among RB69 DNA polymerase, RB69 SSB, and primer-template DNA by equilibrium fluorescence methods where the tryptophan signal from the RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB is quenched upon binding to the DNA. We have found that the protein-protein cooperativity between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB causes a roughly 60-fold increase of affinity of SSB to the adjoining single-stranded template region. These data have allowed us to construct testable models for the formation of the DNA polymerase-SSB interaction as they occur in replication forks of all organisms. Enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, and chemicals were from either Sigma or Fluka. Chromatography resins were purchased from Whatman and Amersham Biosciences. The ssDNA cellulose column was prepared in the laboratory using the protocols of Alberts and Herrick (23Alberts B. Herrick G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 198-217Crossref Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The original clone encoding RB69 gene 32 (pLIA5) was a gift from Dr. J. Karam (Tulane University School of Medicine). pLIA5 was not efficient in making the RB69 SSB, because an upstream autogenous regulatory element was present in the clone (24Krisch H.M. Allet B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). gp32 was subcloned into the overexpression vector pKC30 without the native 5′ autoregulatory sequences and used to transform Escherichia coliAR120 (25Shamoo Y. Adari H. Konigsberg W.H. Williams K.R. Chase J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8844-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In toto, three different RB69 SSB expression constructs were engineered for this work: the intact protein (gp32), a truncation mutant without the N-terminal domain (gp32-B; residues 22–299), and a mutant without the C-terminal domain (gp32-A; residues 1–253). The clone for expression of gp32-A was generated by changing the codon for Val-254 to a stop codon on intact gene 32 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Clones for the overexpression of RB69 DNA polymerase and an exo− mutant were the generous gift of Dr. J. Karam (Tulane University School of Medicine). RB69 DNA polymerase exo− was purified in a similar manner as described previously (26Wang C.-C. Lu-Shu Y. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Intact RB69 gp32, gp32-A, and gp32-B were purified in a manner similar to intact T4 SSB (25Shamoo Y.

RB69 gp32 core protein was produced from trypsin digestion of gp32-A protein (19Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified using ssDNA cellulose affinity column (26Wang C.-C. Lu-Shu Y. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The design of a primer-template DNA to form a complex with RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB was based on the crystal structure of RB69 DNA polymerase bound to a primer-template DNA (13Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and biochemical studies on the site size of T4 SSB binding to ssDNA (27Shamoo Y. Ghosaini L.R. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Sturtevant J.M. Konigsberg W.H. Biochem. 1989; 28: 7409-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (TableI). Oligonucleotides were purified by ion-pairing reverse phase chromatography (C4 resin; Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Primer-template DNAs were annealed by mixing equal molar amounts of primer and template strands in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA (TE) heated to 80 °C and allowed to slow cool to 20 °C prior to use.Table IDNA constructs for cis and trans experimentsp5′-CGTAAGCAGTAGTTCCCGTt + 123′-GCATTCGTCATCAAGGGCACGCTTTTTTTT-5′p5′-CGTAAGCAGTAGTTCCCGTt + 63′-GCATTCGTCATCAAGGGCACGCTTT6TTTTTT-5′ Open table in a new tab A miniDAWN three-angle light-scattering photometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) with a 30-milliwatt semiconductor diode laser of wavelength 690 nm was used to determine the molecular mass of individual proteins and complexes. 200–300-μg samples were injected onto a Shodex KW803 gel filtration column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and their elution was monitored by Shimadzu SPD-10Avp UV-visible and Waters R401 refractive index detectors. All measurements were made in the in-line flow mode. The miniDAWN was calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Wyatt Technology). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard to evaluate the accuracy of the system. A dn/dc (change in refractive index as a function of concentration) value of 0.184 was used for bovine serum albumin and single proteins (28Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). dn/dc values for complexes were determined by using both UV-visible detector and differential refractometer. The Zimm method was used to determine the molecular mass for all samples (29Wyatt P.J. Analyt. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The interaction between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB to primer-template DNA was quantitated by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. All measurements were made in an SLM 8100 spectrometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL), using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 347 nm. All experiments were carried out in a 1-cm path length quartz fluorimetric cuvette containing an active magnetic stirrer at 20 °C and a 4-nm band-pass for both excitation and emission monochromators. Initial protein concentrations were 1 or 2 μm in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl in the cuvette. Small aliquots (2 to 10 μl) of the corresponding DNA solution in TE buffer were added to the sample cuvette, and TE buffer was added to the reference cuvette. After mixing for 4 min, the spectrometer made ten measurements, and the average was taken as one data point. The effects of dilution and photobleaching were corrected by data from the reference cuvette. Nucleic acids absorb excitation light at 295 nm, and it was necessary to correct for this inner filter effect using ann-acetyltryptophan amide (NATA) calibration titration (30Subbarao N.K. MacDonald R.C. Analyst. 1993; 118: 913-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is no appreciable interaction between NATA and nucleic acids, decrease in NATA fluorescence is a consequence of inner filter effect. After correcting for photobleaching, dilution, and inner filter effects, the titration curves were fitted using the program Dynafit (BioKin Ltd., Pullman, WA) (31Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). In Dynafit, users give the reaction mechanisms, which are translated by the program into the underlying systems of mathematical equations by using the theory of matrices (32Smith W.R. Missen R.W. Chemical Reaction Equilibrium Analysis. Wiley Interscience, New York1982Google Scholar). The data are then fitted using least squares regression. To analyze the formation of the RB69 DNA polymerase·SSB·primer-template complex, it was necessary to find conditions that support a discrete 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Light scattering was used to assess complex stoichiometry by an accurate determination of their molecular mass and by analysis of their contents by SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectrophotometry. As shown in TableII, RB69 DNA polymerase exo−, gp32-B, and gp32 core protein were well behaved monomeric species whereas intact gp32 and gp32-A were highly polydisperse, consistent with their known ability to self-aggregate (33Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 403-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We estimated the molecular mass of the RB69 DNA polymerase exo−·primer-template DNA complex to be 122.2 kDa, which was 2.2% away from the theoretical molecular mass of 119.6 kDa. Finally, we determined the molecular mass for the complexes in the presence of different RB69 SSB proteins (TableIII). Because some aggregation was always seen in the front shoulder (less than 5% of the total material), the middle of the peak was selected for molecular mass calculations. Under the conditions used (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), the RB69 DNA polymerase·SSB·primer-template complex was monodisperse (Fig. 1) and displayed a molecular mass of about 130 kDa. Molecular mass estimates for complexes made up of both DNA and protein are somewhat more difficult as the dn/dc value of the sample must be estimated from refractive index changes and led to slightly larger residual errors for all complexes tested. Although the molecular mass of the 1:1:1 stoichiometry was about 10% lower than the theoretical value, we used SDS-PAGE and UV absorbance at 280 and 260 nm to ensure that DNA polymerase, SSB, and primer-template DNA were all present (data not shown). Alternative stoichiometries lead to much greater errors and allow us to conclude that there was one molecule of DNA polymerase (104.6 kDa), one molecule of primer-template DNA (15.0 kDa), and one molecule of RB69 SSB (26.2–31.1 kDa) in the complex. Interestingly, whereas intact gp32 and gp32-A were polydisperse alone, the DNA polymerase·primer-template DNA complexes with these proteins were monodisperse (Table III) and further confirm that only one RB69 SSB was accommodated onto the template DNA. We also performed the same experiments using 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2 as a buffer but found that the complexes were more polydisperse, presumably because of nonspecific aggregation at low ionic strength (data not shown).Table IIMonodispersity and accuracy of molecular mass of individual proteins determined by light scatteringProteinTheoretical massExperimental massApparent errorMonodispersity2-aA value of 1 means absolutely monodisperse.

To assay whether the interactions between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB change the affinity of the polymerase to primer-template DNA, we determined the binding affinity of RB69 DNA polymerase to primer-template DNA by titration of 2 μmRB69 DNA polymerase exo− with p/t+12 primer-template DNA. Fig. 2 shows the saturation binding curves of DNA polymerase to primer-template DNA under different salt concentrations generated by measuring the percentage change in protein fluorescence as a function of DNA concentration. Under low salt conditions (50–100 mm NaCl), the binding is too tight to allow an accurate estimate of K a; however, we can estimate the stoichiometry of binding to be 1:1 using the break point estimated from the initial and final slopes of the binding curve (19Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for RB69 DNA polymerase to primer-template DNA at 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl was estimated to be greater than 2 nm, in good agreement with previous studies (4Guest C.R. Hochstrasser R.A. Dupuy C.G. Allen D.J. Benkovic S.J. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8759-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Allen D.J. Darke P.L. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4601-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) on other polymerases. To obtain an accurate measurement of binding, it was necessary to increase the concentration of NaCl to 150 mm. Data were fitted in Dynafit, and the calculated dissociation constant for RB69 DNA polymerase to primer-template DNA at 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl was 124 ± 16 nm. In addition, we noted that the maximum change in fluorescence quenching decreased as a function of salt concentration. As a consequence all our studies were performed at 150 mm NaCl. We also measured the affinity of RB69 SSB to a short ssDNA. By measuring the individual affinities of RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB to their substrates, we were then able to determine their cooperativity when bound together on the same DNA. Bacteriophage T4 gp32 has been a prototype for protein-nucleic acid interactions, and the RB69 homolog also proved amenable to physicochemical analysis. The site size of RB69 SSB to ssDNA and maximum fluorescence quenching were determined by titrating 2 μm RB69 SSB intact protein with poly(dT) DNA. The site size was determined under stoichiometric binding conditions to be n = 6 ± 1 nucleotides (Data not shown), in good agreement with the previous studies (27Shamoo Y. Ghosaini L.R. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Sturtevant J.M. Konigsberg W.H. Biochem. 1989; 28: 7409-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) on T4 SSB. The dissociation constant for gp32-B to T6 DNA at 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl was very weak, 10.9 ± 1.7 μm (data not shown), consistent with previous studies using T4 gp32 (19Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We designed experiments to determine the cooperativity between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB when bound to the same (cis) or different (trans) DNA strands (Fig. 3). In the cis experiment, equimolar ratios of RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB bind to a single contiguous primer template. If the presence of RB69 DNA polymerase at the primer-template junction increases the affinity of SSB for the template strand, the increase in binding through protein-protein interactions can be readily measured. In the trans experiment, the template strand is broken into a shorter primer-template junction, which only RB69 DNA polymerase will bind, and a six-nucleotide DNA, which RB69 SSB will bind. Because no significant association has been found between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB in solution in the absence of DNA, the experiment serves as a control for the proteins when they are bound in trans to separate DNA strands. To simplify our analysis of the fluorescence data, we used a truncation fragment of gp32 (gp32-B) that binds with the same intrinsic affinity to ssDNA as intact gp32 but without the gp32:gp32 cooperativity that complicates analysis. At 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, RB69 DNA polymerase binds to primer template with ∼100 nm affinity whereas gp32-B binds to ssDNA about 100 times more weakly (10.9 μm) and as proposed in our model, suggests DNA polymerase would bind preferentially at the primer-template junction whereas gp32-B would associate with available single-stranded template DNA (Fig. 3). Under identical solution conditions, 1 μm RB69 DNA polymerase and gp32-B were titrated with p/t+12 DNA or p/t+T6 DNA (see Table I and Fig. 3). The saturation binding curves are shown in Fig. 4 A. As expected, in thecis situation, the interaction between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB increased the affinity of SSB to ssDNA, which appeared as a tighter binding regime, whereas in the trans experiment, two independent binding processes were displayed as a two-phase curve. The mechanism and their associated fits to our data are shown in Fig. 4 B. The overall calculated dissociation constant for RB69 DNA polymerase/gp32-B to primer-template DNA at 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl was 353 ± 25 nm, similar to the affinity of DNA polymerase alone to primer-template DNA (124 ± 16 nm). In thetrans experiment, we were readily able to fit the data assuming there were two independent binding processes in the cuvette, and the calculated dissociation constant for RB69 DNA polymerase to primer-template DNA was 139 ± 14 nm and for RB69 gp32-B to T6 DNA was 20.0 ± 0.4 μm. These data are in good agreement with the dissociation constant for individual binding processes, 124 ± 16 nm and 10.9 ± 1.7 μm, respectively, and support the proposed mechanism for the trans experiment. The strength of the RB69 DNA polymerase-SSB interaction can be estimated from the difference in apparent association of SSB to available single-stranded template DNA. At 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, the presence of RB69 DNA polymerase results in a 57-fold increase in SSB affinity for ssDNA as a result of DNA polymerase:SSB cooperativity.Figure 4a, fluorescence titration curves for thecis experiments using different RB69 SSB proteins and for the trans experiments using gp32-B.

Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If this is true, the cooperative RB69 DNA polymerase-SSB interactions should be abolished by the removal of the A-domain. To test this hypothesis, we performed our DNA polymerase:SSB cooperativity studies using core gp32 (without the A-domain). To our surprise, we obtained a curve that demonstrated tighter DNA polymerase-SSB interaction than we observed with gp32-B protein (Fig. 4 A). The calculated dissociation constant for RB69 DNA polymerase:gp32 core to primer-template DNA at 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl was 48.6 ± 7.7 nm. This is about a 350-fold increase in affinity from protein-protein interactions and is 7-fold higher than observed for RB69 DNA polymerase:gp32-B. The dissociation constants are summarized in Tables IV andV. We also obtained a saturation curve for RB69 DNA polymerase:gp32 intact protein binding to primer-template DNA and for RB69 DNA polymerase:gp32-A binding to primer-template DNA. Interestingly, the gp32 and gp32-B proteins showed similar cooperativity (∼60-fold), whereas gp32 core and gp32-A consistently showed stronger polymerase:SSB cooperativity (∼350-fold).Table IVDissociation constants for RB69 DNA polymerase exo− and SSBs to different DNA ligands at 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150mm NaCl4-a Data were fitted using single binding process as the mechanism, e.g. pol + SSB + p/t + 12 = pol:SSB:p/t + 12.

The specificity and strength of protein-DNA and protein-protein contacts within the replisome are critical for its correct assembly and function. Even a minimal replisome in T4/RB69 consists of at least five proteins: DNA polymerase, sliding clamp, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, the primase, and the helicase. Each organism has proteins fulfilling analogous conserved roles throughout DNA replication, although eukaryotes typically have more subunits (10Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although there have been several very good qualitative studies of protein-protein interactions within replication, quantitative analysis has proven to be more difficult (3Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 35Nossal N.G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Typically, this is because the assembly of the replisomal proteins is quite weak and dissociates readily in the absence of DNA. Based on the crystal structure of RB69 DNA polymerase·primer-template DNA complex and the biochemical studies on the site size of T4 SSB core protein, we have found solution conditions that support formation of a homogeneous complex of RB69 DNA polymerase, SSB, and primer-template DNA. Our results show that the cooperativity between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB increases the affinity of SSB to the single-stranded region on the template strand about 60-fold. Studies on the SSB family of proteins suggest their function in DNA replication is conserved across all organisms. In addition to being essential to DNA replication, recombination, and repair, they are among the first proteins that assemble onto the DNA for these diverse processes and recruit other proteins to the site of action. A direct interaction between SSB and replicative DNA polymerase has also been proposed for eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, the SSB protein is replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimeric protein shown to act as a common “touchpoint” (36Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) for the assembly of the polδ replication complex. Our studies show that binding in cis to the same DNA strand is facilitated by protein-protein interactions and thus promotes proper assembly of proteins to the primer-template junction. Immunoaffinity chromatography has shown that DNA polδ from calf thymus and the p70 subunit of RPA associate with several other proteins involved in DNA replication (37Mo J. Liu L. Leon A. Mazloum N. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and RPA is also directly responsible for the loading of replication factor C and polδ onto primer-template DNA in a coordinated manner (36Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the scenario we found in our studies in which RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB directly and coordinately assemble at the primer-template junction. More specifically for the RB69/T4 system, it has been hypothesized that the C-terminal A-domain of RB69 SSB recruits proteins essential for replication, recombination, and repair (18Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) via protein-protein interactions. Current models suggest that in the DNA-free state of RB69 SSB, the A-domain is at least partially buried within the ssDNA-binding site (21Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 38Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon binding to ssDNA, the A-domain is exposed and can make interactions more readily with other proteins (38Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Williams K.R. Konigsberg W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) purified a C-terminal region of the T4 SSB (residues 213–301) and immobilized it on an agarose matrix. They found that this affinity column was able to retain DNA polymerase and several other replication and recombination proteins from T4 whole cell extract. If the A-domain is the domain responsible for interaction with DNA polymerase, the DNA polymerase·primer-template DNA·SSB core complex should not display any cooperativity between DNA polymerase and SSB core in our studies. Surprisingly, we observed about 7-fold higher cooperativity for this complex than with gp32-B protein (which has the A-domain). This implies that the A-domain on RB69 SSB is not the site for binding to DNA polymerase. On the contrary, it slightly hinders the interaction between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB. Our studies support a model for DNA polymerase-SSB interaction in the RB69/T4 system, in which the A-domain partially folds back into the DNA-binding pocket, blocking the binding site for DNA polymerase (Fig. 5). Upon binding to ssDNA, the A-domain is displaced, and the binding site for DNA polymerase is exposed to make interactions with DNA polymerase. The experiments performed by Hurley et al. (18Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) used a peptide that includes not only the A-domain of T4 SSB but also 42 extra amino acids (residues 213–255) on the core domain, and this may account for differences between our studies. Because the crystal structure of T4 gp32 core bound to DNA shows that these 42 amino acids form a large surface on the back of the DNA-binding pocket (16Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the binding site for DNA polymerase may be composed, in part, by residues 213–255. If the A-domain is not present, the interaction surface with DNA polymerase may already be accessible and could explain why we see a 7-fold higher cooperativity for the DNA polymerase·gp32-A·primer-template complex. Our data suggest the binding site for DNA polymerase in gp32-A is exposed, sending a “false signal” that gp32 is bound to DNA and is available for DNA replication. In the intact gp32, the binding site for DNA polymerase is protected by the A-domain and is exposed only when it is bound to ssDNA. We have found that specific protein-protein cooperativity between RB69 DNA polymerase and its SSB (gp32) has the overall effect of increasing the affinity of SSB for ssDNA proximal to the DNA polymerase by about 60-fold. This modest protein-protein association predicts that, in the absence of DNA, the DNA polymerase and SSB will not associate to form unproductive “pseudo-replisomes” at their in vivoconcentrations. Conversely, the cooperativity assures that when both proteins are bound to the same DNA strand, they will productively associate to facilitate accurate and processive DNA synthesis. Previous studies have suggested that SSB from bacteriophage T4 and E. coli are able to diffuse along ssDNA, and therefore the “search” for either another SSB or DNA polymerase is confined to two dimensions (42Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The protein-protein cooperativity exhibited by DNA polymerase and SSB furthers the view that the dynamic character of the replisome is the product of subtle and finely tuned interactions at the molecular level. It is our expectation that these organizing principles will be seen throughout DNA replication and in all organisms. We thank Dr. Jim Karam and Dr. J.

Endotoxin plays a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. The effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the endotoxin component of Gram-negative bacteria, was determined on liver ADH. LPS given daily to rats for 3 days increased ADH mRNA, ADH protein, and ADH activity. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the liver nuclear extracts bound to an oligonucleotide specifying region −226 to −194 of the ADH promoter, whereas upstream stimulatory factor (USF) was shown previously to bind to a more proximal site. LPS increased NF-κB and USF binding to the ADH promoter. The NF-κB (p65) and NF-κB (p50) expression vectors inhibited the transfected ADH promoter activity, which contrasts with the previously demonstrated stimulation by an USF expression vector. The binding activities of STAT5b and of C/EBPβ, which mediate the effect of GH on ADH, were not changed or decreased, respectively, by LPS, indicating that GH plays no intermediary role in the effect of LPS. This study shows that LPS increases ADH and that this effect is mediated by increased binding of USF to the ADH promoter and not by NF-κB, which has an inhibitory action.

Immobilization stress in rats, which stimulates the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenocortical axis, increases liver ADH activity and ethanol elimination (1Mezey E. Potter J.J. Kvetnansky R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 2: 657-663Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity is regulated by hormones and increases in the activity of the enzyme, resulting in increased formation of metabolites of ethanol such as acetaldehyde, which are important in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (2Mezey E. Potter J.J. Yang V.W. Alcohol Alcohol. 1993; Suppl. 2: 57-62Google Scholar). CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β, upstream regulatory factor (USF), and signal transduction and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b) are transcription factors that bind to and activate the ADH promoter in transfection experiments. C/EBPβ binds principally between −22 and −11 (3Potter J.J. Mezey E. Cornelius P. Crabb D.W. Yang V.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 95: 360-368Google Scholar), USF between −60 and −52 (4Potter J.J.

Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) relative to the start site of transcription. C/EBPβ also binds to a second site adjacent to the STAT5b binding site (5Potter J.J. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The action of growth hormone (GH) in enhancing the ADH promoter activity is mediated by both C/EBPβ (6Potter J.J. Yang V.W. Mezey E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and STAT5b (5Potter J.J. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Endotoxin originating from intestinal bacteria is an important mediator of hepatocellular inflammation in the intragastric-feeding rat model of alcoholic liver disease (7Thurman R.G. Am. J.

Hepatology. 2001; 34: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the endotoxin component of Gram-negative bacteria, leads to the production of a variety of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1, the formation of oxygen radicals, and the translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the cell nucleus (9Ye X. Liu S.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Baldwin A.S, Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5572) Google Scholar). LPS activates the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenocortical axis, and this is manifested principally by increases in ACTH and cortisol secretion (11McCann S.M. Kimura M. Karanth S., Yu, W.H. Mastronardi C.A. Rettori V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 917: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The effect of LPS on GH is species-dependent with increases in the human but decreases in the rat (11McCann S.M. Kimura M. Karanth S., Yu, W.H. Mastronardi C.A. Rettori V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 917: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The purpose of the study was to determine whether LPS with its associate acute phase metabolic response influences ADH and whether such an effect on ADH is mediated by NF-κB. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All animals received humane care in compliance with the guidelines from the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Johns Hopkins University. LPS fromEscherichia coli was obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and agarose were purchased from Invitrogen. Plastic 752 tissue culture flasks were purchased from BD Biosciences. [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. An oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding sequence of NF-κB was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rats received intraperitoneal injections of LPS (100 μg/100g body weight) daily for 3 days, while control rats received isovolumetric amounts of saline. The animals were sacrificed 2 h after the last injection. Approximately 400–500 mg of the liver was homogenized in 4 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was used for the determination of ADH activity and ADH protein. One section of 1.0–1.2 gm of the liver was processed for RNA isolation, and the remainder of the liver was used for preparation of nuclear protein extracts as described previously (4Potter J.J. Cheneval D. Dang C.V. Resar L.M.S. Mezey E. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear protein extracts were aliquoted and stored under nitrogen at −100 °C. Protein content of the cytosol and nuclear extract was determined by the method of Lowryet al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADH activity was determined in the liver cytosol at 37 °C by the method of Crow et al. (13Crow K.E. Cornell N.W. Veech R.L. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1977; 1: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was 1.0 ml and consisted of 0.5m Tris-HCL, pH 7.2, 18 mm ethanol, 2.8 mm NAD+, and 0.03 ml of the liver cytosol. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the formation of 1 μmol NADH per min. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined by the method of Plagemann et al. (14Plagemann P.G.W. Gregory K.F. Wroblewski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2288-2293Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Immunoreactive protein of ADH was determined by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (15Yamauchi M. Potter J.J. Mezey E. Gastroenterology. 1988; 94: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA plasmid encoding the rat class I ADH and the rat class I 240ADH-CAT construct, which were obtained from Dr. David W. Crabb of Indiana University School of Medicine (Indianapolis, IN), have been described previously (3Potter J.J. Mezey E. Cornelius P. Crabb D.W. Yang V.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 95: 360-368Google Scholar). The NF-κB expression vectors RSV-NF-κB (p50) and RSV-Rel (p65) and the empty vector K1 were obtained from Professor Guidalberto Manfioletti, from the University of Trieste, Italy. The STAT5b expression vector pCMX-STAT5b and the empty vector pCMV5 were gifts from Dr. Gregorio Gil of the Medical College of Virginia (Richmond, VA). Luciferase constructs of the ADH promoter were prepared as described previously (5Potter J.J. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated using the procedure of Chomcynski and Sacchi (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). RNA quality and concentration were verified by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Northern blots for rat liver ADH and mouse γ-actin were performed as described previously (17Potter J.J. Yang V.W. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of ADH mRNA hybridized was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry. The sequences of the ADH oligonucleotides used for EMSA are shown in TableI. Complimentary strands of each oligonucleotide were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme according to the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (18Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). DNA-protein binding reactions were performed with nuclear extracts (8 μg of protein) following the previously described EMSA procedure (3Potter J.J. Mezey E. Cornelius P. Crabb D.W. Yang V.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 95: 360-368Google Scholar). For “supershift” EMSA experiments, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, USF-1, USF-2, STAT5b, and C/EBPβ, obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., were used. These antibodies were added separately to the reaction at the completion of DNA-protein binding, incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature, and resolved on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.Table IADH oligonucleotides used for EMSA −22 −1ADH-E5′-TGTGTGCAACTTTGGCCCAGTT −73 −46ADH-U5′-TGGGCTAGATCACATGTGGGATCAGCTG-3′ −226 −194ADHwt5′-CAATTGGCTGTACATTTGGGAAAATAAAACTTT-3′NF-κB1-aNF-κB protein consensus binding sequence.5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′The C/EBP, USF, and STAT regulatory motifs, respectively, in the ADH-E, ADH-U, and ADHwt oligonucleotides are underlined.1-a NF-κB protein consensus binding sequence.

Transient transfection experiments were carried out in cultured HepG2 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were seeded on 75-cm2 polystyrene flasks and allowed to grow to 60–70% confluency in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was renewed 1 h prior to transfection. To each flask 10 μg of pGL3-ADH, 5 μg of β-galactosidase vectors, and 5 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added in the form of calcium phosphate precipitates. For each experiment, pGL3-basic and pGL3-control luciferase vectors were used as a negative and a positive control. After overnight incubation, the cells were shocked with 10% Me2SO in DMEM for 3 min and then washed and refed with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At 40 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle in 200 μl of the reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were determined by respective chemiluminescent assays (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.V. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Current Status. Wiley, New York1991: 543-546Google Scholar). The binding of nuclear proteins to the oligonucleotide probe was performed as for EMSA. Reactions using 8 μg of nuclear protein and 50 fmol of radioactively labeled oligonucleotides were used. Following the binding reaction, UV cross-linking was performed as described previously (4Potter J.J. Cheneval D. Dang C.V. Resar L.M.S. Mezey E. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

The membranes were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, USF-1, USF-2, STAT 5b (1:200 dilution), or to C/EBPβ (C-19, 1:500 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for one h. After repeated washing for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 50,000 dilution) (Amersham Biosciences) for one h. The membranes were again washed for 1 h and then immersed in lumigen PS-3 acridan substrate solution (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min. The antigens were visualized by exposing the membrane to x-ray film. All data points are expressed as means ± S.E. The differences between means of paired groups and between means of more than two paired groups were examined by Student'st test and by two-way analysis of variance plus appropriate multiple comparisons, respectively. The administration of LPS resulted in a mean 2.9-fold increase in liver ADH activity (TableII) but in no significant change in lactate dehydrogenase activity. ADH immunoprotein was also increased after LPS administration from 7.49 ± 4.12 ng/mg cytosol protein in the controls to 10.91 ± 0.70 ng/mg cytosol protein after LPS (p < 0.05). LPS administration did not change liver weight or protein concentration in the liver cytosol. The effect of LPS in increasing ADH activity and protein was accompanied by an increase in ADH mRNA. The relative densitometric readings of ADH mRNA/γ actin mRNA ratios for the autoradiographs of the Northern blots were increased to 164 ± 12 (n = 5) after LPS treatment as compared with 100 ± 24 (n= 5) for controls (p < 0.05).Table IIEffect of LPS administration on hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activitiesTreatmentADHLDHmIU/mg proteinIU/mg proteinControl9.40 ± 1.292.27 ± 0.05LPS26.96 ± 6.892-ap < 0.02 versus control.1.92 ± 0.15LPS was administered intraperitoneally in a daily dose of 100 μg/100 gm body weight for 3 days.

Furthermore, NF-κB in nuclear extracts from rat liver was found to bind to the oligonucleotide ADHwt. specifying a region from −226 to −194 of the ADH promoter (Table I). EMSA with the nuclear extracts from control rats shows four protein-DNA complexes with the ADHwt oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A, arrows). These complexes were previously identified (5Potter J.J. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) as binding by STAT5b (upper complex) and C/EBPβ (two middle complexes). Nuclear extract from LPS-treated rats resulted in the formation of two additional upper protein-DNA complexes with the ADHwt oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A, arrowheads). Antibody to NF-κB p50 decreased the uppermost protein-DNA complex and resulted in the formation of a supershifted complex, whereas antibody to NF-κB p65 resulted in a smaller supershifted complex (Fig. 2 B). LPS did not significantly change the binding activity of nuclear STAT5b and C/EBPβ to the ADHwt oligonucleotide from that obtained with nuclear extracts of control rats. LPS, however, resulted in a decrease in the formation of the protein-DNA complex with the ADH-E oligonucleotide (Fig. 3), which represents C/EBPβ binding to the more proximal site (Table I) of the ADH promoter (3Potter J.J.

The NF-κB (p65) and NF-κB (p50) expression vectors resulted in inhibition of the activity of the ADH promoter (pGL-ADH) (Table III). The combination of the NF-κB expression vectors did not result in additional inhibition over that obtained with NF-κB (p65) alone.

UV cross-linking with immunoblots was done to further define the effects of LPS on NF-κB and C/EBPβ binding and to determine the effect of LPS on USF binding to ADH oligonucleotides. LPS increased the binding of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 4) but had no effect on the minimal binding of NF-κB p50. LPS decreased the binding of the 35-kDa C/EBPβ to ADH-E (Fig. 5). By contrast, LPS resulted in moderate increases in the binding of the 43-kDa USF-1 and 44-kDa USF-2 proteins and a marked increase in the binding of the 17-kDa USF protein to the ADH-U oligonucleotide (Fig. 6).Figure 5Immunoblot showing the presence of C/EBP β in nuclear extracts ( NE ) from control and LPS-treated rat liver UV cross-linked to the labeled ADHU oligonucleotide.

LPS activates NF-κB, and NF-κB in turn is a known regulator of the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor α and other inflammatory cytokines. NF-κB in nuclear protein extracts from rat liver was shown in this study to bind to the ADH promoter. Although LPS resulted in the expected increase of NF-κB activity and in increased NF-κB binding to the ADH promoter, the effect of LPS in enhancing the ADH was not mediated by NF-κB. Indeed, the NF-κB expression vectors resulted in inhibition of the activity of the ADH promoter. Furthermore, the NF-κB (p65) expression vector inhibited the activation of the ADH promoter by the STAT5b expression vector. Acetaldehyde in vitro was shown to diminish LPS-stimulated degradation of IκBα and to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, resulting in decreased NF-κB binding to the NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (22Jokelainen K. Thomas P. Lindros K. Nanji A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that any inhibitory effect of NF-κB on ADH may be markedly decreased or abrogated by the acetaldehyde produced during ethanol metabolism. GH enhances ADH, an effect mediated by both C/EBPβ (6Potter J.J. Yang V.W. Mezey E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and STAT5b (5Potter J.J. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 391: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The effect of LPS on increasing ADH, however, is not mediated by GH. LPS increases GH secretion in the human but decreases GH secretion in the rat (11McCann S.M. Kimura M. Karanth S., Yu, W.H. Mastronardi C.A. Rettori V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 917: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Briard N. Dadoun F. Pommier G. Sauze N. Lebouc Y. Oliver C. Dutour A. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPS did not affect the binding of STAT5b and decreased the binding of C/EBPβ to oligonucleotides specifying their binding sites on the ADH promoter. These findings are in agreement with prior observations showing that LPS down-regulated the STAT5-mediated GH-responsive gene serine protease inhibitor 2 (24Bergad P.L. Schwarzenberg S.J. Humbert J.T. Morrison M. Amarasinghe S. Towle H.C. Berry S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1906-C1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, LPS decreased the 42-kDa C/EBPα and the 35-kDa C/EBPβ proteins in nuclear extracts from mice and their binding to the C/EBP binding site of the α1-acid glycoprotein promoter (25An M.R. Hsieh C.C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1966; 16: 2295-2306Crossref Google Scholar). The 20-kDa C/EBPβ and its binding were increased acutely after LPS but decreased to baseline values after 48 h (25An M.R. Hsieh C.C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1966; 16: 2295-2306Crossref Google Scholar). This study indicates that the effect of LPS in increasing ADH is mediated by increased binding of USF to the ADH promoter. In a previous study, we demonstrated that USF activated the promoter of the ratADH gene (4Potter J.J. Cheneval D. Dang C.V. Resar L.M.S. Mezey E. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding to the ADH promoter of the 43-kDa USF-1 and the 44-kDa USF-2 isoforms, which are principally responsible for transcriptional activity in mammalian cells (26Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), was increased by LPS. In addition, the binding of a smaller 17-kDa USF polypeptide was also increased by LPS. The 17-kDa polypeptide is recognized by USF-1 antibody and binds to DNA as both a homodimer and a heterodimer with full-length USF-2 (26Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 27Matsukawa T. Inoue Y. Oishi Y. Kato H. Noguchi T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4643-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Heat shock and LPS were previously found to increase binding of nuclear proteins to the E-box of the murine-inducible nitric oxidase gene, and these proteins were supershifted with antibodies to USF-1 and -2. However, mutation of the E-box did not affect the activation of the promoter by LPS (28Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Chantome A. Pance A. Fleury C. Hume D.A. Sester D. Mignotte B. Jeannin J.F. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2393-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the inhibitory effect of NF-κB on ADH in transfection experiments, LPS administration in vivo resulted in an increase in ADH message, protein, and activity, indicating that activators such as C/EBPβ and USF negate a possible inhibitory effect of NF-κB. Also of note is that in vivo the accumulation of NF-κB p50 homodimers is greater than that of NF-κB p50-p65 heterodimers in rat hepatocytes after LPS administration (29Iber H. Chen Q. Cheng P-Y. Morgan E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and, as shown in this study, the inhibitory action of NF-κB p50 was less than that of NF-κB p65 in transfection experiments. The greater increase in ADH activity than in ADH protein and mRNA after LPS administration suggests that the effect of LPS is not only on transcription but possibly also on activation of ADH. In summary, this study shows that LPS, the endotoxin component of Gram-negative bacteria, increases ADH activity and that this effect is mediated by increased binding of USF to the ADH promoter and not by NF-κB, which has an inhibitory action. An increased rate of formation of acetaldehyde caused by an enhanced ADH activity may contribute to worsening of alcoholic liver injury caused by endotoxin."

In the first step of this reaction RecA protein polymerizes on single-stranded DNA to form a filament with a stoichiometry of three nucleotides/RecA monomer called the presynaptic complex. We have used fluorescence anisotropy of a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide to investigate presynaptic complex formation. RecA-ATPγS bound to oligonucleotide by a two-step process. Kinetic studies revealed an intermediate in the polymerization reaction that had greater mobility than the final product filament. The intermediate was transformed into the final product by a process that was independent of filament concentration and temperature, k = 0.3 ± 0.1 min−1. This process had the same rate as that reported for a step in the isomerization of presynaptic complex by ATPγS (Paulus, B. F., and Bryant, F. R. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 7832–7838). Judging from anisotropy measurements, the intermediate had hydrodynamic properties similar to a mixed filament containing RecA monomers with and without ATPγS. These results show that the presynaptic complex can assume conformations with different segmental mobilities that could play a role in homologous recombination.

RecA protein has two functional DNA binding sites (5Howard-Flanders P. West S.C. Stasiak A. Nature. 1984; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the first step of the reaction, multiple RecA monomers bind ssDNA1 at one site of the protein to form a right-handed helical polymer, 3 nt per RecA monomer, known as a presynaptic complex. In the presence of ATP, this filament binds dsDNA, and if the DNA sequences are complementary, strand exchange occurs. RecA protein catalyzes DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis uniformly throughout the nucleoprotein filament (6Brenner S.L. Mitchell R.S. Morrical S.W. Neuendorf S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4011-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presynaptic complex is necessary and sufficient for ATPase activity, even though this filament can bind additional ssDNA or dsDNA (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of ATP hydrolysis on the DNA strand exchange reaction carried out by RecA protein has been investigated using stable ATP analogs such as ATPγS (8Rosselli W. Stasiak A. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In these conditions the presynaptic filament binds but does not hydrolyze cofactor. This filament nevertheless carries out limited DNA strand exchange and is considered to reproduce some of the early steps of homologous recombination. In particular, binding of ATP or ATPγS produces a filament in which DNA is extended (5.1 Å per base pair) and underwound (18 base pair/turn) (12Flory J. Radding C.M. Cell. 1982; 28: 747-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Dunn K. Chrysogelos S. Griffith J.D.

Concomitantly ATP or ATPγS increase the stability of the nucleoprotein filament, while ADP destabilizes the filament relative to no cofactor (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which RecA protein forms the presynaptic complex is poorly understood. Equilibrium binding studies have been carried out for the reaction of RecA with ssDNA in the absence of cofactor (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,16Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 288-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, equilibrium constants and rate constants for formation of the presynaptic complex with ATP or ATPγS have not been investigated in part because of the high stability of the filament in the presence of cofactor. It has been reported that addition of nucleoside triphosphate cofactor to a 3/1 nt/RecA filament may induce transient dissociation of the filament (17Cazenave C. Toulmé J.J. Hélène C. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Cox M.M. Soltis D.A. Lehman I.R. DeBrosse C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore the use of oligonucleotide substrates can destabilize nucleoprotein filaments by reducing the number of protein-protein interactions. Here we use the dissociation-reassociation reaction and oligonucleotide nucleoprotein filaments to investigate the mechanism of presynaptic complex formation. We have recently developed fluorescence anisotropy methods to study the binding of oligonucleotide to the presynaptic filament in the presence of ATPγS (20Gourves A.S. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9613-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The anisotropy of a 5′-fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide increases as protein binds to DNA. Control experiments show that the 5′-fluorescein label does not affect the DNA strand exchange reaction and that the spectroscopic signal reflects the properties of the nucleoprotein filament rather than the local behavior of the fluorophore. We apply this method to study the presynaptic complex. Fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide, 5′-F CCA TCC GCA AAA ATG ACC TCT TAT CAA AAG GA where F is fluorescein, was synthesized by Genosys. RecA protein and M13 DNA were purified, and concentrations were determined as described (20Gourves A.S. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9613-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Cazaux C. Blanchet J.S. Dupuis D. Villani G. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28799-28804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RecA concentration units are M protein monomer; oligonucleotide concentrations are m nt. TMDG buffer is 20 mm Tris acetate, 2 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5. Unless otherwise stated, nucleotide filaments were prepared with stoichiometry of 3/1 nt/RecA protein in TMDG buffer at 25 °C ± 1 °C; concentration units of the filament are m nt. In a typical experiment, nucleoprotein complex in the absence of cofactor was prepared and equilibrated in the cuvette, cofactor was added at the beginning of the reaction, t = 0 s, and fluorescence signal followed for 1000 s. Manual mixing time for addition of cofactor was 15 s. Fluorescence experiments were performed using a model MOS-400 spectrophotometer from Bio-Logic (Claix, France). Measurements were taken of samples in a 1.0 × 0.4-cm cuvette stirred continuously at the indicated temperature ± 1 °C. To maximize sensitivity, a single polarizer configuration was used to determine fluorescence anisotropy, A, and fluorescence intensity, Fl (V) (22Canet D. Doering K. Dobson C.M. Dupont Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1996-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fluorescence is reported as quenching, Q = 1 − (Fl/Flo) where Flo is the signal from oligonucleotide alone. Samples were excited at 490 nm, and total emission intensity was measured at 1-s intervals using a 515-nm cutoff filter. We first wished to show that dissociation and reassociation of the RecA nucleoprotein filament can be studied by fluorescence anisotropy. The fluorescence signals of various complexes of 1.0 μm5′-fluorescein 32-mer oligonucleotide and 0.33 μm RecA protein are shown in Fig. 1. Fluorescence anisotropy of free oligonucleotide in the absence of RecA was A = 0.05 ± 0.005. Anisotropy of the 3/1 nt/RecA complex without cofactor was A = 0.19 ± 0.005 and fluorescence quenching was 0.3 ± 0.05. Addition of ADP to this complex decreased the anisotropy to 0.05, the same value as free oligonucleotide; fluorescence quenching decreased to 0.025, and these spectroscopic signals did not change with time. NaCl decreased the anisotropy and fluorescence quenching of the 3/1 complex of oligonucleotide and RecA protein in absence of cofactor, while the signal of the corresponding filament in the presence of ATPγS was stable in 800 mmsalt (not shown). ADP is known to destabilize the RecA protein-DNA complex, while ATPγS stabilizes it with respect to salt denaturation (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Hence these fluorescence signals measure known effects of cofactor and salt on the formation and stability of the 3/1 nt/RecA nucleoprotein filament. When ATPγS was added to the filament without cofactor, the anisotropy signal decreased. In this experiment, the intensity att = 0 s, which is defined as the beginning of measurement after mixing, was A = 0.12 and signal gradually increased over 15 min to A = 0.19 (Fig. 1 c). In the same experiment quenching decreased immediately after addition of ATPγS to 0.2; signal then increased for about 50 s to Q = 0.26 and thereafter slowly decreased to Q = 0.22. After addition of ATP, the anisotropy and fluorescence signals initially decreased; signals then increased for about 50 s in these experiments and subsequently decreased. The time-dependent spectroscopic signals observed for the reaction with ATP are consistent with a combination of cofactor binding followed by hydrolysis to ADP. To further understand the kinetic effects brought about by nucleoside triphosphate binding (separate from its hydrolysis), we investigated the reaction with ATPγS. If the decrease in fluorescence anisotropy produced by the addition of ATPγS (Fig. 1 c) was caused by cofactor-induced dissociation, the resulting free RecA protein should react with competitive nonfluorescent DNA. To test this hypothesis, various concentrations of M13 phage ssDNA were added with ATPγS at the beginning of the reaction (Fig. 2). The decrease in the anisotropy and fluorescence quenching signals att = 0 s caused by addition of ATPγS was not influenced by 0–4 μm competitor DNA. However, the recovery of fluorescence signals was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. Adding 10 μmnonfluorescent ssDNA at the end of the reaction caused a small decrease in the anisotropy and no change in the quenching (not shown), indicating that once it is formed the ATPγS-RecA nucleoprotein filament was not significantly perturbed by competitor DNA. These results support the hypothesis that addition of ATPγS dissociated protein molecules from the 3/1 oligonucleotide/RecA complex. The anisotropy increase following this dissociation (designatedt > 0 s, Fig. 1 c) could be caused by reassociation of RecA protein with DNA. To test this possibility, we compared two reactions (Fig. 3). First, addition of cofactor to a 3/1 nt/RecA complex led to a decrease in the anisotropy followed by recovery of signal as in Fig. 1 c. Second, for the same concentrations of reactants, RecA protein and ATPγS were added to fluorescent oligonucleotide. For this reaction, the anisotropy of the oligonucleotide alone was 0.05 and signal increased after addition of RecA as protein bound to oligonucleotide. The increased anisotropy and fluorescence quenching changes were the same for the two reactions. These results were confirmed in eight independent experiments using 3/1 nt/RecA complexes made with 0.5–10 μm nt. Hence the increase in fluorescence anisotropy observed after addition of cofactor corresponds to the reaction of RecA-ATPγS with fluorescent oligonucleotide. The kinetics of the dissociation-reassociation reaction were unchanged for ATPγS concentrations above 15 μm. To study the requirement of the reaction for ATPγS, 0–10 μm ATPγS were added to a 3/1-nt/RecA complex, 1 μm nt (Fig4). The anisotropy at t = 0 s decreased from A = 0.2 to A = 0.15 as ATPγS concentrations increased from 0 to 2 μm. Binding of RecA protein to oligonucleotide was greater without ATPγS or for ATPγS concentrations > 10 μm than for intermediate concentrations. Low concentrations of ATPγS would be expected to produce a mixture of RecA molecules with and without ATPγS. These results show that binding of such a mixed population of RecA molecules to single-stranded DNA was qualitatively different than for either species by itself (see “Discussion”). Complexes of 3/1 nt/RecA containing from 0.5 μm to 10 μm oligonucleotide were prepared, ATPγS was added, and the anisotropy and fluorescence quenching were observed as a function of time (Fig. 5). The effect of filament concentration on several features of the anisotropy kinetic curves is shown in Fig. 6 a. In absence of ATPγS, 3/1 RecA/nt formed a complex at high filament concentrations with A = 0.21 ± 0.005 and Q = 0.35 ± 0.05 (designatedt < 0 s, Fig. 5; circles, Fig. 6 a). These spectroscopic values correspond to a complex in which fluorescent oligonucleotide is saturated by RecA protein (20Gourves A.S. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9613-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic signals of this complex decreased for oligonucleotide concentrations below 2.0 μm. The simplest explanation of this observation would be that oligonucleotide and protein dissociate at low concentrations of filament.Figure 6a, anisotropy values of different parts of the kinetic curves in Fig. 5 a.

At all concentrations the value of anisotropy was significantly less than the signal observed for the reactant or the product complexes. These results show that reassociation after addition of ATPγS occurred in two kinetically distinct steps. A rapid reaction formed a stable intermediate. Kinetics of this reaction could be observed at sufficiently low filament concentration. At concentrations above 2.5 μm this reaction was completed during the mixing time of the experiment. This intermediate evolved slowly to give the final product that had the same anisotropy as the initial filament (Fig. 6 a,triangles). Spectroscopic properties of the various stages of the reaction are summarized in TableI.Table ISteady state spectroscopic parameters of 3/1 oligonucleotide/RecA protein complexesTime1-aTime at which spectroscopic parameters were determined from kinetic curves (Fig. 5, 6 a) for filament concentration > 2.5 μm nt.Species1-bAbbreviations for various RecA oligonucleotide complexes (Fig. 8).Fluorescence quenchingAnisotropyt < 0 sRF0.35 ± 0.050.21 ± 0.005t = 0 sRgF0.30 ± 0.050.17 ± 0.01t = 1000 sRgF′0.23 ± 0.050.21 ± 0.0051-a Time at which spectroscopic parameters were determined from kinetic curves (Fig. 5, 6 a) for filament concentration > 2.5 μm nt.1-b Abbreviations for various RecA oligonucleotide complexes (Fig. 8). Open table in a new tab The anisotropy of the product filament decreased below 2.5 μm complex in a manner similar to the filament without cofactor (compare circles and triangles, Fig. 6 a). These results suggest that the filament with ATPγS dissociated at low concentrations. To test this hypothesis, we prepared 4.8 μm 3/1 nt/RecA complex in the presence of 100 μm ATPγS and either i) diluted this complex into buffer with 100 μm ATPγS or ii) titrated this buffer with the complex (Fig. 6 b). In both cases, fluorescence anisotropy decreased at low filament concentrations and results were superimposable on data in Fig. 6 a. Hence the equilibrium constant for binding of RecA protein to ssDNA can be determined in the presence of ATPγS in these reaction conditions. Equilibrium constants for the reaction between RecA protein and ssDNA have not been measured in the presence of ATPγS because significant concentrations of free protein were not previously observed. Dissociation was apparently enhanced in our experiments by dilution and by using short oligonucleotide substrate that presumably would have less cooperative interactions between protein monomers than a filament on longer ssDNA. The binding constant can be estimated from the filament concentration at which 50% of the oligonucleotide is bound, [F] (mnt), by the relation (23Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar),1/Kω=[F]/2Equation 1 where K is the intrinsic binding constant of a protein monomer and ω is the cooperativity factor. Data in Fig. 6 indicate that 1/Kω = 10−7 (m nt) at 25 °C in TMDG buffer. In the absence of cofactor, the anisotropy and the fluorescence quenching of the 3/1 nt/RecA protein complex, 1 μm oligonucleotide, decreased slowly over 15 min at 37 °C. This reaction was inhibited by lower temperatures (Fig. 7 a) and by higher filament concentration (not shown). It is likely due, at least in part, to dissociation of oligonucleotide and aggregation of free protein (see below). After addition of ATPγS to this complex, RecA protein reassociated with oligonucleotide in a biphasic reaction similar to that observed at 25 °C. The nucleoprotein complex formed in the absence of ATPγS appeared to be unstable at low Mg2+ concentrations. Addition of 0.167 μm RecA protein to 0.5 μm fluorescent oligonucleotide at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and no Mg2+ initially produced a filament with A = 0.16 and Q = 0.3. The anisotropy and fluorescence quenching subsequently decreased during 15 min to A = 0.07, Q = 0.12. The decrease was less apparent at higher filament concentration;e.g. for a 2 μm complex, spectroscopy signals decreased less than 10%. Similar instability was also apparent under certain conditions in standard buffer. For example, a slow decrease of anisotropy from A = 0.18 to A = 0.1 was observed in TMDG buffer for 3/1 nt/RecA complexes with 1 μm nt at 37 °C (Fig. 7 a) but not at 25 °C (Fig. 1 a). The effect of low Mg2+ concentration was reversible. Addition of 15 mm Mg(CH3COO)2 20 min after incubation of the complex at 25 °C in the absence of Mg2+ restored the 3/1 complex as well as the ATPγS-induced dissociation and reassociation reactions. The instability of the 3/1 complex in the absence of cofactor and Mg2+ may be due to slow aggregation of free protein into a nonproductive complex as previously reported (24Morrical S.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that high Mg2+ concentrations dissociate the presynaptic complex (20Gourves A.S. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9613-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Addition of NaCl favored the ATPγS-induced dissociation reaction (Fig. 7 b, t = 0 s) as expected from known salt effects on filament stability (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Gourves A.S. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9613-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NaCl also inhibited the reassociation reaction with 50% inhibition observed for 250 mm NaCl. In contrast, addition of these concentrations of NaCl at the end of the reaction did not greatly decrease the anisotropy of product filament, as previously reported (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); for example, addition of 1 m NaCl to the product filament with 1 μmnt decreased the anisotropy from 0.18 to 0.14. Hence salt concentrations that inhibited formation of the ATPγS-RecA-oligonucleotide complex did not destabilize the complex once it was formed. Similar results were observed using etheno-modified M13 DNA (not shown). The preceding results indicate that a mechanism for the reaction of ATPγS with the 3/1 nt/RecA filament would include at least the following elements (Fig. 8). i) Prior to addition of ATPγS, free RecA protein (R) and fluorescent oligonucleotide (F) are in equilibrium with the nucleoprotein complex (RF) (reaction 1). ii) The slow dissociation of RF, which was observed in the absence of Mg2+, indicates a competitive reaction in which free RecA formed aggregates (24Morrical S.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that can not bind to the oligonucleotide (reaction 2). iii) Reaction of ATPγS with free RecA dissociates the 3/1 nt/RecA filament (reaction 3, see “Discussion”). iv) Subsequently RecA-ATPγS (Rg) binds to the oligonucleotide to form a stable reaction intermediate RgF (reaction 4). v) The product of reaction 4 is slowly transformed into the final product RgF′ (reaction 5). At low filament concentrations, an equilibrium was also observed between free RecA protein and product filament in the presence of ATPγS (Fig. 6 b). Time-dependent spectroscopic signals were analyzed in an attempt to determine the rate constants for the association reactions 4 and 5. Kinetics were studied for addition of ATPγS to 1 μm filament. Reaction 5 was approximated as a first order process (see below). Rate constants were determined for the mechanism shown in Fig. 9 a, which further assumes that the binding of RecA is a two-step reaction between free protein, Rg, and oligonucleotide, F. Kinetic equations were solved numerically (25Otto M.R. Lillo M.P. Beechem J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2511-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)Fl(t)=Σci(t)qiEquation 2 A(t)=[Σci(t)qiAi/[Σci(t)qi]where A(t) and F(t) are the time-dependent anisotropy and fluorescence. ci(t) are the concentrations of fluorescent species i (μm nt) calculated from the equation in Fig. 9 A. Ai and qi are the anisotropy and effective quantum yields of each species; the latter was approximated by fluorescence intensity (25Otto M.R. Lillo M.P. Beechem J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2511-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Calculations were carried out as follows. i) Initial values of Ai and qi were determined from steady state parameters, Table I; the spectroscopic signals of free oligonucleotide were kept constant, A = 0.05, Fl = 0.375 V. ii) Rate constants for the forward and reverse steps of reaction 4, k 4f andk 4r, and for the first order reaction 5 were adjusted to visually fit the experimental data (Fig. 9 B, Table II).Table IIKinetic parameters for the reaction, Fig. 9Species2-aAbbreviations for various RecA oligonucleotide complexes (see Fig. 8).qi(V)Fluorescence quenchingAnisotropy AiRate constantF0.3750.00.05RgF0.2660.290.165RgF′0.2850.250.191k 4f21 (μm nt min)−1k 4r0.18 min−1k 50.36 min−12-a Abbreviations for various RecA oligonucleotide complexes (see Fig. 8). Open table in a new tab Good agreement between experimental and theoretical curves was observed for data t > 150 s, k 5 = 0.36 min−1. The rate constant for the second step of the reaction was confirmed by nine additional experiments in which ATPγS was added to 3/1 nt/RecA complexes containing 2–8 μmfilament, conditions where only this reaction was observed (Fig. 6 a); anisotropy kinetic curves in these experiments were identical, indicating a reaction mechanism that was independent of filament concentration. These curves could be fit by a single exponential with average rate ± S.D., k 5 = 0.4 ± 0.1 min−1. A concentration-independent rate constant indicates that neither protein binding nor aggregation contributes significantly to the time-dependent spectroscopic signals. Hence the increased anisotropy and fluorescence that occur during the second step of the reaction (Fig. 9) appear to be caused by a process other than protein binding, such as a conformational change (see “Discussion”). The rate constant for the second step of the reaction was independent of temperature between 25 °C and 37 °C (Table III).Table IIIRate constants for the second association reaction, k5 (see Fig. 8) at different temperaturesFilament concentrationTemperaturek 5 ± 0.063-aRate constants and uncertainty were determined from the best exponential fit using the program KaleidaGraph.μm nt°Cmin−11.0250.180.360.241.0310.300.241.0370.300.300.243.0370.300.363-a Rate constants and uncertainty were determined from the best exponential fit using the program KaleidaGraph. Open table in a new tab Fit of the early part of the reaction was poor, and rate constants were not consistent with Kω obtained from the dissociation of the filament at low concentrations (Fig. 6 b). The DNA binding reaction 4 probably needs to be represented by another mechanism than a simple two-state process. For example, the reaction of RecA protein with ssDNA can be analyzed in the general context of cooperative binding between a ligand with a finite binding site size and a one-dimensional lattice (26McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 27Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This formalism shows that binding is a function of the size of the binding site, cooperative interactions, and effects of oligonucleotide extremities as well as the association constant. Equilibrium binding parameters for the reaction of RecA protein with ssDNA have been previously determined by this method (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 16Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 288-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but a kinetic formalism has not been developed to our knowledge. E. coli RecA protein forms a nucleoprotein filament with ssDNA in the presence of ATPγS, 3 nt/RecA monomer, which is able to carry out the initial steps of homologous recombination in vitro and is considered to be a good model for the presynaptic complex (8Rosselli W. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We have investigated this RecA nucleoprotein filament using the fluorescence anisotropy of a 5′-fluorescein-labeled 32-mer oligonucleotide. This method is sensitive to hydrodynamic properties of the fluorophore (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 112-150Google Scholar), and consequently the fluorescence anisotropy of the oligonucleotide increases with RecA binding (20Gourves A.S. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9613-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that addition of nucleoside triphosphate to the nucleoprotein filament can cause its dissociation under some conditions as previously suggested from biochemical experiments (18Cox M.M. Soltis D.A. Lehman I.R. DeBrosse C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2586-2592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7677-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the spectroscopic measurements showed a two-step association reaction between RecA and ssDNA. The most important result of this study is the observation of a previously unknown intermediate in the polymerization of RecA protein on ssDNA that we will attempt to define in this Discussion. Polymerization of RecA protein on the oligonucleotide in the presence of ATPγS took place in two steps. In the first, fluorescence was quenched by 0.30 ± 0.05 and fluorescence anisotropy increased from 0.05 to 0.17 ± 0.005 (Fig. 6 a, Table I). Kinetics of this reaction could be observed below filament concentrations of 2 μm nt; at higher concentrations the reaction was complete in the mixing time of the experiments, 15 s (Figs. 5,6 a). In the second step of the reaction the anisotropy increased to 0.21 ± 0.005 and fluorescence quenching decreased to 0.23 ± 0.05. The rate of this reaction was independent of filament concentration (Fig. 5) and temperature (Table III),k 5 = 0.3 ± 0.1 min−1. Concentration-independent kinetics indicate that neither aggregation nor protein binding contribute significantly to the reaction. The fluorescence measurements give some information about the relative physical properties of the reaction intermediate and the product. Both filaments appear to have quantitatively bound RecA protein at filament concentrations above 2 μm (Fig. 6 a). However, the intermediate is more hydrodynamically mobile judging from its lower anisotropy (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 112-150Google Scholar). RecA protein is known to extend the nucleoprotein filament (12Flory J. Radding C.M. Cell. 1982; 28: 747-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Dunn K. Chrysogelos S. Griffith J.D. Cell. 1982; 28: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Stasiak A. Di Capua E. Nature. 1982; 299: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). An increased mobility of the intermediate could be explained if it had a smaller persistence length than the product filament. Low concentrations of ATPγS decreased the anisotropy of the nucleoprotein filament, while higher concentrations of ATPγS restored anisotropy (Fig. 4). The maximum decrease was observed for 2 μm ATPγS. In these conditions the anisotropy of the complex was reduced to A = 0.15 ± 0.01, which corresponds to the anisotropy of the polymerization intermediate described above (Fig. 6 a). This filament was stable for at least 15 min. Although the equilibrium constants for the reaction between RecA protein and nucleotide cofactors are not known, sufficiently low concentrations of the nucleoside triphosphate should give two populations of RecA protein, with and without ATPγS. Hence, these results suggest that the intermediate filament formed during the polymerization reaction may have a conformation similar to a mixed filament containing RecA molecules with and without ATPγS. The low anisotropy of this latter filament could be explained if relatively rigid segments of polymerized RecA (R) and RecA-ATPγS (Rg) were separated by flexible “hinges” caused by the incompatible protein-protein interactions between R and Rg monomers (29Logan K.M. Forget A.L. Verderese J.P. Knight K.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11382-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). At high ATPγS concentrations, cofactor would bind to all protein and the more rigid product filament would form via reaction 5 (Figs. 4 and 8). This reaction is apparently inhibited in a filament containing a mixed population of RecA monomers with and without cofactor. These considerations suggest that a rearrangement takes place in the slow step of the polymerization reaction that increases the persistence length of the filament (reaction 5 in Fig. 8). Reported kinetics of ATP hydrolysis suggest a possible mechanism for this process. Using a combination of intrinsic protein fluorescence and ATP hydrolysis measurements, Paulus and Bryant demonstrated a two step mechanism for ATP hydrolysis in similar reaction conditions to those used in our experiments (31Paulus B.F. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7832-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Rapid binding of ATP is followed by rate-limiting “isomerization” of the filament. When ATPγS is used in the reaction, isomerization is observed without hydrolysis. ATPγS hydrolyzes in these conditions but the rate, k = 0.01 min−1, is too slow to contribute to our reaction 5. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis of ATP hydrolysis and its inhibition by ATPγS showed that the forward rate constant for the isomerization reaction is the same as that for ATP hydrolysis, k = 20 min−1 at 37 °C. Hence in our reaction, this isomerization has likely occurred in the intermediate complex. The reverse rate for the isomerization, k′ = 0.1–0.2 min−1corresponds well to the rate constant for the slow reaction observed in our experiments, k 5 (Tables II and III). These results suggest that reversal of isomerization is required for the transition from the flexible intermediate to the more rigid product. To summarize, we present spectroscopic evidence for a previously unknown intermediate in the reaction that forms the RecA nucleoprotein filament in the presence of ATPγS. Fluorescent anisotropy measurements indicate that the intermediate is less rigid than the final product. It has anisotropy similar to mixed filaments of extended and condensed RecA monomers observed at low ATPγS concentrations. However, the intermediate is observed in the presence of a large excess of nucleotide cofactor, and presumably all RecA monomers are in the extended conformation. The greater flexibility of the intermediate filament might result from some sort of incorrect binding between relatively rigid segments of polymerized RgF (Fig. 8). This defect could be due to faulty protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions at the site between the segments. Our preferred hypothesis is that polymerization may initiate from multiple sites on the oligonucleotide and leave gaps of 1 or 2 nt between adjacent polymerization events, which are too small to react with RecA, whose binding site size is 3 nt (2Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism responsible for this flexibility, it disappears by the slow second step of the reaction. Comparing the rate of this process with published data (31Paulus B.F. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7832-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) suggests that reversal of the nucleoside triphosphate dependent isomerization of the RecA filament is required to reshuffle RecA monomers in the filament to form a more rigid structure. Taken together these results also show that the 32-mer oligonucleotide-RecA complex studied here can exist in two forms with different hydrodynamic properties. The more rigid form was observed (i) in filaments without cofactor and (ii) for the product filament in presence of ATPγS. The more flexible structure was observed (iii) during the polymerization reaction in presence of ATPγS and (iv) in mixed filaments of RecA protein with and without ATPγS. We argue that flexibility is caused by a break between segments of polymerized RecA protein. In the reaction intermediate (iii), the break is probably due to a discontinuity in the polymer, perhaps the result of multiple polymerization events. In the mixed filament (iv), the break likely comes from the inability of extended and condensed RecA monomers to form adequate protein-protein interactions for polymerization (29Logan K.M. Forget A.L. Verderese J.P. Knight K.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11382-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A transition between filament conformations with different mobilities such these could be coupled to ATP hydrolysis. RecA monomers are released from the nucleoprotein filament during ATP hydrolysis, albeit with a low efficiency compared with the hydrolysis rate (32Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis can introduce conformational changes that alter protein-protein interactions between adjacent RecA monomers (29.30). Either of these effects could introduce a flexible hinge in the filament at the site of ATP hydrolysis thereby introducing local segmental mobility, which could play a role in homologous recombination."
