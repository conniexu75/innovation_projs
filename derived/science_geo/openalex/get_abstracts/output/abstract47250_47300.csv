https://openalex.org/W1555943967,"Abstract Trigramin, a highly specific inhibitor of fibrinogen binding to platelet receptors, was purified to homogeneity from Trimeresurus gramineus snake venom. Trigramin is a single chain (approximately 9 kDa) cysteine-rich peptide with the Glu-Ala-Gly-Glu-Asp-Cys-Asp-Cys-Gly-Ser-Pro-Ala NH2-terminal sequence. Chymotryptic fragmentation showed the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence in trigramin. Trigramin inhibited fibrinogen-induced aggregation of platelets stimulated by ADP (IC50 = 1.3 X 10(-7)M) and aggregation of chymotrypsin-treated platelets. It did not affect the platelet secretion. Trigramin was a competitive inhibitor of the 125I-fibrinogen binding to ADP-stimulated platelets (Ki = 2 X 10(-8) M). 125I-Trigramin bound to resting platelets (Kd = 1.7 X 10(-7) M; n = 16,500), to ADP-stimulated platelets (Kd = 2.1 X 10(-8) M; n = 17,600), and to chymotrypsin-treated platelets (Kd = 8.8 X 10(-8) M; n = 13,800) in a saturable manner. The number of 125I-trigramin binding sites on thrombasthenic platelets amounted to 2.7-5.4% of control values obtained for normal platelets and correlated with the reduced number of GPIIb-GPIIIa molecules on the platelet surface. EDTA, monoclonal antibodies directed against the GPIIb-GPIIIa complex, and synthetic peptides (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and Tyr-Gly-Gln-Gln-His-His-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val) blocked both 125I-fibrinogen binding and 125I-trigramin binding to platelets. Fibrinogen binding was more readily inhibited by these compounds than was trigramin binding. Monoclonal antibodies directed either against GPIIb or GPIIIa molecules did not block the interaction of either ligand with platelets. Reduced, S-pyridylethyl, trigramin did not inhibit platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding to platelets and it did not bind to platelets, suggesting that the secondary structure of this molecule is critical for expression of its biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2157680057,"To identify the rate-limiting step(s) in the hepatic production of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), we investigated the intracellular distribution and rate of intracellular transport of de novo synthesized apolipoprotein B (apoB). For all secretory proteins examined (i.e. albumin, large molecular weight apoB, and small molecular weight apoB) the rough and smooth microsomes contained the majority of intracellular de novo synthesized protein, while the Golgi subfraction contained 10% or less. Pulse-chase analysis of the intracellular movement of apoB and albumin showed that the first order rate constant (in terms of half-life) describing the rate of movement out of the smooth and rough microsomes determined the overall rate of movement out of the cell. These data suggest that movement out of the endoplasmic reticulum, the site where VLDL is assembled, determines the overall rate of secretion. Furthermore, compared to albumin, the rate of intracellular transport of apoB was approximately two times slower suggesting that processing unique to VLDL apoB occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum was responsible. Additional studies show that essentially all of the de novo synthesized 35S-labeled albumin (produced from a pulse of [35S]methionine) lost from the cell during the chase period could be recovered in the culture medium. In contrast, much less of large molecular weight apoB (36%) and small molecular weight apoB (60%) was recovered in the culture medium. Since these cultured rat hepatocytes do not take up or degrade newly secreted apoB, these data suggest that a significant amount of apoB is degraded intracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W1499478787,"The nonenzymatic glycosylation (glycation) of Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase led to gradual inactivation of the enzyme (Arai, K. Iizuka, S., Tada, Y., Oikawa, K., and Taniguchi, N. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 924, 292-296). The purified superoxide dismutase from human erythrocytes comprises both glycated and nonglycated forms. The nonglycated Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase was isolated by boronate affinity chromatography. Incubation of the nonglycated superoxide dismutase with D-[6-3H]glucose in vitro resulted in the gradual accumulation of radioactivity in the enzyme protein, and Schiff base adducts were trapped by NaBH4. The sites of glycation of the superoxide dismutase were identified by amino acid analysis after reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the trypsin-treated peptides. Lysine residues, i.e. Lys3, Lys9, Lys30, Lys36, Lys122, and Lys128, were found to be glycated. Three of the glycated sites lie in Lys-Gly, two in Lys-Ala, and one in Lys-Val. The inactivation of the superoxide dismutase on the glycation is due mainly to the glycation of Lys122 and Lys128, which are supposed to be located in an active site liganding loop. The remaining five sites, such as Lys-Glu, Lys-Asp, Lys-His, and Lys-Thr are relatively inactive as to the formation of either a Schiff base or an Amadori adduct."
https://openalex.org/W1515444383,"One characteristic of type C Niemann-Pick (NPC) disease is the substantial intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. The increased cholesterol content in NPC fibroblasts which are grown in the presence of low density lipoproteins (LDL) has been postulated to be due to a deficiency in cellular cholesterol esterification. We have examined several aspects of LDL metabolism in NPC fibroblasts. We observe that LDL binding, internalization, and lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl esters are normal in NPC cells. As reported by Pentchev et al. (Pentchev, P. G., Comly, M. E., Kruth, H. S., Vanier, M. T., Wenger, D. A., Patel, S., and Brady, R. O. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 8247-8251), we find that LDL does not stimulate cholesterol esterification. However, we also show that LDL does not down-regulate cholesterol synthesis or LDL receptor activity as normal. In NPC cells, these processes are regulated normally by nonlipoprotein effectors, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonate. Since NPC cells are not defective in lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-derived cholesteryl esters, they must exhibit a different defect than Wolman's or cholesteryl ester storage diseases. We conclude that NPC cells are defective specifically in LDL-mediated regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism. We suggest that the intracellular processing of LDL-derived cholesterol may be defective in NPC fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1525114741,"Fractionation of octyl glucoside-solubilized proteins from young rat brain was monitored using rat brain neurons, which were cultured in microwells coated with various protein fractions to be studied. An adhesive protein that promotes neurite outgrowth in rat brain neurons was isolated by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose followed by Affi-Gel blue. The apparent molecular mass of the protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions was about 30 kilodaltons (p30). Under nonreducing conditions a closely spaced doublet band was observed corresponding to 27-28-kilodalton size. Gel filtration in the presence of 4 M urea indicated the molecular size of 58 kilodaltons suggesting a dimeric structure. Western blotting experiments using affinity-purified rabbit antibodies detected p30 as an immunochemically distinct protein in brain and in N18 neuroblastoma cells. The p30 protein was also detected in the N18 cells by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed cell surface iodination. Western blotting of heparin-binding proteins solubilized from brains of rats of various age groups indicated that p30 is clearly more abundant in perinatal brain as compared to adult tissue. The neuron-binding and neurite outgrowth-promoting properties of p30 as well as the developmental regulation of its content in brain tissue suggest a role in neuronal growth."
https://openalex.org/W1598674460,"Abstract A di-(carboxamidomethyl) derivative of molybdopterin, the organic component of the molybdenum cofactor, has been prepared under conditions favoring retention of all of the structural features of the molecule. The specific radioactivity of [1-14C]iodoacetamide incorporated relative to the amount of phosphate indicated two alkylation sites per pterin. Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis of the derivative showed the presence of 2 sulfurs in the derivative. An exact mass corresponding to the molecular formula C14H18N7O5S2 was obtained for the MH+ ion of the alkylated, dephosphorylated compound by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy. 1H NMR spectra of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of alkylated molybdopterin, in conjunction with the other data, have provided strong corroboration of the validity of the proposed structure of molybdopterin (Johnson, J. L., and Rajagopalan, K. V. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6856-6860) as a 6-alkylpterin with a 4-carbon side chain containing an enedithiol on C-1' and C-2', a secondary alcohol on C-3', and a phosphorylated primary alcohol on C-4'. As isolated, the di-(carboxamido-methyl)molybdopterin was found to be a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin."
https://openalex.org/W1552536758,"The purposes of the present study were to investigate the characteristics and regulation of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in pancreatic acini and to demonstrate the role of this Ca2+ influx in the mechanism of reloading of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool. In pancreatic acini, depleted of intracellular Ca2+ by stimulation with carbachol in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, 25 microM LaCl3 inhibited the increase in free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool that occurred with the addition of extracellular CaCl2 to the medium. LaCl3 also inhibited the increase in cellular 45Ca2+ uptake that occurred during agonist stimulation and its termination but not cellular 45Ca2+ uptake into unstimulated acini. In acini depleted of intracellular Ca2+, increased cellular Ca2+ influx and reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool occurred even if extracellular CaCl2 was added 10 min after the termination of agonist action. Maximal reloading was independent of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration between 0.5 and 2.0 mM CaCl2. However, the time to maximal reloading was longer at lower extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. These results demonstrate a plasma membrane Ca2+ influx mechanism in the pancreatic acinar cell that is activated during cell stimulation. This transport remains activated as long as the agonist-sensitive pool is not completely loaded with Ca2+ suggesting that the Ca2+ influx mechanism is regulated by the quantity of Ca2+ in the agonist-sensitive pool. The activation of this Ca2+ transport mechanism functions to allow Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and Ca2+ reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool. Furthermore, these results suggest that during reloading Ca2+ crosses the plasma membrane into the cytosol before entering the agonist-sensitive pool."
https://openalex.org/W1486808382,"Subconfluent cultures of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transformed by the Ha-ras, Ki-v-ras, v-src, and v-fms oncogene proteins all possess elevated steady-state levels of diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator of protein kinase C, as compared to the nontransformed parental lines. These oncogene-transformed fibroblasts also exhibit a significantly decreased level of cellular protein kinase C activity as measured by four different criteria: phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation of an endogenous 80-kilodalton (80 kDa) substrate; phorbol ester-stimulated changes in 86Rb uptake; enzymatic assay; and [3H]phorbol ester binding. In all cases, the transformed cells demonstrated an attenuated response to phorbol ester addition and a lower phorbol ester binding capacity as compared to the parental lines. Western analysis of the endogenous 80-kDa substrate of protein kinase C revealed a significantly lower level of this protein in the transformed cells than in the untransformed controls, and this decrease could be mimicked in parental cells by long-term incubation with phorbol esters, suggesting that the level of the 80-kDa protein is regulated by the state of activation of protein kinase C. These effects do not appear to be nonspecific responses to autocrine secretions by the transformed cells. They may represent an unsuccessful attempt by the transformed cells to negatively modulate the constitutive proliferative signals generated by the oncogene products."
https://openalex.org/W1613128607,"Cultured chromaffin cells can be permeabilized with digitonin; the cell interior is then accessible to the cytoplasm, and addition of calcium provokes release of catecholamines. Increasing the incubation time between the permeabilization step and calcium-induced stimulation resulted in a progressive inhibition of secretion reaching 60% after 20 min. Cytosoluble proteins which leak from detergent-permeabilized cells were collected, dialyzed, and concentrated. When these proteins were added back to permeabilized cells which were unable to secrete, catecholamine release was fully restored, suggesting that certain proteins necessary for exocytosis had been dialyzed from these cells. One of the released proteins was characterized as calmodulin. However, addition of calmodulin alone was ineffective in maintaining or restoring secretory activity in digitonin-permeabilized cells, excluding calmodulin as the sole factor responsible for the loss of release. Protein kinase C was also identified as one of the leaked proteins. This enzyme is known to be retained in cells in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). However, under TPA-dependent conditions, there was also a loss of secretory activity. The present paper shows that among the proteins leaked from digitonin-permeabilized cells, there are specific proteins crucial to the exocytotic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1515512355,"Abstract Recombinant clones containing the promoter region of the human insulin receptor gene were isolated from genomic libraries derived from nondiabetic persons. A 1.5-kilobase pair fragment of the 5'-flanking region was sequenced. One transcriptional start site, located at 203 bases upstream from the start of translation was identified by nuclease S1 mapping and the primer extension experiment using the human insulin receptor mRNA. The bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that a 573-base pair fragment immediately preceding the ATG has promoter activity and that the transcript initiates from the normal start site of the insulin receptor gene in the COS cells. The promoter region contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box, has an extremely high G + C content, and contains seven central components of potential Sp 1 binding sites (GGGCGG or CCGCCC). These features are common to those found in the regulatory regions of a class of constitutively expressed housekeeping genes. A comparison between the promoter sequence of the human insulin receptor and those of other housekeeping genes revealed the presence of homologous sequences among these genes, in addition to the potential Sp 1 binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1656352899,"We (Kligman, D., and Patel, J. (1986) J. Neurochem. 47, 298-303) and others have previously identified a major protein kinase C substrate of apparent molecular weight 87,000 (Mr 87,000). To gain insight into the function of this potentially important phosphoprotein, we have undertaken its purification and characterization from rat brain. We now report a purification scheme involving heat treatment, ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion ion-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography. This procedure gave a Mr 87,000 that was homogeneous (based on silver staining), 1,600-fold enriched relative to heat-treated material and at a yield of approximately 58 micrograms/kg wet weight. We also report the amino acid composition to be high in acidic residues and in alanine and show the protein to be phosphorylated on serine residues with a stoichiometry of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of substrate. The subcellular distribution indicates Mr 87,000 is present in two forms, membrane-bound and soluble. The membrane-bound Mr 87,000 represents 45% of the total phosphoprotein content and is enriched in microsomal and synaptic membranes. Ontogenic study has revealed this protein to be developmentally regulated, with the highest concentrations of Mr 87,000 found in prenatal animals. The availability of a purification procedure should greatly facilitate further structural characterization and elucidation of the function of Mr 87,000."
https://openalex.org/W1512698829,"These studies assess the metabolic source and fate of cellular 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), an intermediate that increases with physiologic stimulation, participates in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, and acts as a substrate for arachidonic acid release. The quantitation of the molecular species of DAG and one of its metabolic products, phosphatidic acid (PA), was assessed in the purified rat mast cell, a model system with marked quantitative constraints but with rapid and extensive secretion after receptor stimulation. Cellular DAG was extracted, partially purified, radioactively phosphorylated to form [32P]PA, and, after conversion to its dimethyl phosphoric acid ester, molecular species separations were undertaken using reversed phase HPLC and/or argentation TLC. Quantitation of 0.5 pmol of a single molecular species of cellular DAG was achieved, but HPLC was not alone sufficient to resolve all molecular species of interest. More importantly, comparison of mast cell DAG with [32P]PA generated in 32Pi-prelabeled cells revealed that the sub-classes that contained arachidonic acid species represent only 11% of the total DAG, while that of [32P]PA was 41% in resting cells. [32P]PA and, to a variable extent, DAG showed preferential increases in arachidonate-containing subclasses after stimulation (to 50.9 and 13.9%, respectively). These data suggest that a large portion of the increased mass of DAG seen during stimulation was probably not derived by phosphoinositide hydrolysis. This type of molecular species analysis of intermediates of important phospholipid metabolic pathways should help to establish the metabolic origin and fate of these and other compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1548699146,"Initiation of flagellar motility in spermatozoa of the rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, is closely related to phosphorylation of a protein of molecular mass 15 kDa (Morisawa, M., and Hayashi, H. (1986) Biomed. Res. 6, 181-184). We have been able to solubilize the protein and its kinase and then construct an assay system in vitro for the phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein. In vitro, the protein was phosphorylated in a cAMP-dependent manner. The phosphorylation absolutely required the presence of Mg2+ ions. at millimolar concentrations, but not of Ca2+ ions. The amino acid residue which was phosphorylated in the 15-kDa protein was tyrosine. The 15-kDa protein was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a column of adenosine nucleotides conjugated to Eupergit and ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The effects of synthetic inhibitors of protein kinase on the phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein were also studied."
https://openalex.org/W2411404145,"When the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor was solubilized from bovine adrenal cortex membranes and subjected to electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agents, a disulfide-bonded dimeric species was demonstrated. Formation of these covalent bonds was blocked when the tissue was homogenized in the presence of sulfhydryl alkylating agents, indicating that the native receptor was self-associated noncovalently and that the disulfide bond formation occurred only after homogenization. The disulfide-linked dimers were disrupted and the receptor was restored to a monomeric form when inside-out adrenal vesicles were treated with trypsin, suggesting that the disulfide bond formation involved the 50-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. When the receptor was solubilized from bovine adrenal cortex membranes and then purified by ion exchange and affinity chromatography, it could be covalently coupled into dimers and trimers in the presence of bivalent cross-linking agents. Receptor dimers could also be demonstrated by chemical cross-linking of intact cells that were transfected with an expressible cDNA encoding the normal human LDL receptor. Dimer formation was markedly reduced in transfected cells expressing mutated cDNAs that had premature termination codons at positions 792, 807, and 812, which produced shortened receptors that retained 2, 17, and 22 of the original 50 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, respectively. The first two mutant receptors, which did not form oligomers, did not enter coated pits and were not rapidly internalized by cells. However, the mutant receptor that terminates at position 812 was internalized normally even though oligomer formation was greatly reduced. Moreover, a mutant receptor with a cysteine substituted for a tyrosine at position 807, which internalized very slowly, showed a normal susceptibility to chemical cross-linking. Deletion of external domains of the LDL receptor, including the epidermal growth factor homology region and the O-linked sugar domain, did not alter susceptibility to chemical cross-linking. We conclude that the cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor is responsible both for self-association into oligomers and for clustering in coated pits, but the available data do not establish a causal connection between these two events."
https://openalex.org/W2135301562,"We have determined whether the process of agonist-mediated phosphorylation of the muscarinic receptor correlates with the process of muscarinic receptor desensitization in chick cardiac tissue. Exposure of ventricular slices to the agonist carbachol under conditions previously shown to lead to large increases in muscarinic receptor phosphorylation (Kwatra, M. M., and Hosey, M. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12429-12432) resulted in decreased affinity of the muscarinic receptor for agonists. The agonist oxotremorine mimicked and the antagonist atropine prevented the effects of carbachol on receptor phosphorylation and agonist affinity. The time courses and concentration dependences for agonists to induce phosphorylation of the muscarinic receptor and decreases in agonist affinity were similar. Treatment of chick atria with acetylcholine under conditions which led to receptor phosphorylation resulted in decreased sensitivity of these preparations to the negative inotropic effect of carbachol. Taken together, the results support the concept that phosphorylation of cardiac muscarinic receptors may be related to the process of receptor desensitization. The mechanism by which agonists induce receptor phosphorylation was also investigated. The phosphorylated amino acids formed in response to agonists were serine and threonine. The protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate had no effect on receptor phosphorylation or agonist affinity, nor did it prevent the effects of carbachol on either of these parameters. Receptor phosphorylation also was unaffected by the calmodulin antagonists W-7 and W-13, by elevation of cyclic nucleotides, and by agonists which activate other cardiac receptor systems. The results suggest that the phosphorylation of cardiac muscarinic receptors requires agonist occupancy of the receptor and/or may involve the participation of a selective protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W8138790,"A transcription factor which binds to the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP) sequence spanning between -70 and -90 is required for efficient transcription of the ovalbumin gene. This COUP transcription factor has been purified approximately 200,000-fold by a combination of conventional column and sequence-specific DNA affinity column chromatography. A few polypeptides were identified in the purified preparation on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. Upon renaturation, all the major polypeptides in the molecular size range between 43 and 53 kDa bound specifically to the COUP sequence. Furthermore, at least one of the renatured polypeptides in the region of 43-45 kDa retained transcriptional activity. The binding of the COUP transcription factor to the ovalbumin promoter cannot be competed by DNA fragments which contain the CCAAT box promoter sequence. Since the COUP and CCAAT binding proteins can be separated on an S300 column, they are distinct molecules. Using band-shifting assays and 3' and 5' deletion mutants and oligonucleotide mutants, the sequence important for binding was mapped."
https://openalex.org/W1520847252,"Evidence that Ca2+ may serve as a physiologic regulator of post-transcriptional protein synthesis was recently reported (Brostrom, C. O., Bocckino, S. B., Brostrom, M. A., and Galuska, E. M. (1986) Mol. Pharmacol. 29, 104-111). To evaluate further the role of Ca2+ in translation, the polysomal contents of Ca2+-depleted and -restored GH3 pituitary cells were compared. Ca2+ depletion of intact cells with 1 mM EGTA resulted in the disappearance of polysomes and an accumulation of 80 S monosomes and ribosomal subunits typical of slowed rates of initiation. Ca2+ repletion rapidly (minutes) restored cellular polysomal contents with an accompanying accumulation of 43 S preinitiation complex (40 S.eukaryotic initiation factor 2.Met-tRNAf.GTP). Comparable polysomal profiles were found for Ca2+-depleted and -restored cells exposed to cycloheximide which apparently slowed polypeptide chain elongation to rate-limiting values in the overall translation process. Ribosomal transit times for both Ca2+-depleted and -restored cells were identical, indicating that elongation is not directly affected by the cation. Transit times were extended in parallel as a function of increasing cycloheximide concentration. Lysates of GH3 cells exhibited incorporation that was proportional to the polysomal contents derived from the original intact cell preparations. Such lysates did not possess the ability to initiate new peptide synthesis and were not affected by Ca2+ or EGTA. Ca2+-depleted cells exposed to cycloheximide provided lysates with identical elongation activity to that of lysates prepared from either comparably treated or control Ca2+-restored cells. Ca2+ is proposed to regulate translation in intact cells through modulation of the rate of initiation rather than either polypeptide chain elongation or termination."
https://openalex.org/W1492454134,"Using radioimmunoassays for amidated and glycine-extended gastrin before and after trypsin-carboxypeptidase B cleavage and chromatography, alpha-carboxyamidation of porcine antral progastrin has been related to tyrosine-O-sulfation and proteolytic cleavages. Corresponding to the sequence at the proteolysis and amidation site, -Gly-Arg-Arg-, antrum contained three COOH-terminally extended precursor types. The glycine-extended gastrins were present in the highest concentrations (241 +/- 58 pmol/g). The degree of tyrosine-O-sulfation was identical for amidated and precursor gastrins irrespective of component size, whereas the component size differed for glycine-extended and amidated forms. For instance, gastrin-34-Gly constituted 54% of the glycine-extended gastrins, while gastrin-34 comprised 8% of the amidated gastrins. The results indicate that tyrosine-O-sulfation occurs prior to NH2-terminal cleavages, which again precede carboxyamidation; but a significant correlation between tyrosine-O-sulfation and proteolytic cleavages or alpha-carboxy-amidation of antral gastrin could not be demonstrated. Furthermore, our results suggest that the immediate precursor of the principal hormonal form, gastrin-17, is gastrin-17-Gly rather than gastrin-34 as previously believed."
https://openalex.org/W1514959883,"2-Allylisopropylacetamide, a porphyrinogen which decreases the microsomal and cytosolic heme pools, is a phenobarbitone-like inducer of cytochrome P-450(b + e) messenger RNAs in rat liver. The porphyrinogen, however, does not affect the nuclear heme pool and enhances the transcription of cytochrome P-450(b + e) messenger RNAs strikingly. Inhibitors of heme biosynthesis, such as CoCl2 and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, which decrease the total heme levels including that of the nuclear heme pool, block the 2-allylisopropylacetamide- or phenobarbitone-mediated increase in the transcription of cytochrome P-450(b + e) messenger RNAs. Administration of exogenous heme at a very low concentration (25 micrograms/100 g) is able to counteract the inhibitory effects of the heme biosynthetic inhibitors. Addition of heme in vitro to heme-depleted nuclei leads to a significant increase in the transcription rates for cytochrome P-450(b + e) messenger RNAs. 2-Allylisopropylacetamide, unlike phenobarbitone, fails to increase the levels of cytochrome P-450b protein at 12 h after the drug administration, although there is a striking increase in the messenger RNA levels. Under conditions of 2-allylisopropylacetamide treatment, the cytochrome P-450 messenger RNA is translated, but the newly synthesized apoprotein undergoes rapid degradation. It is concluded that heme is a positive modulator of cytochrome P-450 gene transcription and is also required to stabilize the freshly synthesized apoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1499582683,"A patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type VIIB was found to have an interstitial deletion of 18 amino acids in approximately half of the pro-alpha 2(I) chains of Type I procollagen. Analysis of pepsin-solubilized tissue and fibroblast collagen revealed an abnormal additional chain, alpha 2(I)', which migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis between the normal alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains. The apparent ratio of normal alpha 1(I):mutant alpha 2(I)':normal alpha 2(I) was 4:1:1. Procollagen studies and enzyme digestion studies of native mutant collagen suggested defective removal of the amino propeptide. Sieve chromatography of CNBr peptides from purified alpha 2(I)' chains revealed the absence of the normal amino telopeptide fragment CB 1 and the appearance of a larger new peptide of approximately 60 residues (CB X). Compositional and sequencing studies of this peptide identified normal amino propeptide sequences. However, the most carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide of CB X differed substantially in composition and sequence from the expected and was found to have an interstitial deletion of 18 amino acids corresponding to the N-telopeptide of the pro-alpha 2(I) chain. This deletion removes the normal sites of cleavage of the N-proteinase and also removes a critical cross-linking lysine residue. The 18 amino acids deleted correspond exactly to the residues encoded by exon 6 of the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene (COL 1 A2), and, therefore, the protein defect may be due to a genomic deletion, or alternatively, an RNA splicing defect."
https://openalex.org/W1546450197,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of the nicotinic receptor by this kinase increases its rate of rapid desensitization. We now report the identification of the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on the gamma and delta subunits. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the phosphorylated gamma and delta subunits, after limit proteolysis with thermolysin, indicated that each subunit is phosphorylated on a single site. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 32P-labeled subunits demonstrates that phosphorylation had occurred exclusively on serine residues. Purified phosphorylated subunits were cleaved with cyanogen bromide and the resultant phosphopeptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Shorter phosphopeptides, obtained by secondary digestion with trypsin, were purified and subjected to both automated gas-phase sequencing and manual Edman degradation. The results demonstrate that the gamma subunit was phosphorylated at Ser-353, contained within the sequence Arg-Arg-Ser(P)-Ser-Phe-Ile and that the delta subunit was phosphorylated at Ser-361, contained within the sequence Arg-Ser-Ser(P)-Ser-Val-Gay-Tyr-Ser-Lys. Determination of the sites phosphorylated within the structure of the gamma and delta subunits should contribute to the molecular characterization of the regulation of desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1559073010,"Two isozymes of creatine kinase have been purified from sperm of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. One isozyme was purified from the sperm flagellum, and the other from the head. Both require nonionic detergent for extraction from sperm. The flagellar isozyme is a monomeric species with an Mr of 145,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 126,000 from sucrose density gradient and gel filtration analyses. Creatine kinase from sperm heads was localized to the mitochondrion by an antibody raised against mouse muscle creatine kinase. This purified mitochondrial isozyme is multimeric, with an Mr of 47,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but 240,000 for the native enzyme. Peptide mapping indicates that the two isozymes are not related. The following kinetic characteristics were observed for the purified flagellar and mitochondrial isozymes, respectively. In the direction of ATP formation, at pH 6.6 and 25 degrees C, specific activities were 235 and 180 units/mg; pH optima were 6.7 and 6.9 and Michaelis constants were 0.13 and 0.055 mM for ADP and 5.8 and 2.7 mM for phosphocreatine. In the direction of phosphocreatine formation, at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, specific activities were 29 and 47 units/mg; pH optima were 7.5 and 7.7 and Michaelis constants were 0.89 and 0.31 mM for ATP and 39 and 62 mM for creatine. These unique isozymes constitute the termini of the phosphocreatine shuttle of sea urchin sperm that is responsible for energy transport from the mitochondrion to the distal flagellum (Tombes, R. M., and Shapiro, B. M. (1985) Cell 41, 325-334; Tombes, R. M., Brokaw, C. J., and Shapiro, B. M. (1987) Biophys. J., 52, 75-86)."
https://openalex.org/W158478216,"Rabbit thyroglobulin (Tg) was labeled in vivo with 125I and purified by gel filtration. Separation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of tryptic digests of S-cyanoethylated Tg yielded four major iodothyronine-containing peaks, designated A, B, C, and D. These were further purified on HPLC and sequenced for identification of amino acid residues and for location of the iodothyronine by 125I counting. The published primary structure for bovine Tg, derived from cDNA sequencing of the Tg gene (Mercken, L., Simons, M.J., Swillens, S., Massaer, M., and Vassart, G. (1985) Nature 316, 647-651), permitted tentative location of the rabbit hormonogenic peptides within the Tg polypeptide chain. Site A, corresponding to bovine residue 5, contained 44% of Tgs [125I]T4 (thyroxine) and 25% of its [125I]T3 (triiodothyronine); its specific activity of iodine was higher than that for other sites, indicating priority of iodination. Site B, containing 24% of Tgs [125I]T4 and 18% of its [125I]T3, corresponded to bovine residue 2555. Site C, at the third residue from the C terminus (bovine residue 2748), was the major T3 site, accounting for over 50% of Tgs [125I]T3. The amino acid sequence around this site shows less homology among different animal species than do those flanking the other hormonogenic sites. Site D accounted for 17% of Tgs [125I]T4 and corresponded to bovine Tyr-1291, in the midportion of Tgs polypeptide chain. The three major T4-forming sites had the sequence Asp-Tyr (sites B and D) or Glu-Tyr (site A), while the sequence Ser-Tyr-Ser appeared to favor T3 synthesis (site C), suggesting an important influence of primary structure on hormonogenesis. We conclude that site A is the major T4-forming site and site C the major T3-forming one, but others are available and offer the opportunity for flexibility in meeting different demands for hormone formation."
https://openalex.org/W1546569881,"The immunoglobulin fraction of a polyclonal anti-insulin receptor antibody (B-10) derived from a patient with severe insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans was tested for its ability to activate the protein kinase activity of the insulin receptor and to mimic insulin action in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either wild type or kinase-deficient human insulin receptors. This antiserum had previously been reported to be insulinmimetic without activating the insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Antibody B-10 bound to both wild type and mutant human insulin receptors, but it induced receptor down-regulation and stimulated hexose transport and thymidine incorporation into DNA only in cells expressing the wild type receptor. Furthermore, this antibody activated the kinase activity of the wild type insulin receptor in intact cells and in vitro. It is likely, therefore, that the biological activities of antibody B-10, like those of insulin, depend upon the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1896181306,"Intoxication of Vero cells by ricin, modeccin, diphtheria toxin (DT), and Pseudomonas exotoxin A requires: 1) binding to cell surface receptors; 2) transport to the cytoplasm; and 3) enzymatic inactivation of a component of the protein synthetic machinery. The kinetic profiles of all four toxins consist of a lag followed by the apparent first-order decrease in protein synthesis. Autoradiographic analysis of DT-intoxicated cell populations has demonstrated that two subpopulations of cells exist during the period of decreasing protein synthesis: one population synthesizing at control levels and the other synthesizing little or no protein (Hudson, T. H., and Neville, D. M., Jr. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2675-2680). The present study correlates the autoradiographic data with the rates of protein synthesis decline in cells intoxicated with modeccin, ricin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, as well DT. In all cases, the first time point which exhibits a decrease in protein synthetic activity also exhibits two subpopulations of cells, one synthesizing protein at control rates and the other synthesizing little or no protein. As the intoxication progresses, cells leave the control population by the rapid cessation of all protein synthesis. These experiments demonstrate that transport of all four toxins to the cytosol is the rate-limiting step during the pseudo first-order decline in protein synthesis. Furthermore, the final step in the transport process (translocation) must result in the release to the cytoplasm of a quantity of toxin sufficient to rapidly inactivate all protein synthesis in that cell. The probability of a translocation event occurring in any cell of the population is established during the lag and remains constant throughout the first-order decrease in protein synthesis. The requirement for acidification during the intoxication by DT, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, or modeccin is restricted to the lag period. Acidification is therefore necessary to establish the probability of translocation, but it is not directly involved in the actual translocation of these toxins. The pseudo first-order passage of DT intoxications through antitoxin and NH4Cl- or monensin-sensitive stages are shown to have the same cellular basis as the pseudo first-order decrease in protein synthesis. A kinetic model is presented which defines the DT intoxication process from one of its earliest events (endocytosis) to its penultimate event (translocation of toxin to the cytosol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Reconstitution of the functionally active carrier proteins with high protein/lipid ratios was achieved by detergent removal on hydrophobic ion-exchange columns. A simplified version of the mitochondrial malate/aspartate shuttle was constructed by inclusion of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and the substrates aspartate and oxaloacetate within the interior of the liposomes. Addition of external glutamate led to internal production of oxoglutarate which could be exchanged against externally added labeled malate. The reconstitution procedure was characterized with respect to the optimum ratio of reconstituted carrier proteins, the lipid concentration, and the concentration of internal substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1555757452,Two-dimensional proton NMR studies were undertaken on the d(C-G-A-G-A-A-T-T-C-C-C-G) duplex (designated A.C 12-mer) where the A at the mismatch site is flanked by G residues and the d(C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-A-C-G) duplex (designated C.A 12-mer) where the A at the mismatch site is flanked by C residues in an attempt to elucidate the role of flanking base pairs on the structure of the A.C mismatch. The exchangeable and nonexchangeable proton spectra of these two dodecanucleotides have been completely characterized by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiments in H2O and D2O solution at acidic pH. The NOE distance connectivities demonstrate that both A and C at the mismatch site are stacked into a right-handed helix between flanking G.C base pairs and exhibit anti-glycosidic torsion angles. The proton chemical shifts and NOE patterns are consistent with Wobble A.C pairing for the A.C 12-mer and C.A 12-mer duplexes in solution and demonstrate that the A.C mismatches introduce local conformational perturbations that do not extend to the central AATT segment. We detect that amino protons of adenosine (approximately 9.2 ppm) but not of cytidine at the A.C mismatch site in both duplexes on lowering the pH below 6.
https://openalex.org/W1586698509,"Phosphatidylcholine is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the lumenal monolayer by a protein transporter, a phosphatidylcholine flippase (Bishop, W. R., and Bell, R. M. (1985) Cell 42, 51-60). Since the endoplasmic reticulum contains enzymes involved in phosphatidylcholine turnover that have different locations within the organelle, transport systems may exist for phosphatidylcholine metabolites. To test the hypothesis that rat liver microsomes contain a lysophosphatidylcholine transporter, sn-1-monobutyroylphosphatidylcholine was employed. Since this homolog is highly water-soluble, transport of lysophosphatidylcholine could be measured using standard transport methods. sn-1-Monobutyroylphosphatidylcholine entered the lumenal compartment of microsomal vesicles. Transport was saturable and dependent on time and on amount of microsomes and required an intact permeability barrier. sn-1-Monobutyroylphosphatidylcholine transport was inhibited by treatment of microsomes with trypsin, N-ethylmaleimide, and trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid. These findings suggest that sn-1-monobutyroylphosphatidylcholine transport is protein-mediated. sn-1-Monobutyroylphosphatidylcholine transported into microsomes was degraded to glycerophosphorylcholine. Glycerophosphorylcholine was also transported across the microsomal membrane. Glycerophosphorylcholine transport was also saturable and dependent on time, amount of microsomes, and an intact permeability barrier but was not inhibited by treatment with trypsin or the two protein modification agents. Thus, separate and distinct transport systems exist for phosphatidylcholine metabolites. Molecular events of phosphatidylcholine turnover in the endoplasmic reticulum are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1513336366,"The nucleotide fraction of cultured 3T6 and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts contains deoxy-CDP choline and deoxy-CDP ethanolamine as well as the corresponding riboliponucleotides. In permeabilized cells both deoxyliponucleotides were formed from dCTP. In intact cells they could be labeled from [5-3H] deoxycytidine or cytidine via transformation of the nucleosides to dCTP. Their turnover was slow compared to that of dCTP. When rapidly growing 3T3 cells were labeled during 90 min from deoxycytidine the specific activity of dCDP choline was 2.4 times higher than that of dCTP while after labeling from cytidine both nucleotides (and CTP) reached the same specific activity under steady state conditions. Also dCDP ethanolamine was labeled more rapidly from deoxycytidine than from cytidine. Our results suggest that the deoxyliponucleotides were synthesized from a dCTP pool that was labeled preferentially from deoxycytidine. Earlier work (Nicander, B., and Reichard, P. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 1347-1351) had demonstrated synthesis of DNA from a dCTP pool labeled preferentially from cytidine. Taken together our results suggest that deoxyliponucleotides and DNA are synthesized from separate dCTP pools."
https://openalex.org/W1625317547,"In 1979, Steinberg and colleagues described a unique kindred with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (Steinberg, D., Grundy, S. M., Mok, H. Y. I., Turner, J. D., Weinstein, D. B., Brown, W. V., and Albers, J. J. (1979) J. Clin. Invest. 64, 292-301). Recently, we demonstrated the existence of an abnormal species of apolipoprotein (apo-) B, apo-B37 (Mr = 203,000) in nine members of that kindred (Young, S. G., Bertics, S. J., Curtiss, L. K., and Witztum, J. L. (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 79, 1831-1841; Young, S. G., Bertics, S. J., Curtiss, L. K., Dubois, B. W., and Witztum, J. L. (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 79, 1842-1851). Apolipoprotein B37 contains only the amino-terminal portion of apo-B100. In affected individuals most of the apo-B37 is contained in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction (d = 1.063-1.21 g/ml), where it is the principal apolipoprotein in a unique lipoprotein (Lp) particle, Lp-B37, which contains little, if any, apo-A-I. However, the most abundant lipoprotein in the HDL density fraction is a smaller particle, which contains apo-A-I, but no apo-B. The Lp-B37 particles were isolated from the HDL of affected individuals by immunoabsorption of apo-B37. Selected affinity antibodies specific for apo-B37 were used to prepare an anti-apo-B37-Sepharose 4B column. Lipoproteins not bound by the column (unbound HDL fraction) contained apo-A-I, but no apo-B. The Lp-B37, which was eluted from the column with 3 M KI, contained apo-B37 and trace amounts of apo-A-I, but no apo-B100. Over a 4-h period, normal human fibroblasts degraded 10-fold more 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) than 125I-Lp-B37. Also, whereas addition of excess unlabeled LDL markedly reduced degradation of 125I-LDL, it did not significantly reduce the degradation of 125I-Lp-B37. Unlabeled Lp-B37 did not inhibit uptake and degradation of 125I-LDL by fibroblasts. These data suggest that the amino-terminal portion of apo-B100, when expressed on a naturally occurring lipoprotein particle, does not contain a functional apo-B,E(LDL) receptor binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2256361964,"Abstract By fusion of human leukocytes and cells of the murine myeloid cell line WEHI-TG, we produced human-mouse myeloid cell hybrids. Hybrids which contain human chromosome 11 have been demonstrated to express the myeloid-associated carbohydrate antigen Lex (Geurts van Kessel, A. H. M., Tetteroo, P. A. T., Von dem Borne, A. E. G. Kr., Hagemeijer, A., and Bootsma, D. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 3748-3752). In this paper, we report that the hybrids that contain chromosome 11 also expressed the Lex-related antigens Ley and sialyl-Lex. Glycosyltransferase activities were measured in a panel of six such hybrid cell lines, and the correlation to antigen expression and to the presence of human chromosomes was investigated. GDP-fucose:[Gal beta 1----4]GlcNAc alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase activity in the hybrids tested correlated with the expression of Lex, Ley, and sialyl-Lex and with the occurrence of chromosome 11. No such correlation was found for several other glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of these antigens. These findings suggest that the gene for alpha 3-fucosyltransferase is located on chromosome 11 and that it is through the activity of this enzyme that the expression of Lex, Ley, and sialyl-Lex in human myeloid cells is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2413533278,"Effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) on rRNA synthesis in vivo and in vitro were studied using lymphosarcoma P1798 in culture. Pulse labeling with [3H]uridine indicated that treatment of P1798 cells with 1 microgram/ml of CsA for 24-h reduced rRNA levels by 50-60%, whereas rRNA levels of cells rescued from CsA and grown for 24 h were similar to those of controls. Transcription experiments using nuclei from control, treated, and rescued cells indicated that the reduction in rRNA synthesis in treated cells was due to reversible inhibition of transcription of rDNA. Transcription studies in vitro indicated that S100 extracts from CsA-treated cells were unable to carry out faithful transcription of cloned mouse rDNA, even though RNA polymerase I levels of control and treated cell extracts were similar. Mixing experiments indicated that the inability of the CsA-treated cell extract to transcribe cloned rDNA in vitro was not due to the presence of inhibitor(s) or nuclease(s) in such extracts. Supplementation of CsA-treated cell extract with partially or highly purified preparations of a transcription initiation factor for RNA polymerase I, obtained from control cell extracts, conferred transcriptional ability on the CsA-treated cell extract. Extracts from cells treated with cyclosporin H, an inactive analogue of CsA, faithfully transcribed rDNA, indicating the specificity of CsA action. These data indicate that CsA-treated cells lack the ability to initiate rDNA transcription in vivo and in vitro, due to specific, reversible reduction in the amount or activity of transcription factor IC. Significance of these results in understanding the mechanisms of the lymphostatic activity of CsA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2472100453,"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is a substrate of band 3, the erythrocyte anion transport protein. It competitively inhibits anion transport and labels two exofacial chymotryptic domains (the 17-kDa (CH17) and the 35-kDa (CH35) integral fragments). Two mol of PLP are bound/mol of each fragment at saturation. PLP labeling of both domains is competitive with chloride at constant ionic strength. Addition of DNDS (4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate), protects PLP labeling of CH35 but exposes new, nonoverlapping sites on CH17.4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate reduces PLP labeling to both domains with time, while NAP-taurine (N(-4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)2-aminosulfonate) has no effect on either domain. At low chloride (balance citrate) and high DNDS, we can strongly suppress CH35 labeling and selectively titrate CH17 with PLP. Correlation of fractional transport inhibition with fractional PLP covalent coverage of CH17, quantitatively follows the 1:2 correlation line indicating that full coverage of CH17 sites (which constitute half of the total PLP-labeling sites on band 3) exactly inhibits one-half of transport. PLP labeling of CH35 sites accounts for the other half of inhibition. The inhibition-labeling correlation plots are nonlinear in the absence of DNDS, indicating the presence of allosteric interactions between the domains. We conclude that CH17 and CH35 compose nonoverlapping, functionally equivalent, allosterically linked transport inhibitory subdomains on band 3."
https://openalex.org/W99526018,"After binding to rat testicular or ovarian luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and mammalian LH can be detected with monoclonal antibodies directed against a conserved epitope on the beta subunit of the hormones. Two such anti-hCG/anti-LH monoclonal antibodies, known as B105 and B110, compete with one another for binding to this epitope region on free and receptor-bound hormone. By comparing the affinities of B105 and B110 for these two forms of hCG, we have detected apparent changes in the structure of the hormone which develop subsequent to receptor binding. Whereas the affinity of B105 for receptor-bound hCG is approximately 10-fold lower than that for free hCG, the affinity of B110 for receptor-bound hCG is nearly 20-fold greater than that for free hCG. Both B105.hCG and B110.hCG complexes bind to the receptor; however, they have approximately 25 and 50% lower affinity than hCG. Thus, although B110 binds better to the form of hCG which is bound to receptors, binding of B110 to hCG does not appear to induce a conformational change in the hormone which facilitates hormone-receptor binding. Consequently, both B105 and B110 partially inhibit binding of hCG to its receptors. Fab fragments of B105 and B110 are as effective as intact B105 and B110 in inhibiting the binding of labeled B105 and B110 to hCG-receptor complexes, suggesting that circular complexes which might be formed by the interaction of divalent antibody, two molecules of hCG, and two membrane-bound receptors or one divalent receptor are not contributing to the affinity of the antibodies for receptor-bound hCG. Alternatively, formation of circular complexes can explain an increase in apparent affinity of B105 for ovine or bovine LH-receptor complexes. Data obtained with B105 suggest either that the structure of the epitope is altered following binding or that a portion of the epitope is partially obscured when hCG binds to the receptor. In contrast, the data obtained using B110 are not explained by models in which steric factors reduce the affinity of the antibody for the hormone-receptor complex. Therefore, as a minimal explanation for these observations, we postulate that the conformation of the B105/B110 epitope region is altered following binding of the hormone to receptors. The nature of the conformational change and its relationship to LH/hCG action is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2413126161,"In an effort to exploit the advantages of Crithidia fasciculata for detailed analysis of the mechanisms of discontinuous transcription in the trypanosomatid family, we have cloned, sequenced, and characterized the mini-exon gene repeat in Crithidia and mapped the termini of its primary transcript. We find that Crithidia contains approximately 500 mini-exon genes, present almost exclusively as tandemly repeated arrays on a single chromosome. Transcripts derived from these genes are approximately 90 bases in length with heterogeneity at both the 5' and 3' ends. Primer extension experiments reveal a putative splicing intermediate. Specific inhibition of in vitro translation of Crithidia mRNAs by an oligonucleotide complementary to the mini-exon suggests that all Crithidia mRNAs contain the mini-exon at their 5' termini. Comparison of mini-exon gene sequences from various trypanosomatids reveals several regions of conservation that imply functional constraints on the transcription of mini-exon genes and the processing of their transcripts."

Portions of peptides CB-1, CB-4, and CB-6 were sequenced by automated Edman degradation and high performance liquid chromatography and the carboxyl-terminal region by conventional procedures. Further proteolytic digestion of CB-6 and isolation of the products afforded a seven-amino acid peptide. A low degeneracy probe comprising 20 nucleotides was synthesized from the sequence of this peptide and was used to screen a rat liver cDNA expression library constructed in the vector lambda gt 10. Positive clones were isolated, and detailed examination of five of these by restriction endonucleases and dideoxy sequence analyses allowed identification of the entire coding region for dihydropteridine reductase. The gene was found to code for a protein of 240 amino acids (excluding the methionine initiator) of Mr = 25,420. Each of the sequences corresponding to the peptides CB-1, CB-4, CB-6, and the carboxyl terminus were identified in the deduced protein sequence. The rat enzyme is highly homologous to the human dihydropteridine reductase; the two proteins differ in only 10 amino acids, and all are conservative substitutions. In contrast, the sequence shows little homology with that of mammalian dihydrofolate reductase: reduced pyridine nucleotide-requiring enzymes with superficial mechanistic similarities."
https://openalex.org/W1485227998,"Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that ongoing protein synthesis is required for L-tri-iodothyronine (T3) regulation of rat hepatic genes. In this report we have examined the role of ongoing protein synthesis in T3 regulation of the growth hormone gene (GH) in rat pituitary and GC cells. T3 (200 micrograms/100 g body weight injected intraperitoneally or 10(-8) M added to the media) induced a 3-fold rise of GH mRNA concentration after 8 h in rat pituitary (from 5.9 +/- 1% to 17.8 +/- 1.4% of an internal standard (IS), p less than 0.01) and a 5-fold rise in GC cells after 6 h (from 0.1 +/- 0.01% to 0.54 +/- 0.03% of IS, p less than 0.01). Cycloheximide (1 mg/100 g body weight intraperitoneally or 25 microM added to the media) completely blocked the increase in GH mRNA when given before the hormone in rat pituitary (7.5 +/- 0.5% of IS after 8 h) and GC cells (0.095 +/- 0.01% of IS after 6 h). Similar results were observed when emetine and puromycin were used to block protein synthesis. GH transcription rate in pituitaries from hypothyroid animals was 20 +/- 8 ppm and increased to a value of 295 +/- 85 parts per million 2 h after the injection of T3, and a similar 8-fold increase was observed in GC cells after 2 h. However, when cycloheximide was given before the hormone, the T3-induced increase in transcription was completely blocked. We also demonstrate here that the differences observed in GH transcription rate between hypo- and euthyroid rat pituitaries fully account for the differences observed in mRNA concentration. We conclude that short-lived proteins are involved in T3 regulation of the GH gene in rat pituitary and GC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529725959,"Phosphate transport across brush border membranes from kidney cortex is very sensitive to inhibition by phenylglyoxal, an arginine modifier. Sodium-dependent phosphate influx into brush border membrane vesicles was inhibited by 60%. In contrast, phenylglyoxal had no effect on passive influx or on sodium-dependent efflux of phosphate. Preincubation of the vesicles with sodium prior to the addition of phenylglyoxal demonstrated a strong protective effect of intravesicular sodium (73% protection). Phosphate also protected the transporter from inhibition, but from the extravesicular side only (63%). Substitution of phosphate by sulfate offered no protection at all, indicating the specificity of protection. Addition of both substrates (sodium and phosphate) offered an additional protection from the extravesicular side compared to that offered by phosphate alone (92 versus 55%). There was no additional protection when both substrates were added to the intravesicular side. Phosphate influx measured in the presence of sodium but in the absence of a sodium gradient was totally unaffected by phenylglyoxal modification. There was no inhibition on phosphate influx measured in equilibrium exchange conditions. We propose a model for the phosphate carrier in which the sodium gradient induces a conformational change and an arginine residue is essential for the coupled flux of sodium and phosphate."

Fucosyl-GM1 was also detected as a minor ganglioside in rat gastric mucosa. The ganglioside profile was modified during the postnatal development. The contribution of GM3 and GD3, which accounted for 95% of the ganglioside sialic acid at birth, decreased during the first 3 weeks of life. GM1, fucosyl-GM1, and B-GM1 were not detected at birth. The concentration of the fucogangliosides increased during the 2nd and 3rd weeks after birth, was stable during the 4th week and then decreased, whereas that of GM1 increased steadily between 6 days and 2 months of age.

https://openalex.org/W68322637,"The envelope protein (gp52) of Friend spleen focus-forming virus (F-SFFV) is defective in its intracellular transport and accumulates in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of F-SFFV-infected cells. This defect in transport has been attributed to the lack of a cytoplasmic domain, and possible loss of signals required for transport to the cell surface. The mature form of gp52, designated gp65, is also reported to be secreted from SFFV-infected cells. To determine the specific changes in the envelope protein which may lead to its lack of transport and to its lack of stability in associating with membranes, the 3' end of the F-SFFV envelope gene, which encodes the transmembrane domain, was inserted in place of the normal 3' end of the Friend murine leukemia virus genome. This chimeric envelope gene was expressed using the vaccinia virus expression system. The chimeric gp70/p15E glycoprotein molecule lacks the cytoplasmic tail residues and as a consequence is about 3300 daltons smaller. The chimeric PrEnv molecule was found to be cleaved efficiently as indicated by pulse-chase experiments. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that the chimeric molecule is efficiently transported to the surface of cells, unlike the SFFV gp52 glycoprotein. The chimeric molecule was found to be unstable in its membrane association and is released into the culture medium. These results indicate that the changes in the membrane spanning region and the lack of a cytoplasmic tail do not determine the defective transport of gp52, but may determine the stability of its association with membranes."

The crystals, which contained two independent molecules of RNase B as the asymmetric unit, were solved by a combination of multiple isomorphous replacement and molecular replacement approaches. The structures of the two molecules were refined to 2.5-A resolution and a conventional R factor of 0.22 using a constrained-restrained least squares procedure (CORELS). Complexes were also investigated of RNase B plus ruthenium pentaamine and between RNase B and a substrate analogue iodouridine. The polypeptide backbones of the two molecules of RNase B in the asymmetric unit were found to be statistically identical and their differences from RNase A to be statistically insignificant. The carbohydrate chains of both molecules extended into solvent cavities in the crystal lattice and appear to be disordered for the most part. The oligosaccharides appear to exert no influence on the structure of the protein. Iodouridine was observed to bind identically in the pyrimidine site of both RNase B molecules and in a way apparently the same as that previously observed for RNase A. Ruthenium pentaamine bound at histidine 105 of both RNase B molecules in the asymmetric unit, but at a number of secondary sites as well. An array of bound ions was observed by Fo-Fc difference Fourier syntheses. These ions were proximal to lysine and arginine residues at the surface of the proteins while a pair of strong ion binding sites were seen to fall exactly in the active site clefts of both RNase B molecules in the asymmetric unit."
https://openalex.org/W1494930567,"When pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is covalently bound to band 3 protein in intact red blood cells and those cells are subjected to the osmotic hemolysis and resealing process, a significant reduction in the original PLP anion transport inhibitory potency occurs. We show that partial deinhibition is not due to the development of a second anion transport pathway in resealed ghosts. Rather, partial deinhibition arises from a hemolysis-induced conformational change in CH17 (17-kDa integral chymotryptic domain of band 3). This change causes the extracellular exposure of new transport inhibitory sites. Exposure of the new sites leads to a 2-fold increase in PLP labeling of CH17 in resealed ghosts compared with CH17 in intact red cells. The hemolysis and resealing process has no effect on the labeling of CH35 (35-kDa integral chymotryptic fragment of band 3). Double-labeling studies show restoration of transport inhibitory potency to near red cell levels when the newly exposed CH17 sites are labeled with PLP in resealed ghosts. The results support the view that CH17 contains PLP transport inhibitory sites. They show that a major conformational change occurs in band 3 with hemolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1513705939,"The modulation of the shunt pathway of mevalonate metabolism (Edmond, J., and Popjak, G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 66-71) has been studied in livers from fed, starved, and diabetic rats perfused with a physiological concentration (300 nM) of [5-14C] + [5-3H]mevalonate. Shunt activity was measured by (i) production of 14CO2 (corrected for loss of label by exchange reactions) and (ii) production of 3H2O. Contribution of exogenous mevalonate to total mevalonate production (0.06-0.11%) was assessed in parallel experiments by the incorporation of 3H2O into sterols. Inhibition of non-saponifiable lipid synthesis by starvation and diabetes is not associated with an inhibition of mevalonate production but with a major increase in shunting (7-34%) of sterol-bound mevalonate. The shunt pathway of mevalonate metabolism appears to participate in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1488103280,"Lysosomal cystine transport is a carrier-dependent process that, in isolated lysosomes, is stimulated by proton gradients, membrane potential, and millimolar concentrations of divalent cations. The importance of these regulatory factors in vivo is not well established. Polyamines were found to stimulate cystine transport in Percoll gradient purified rat liver lysosomes with spermidine greater than putrescine = cadaverine greater than spermine in order of effectiveness. Maximal stimulation was achieved with 500 microM spermidine. The effects of optimal concentrations of polyamines and divalent cations on cystine transport were not additive. Spermidine stimulated cystine efflux from lysosomes of cultured human diploid fibroblasts, but had no effect on lysosomes of cystinotic fibroblasts which have defective cystine transport. Spermidine did not accumulate within lysosomes in exchange for cystine, had no effect on lysosomal pH, had only slight effects on the lysosomal membrane potential, and had little effect on either methionine or tyrosine efflux. Polyamines are cellular cytoplasmic components that, in physiologic concentrations, stimulate lysosomal cystine transport."
https://openalex.org/W1589441054,"Repression of a strong promoter localized 5′ to the P1 ban gene is a prerequisite for cloning the ban operon in the multicopy plasmid pBR325. Repression is brought about by the binding of P1 repressor to the operator of the ban operon (Heisig, A., Severin, I., Seefluth, A. K., and Schuster, H. (1987) Mol. Gen. Genet. 206, 368-376). Binding of RNA polymerase in vitro overlaps with the operator and is inhibited by P1 repressor as shown by electron microscopy. The mutant P1 bac, which renders ban expression constitutive, contains a single base pair exchange within the operator. As a consequence, more repressor is required (i) for the inhibition of binding of RNA polymerase, and (ii) for the electrophoretic retardation of a P1 bac DNA fragment when compared to the corresponding bac+ fragment. A P1 ban recombinant plasmid containing a 4-base pair deletion close to the operator still allows binding of repressor but not of RNA polymerase. By that means, a repressible promoter is located at the P1 map position 72 in a distance of about 2.5 kilobase pairs to the beginning of the ban gene."
https://openalex.org/W1571282541,"Abstract The structure of the mutant of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme in which Gly-156 is replaced by aspartic acid is described. The lysozyme was isolated by screening for temperature-sensitive mutants and has a melting temperature at pH 6.5 that is 6.1 degrees C lower than wild type. The mutant structure is destabilized, in part, because Gly-156 has conformational angles (phi, psi) that are not optimal for a residue with a beta-carbon. High resolution crystallographic refinement of the mutant structure (R = 17.7% at 1.7 A resolution) shows that the Gly----Asp substitution does not significantly alter the configurational angles (phi, psi) but forces the backbone to move, as a whole, approximately 0.6 A away from its position in wild-type lysozyme. This induced strain weakens a hydrogen bond network that exists in the wild-type structure and also contributes to the reduced stability of the mutant lysozyme. The introduction of an acidic side chain reduces the overall charge on the molecule and thereby tends to increase the stability of the mutant structure relative to wild type. However, at neutral pH this generalized electrostatic stabilization is offset by specific electrostatic repulsion between Asp-156 and Asp-92. The activity of the mutant lysozyme is approximately 50% that of wild-type lysozyme. This reduction in activity might be due to introduction of a negative charge and/or perturbation of the surface of the molecule in the region that is assumed to interact with peptidoglycan substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1546928976,"Visible absorption, circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic circular dichroism spectra have been recorded for the Ca2+-Co2+ derivatives of the lentil (CCoLcH) and pea (CCoPSA) lectins (Co2+ at the S1 sites and Ca2+ at the S2 sites) and shown to be very similar for both proteins. The visible absorption and magnetic circular dichroism spectra indicate similar octahedral geometries for high spin Co2+ at S1 in both proteins, as found in the Ca2+-Co2+ complex of concanavalin A (CCoPL) (Richardson, C. E., and Behnke, W. D. (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 102, 441-451). The visible CD data, however, indicate differences in the environment around S1 of CCoLcH and CCoPSA compared to CCoPL. 1H NMR spectra at 90 MHz of the Co2+ and Ni2+ derivatives of the lectins show a number of isotropically shifted signals which arise from protons in the immediate vicinity of the S1 sites. Analysis of the spectra of the Co2+ derivatives in H2O and D2O has permitted resonance assignments of the side chain ring protons of the coordinated histidine at S1 in the lectins. Differences are observed in the H-D exchange rate of the histidine NH proton at S1 in concanavalin A compared to the lentil and pea lectins. NMR data of the Ni2+-substituted proteins, together with spectra of the Co2+ derivatives, also indicate that the side chains of a carboxylate ligand and of the histidine residue at S1 are positioned differently in concanavalin A than in the other two lectins. These results appear to account, in part, for the differences observed in the visible CD spectra of the Co2+-substituted proteins. In addition, binding of monosaccharides does not significantly perturb the spectra of the lectins. An unusual feature in the 1H NMR spectra of all three Co2+-substituted lectins is the presence of two exchangeable downfield shifted resonances which appear to be associated with the two protons of a slowly exchanging water molecule coordinated to the Ca2+ ion at S2. T1 measurements of CCoLcH have provided an estimation of the distances from the Co2+ ion to these two protons of 3.7 and 4.0 A."
https://openalex.org/W1530075734,"The effect of pyridoxal depletion and supplementation on the intracellular level of mitochondrial and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase in cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts was examined. No apoenzyme was detected in cells grown in the presence of pyridoxal, and the specific activity of total enzyme did not vary profoundly from primary to quaternary cultures. Under pyridoxal depletion, up to 40% apoenzyme was found in tertiary cultures which was entirely due to the mitochondrial isoenzyme. Cytosolic apoenzyme was never detected. Total aspartate aminotransferase relative to total protein was increased 2-fold in secondary cultures; only the mitochondrial isoenzyme contributed to the increased specific activity. The cytosolic isoenzyme decreased steadily and was below the limit of detection in quaternary cultures. The changes are attributed to an increased and decreased synthesis of mitochondrial and cytosolic isoenzyme, respectively. No induction of either isoenzyme was observed after incubating the cells with different hormones and substrates. In secondary cultures, no degradation of mitochondrial isoenzyme could be detected under pyridoxal deficiency or supplementation during 4.4 days, an interpassage duration. The cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase was degraded initially with an apparent half-life of approximately 0.9 day under both sets of conditions. The pronounced stability of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, even though one-third of it was present as apoenzyme, excludes the formation of the apoform to be the rate-limiting step in its degradation. The present results show that pyridoxal affects the synthesis of mitochondrial and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, but differently."
