https://openalex.org/W2034064942,"Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a light-gated, cation-selective ion channel isolated from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Here, we report the generation of transgenic mice that express a ChR2-YFP fusion protein in the CNS for in vivo activation and mapping of neural circuits. Using focal illumination of the cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb, we demonstrate a highly reproducible, light-dependent activation of neurons and precise control of firing frequency in vivo. To test the feasibility of mapping neural circuits, we exploited the circuitry formed between the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex in anesthetized mice. In the olfactory bulb, individual mitral cells fired action potentials in response to light, and their firing rate was not influenced by costimulated glomeruli. However, in piriform cortex, the activity of target neurons increased as larger areas of the bulb were illuminated to recruit additional glomeruli. These results support a model of olfactory processing that is dependent upon mitral cell convergence and integration onto cortical cells. More broadly, these findings demonstrate a system for precise manipulation of neural activity in the intact mammalian brain with light and illustrate the use of ChR2 mice in exploring functional connectivity of complex neural circuits in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2143335572,"Orthology detection is critically important for accurate functional annotation, and has been widely used to facilitate studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics. Although various methods are now available, there has been no comprehensive analysis of performance, due to the lack of a genomic-scale ‘gold standard’ orthology dataset. Even in the absence of such datasets, the comparison of results from alternative methodologies contains useful information, as agreement enhances confidence and disagreement indicates possible errors. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a statistical technique that can exploit this information to reasonably infer sensitivities and specificities, and is applied here to evaluate the performance of various orthology detection methods on a eukaryotic dataset. Overall, we observe a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in orthology detection, with BLAST-based methods characterized by high sensitivity, and tree-based methods by high specificity. Two algorithms exhibit the best overall balance, with both sensitivity and specificity>80%: INPARANOID identifies orthologs across two species while OrthoMCL clusters orthologs from multiple species. Among methods that permit clustering of ortholog groups spanning multiple genomes, the (automated) OrthoMCL algorithm exhibits better within-group consistency with respect to protein function and domain architecture than the (manually curated) KOG database, and the homolog clustering algorithm TribeMCL as well. By way of using LCA, we are also able to comprehensively assess similarities and statistical dependence between various strategies, and evaluate the effects of parameter settings on performance. In summary, we present a comprehensive evaluation of orthology detection on a divergent set of eukaryotic genomes, thus providing insights and guides for method selection, tuning and development for different applications. Many biological questions have been addressed by multiple tests yielding binary (yes/no) outcomes but no clear definition of truth, making LCA an attractive approach for computational biology."

Such spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) follows rules that govern how patterns of neural activity induce changes in synaptic strength. Synaptic plasticity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) follows Hebbian and anti-Hebbian patterns in a cell-specific manner. Here we show that these opposing responses to synaptic activity result from differential expression of two signaling pathways. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling underlies Hebbian postsynaptic LTP in principal cells. By contrast, in interneurons, a temporally precise anti-Hebbian synaptic spike-timing rule results from the combined effects of postsynaptic CaMKII–dependent LTP and endocannabinoid-dependent presynaptic LTD. Cell specificity in the circuit arises from selective targeting of presynaptic CB1 receptors in different axonal terminals. Hence, pre- and postsynaptic sites of expression determine both the sign and timing requirements of long-term plasticity in interneurons.

Hence, pre- and postsynaptic sites of expression determine both the sign and timing requirements of long-term plasticity in interneurons. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is an auditory brainstem region resembling the cerebellar cortex (Bell, 2002Bell C.C. Evolution of cerebellum-like structures.Brain Behav.

Its circuitry integrates auditory with somatosensory input and is thought to play a role in the orientation of the head toward sounds of interest (May, 2000May B.J.

Integrative Functions in the Mammalian Auditory Pathway. Springer, New York2002: 160-206Crossref Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the DCN performs its computational tasks remains unclear. The DCN molecular layer consists of excitatory parallel fibers innervating both “cartwheel” interneurons and “fusiform” principal neurons (Mugnaini et al., 1980Mugnaini E. Warr W.B. Osen K.K. Distribution and light microscopic features of granule cells in the cochlear nuclei of cat, rat, and mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 1980; 191: 581-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cartwheel cells, in turn, strongly inhibit fusiform cells through feed-forward inhibition (Davis et al., 1996Davis K.A. Miller R.L. Young E.D. Effects of somatosensory and parallel-fiber stimulation on neurons in dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 3012-3024PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). In studies of long-term synaptic plasticity over the last decade, it has become clear that the direction of change, either strengthening or weakening, can be determined by the precise timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials (Bell et al., 1997Bell C.C.

This dependence on timing is termed spike-timing-dependent plasticity, or STDP. We have demonstrated unique, opposing forms of STDP at parallel fiber synapses onto fusiform and cartwheel cells (Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y. Oertel D. Trussell L.O. Cell-specific, spike timing-dependent plasticities in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The STDP observed at parallel fiber-fusiform cell synapses resembles STDP observed in the cortex and hippocampus and is Hebbian: presynaptic inputs are strengthened when they are successful in driving postsynaptic spikes, i.e., LTP is observed when a postsynaptic spike follows the EPSP (Bi and Poo, 1998Bi G.Q.

By contrast, parallel fiber-cartwheel cell synapses are characterized by an anti-Hebbian timing rule: presynaptic inputs that reliably cause, or predict, a postsynaptic spike are weakened, i.e., LTD is observed when a postsynaptic spike follows the EPSP. Similar forms of anti-Hebbian STDP have been observed in the electrosensory system of a weakly electric fish (Bell et al., 1997Bell C.C. Han V.Z. Sugawara Y. Grant K.

Denk W. Hausser M. Coincidence detection in single dendritic spines mediated by calcium release.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, in the DCN, the timing requirements for coincident detection of pre- and postsynaptic activity appear more precise when compared to other mammalian synapses exhibiting STDP, particularly with respect to LTD (Dan and Poo, 2006Dan Y. Poo M.M. Spike timing-dependent plasticity: from synapse to perception.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1033-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Computational studies suggest that anti-Hebbian STDP provides a mechanism that equalizes synaptic efficacy along the dendritic tree, thus eliminating location dependence of the synapses (Rumsey and Abbott, 2006Rumsey C.C. Abbott L.F. Synaptic democracy in active dendrites.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Unlike recent progress on the cellular mechanisms of Hebbian-STDP (Bender et al., 2006Bender V.A. Bender K.J. Brasier D.J. Feldman D.E.

Sakmann B. Spine Ca2+ signaling in spike-timing-dependent plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11001-11013Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying anti-Hebbian STDP remain unclear. We have examined signaling mechanisms underlying STDP in the DCN and found that anti-Hebbian LTD in cartwheel cells is mediated by retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. However, the timing rule that results from this signaling is opposed by the presence of a postsynaptic CaMKII-dependent mechanism that acts to strengthen synaptic communication. Excitatory synapses onto principal cells lack the endocannabinoid system and thus only express a Hebbian LTP. Specifically, electrophysiological and electron-microscopic data suggest that endocannabinoid signaling is less prominent in fusiform cells as a result of differential distribution of endocannabinoid receptors on terminals of single axons. Thus, a decrease in transmitter release mediated by endocannabinoids and increase in transmitter sensitivity mediated by CaMKII signaling together shape the spike-timing rule in a synapse-specific manner. We investigated the underlying induction and expression mechanisms of anti-Hebbian LTD in cartwheel cells using pharmacological tools. LTD was induced using a conditioning protocol in which a postsynaptic spike was triggered 5 ms after the onset of a parallel-fiber-evoked EPSP, as shown previously (Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y. Oertel D. Trussell L.O. Cell-specific, spike timing-dependent plasticities in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV, 100 μM applied to the bath) or MK-801 (20 μM, applied intracellularly) blocked LTD, as did intracellular application of 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA, 20 mM, Figure 1B). Therefore, the induction of LTD requires a postsynaptic rise in Ca2+, probably mediated by postsynaptic NMDARs. To investigate expression mechanisms, we used two assays that are sensitive to changes in neurotransmitter release: paired-pulse facilitation (PPF; Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar) and coefficient of variation (CV) analysis (Faber and Korn, 1991Faber D.S. Korn H. Applicability of the coefficient of variation method for analyzing synaptic plasticity.Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1288-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, Larkman et al., 1992Larkman A. Hannay T. Stratford K. Jack J.

Changes in presynaptic function during long-term potentiation.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1991; 635: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PPF was increased after LTD induction, suggesting a decrease in probability of release associated with LTD expression (Figure 1C). Induction of LTD was paralleled by a reduction in 1/CV2; a similar reduction was seen with baclofen, which is known to inhibit the postsynaptic response via a presynaptic mechanism (Figure 1D). By contrast, 0.5 μM 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), which reduces responses by partially blocking postsynaptic glutamate receptors, left CV and paired-pulse plasticity unaffected (Figures 1C and 1D). We conclude that anti-Hebbian LTD is induced postsynaptically, but expressed presynaptically. Given the role of endocannabinoids in retrograde signaling in the cerebellar cortex, and the strong parallels between Purkinje neurons and cartwheel cells (Berrebi and Mugnaini, 1988Berrebi A.S.

Endocannabinoids are released from postsynaptic cells and diffuse to presynaptic terminals where they activate endocannabinoid (CB1) receptors (Freund et al., 2003Freund T.F. Katona I. Piomelli D.

Using an induction protocol wherein the EPSP preceded the spike by 4–5 ms, application of 1 μM AM-251 (a selective CB1 receptor antagonist) not only blocked LTD but, surprisingly, also unmasked a long-term potentiation (Figure 2A). AM-251 had no effect on baseline synaptic transmission (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online), indicating lack of tonic activation of CB1 receptors. Given the involvement of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in endocannabinoid-mediated LTD in other systems (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003Chevaleyre V. Castillo P.E. Heterosynaptic LTD of hippocampal GABAergic synapses: a novel role of endocannabinoids in regulating excitability.Neuron. 2003; 38: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), we tested the role of mGluR1 and -5 on the induction of LTD. Bath application of 100 μM LY367385 and 4 μM MPEP, selective antagonists of mGluR subtypes 1 and 5, respectively, had no effect on cartwheel cell LTD (Figure 2C), indicating that mGluR1/5 activation is not necessary for LTD induction. Next we determined the induction and expression mechanisms of the “unmasked” LTP. Application of extracellular APV or intracellular BAPTA was able to block this form of LTP, suggesting that both signaling cascades leading to LTP and LTD are initiated in the postsynaptic cell by a rise in Ca2+, probably mediated by NMDARs (Figure 2B). As with LTP in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Long-term potentiation—a decade of progress?.Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar), this “unmasked” LTP was mediated through a postsynaptic mechanism because, PPF and 1/CV2 did not change after its induction (Figures 2D and 2E) and LTP was blocked by intracellularly applied CaMKII peptide inhibitor (Chang et al., 2001Chang B.H. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R.

Barth A.L. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. A developmental switch in the signaling cascades for LTP induction.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (CaMKII-Ntide, 10–50 μM) (Figure 2B). To determine the relative roles of these signaling pathways in shaping the dependence of plasticity on timing, we applied selective blockers of each of the two pathways and monitored the change in EPSP amplitude after conditioning trains with different EPSP spike-timing relationships. CaMKII-Ntide, applied through the recording pipette, was used to block CaMKII signaling and thus permitted us to study the learning rule determined by endocannabinoid signaling, while AM-251 was used to block endocannabinoid signaling. The black squares in Figure 3A are control data showing that LTD is only observed for an EPSP spike-timing delay of 4–5 ms (Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y. Oertel D. Trussell L.O. Cell-specific, spike timing-dependent plasticities in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When endocannabinoid signaling was blocked with AM-251, the timing curve (triangles, Figure 3A) revealed LTP that was triggered between 5 and 20 ms pre-post pairing protocol. Thus, both the polarity and the timing sensitivity had changed. Interestingly, this broader timing window is similar to that observed for timing-dependent LTP in fusiform cells (Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y. Oertel D. Trussell L.O. Cell-specific, spike timing-dependent plasticities in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When CaMKII signaling was blocked with CaMKII-Ntide, the observed timing rule was anti-Hebbian, but the timing window for coincident detection increased, a mirror-image of the relationship seen in AM-251 (circles, Figure 3A). At a 10 ms delay, no plasticity is seen in controls, and this appears to reflect the cancelling of the effects of presynaptic endocannabinoid-mediated LTD and postsynaptic CaMKII-mediated LTP occurring simultaneously. When the spike follows the EPSP by only 5 ms, additional LTD is observed after blocking LTP (Figure 3A). Since peptide diffusion from the patch pipette into dendritic spines may be limited, we tried a higher peptide concentration (200 μM), which produced a weak potentiating effect on baseline EPSP amplitude but also revealed an even stronger LTD when tested at the 5 ms EPSP spike interval (Figure S2). At either zero or −5 ms, no plasticity was observed under any recording condition (Figure 3A). These results show that the unique, narrow timing plot rule for the interneuron reflects the interaction of distinct metabolic pathways and plasticities expressed on both sides of the synapse. The polarity of synaptic plasticity in cartwheel cells is frequency dependent (Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y. Oertel D. Trussell L.O. Cell-specific, spike timing-dependent plasticities in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Anti-Hebbian LTD was observed at low frequencies (10 Hz; Figures 3A and 3B), while LTP was induced at 40 Hz, regardless of the timing order of pre- and postsynaptic activity (Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y. Oertel D. Trussell L.O. Cell-specific, spike timing-dependent plasticities in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). When AM-251 was applied, the LTP was not significantly different at 10 Hz or 40 Hz, nor was it different from the LTP seen at 40 Hz in control conditions (Figure 3B). Therefore, LTP observed at 40 Hz in control conditions is mediated by CaMKII signaling and its effects apparently dominate over endocannabinoid signaling. After blocking CaMKII signaling, a larger-magnitude LTD could be induced at 10 Hz (Figure 3B). Thus, learning rules are not static, but depend both on the frequency of synaptic activity and on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic activity. Parallel fibers are known to contact both cartwheel and fusiform cells, yet these cells exhibit strikingly different timing plots in STDP paradigms (Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y.

Could the differential distribution of the signaling mechanisms described above account for cell-specific synaptic learning rules? In fusiform cells, which do not exhibit anti-Hebbian plasticity, blockade of either NMDAR or CaMKII prevented induction of LTP (Figure 4A). Additionally, PPF and CV did not change after its induction, indicating a postsynaptic site of LTP expression (Figures 4B and 4C), similar to that of cartwheel cells. These results suggest that selective engagement of endocannabinoid signaling in cartwheel cells and its interaction with the CaMKII signaling cascade may explain site-specific STDP in the DCN. If the plasticity in cartwheel cells is different from that observed in fusiform cells solely because of engagement of endocannabinoid signaling, then we would predict that parallel fiber terminals innervating fusiform cells do not express CB1 receptors and/or that fusiform cells do not release endocannabinoids, at least under the induction protocol used in this study. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used physiological and histological approaches. Depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) is a transient decrease in synaptic strength of excitatory inputs that is mediated by endocannabinoids (Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001bKreitzer A.C. Regehr W.G. Retrograde inhibition of presynaptic calcium influx by endogenous cannabinoids at excitatory synapses onto Purkinje cells.Neuron. 2001; 29: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and was used here to reveal endocannabinoid signaling in cartwheel and fusiform cells. Application of 1 s depolarization to 0 mV in cartwheel cells led to a decrease of synaptic strength that lasted ∼10–15 s (Figure 5A). This decrease was mediated by endocannabinoids, as application of AM-251 was able to block this decrease (Figure 5C). DSE in fusiform cells was much smaller than in cartwheel cells (Figures 5A–5C). We then asked how sensitive parallel fiber synapses on the two cell types are to an agonist of CB1 receptor. When WIN-55,212-2 (1 μM), was bath applied, a quantitatively similar decrease of synaptic strength was observed both in cartwheel and fusiform cells (Figures 5D and 5F); however, the onset of block of synapses on fusiform cells was distinctly slower. This difference was not due to differential penetration of the drug, as we were careful not to record from fusiform cells located in deeper layers of the slice. When the concentration of WIN-55,212-2 was reduced to 50 nM (Figures 5E and 5F), a more gradual and limited block of transmission at cartwheel synapses was seen, and almost no effect was observed in fusiform cells, after 35 min of incubation. These data suggest that parallel fiber terminals may differ in their density of CB1 receptors. This interpretation was confirmed through EM immunolocalization of CB1 receptors (Figure 6). Postembedding immunolocalization was performed using antibodies directed against either the entire C terminus (Figure 6) or a 15 amino acid section of the protein (Figure S3) of the CB1 receptors, with comparable results. Five-nanometer gold particles were apparent within parallel fiber terminals onto both cell types (Figures 6A–6F) and on the spines of cartwheel cells (Figures 6A–6C). The distribution of presynaptic particles was quantified as shown in the cartoon in Figure 6G; particles were classified as being associated with membrane facing the postsynaptic density (PSD), at the periphery of the PSD, or in extrasynaptic membrane areas. Particles had to be within 40 nm of presynaptic plasma membrane to qualify as membrane labeling (see Experimental Procedures). With these criteria, a striking difference in distribution was apparent, such that parallel fiber-cartwheel synapses had more membrane labeling than synapses onto fusiform cells, and most of that labeling was facing the PSD (Figure 6G). Intraterminal labeling was not different between the two classes of terminal (Figure 6H). Thus, these data confirm that differential endocannabinoid signaling may be caused by cell-selective expression of CB1 receptors at terminals of parallel fibers. By using electrophysiological and anatomical techniques, we revealed mechanisms underlying cell-specific STDP in the DCN. Our findings show that differences in cell-specific synaptic learning rules can be ascribed to differences in the subcellular targeting of presynaptic endocannabinoid receptors. We also show that the uniquely narrow timing windows for STDP observed in the DCN represent the convergent effects of presynaptic endocannabinoid signaling and postsynaptic CaMKII signaling.

Recent studies proposed two apparently incompatible pathways, via protein kinase C (PKC) and via Munc13. Here we show how these two pathways converge. First, we confirm that DAG analogs indeed continue to potentiate transmission after PKC inhibition (the Munc13 pathway), but only in neurons that previously experienced DAG analogs, before PKC inhibition started. Second, we identify an essential PKC pathway by expressing a PKC-insensitive Munc18-1 mutant in munc18-1 null mutant neurons. This mutant supported basic transmission, but not DAG-induced potentiation and vesicle redistribution. Moreover, synaptic depression was increased, but not Ca2+-independent release evoked by hypertonic solutions. These data show that activation of both PKC-dependent and -independent pathways (via Munc13) are required for DAG-induced potentiation. Munc18-1 is an essential downstream target in the PKC pathway. This pathway is of general importance for presynaptic plasticity. Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a prominent endogenous modulator of synaptic transmission.

In the nervous system, DAG is a prominent modulator of synaptic transmission, probably in all types of synapses (Hori et al., 1999Hori T. Takai Y. Takahashi T.

The dominant effect of DAG (or its synthetic analogs, β-phorbol esters) is to transiently enhance evoked presynaptic release, often referred to as synaptic potentiation (Malenka et al., 1986Malenka R.C.

Typically, no changes are observed in the amplitude of the responses that individual release events generate on the postsynaptic side, indicating that potentiation is primarily a presynaptic phenomenon (Lou et al., 2005Lou X.

Residual Ca2+ and short-term synaptic plasticity.Nature. 1994; 371: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength is specifically referred to as synaptic augmentation (Swandulla et al., 1991Swandulla D. Hans M. Zipser K. Augustine G.J.

DAG potentiates the effects of residual Ca2+ (Lou et al., 2005Lou X. Scheuss V. Schneggenburger R.

Protein kinase c increases the apparent affinity of the release machinery to Ca2+ by enhancing the release machinery downstream of the Ca2+ sensor.J.

Regulation of presynaptic phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate by neuronal activity.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hence, DAG-induced potentiation is a central aspect in synaptic plasticity. Protein kinase C (PKC) is the major intracellular target of DAG. PKC is activated by DAG through binding to its C1 domain or directly by Ca2+ via its C2 domains and has been found to induce synaptic potentiation/augmentation in many studies (Francis et al., 2002Francis H.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10538-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This makes Munc18-1 an important and one of the few remaining plausible candidates as a downstream target of synaptic PKC-dependent potentiation. In addition to PKC activation, DAG and phorbol esters can also directly activate other C1 domain-containing proteins like Munc13. Direct activation of Munc13 by phorbol esters is essential for synaptic potentiation and continues to occur after PKC activity is blocked, suggesting a redundant role of PKC (Rhee et al., 2002Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Beta phorbol ester- and diacylglycerol-induced augmentation of transmitter release is mediated by Munc13s and not by PKCs.Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, constitutively active membrane-bound UNC-13 was unable to fully compensate for impaired endogenous phorbol ester production in C. elegans (Lackner et al., 1999Lackner M.R. Nurrish S.J. Kaplan J.M. Facilitation of synaptic transmission by EGL-30 Gqalpha and EGL-8 PLCbeta: DAG binding to UNC-13 is required to stimulate acetylcholine release.Neuron. 1999; 24: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional phorbol ester-dependent pathways may be involved in potentiation. Thus, although many studies point toward a PKC-dependent pathway underlying potentiation and good candidate substrates exist, the data on the Munc13 mutant challenges this theory, and a conceptual paradox between PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways arises. Here, we provide evidence to converge both pathways of DAG-induced potentiation. First, we confirm that DAG analogs continue to augment transmission after PKC inhibition in autaptic neurons, but only when DAG analogs were previously applied to the same cells. Second, we identify Munc18-1 as an essential substrate in the PKC-dependent pathway by comparing synaptic responses in munc18-1 null mutant autaptic neurons rescued with either wild-type Munc18-1 or a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PKC. Finally, using repetitive stimulation, we show that Munc18-1 phosphorylation by PKC is a central and essential aspect in short-term plasticity. To test the potential role of Munc18-1 phosphorylation by PKC in synaptic plasticity, we substituted PKC phosphorylation sites serine 306 and serine 313 for alanines, creating a mutant referred to as M18PKCi. Indeed, phosphorylation by PKC was severely impaired in this mutant (Figures 1A and 1B). As expected, the mutations did not obstruct the interaction between M18PKCi and syntaxin (Figure 1C). Munc18-1 null mutant neurons die within 7 days in vitro (DIV) (Heeroma et al., 2004Heeroma J.H. Roelandse M. Wierda K. van Aerde K.I. Toonen R.F. Hensbroek R.A. Brussaard A. Matus A. Verhage M. Trophic support delays but does not prevent cell-intrinsic degeneration of neurons deficient for munc18-1.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Viral introduction of munc18-1 cDNA at DIV 1 rescues these neurons. Autaptic (micro-dot) cultures of munc18-1 null mutant neurons rescued with M18PKCi were viable and morphologically similar to autaptic munc18-1 null mutant neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 (Figure 1D). No difference was observed in the number of synaptic connections, total dendritic length, and dendritic branching between neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 or M18PKCi (Figure 1E). Thus, viral introduction of M18PKCi rescues the lethal phenotype of munc18-1 null mutant neurons. We studied the basal synaptic function in M18PKCi-rescued neurons using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were normal in neurons rescued with M18PKCi, both at 33°C and at room temperature (RT; Figures 1F and 1G) as well as during conditions of decreased release efficiency (2 mM Ca2+/4 mM Mg2+, Figure 1H). Application of hyperosmotic solution was used to probe the size of the ready-releasable pool (RRP). Both high and medium hyperosmotic sucrose responses were comparable between neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 and M18PKCi (200 mM sucrose, Figure 1I; 500 mM sucrose, Figure 1J). Consequently, the initial vesicular release probability (Pves, evoked release/RRP) was normal in neurons rescued with M18PKCi (Figure 1K). Spontaneous amplitude, decay time, and frequency were similar in neurons rescued with M18PKCi and wild-type munc18-1 (Figure 1L). Note that viral expression of Munc18-1 in munc18-1 null mutant neurons results in a mild (1–1.5 times) overexpression phenotype, resulting in an increased spontaneous release frequency (Nili et al., 2006Nili U. de Wit H. Gulyas-Kovacs A. Toonen R.F. Sorensen J.B. Verhage M. Ashery U. Munc18-1 phosphorylation by protein kinase C potentiates vesicle pool replenishment in bovine chromaffin cells.Neuroscience. 2006; 143: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). So, Munc18PKCi rescues neuronal morphology and basal synaptic transmission to a similar extent as wild-type Munc18-1. Next we investigated DAG-induced potentiation in neurons rescued with M18PKCi. We used phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) as synthetic DAG analogs (Newton, 1995Newton A.C. Protein kinase C: structure, function, and regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, Newton, 1997Newton A.C. Regulation of protein kinase C.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and low-frequency electrical stimulation (0.2 Hz) to study their effects on EPSC amplitude in munc18-1 null mutant neurons rescued with either wild-type munc18-1 or M18PKCi. In line with previous studies, PMA increased autaptic EPSC amplitude in neurons expressing wild-type Munc18-1 (Figure 2A), while no potentiation was observed with the biological inactive form of PMA (α-PMA, data not shown). Interestingly, PMA-induced potentiation was absent in neurons rescued with M18PKCi (Figure 2A). Even in conditions favoring the induction of synaptic potentiation (reduced external Ca2+; Lou et al., 2005Lou X. Scheuss V. Schneggenburger R.

Physiol. 1999; 515: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), PMA failed to potentiate release in neurons rescued with M18PKCi (Figure 2B). As anticipated, neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 now showed an even more pronounced potentiation of evoked release (Figure 2B). Furthermore, we found a 6-fold increase in spontaneous release frequency in autaptic neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1, but no increase in release frequency upon PMA application was observed in neurons rescued with M18PKCi (Figures 2C and 2D). Similar to PMA application, PDBu-induced potentiation of evoked release was absent in neurons rescued with M18PKCi (Figures 3A and 3F), while neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 showed normal potentiation (Figures 3A, 3D, and 3F, first PDBu application). Thus, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Munc18-1 is essential for PMA/PDBu-induced potentiation.Figure 3PKC Inhibition Blocks Potentiation Only in Neurons Naive for Phorbol EstersShow full caption(A) Bath-applied PDBu (1 μM, 60 s) could not induce potentiation of EPSCs in M18PKCi-expressing neurons (open gray triangles, n = 6), while induction was normal in M18WT-expressing neurons (black squares, n = 11). PKC inhibitor BIS (3 μM) was used to assess involvement of PKC in potentiation. Interestingly, PDBu still induced potentiation after PKC inhibition in neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 (second PDBu application).

PKC inhibitor BIS (3 μM) was used to assess involvement of PKC in potentiation. Interestingly, PDBu still induced potentiation after PKC inhibition in neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 (second PDBu application). EPSCs were evoked with 0.2 Hz stimulations at RT.

Naive munc18-1 null mutant neurons rescued with M18DD showed a partial resistance to Ro 31-8220 application. (F) To avoid BIS-induced rundown of synaptic responses, we used Ro 31-8220 as PKC inhibitor. Again, single application of PDBu before Ro 31-8220 infusion allowed PKC-independent potentiation during a second PDBu application in the presence of Ro 31-8220 in cells rescued with wild-type Munc18-1, but not in M18PKCi-expressing neurons. Data shown are mean values ± SEM. However, previous experiments have shown that PDBu potentiates release even when PKC activity is blocked by bisindolylmaleimide (BIS), arguing that phorbol ester-induced potentiation is PKC independent and acts via direct stimulation of the C1 domain of Munc13 (Rhee et al., 2002Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Beta phorbol ester- and diacylglycerol-induced augmentation of transmitter release is mediated by Munc13s and not by PKCs.Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we first confirmed that PKC inhibition by BIS indeed failed to block PDBu-dependent potentiation in neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 (Figure 3A, second PDBu application in the presence of BIS). However, in naive wild-type neurons that had not been challenged with PDBu before, BIS application did block PDBu-induced potentiation (Figure 3B). Thus, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Munc18-1 is a prerequisite for Munc13-dependent potentiation. The BIS-induced synaptic rundown of evoked responses is caused by an unknown (possibly postsynaptic) mechanism, unrelated to Munc18-1 and Munc13 (Yawo, 1999Yawo H. Protein kinase C potentiates transmitter release from the chick ciliary presynaptic terminal by increasing the exocytotic fusion probability.J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To avoid BIS-induced EPSC rundown, we used a second PKC inhibitor (Ro 31-8220, 1 μM) that does not cause synaptic rundown. Again, we found PKC inhibition in naive wild-type neurons and null mutant neurons rescued with wild-type munc18-1 to block PDBu-induced potentiation (Figures 3C and 3D) while application of PDBu before Ro 31-8220 infusion again resulted in synaptic potentiation upon the second PDBu application during Ro 31-8220 block (Figure 3F). In conclusion, both PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Munc18-1 and direct activation of Munc13 are essential for phorbol ester-induced potentiation. We wondered whether induction of Munc18-1 phosphorylation by repetitive synaptic activity would also permit PDBu-induced potentiation in the presence of Ro 31-8220. To test this, we applied 20 or 200 pulses at 40 Hz directly preceding Ro 31-8220 application (Figure 4A). In munc18-1 null mutant cells rescued with wild-type Munc18-1, these depolarization trains indeed allowed for PDBu potentiation of evoked release that was proportional to the amount of previous stimuli. In contrast, munc18-1 null mutant cells rescued with M18PKCi did not show a PDBu potentiation permissive period (in line with data in Figure 3). Reduced release probability (2 mM Ca2+/4 mM Mg2+) resulted in synaptic facilitation during high-frequency stimulation in both M18WT and M18PKCi-expressing neurons, indicating that facilitation is unaffected in M18PKCi-expressing neurons (Figure 4B and see Figure S4 in the Supplemental Data available online). In contrast, posttetanic augmentation was absent in neurons expressing M18PKCi (Figure 4B). Finally, to test if Munc18-1 phosphorylation in itself is sufficient to make neurons Ro 31-8220 resistant, we rescued munc18-1 null mutant neurons with a phosphomimetic Munc18-1 mutant (S306D, S313D; M18DD). Naive M18DD-expressing neurons showed a partial resistance to Ro-31 application (Figure 3E). Therefore, Munc18-1 phosphorylation is the major, but possibly not the only, PKC substrate in phorbol ester-induced potentiation. Munc13 may depend on Munc18-1 phosphorylation for its function at the plasma membrane. In adrenal chromaffin cells, Munc13 translocates to the membrane upon phorbol ester application (Ashery et al., 2000Ashery U. Varoqueaux F. Voets T. Betz A. Thakur P. Koch H. Neher E. Brose N. Rettig J. Munc13-1 acts as a priming factor for large dense-core vesicles in bovine chromaffin cells.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3586-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).

However, a direct role of dopamine in ICSS-mediated reward has been questioned. Here, simultaneous voltammetric and electrophysiological recordings from the same electrode reveal that, at certain sites, the onset of anticipatory dopamine surges and changes in neuronal firing patterns during ICSS are coincident, whereas sites lacking dopamine changes also lack patterned firing. Intrashell microinfusion of a D1, but not a D2 receptor antagonist, blocks ICSS. An iontophoresis approach was implemented to explore the effect of dopamine antagonists on firing patterns without altering behavior. Similar to the microinfusion experiments, ICSS-related firing is selectively attenuated following D1 receptor blockade. This work establishes a temporal link between anticipatory rises of dopamine and firing patterns in the NAc shell during ICSS and suggests that they may play a similar role with natural rewards and during drug self-administration."

Moreover, neuronal classes exhibit unique morphologies, and modeling studies have shown that the shape of the dendritic tree affects the electrical behavior (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996Mainen Z.F.

Neuronal signaling is not only restricted to point-to-point synaptic transmission but is also mediated by diffuse messengers including classical neuromodulators (e.g., ACh, 5-HT), nitric oxide (Jacoby et al., 2001Jacoby S.

The signal processing carried out by an individual neuron is therefore determined by both its morphology and the 3D structure of the network in which it is embedded. Understanding how complex brain structures and the myriad of underlying mechanisms interact to produce higher-level functions will require the help of network models with biologically realistic features. Models that use compartmental neurons, Hodgkin-Huxley type membrane conductances, and semirealistic synaptic connectivity have been used to explore the potential mechanisms underlying synchronous activity (Davison et al., 2003Davison A.P.

The development of more biologically realistic network models that include explicit 3D information would allow direct comparison of the model structure with anatomical measurements. Such network models would also allow direct comparison of the spatiotemporal properties of simulated neural activity with experimental measurements using multielectrode recordings (Buzsaki, 2004Buzsaki G.

Moreover, they could be extended to simulate volume signaling and brain metabolism. While the development of such 3D network models is theoretically possible with current simulators such as NEURON (Hines and Carnevale, 1997Hines M.L. Carnevale N.T. The NEURON simulation environment.Neural Comput. 1997; 9: 1179-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) and GENESIS (Bower and Beeman, 1997Bower J.M. Beeman D. The Book of GENESIS: Exploring Realistic Neural Models with the GEneral NEural SImulation System.

These include a requirement for algorithms that can create the highly nonuniform 3D synaptic connectivity observed in biological networks (Song et al., 2005Song S. Sjostrom P.J. Reigl M. Nelson S. Chklovskii D.B.

Indeed, the absence of such tools has prevented the development and use of more biologically realistic 3D network models. A more integrated understanding of brain function will require closer interaction between experimental and theoretical neuroscientists (De Schutter et al., 2005De Schutter E. Ekeberg O.

Untangling dendrites with quantitative models.Science. 2000; 290: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). At present, communication between these groups, and even between individual theoreticians, is hampered by poor accessibility and interoperability of models. Although single-cell and network models are available on public databases (Hines et al., 2004Hines M.L. Morse T. Migliore M. Carnevale N.T. Shepherd G.M. ModelDB: a database to support computational neuroscience.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2004; 17: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), their utility as research tools is often restricted to those familiar with the specialist scripting languages, which are simulator specific. For example, a neuronal model written in NEURON script cannot be used as part of a GENESIS simulation, thereby limiting its interchange and reuse. Although graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have improved the accessibility of single-cell models, networks remain inaccessible to most neuroscientists. We have developed a new software application, neuroConstruct, that facilitates the creation and analysis of networks of multicompartmental neurons in 3D space. Automated cell placement and generation of synaptic connectivity, together with 3D visualization, allow the creation and verification of models with greater anatomical realism than achieved previously with script files. A GUI and the automated generation of code for NEURON or GENESIS allow network models to be built, modified, and run without programming, enhancing their accessibility. Model reuse and interchangeability are facilitated through the implementation of a simulator-independent model description based on NeuroML standards (Crook et al., 2007Crook S. Gleeson P. Howell F.

Sci. 2001; 356: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We describe and test the functionality of neuroConstruct and extend a 1D model of the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex (Maex and De Schutter, 1998Maex R. De Schutter E.D. Synchronization of golgi and granule cell firing in a detailed network model of the cerebellar granule cell layer.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 2521-2537PubMed Google Scholar) to 3D, thereby providing an example of behavior, previously observed in vivo (Vos et al., 1999Vos B.P. Maex R. Volny-Luraghi A. De Schutter E. Parallel fibers synchronize spontaneous activity in cerebellar Golgi cells.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC6PubMed Google Scholar), that could not be captured in the original 1D model. neuroConstruct is a JAVA-based software tool for constructing neural network models with many biologically realistic features. These include realistic cell morphologies, voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, cell densities, synaptic connectivity patterns, and gross 3D structures of different brain regions. Cell and network models can be built through the neuroConstruct GUI and automatically simulated on either the NEURON or GENESIS platform. The latest version of neuroConstruct, including the models described in this paper and a number of tutorials, is freely available for download from http://www.neuroConstruct.org. neuroConstruct's functionality can be grouped into five main areas (Figure 1A). Reconstructed neuronal morphologies, commonly used in conductance-based neuronal models, can be imported into neuroConstruct in various formats (e.g., Neurolucida) and automatically checked for errors. More abstract morphologies with a smaller number of compartments can also be created manually (Figure 1B). Modeling of detailed cellular mechanisms, such as the conductance changes produced by voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, is essential for reproducing the complex behavior of real neurons. Cell mechanisms can be defined in neuroConstruct in a simulator-independent format and cell models created by specifying the complement and density of these on the cell membrane (Figure 1B). Once cell models have been created in neuroConstruct, they can be placed within a region of 3D space at a specified density (Figure 1C). Layered structures, such as the cortex, can be created from stacks of contiguous regions. Once the cells are arranged, synaptic connections can be generated according to specified sets of rules. Network simulations are carried out by automatically generating script files for the simulator packages NEURON or GENESIS and the results stored in text files. Simulations can be loaded back into neuroConstruct for visualization and analysis. For more specialized analyses, script files are created that allow data to be imported into two common numerical analysis packages. Neuronal models with complex morphologies have been used to investigate various aspects of synaptic integration and neuronal excitability (De Schutter and Bower, 1994De Schutter E. Bower J.M.

However, using such morphology files in compartmental models is complicated by the fact that they are often in different formats, their anatomical and electrical compartments are not equivalent and there are subtle differences in how the morphological information is used by different simulators. To overcome these problems, neuroConstruct can import and visualize morphology files with different formats (Figure 2A), including Neurolucida (∗.asc; http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida), GENESIS readcell compatible format (∗.p), most NEURON/ntscable generated morphology files (∗.nrn or ∗.hoc), and Cvapp (∗.swc) format (Cannon et al., 1998Cannon R.C.

The simulator-independent representation of the morphology used in neuroConstruct allows the same model to be mapped onto different simulator structures (Experimental Procedures) and is closely related to MorphML (Crook et al., 2007Crook S. Gleeson P. Howell F. Svitak J. Silver R.A. MorphML: level 1 of the NeuroML standards for neuronal morphology data and model specification.Neuroinformatics. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), a new standard for describing neuronal morphologies. MorphML is based on XML (extensible markup language), and is the core of level 1 of the NeuroML framework (Crook et al., 2007Crook S. Gleeson P. Howell F. Svitak J. Silver R.A.

Large-scale networks of thousands of neurons often use simplified cell models with fewer compartments to minimize the computational overhead (Santhakumar et al., 2005Santhakumar V. Aradi I.

Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 2194-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These can be created manually in neuroConstruct and are handled in the same way as more detailed cells. Neuronal signaling is mediated by a variety of subcellular, membrane, and synaptic mechanisms. Models of cellular mechanisms can be simple, such as a synaptic conductance waveform, or more complex, like Hodgkin-Huxley type formulations of voltage-gated conductances, which depend on both voltage and time, and their conductance density can be nonuniformly distributed over the cell membrane. Such models form a core part of any conductance based neuronal simulation, but their implementation is one of the more complicated aspects of using existing simulation packages. Although the mathematical framework used to describe such mechanisms (e.g., maximum channel conductance, reversal potential, rate equations) is general and familiar to many neuroscientists, implementation of these in NEURON or GENESIS involves use of a platform-specific programming language. Models of cell mechanisms are implemented in neuroConstruct using a ChannelML-based description, which forms part of level 2 of the NeuroML framework (Crook et al., 2007Crook S. Gleeson P. Howell F. Svitak J. Silver R.A. MorphML: level 1 of the NeuroML standards for neuronal morphology data and model specification.Neuroinformatics. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 3 shows a ChannelML file describing a synaptic conductance mechanism and how it can be used. It consists of an XML file containing the physiological parameters in a structured format that can be validated against a specification, reducing the probability of errors. Information in XML files can easily be transformed into other formats with an XSL (extensible stylesheet language) mapping file (Figure 3). We have created XSL files which map ChannelML descriptions of cell mechanisms onto NMODL (Hines and Carnevale, 2000Hines M.L. Carnevale N.T. Expanding NEURON's repertoire of mechanisms with NMODL.Neural Comput. 2000; 12: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) format for NEURON and onto the appropriate object in a GENESIS script file. The simulator-independent XML format promotes compatibility with other simulators: for each newly supported simulator, a single XSL file needs to be created which maps the files onto its specialized format. The nature of XML also allows translation of the file into HTML, allowing the cell mechanism to be presented in an easy-to-read format, facilitating online archiving. A number of ChannelML templates are included with neuroConstruct. Parameters in these models can be easily modified through the GUI to match the channel kinetics in a particular cell type, either from a published model or directly from experimental measurements of these parameters (e.g., m∞, τm, h∞ and τh for a Hodgkin-Huxley type model of a Na+ channel). However, ChannelML specifications are still in development, and some cell mechanism types are not yet covered. To allow for unsupported models and to provide greater backward compatibility, files in NMODL (∗.mod files) or GENESIS script (e.g., tabchannel based) can be incorporated into cell models created with neuroConstruct, but this makes the model simulator specific. For example, synaptic plasticity mechanisms and Markov models can be incorporated into a neuroConstruct-based model by inserting an NMODL file for simulation in NEURON. The use of different systems of units can lead to errors in translation between the different simulators. GENESIS uses a consistent set of either SI units or physiological units (ms, mV, etc.), whereas NEURON has its own system based on physiological units. Conversion between these systems of units is handled automatically by neuroConstruct. Once a cellular morphology has been imported or created in neuroConstruct, groups of sections can be defined to distinguish axons, somata, and dendrites. Subgroups of sections such as proximal, oblique, and apical dendrites can also be defined. The distribution of cellular mechanisms can then be specified for each cell region. For example, a nonuniform channel density can be implemented by varying the conductance density in each group (Figure 1B). Ion-concentration mechanisms (e.g., activity-dependent intracellular Ca2+ concentrations) can also be added in this way, as can passive electrical properties (specific membrane capacitance and specific membrane/axial resistance), allowing spine densities to be simulated without additional compartments. New cell models can be created from experimental or published data using neuroConstruct by importing/creating cell morphologies and modifying existing ChannelML templates or adding native code. However, the painstaking process of making a detailed multicompartmental cell model from scratch often involves automated optimization of parameters and access to all model variables, which requires coding with a command-line-based simulator or another program (e.g., MATLAB or Python; see Discussion). To test neuroConstruct's simulator-independent representation of channel mechanisms, we have recreated a published model of a cerebellar granule cell (GrC), originally written in GENESIS (Maex and De Schutter, 1998Maex R. De Schutter E.D. Synchronization of golgi and granule cell firing in a detailed network model of the cerebellar granule cell layer.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 2521-2537PubMed Google Scholar), and compared its properties on NEURON and GENESIS. The model contains multiple ion conductances, including a fast inactivating Na+ conductance, three K+ conductances (delayed rectifier, A type, and Ca2+ dependent), a high-voltage activated Ca2+ channel, and a hyperpolarization activated H conductance. It also has a passive leak conductance and an exponentially decaying pool of calcium. In the neuroConstruct version, all channels are specified in ChannelML. Figure 4A compares membrane potential during a depolarizing current step for simulations run on GENESIS and NEURON. The timing of the final action potential (AP) in the train depended strongly on the integration time step, and the two simulators converged to values separated by less than 1 ms after a 500 ms simulation run (Figure 4B).

The model quantitatively reproduces behavioral and prefrontal single-cell data from an experiment in which monkeys learn visuomotor associations that are reversed unpredictably from time to time. We show that when synaptic modifications occur on multiple timescales, the model behavior becomes flexible only when needed: slow components of learning usually dominate the decision process. However, if behavioral contexts change frequently enough, fast components of plasticity take over, and the behavior exhibits a quick forget-and-learn pattern. This model prediction is confirmed by monkey data. Therefore, our work reveals a scenario for conditional associative learning that is distinct from instant switching between sets of well-established sensorimotor associations.

Therefore, our work reveals a scenario for conditional associative learning that is distinct from instant switching between sets of well-established sensorimotor associations. In simple reflex, a stimulus automatically triggers a stereotyped motor response in a one-to-one fashion. By contrast, adaptive behavior critically depends on the brain's ability to flexibly choose an appropriate response which can vary depending on the specific behavioral context. For example, when we see a crosswalk and intend to cross the road, we need to first look left in the US, and right in the UK. The same visual stimulus (the crosswalk) should lead to two different motor responses (look left or look right) depending on the context. If we grew up in the US and we travel to the UK for a trip, we can certainly learn to associate with a crosswalk a different motor response. Interestingly we can also retain our bias to look left, as a result of a lifetime practice, and when we go back to the US we can immediately remember that bias. This ability indicates that there are probably learning mechanisms operating on multiple timescales: fast components would allow us to adapt quickly to new environments, while slow components would retain the memory of our experiences on longer timescales. The existence of multiple learning components plays a fundamental role in the decision process and in the learning strategy. In a stable environment, we are requested to respond consistently to sensory stimuli over long timescales and we need to ignore exceptions. For example we do not want to modify the association crosswalk-look left if we live in the US and for some temporary work we need to look right. On the other hand, if we move back and forth between the US and UK, we need to adapt to new environments frequently and quickly. We studied this kind of adaptive behavior by investigating a specific type of flexibility in a controlled laboratory environment. In an oculomotor paradigm (Asaad et al., 1998Asaad W.F. Rainer G.

In order to study the process of learning, the rewarded associations were changed at unpredictable times, and the monkeys had to learn by trial and error a new set of rewarded responses to the same visual stimuli. In particular two visual stimuli (A and B) were initially associated with Left and Right saccadic responses (L and R), respectively. From time to time the associations were reversed (from AL and BR to AR and BL, and vice versa) without any warning to the animal. When the associations were reversed, the monkeys quickly forgot the old associations and then learned the new ones. Interestingly, after a reversal, the animals almost immediately reverted to a chance level performance, followed by learning the new associations in 15–20 trials on average (Figure 1B). This feature was observed across seven monkeys trained on this paradigm by different investigators (Asaad et al., 1998Asaad W.F. Rainer G. Miller E.K.

Machon et al., 2006, Soc. Neurosci., abstract). Two other visual stimuli (C and D) were consistently associated with a fixed motor response throughout the experiment. These nonreversing stimuli were randomly intermixed with the first two stimuli, A and B. Motivated by this experiment, we have built a biologically plausible decision-making neural circuit model for arbitrary sensorimotor mapping. The model is constructed based on the observation that in the experiment of Asaad et al., 1998Asaad W.F. Rainer G. Miller E.K. Neural activity in the primate prefrontal cortex during associative learning.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1399-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar many recorded neurons in the prefrontal cortex responded selectively to the planned motor response. Moreover, the selectivity appeared progressively earlier within each successive trial as the animal learns a correct cue-response mapping, suggesting a role for these cells in learning arbitrary visuomotor associations. These observations, and others (Chen and Wise, 1995aChen L.L. Wise S.P. Neuronal activity in the supplementary eye field during acquisition of conditional oculomotor associations.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 1101-1121PubMed Google Scholar, Chen and Wise, 1995bChen L.L. Wise S.P.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3067-3081PubMed Google Scholar), revealed neural correlates of oculomotor reversal learning but are not sufficient for establishing synaptic mechanisms that causally link the observed neural activity and learning behavior. In the model that we propose, the interplay between decision-making circuit dynamics and reward-dependent synaptic plasticity quantitatively captures the process of learning and forgetting visuomotor associations, both for the observed behavioral data and the single-cell data recorded in prefrontal cortex in the monkey experiment. Importantly, the model gives rise to a surprising prediction, namely behavioral performance is rapidly reset to chance level by a single error even after the learning process has reached a steady state, which is confirmed by analysis of monkey data. Our neural circuit model has yielded insights into key questions about flexible sensorimotor behavior such as the following: what determines when we should be flexible and when we should not? how flexible should we be in different situations? is there a general neural mechanism underlying flexibility? We will show that the ability to decide when to be flexible (i.e., quickly forget and relearn) emerges naturally from the competition between learning processes that operate on multiple timescales. The learning components that predominantly drive the decision process are selected by the temporal statistics of the environment (how often do the associations change? is there any bias?). Moreover, random behavior is often observed in monkeys when the environment changes (Asaad et al., 1998Asaad W.F. Rainer G. Miller E.K. Neural activity in the primate prefrontal cortex during associative learning.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1399-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, Mansouri and Tanaka, 2002Mansouri F.A. Tanaka K. Behavioral evidence for working memory of sensory dimension in macaque monkeys.Behav. Brain Res. 2002; 136: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We show that the degree of randomness reflects the extent to which alternative associations are equally likely on a long timescale. Our model is based on two experimental observations. First, our analysis shows that the learning process is roughly independent for each of the two stimuli (visual cues A and B). Indeed, the proportion of correct responses to a stimulus immediately after a reversal is largely unaffected by the prior presentation of the other reversed object. In other words, having seen one object to be reversed does not greatly influence performance on the other. Specifically, the proportion of correct responses to a particular stimulus immediately after a reversal is 0.08 ± 0.08 when not preceded by presentations of the other object. If the other reversed object had been presented, this proportion rises only slightly (0.19 ± 0.07 for the first sessions and 0.25 ± 0.08 for the last sessions). In what follows we will assume that the interference between the patterns is negligible and we will show that a model based on this hypothesis can reproduce the behavioral data. Secondly, we focus on modeling neurons that are inherently selective to planned saccadic directions, which constituted 29% of the recorded cells in prefrontal cortex. For example, such a cell would fire at a high rate to a stimulus which signals a response in its preferred direction (e.g., Left), and it would fire at a lower rate to all those stimuli which signal a response in the nonpreferred direction (Right). Thus, this cell keeps responding according to the chosen motor response (left saccade) which may be associated with stimulus A or B in different blocks of trials. After a reversal, the time at which selectivity becomes apparent gradually moves backward (from the end of the trial, to soon after stimulus presentation and early in the delay period), as the monkey learned the new associations. Based on this finding, we propose a scenario in which cue-response associations are learned through the synaptic plasticity of afferents from sensory neurons to response-selective cells in a decision circuit. The core of the model is a decision-making network of integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic recurrent synaptic excitation (mediated by AMPA and slow NMDA receptors) and inhibition (mediated by GABAA receptors) as in Wang, 2002Wang X.-J. Probabilistic decision making by slow reverberation in cortical circuits.Neuron. 2002; 36: 955-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar (see Figure 2A for a schematic representation of the network architecture). Two subpopulations of excitatory neurons represent the direction selective neurons observed in the experiment, which we assume contribute to the selection of the monkey's intended motor response. In our model, when a visual stimulus is presented, the two populations compete, and the winner (Left or Right) signals the decision of the model system. When the inputs activated by a visual stimulus are the same for the two neural populations, the network chooses randomly one of the two saccadic movements with equal probability. Any input imbalance would bias the decision. From direct simulations of the spiking neural network model over many trials, we computed the probability that one of the two responses (e.g., Left) is chosen as a function of gLeft − gRight, the difference in the total synaptic conductances of external inputs to the two neural populations (Figure 2B). As the difference increases in favor of Left population, the probability to choose Left increases, and eventually the model's behavior becomes deterministic. Notice that the probability depends only on the difference between the two synaptic conductances, and not on the absolute value of the individual conductances (gLeft and gRight). The “psychometric function” is well described by a sigmoidal function (solid curve in Figure 2B). The network behavior with two different gLeft, gRight values (marked by C and D) is shown in Figures 2C and 2D for 14 individual trials, with the raster plots from a single model cell selective to Left, and the Left population firing rate. In the first case (C) gLeft is larger than gRight, and the decision network chooses Left in about 90% of the trials. In the second case (D) the input synapses are balanced (gLeft = gRight), and the Left neural pool wins in half of the trials. In each trial, a single stimulus triggers firing activities in both the Left and Right cell populations. Initially they increase together, until the recurrent synaptic input is strong enough that the two neural population firing rates start to diverge from each other. The recruited synaptic inhibition leads to a winner-take-all competition, so that one population wins and the other one loses. The time at which it is possible to discriminate between the winner and the loser is essentially the point of no return, at which the model system has already made a decision. This time was estimated by computing the latency to the half maximal direction selectivity as follows. The direction selectivity is defined as the relative difference in the firing rate (rA − rB) / (rA + rB), similar to the selectivity index used in the experiment (Asaad et al., 1998Asaad W.F. Rainer G. Miller E.K. Neural activity in the primate prefrontal cortex during associative learning.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1399-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Initially the network is in a symmetrical spontaneous state so the selectivity is zero. At the end of a simulated trial, the network has made a decision and the activity is high for one motor response and low for the other, so the direction selectivity is maximal. There is an intermediate time at which the selectivity is half of the final, maximal selectivity, which we define as the latency to half maximum selectivity. In the simulations it is clear that with a stronger bias (Figure 2C) the decision occurs earlier, and thus the latency is shorter. It is computationally costly to simulate the full spiking neuron network model for learning process over hundreds of trials. Since the network's decision behavior is well characterized by the choice probability as a sigmoid (softmax) function of the input difference (Figure 2B), we can use the latter instead of direct simulations when learning is considered. Hence, in any single trial, given gRight and gLeft, the network's choice is assumed to be random, with a probability determined by the softmax criterion. The outcome of the stochastic process used to generate the network's decision leads to synaptic changes according to a reward-dependent Hebbian learning rule (see the next section). The modified gRight and gLeft values are then used to update the decision criterion for the next trial. This procedure generates a variability from session to session that is similar to the one observed in the experiment. Learning is modeled by synaptic plasticity from the stimulus selective inputs to the two competing decision neural populations (gLeft and gRight). For the sake of simplicity we will first describe this model with a single learning component, its behavior and experimental predictions. As we will show, this will naturally lead us to introduce learning with multiple components (in particular on at least one additional timescale), in order to account for robust and flexible behavior. Given that in the experiment what the monkey learns about one stimulus does not affect the response to the other, we study separately the external input conductances corresponding to different stimuli. In other words, we focus on a single stimulus (e.g., picture A) and consider which of the two responses is triggered by it. We introduce learning rules for strengthening and weakening the synaptic conductances from that input to the two decision neural pools, depending on whether the triggered response is rewarded or not. Each of the two input synaptic conductances is restricted to a fixed range, reflecting the fact that synapses are bounded and the neural activity varies in a limited range. This restriction makes the memory forgetful (Parisi, 1986Parisi G. A memory which forgets.J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 1986; 19: L617-L620Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Amit and Fusi, 1994Amit D.J.

Hebbian spike-driven synaptic plasticity for learning patterns of mean firing rates.Biol. Cybern. 2002; 87: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), i.e., the mnemonic trace of the past experiences decays exponentially with their age and old visuomotor associations are forgotten. The learning algorithm is schematically summarized in Figure 3A. When the selected response corresponds to the correct association (e.g., AL) and is rewarded, the external inputs to the winning decision neurons are strengthened, whereas those to the losing neurons are weakened. When the selected response corresponds to the wrong association (AR), there is no reward and both external inputs to the two decision cell populations are depressed quickly and brought toward their minimal values which are assumed to be equal for left and right. The updating rule in the absence of reward is not uniquely determined by the data, and other rules are possible (see Experimental Procedures). Learning rate in nonrewarded trials must be much higher (about 20×) than that in rewarded trials, in order to reproduce the strong reset observed in the behaving monkey after reversal. A simulation of the learning process is shown in Figure 3B, where we calibrated the parameters by fitting the model to the behavioral data (see below). For each trial, given the synaptic inputs for a specific cue, the response of the monkey is decided randomly with the choice probability of Figure 2B. Then, the input synaptic conductances are updated according to the rules of Figure 3A; their time courses across several learning reversals are shown in Figure 3B (upper panel). The corresponding probability of choosing one of the two saccades (Left) is shown in the middle panel. The associations are reversed every 60–70 trials. Before each reversal, the performance is high, and the input synapse to the population representing the correct choice is close to its maximal value. After the first error following reversal, both the inputs are reset to the minimal value and the model starts responding randomly, with a performance at chance level. The model usually spends a few trials in such a situation, because each error resets again both synaptic inputs. This is reflected by small fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around zero (upper panel). As the probability of correct responses surpasses a critical threshold, resets due to mistakes become unlikely, and the system learns slowly to have more confidence and eventually responds correctly consistently (middle panel). During this process, the time it takes to make a decision, expressed as the latency to the half maximum direction selectivity of neural activity in a trial, is initially long (about 800 ms), and becomes considerably shorter (300 ms) after the new associations are established (bottom panel). Figure 4A shows the learning curve after reversal from our model (solid line), superimposed with the monkey's behavioral data (open circles) (see Experimental Procedures for fitting the model parameters). In the model, after a learning reversal the chance level performance results from random decisions driven purely by noise (with gRight ≈ gLeft), with no bias for one motor response or another. However, such behavioral data could have different interpretations, since 50%-50% performance can be produced either by truly random choices or by a strongly biased perseverant behavior of the monkey (e.g., if the monkey responds always left to both stimuli after one mistake). We examined these possibilities by data analysis, and our results show that the monkey's behavior does not exhibit a bias for one motor response or another, consistent with our model (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Moreover, the learning curve in Figure 4A was obtained by averaging across blocks of trials. Conceivably such a smooth learning curve could arise even if in single blocks the monkey's learning is not gradual but exhibits a sudden transition from a poor to a high performance level, provided that the transition time is random across blocks of trials. We considered this possibility and found that the raw behavioral data do not show obvious evidence for switch-like abrupt transitions after reversal in individual blocks (Figure S2), although statistically it is difficult to exclude this possibility entirely. Our model assumption about gradual learning after reversal appears to be compatible with the monkey data. We found that in order to replicate the fast reset to chance level performance after association reversal, observed in the monkey experiment (Figure 4A), in the model both synapses gRight and gLeft must undergo strong depression when a response choice is incorrect and yields no reward. Although this seems natural intuitively, it gives rise to a specific model prediction, namely that even after learning has reached a steady state the behavioral performance remains very sensitive to the occurrence of any error. We have tested this conclusion quantitatively in several ways. First, we checked that the performance steadily improves with consecutive correct trials (Figure 4B). About seven consecutive correct trials are sufficient to reach the maximal performance, and only three consecutive correct trials are enough to get to 80% performance (this is compatible with the behavior observed in Brasted and Wise, 2004Brasted P.J. Wise S.P. Comparison of learning-related neuronal activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and striatum.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the performance is reset to chance level after a single error trial, regardless of the number of consecutive correct trials that precede the mistake (Figure 4C). This strong and unexpected model prediction is thus confirmed by our analysis of the monkey's data. Furthermore, in our model the learning rates are assumed to be independent of the previous history and hence every mistake caused by the wrong decision of the model network should reset the performance (shown in Figure 4C), independently from the fact that the error is due to reversal or to some other reason. Thus, another model prediction is that the performance curve following every mistake (no matter when it occurs) should be similar to the one obtained following the first error after reversal. In Figure 4D we show that our prediction is confirmed by additional data analysis. The performance after every mistake is plotted for the experiment (empty circles) and for the model (solid line). The model and the data learning curves match surprisingly well, indicating that our prediction was correct. We also considered the time course of the neural activity in the decision network model during associative learning. Following the first mistake after the reversal, the synaptic inputs are reset to their minimum value and hence the decision is slow (see Figure 2D). The time to the half of the maximum selectivity is the longest. As learning proceeds, biased synaptic inputs lead to faster firing dynamics in decision neurons (see Figure 2C), so that the decision time is progressively shortened. Using direct simulations of spiking neuron network model, we found that our model was able to reproduce the electrophysiological data of neural latency to half maximum selectivity in the experiment of reversal learning (Figure 5), notably with the same model parameters calibrated only by behavioral data. To achieve random decision making after reversal requires fine-tuning of model parameters, because the choice probability is very sensitive to small differences in the two inputs (see Figure 2B): the range over which the decision behavior is stochastic is small compared to the total synaptic conductances of external stimulation (gLeft – gRight) / (gLeft + gRight) ≈ 3%. Therefore any heterogeneity (e.g., random connectivity) can disrupt the mechanism underlying the stochasticity of choice behavior. Here we suggest that this fine-tuning can be accomplished in the nervous system by learning on a long timescale. The idea is that, if we add a slower component of learning (using a similar algorithm as for the fast component, see Experimental Procedures, but with smaller learning rates), the memory window within which experiences are kept in memory can be extended to span several blocks of trials in which the same stimulus is remembered to be associated sometimes with one motor response, sometimes with the other (Figure 6A). If the overall fraction of trials is the same for each of the two responses to be correct, the integration over blocks of trials of the slow components tends to create a symmetric input configuration which makes the two responses equally probable. This is shown in Figure 6B where the slow components of plastic synapses gLeft,Slow and gRight,Slow are initially different (in favor of choosing Left) but become equal through learning across several blocks of trials. At the same time, the fast synaptic components allow the system to learn the correct associations within each block. Every mistake resets the fast components, bringing the system back to the balanced configuration determined by the slow components. This scenario is supported by the experimental observation that, in the early stages of training, monkeys very often adopt strong biases to respond in only one direction. Only once their training is more advanced do they lose these biases and do the two choices became equally likely. The experiment has actually been"

Yeast ESCRT-I contains four subunits, Vps23, Vps28, Vps37, and Mvb12. The crystal structure of the heterotetrameric ESCRT-I complex reveals a highly asymmetric complex of 1:1:1:1 subunit stoichiometry. The core complex is nearly 18 nm long and consists of a headpiece attached to a 13 nm stalk. The stalk is important for cargo sorting by ESCRT-I and is proposed to serve as a spacer regulating the correct disposition of cargo and other ESCRT components. Hydrodynamic constraints and crystallographic structures were used to generate a model of intact ESCRT-I in solution. The results show how ESCRT-I uses a combination of a rigid stalk and flexible tethers to interact with lipids, cargo, and other ESCRT complexes over a span of ∼25 nm."

Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) is a human disorder caused by mutations in the tight junction protein claudin-16. However, the molecular mechanisms underlining the renal handling of magnesium and its dysfunction causing FHHNC are unknown. Here we show that claudin-16 plays a key role in maintaining the paracellular cation selectivity of the thick ascending limbs of the nephron. Using RNA interference, we have generated claudin-16-deficient mouse models. Claudin-16 knock-down (KD) mice exhibit chronic renal wasting of magnesium and calcium and develop renal nephrocalcinosis. Our data suggest that claudin-16 forms a non-selective paracellular cation channel, rather than a selective Mg2+/Ca2+ channel as previously proposed. Our study highlights the pivotal importance of the tight junction in renal control of ion homeostasis and provides answer to the pathogenesis of FHHNC. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for more sophisticated in vivo analysis of tight junction proteins in renal functions. Furthermore, tight junction proteins could be major targets of drug development for electrolyte disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2002566701,"Previous studies showed increased extracellular nucleotides during renal ischemia-reperfusion. While nucleotides represent the main source for extracellular adenosine and adenosine signaling contributes to renal protection from ischemia, we hypothesized a role for ecto-nucleoside-triphosphate-diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases) in renal protection. We used a model of murine ischemia-reperfusion and in situ ischemic preconditioning (IP) via a hanging weight system for atraumatic renal artery occlusion. Initial studies with a nonspecific inhibitor of E-NTPDases (POM-1) revealed inhibition of renal protection by IP. We next pursued transcriptional responses of E-NTPDases (E-NTPDase1-3, and 8) to renal IP, and found a robust and selective induction of E-NTPDase1/CD39 transcript and protein. Moreover, based on clearance studies, plasma electrolytes, and renal tubular histology, IP protection was abolished in gene-targeted mice for cd39 whereas increased renal adenosine content with IP was attenuated. Furthermore, administration of apyrase reconstituted renal protection by IP in cd39-/- mice. Finally, apyrase treatment of wild-type mice resulted in increased renal adenosine concentrations and a similar degree of renal protection from ischemia as IP treatment. Taken together, these data identify CD39-dependent nucleotide phosphohydrolysis in renal protection. Moreover, the present studies suggest apyrase treatment as a novel pharmacological approach to renal diseases precipitated by limited oxygen availability."
https://openalex.org/W2072138658,"Within the developing mammalian CNS, growth factors direct multipotent precursors to generate neurons versus glia, a process that if perturbed might lead to neural dysfunction. In this regard, genetic mutations resulting in constitutive activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 cause Noonan Syndrome (NS), which is associated with learning disabilities and mental retardation. Here, we demonstrate that genetic knockdown of SHP-2 in cultured cortical precursors or in the embryonic cortex inhibited basal neurogenesis and caused enhanced and precocious astrocyte formation. Conversely, expression of an NS SHP-2 mutant promoted neurogenesis and inhibited astrogenesis. Neural cell-fate decisions were similarly perturbed in a mouse knockin model that phenocopies human NS. Thus, SHP-2 instructs precursors to make neurons and not astrocytes during the neurogenic period, and perturbations in the relative ratios of these two cell types upon constitutive SHP-2 activation may contribute to the cognitive impairments in NS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2068482739,"P2X receptors are trimeric cation channels that open in response to binding of extracellular ATP. Each subunit contains a large extracellular ligand binding domain and two flanking transmembrane (TM) helices that form the pore, but the extent of gating motions of the TM helices is unclear. We probed these motions using ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone that stabilizes the open state of P2X(4) receptor channels. We find that IVM partitions into lipid membranes and that transfer of the TM regions of P2X(4) receptors is sufficient to convey sensitivity to the lactone, suggesting that IVM interacts most favorably with the open conformation of the two TM helices at the protein-lipid interface. Scanning mutagenesis of the two TMs identifies residues that change environment between closed and open states, and substitutions at a subset of these positions weaken IVM binding. The emerging patterns point to widespread rearrangements of the TM helices during opening of P2X receptor channels."
https://openalex.org/W2007073672,"The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of hepatic fibrogenesis. In this study, we determined the effects of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type in the liver. Culture-activated HSCs were highly susceptible to 2-AG-induced cell death with >50% cell death at 10 microM after 18 h of treatment. 2-AG-induced HSC death showed typical features of apoptosis such as PARP- and caspase 3-cleavage and depended on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Confocal microscopy revealed mitochondria as primary site of ROS production and demonstrated mitochondrial depolarization and increased mitochondrial permeability after 2-AG treatment. 2-AG-induced cell death was independent of cannabinoid receptors but required the presence of membrane cholesterol. Primary hepatocytes were resistant to 2-AG-induced ROS induction and cell death but became susceptible after GSH depletion suggesting antioxidant defenses as a critical determinant of 2-AG sensitivity. Hepatic levels of 2-AG were significantly elevated in two models of experimental fibrogenesis and reached concentrations that are sufficient to induce death in HSCs. These findings suggest that 2-AG may act as an antifibrogenic mediator in the liver by inducing cell death in activated HSCs but not hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2006201768,"Background Neurosphere-derived cells (NC), containing neural stem cells, various progenitors and more differentiated cells, were obtained from newborn C57/BL6 mice and infused in a murine model of focal ischemia with reperfusion to investigate if: 1) they decreased ischemic injury and restored brain function; 2) they induced changes in the environment in which they are infused; 3) changes in brain environment consequent to transient ischemia were relevant for NC action. Methodology/Principal Findings NC were infused intracerebroventricularly 4 h or 7 d after 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion. In ischemic mice receiving cells at 4 h, impairment of open field performance was significantly improved and neuronal loss significantly reduced 7–14 d after ischemia compared to controls and to ischemic mice receiving cells at 7 d. Infusion of murine foetal fibroblast in the same experimental conditions was not effective. Assessment of infused cell distribution revealed that they migrated from the ventricle to the parenchyma, progressively decreased in number but they were observable up to 14 d. In mice receiving NC at 7 d and in sham-operated mice, few cells could be observed only at 24 h, indicating that the survival of these cells in brain tissue relates to the ischemic environment. The mRNA expression of trophic factors such as Insulin Growth Factor-1, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A, Transforming Growth Factor-β1, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Stromal Derived Factor−1α, as well as microglia/macrophage activation, increased 24 h after NC infusion in ischemic mice treated at 4 h compared to sham-operated and to mice receiving cells at 7 d. Conclusions/Significance NC reduce functional impairment and neuronal damage after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Several lines of evidence indicate that the reciprocal interaction between NC and the ischemic environment is crucial for NC protective actions. Based on these results we propose that a bystander control of the ischemic environment may be the mechanism used by NC to rapidly restore acutely injured brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2169319070,"Neural processing at most stages of the primate visual system is modulated by selective attention, such that behaviorally relevant information is emphasized at the expenses of irrelevant, potentially distracting information. The form of attention best understood at the cellular level is when stimuli at a given location in the visual field must be selected (space-based attention). In contrast, fewer single-unit recording studies have so far explored the cellular mechanisms of attention operating on individual stimulus features, specifically when one feature (e.g., color) of an object must guide behavioral responses while a second feature (e.g., shape) of the same object is potentially interfering and therefore must be ignored. Here we show that activity of neurons in macaque area V4 can underlie the selection of elemental object features and their “translation” into a categorical format that can directly contribute to the control of the animal's behavior."

However, little is known about how intracellular trafficking of lipids is regulated.

The major transport of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi apparatus is an ATP- and cytosol-dependent pathway and is genetically impaired in a Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell line named LY-A (3Fukasawa M.

After functional gene rescue experiments, the factor mutated in LY-A cells was identified to be CERT (also known as a splicing variant of Goodpasture antigen-binding protein), a 68-kDa cytosolic protein (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). CERT consists of three distinct regions. The amino-terminal ∼120 residues of CERT form the phosphoinositide-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The PH domain of CERT serves to target the Golgi apparatus by recognizing phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI4P) (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal ∼230 residues form the lipid transfer START domain. The START domain of CERT is capable of specifically extracting ceramide from membranes and transferring it to acceptor membranes (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M.

The middle region (MR), the ∼250 amino acid residues between the PH and START domains, is predicted to form no globular domains but may have various crucial functions. Indeed, the MR has a short peptide motif named a FFAT motif, which interacts with VAMP-associated protein (VAP), an ER-resident type II membrane protein (7Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In addition to the START domain, both the Golgi-targeting PH domain and ER-interacting FFAT motif of CERT are required for efficient trafficking of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (5Hanada K.

Narrow cytoplasmic gaps called membrane contact sites (MCSs), at which two organelles come into close apposition, are speculated to contribute to interorganelle metabolic and functional interactions (9Voeltz G.K.

Based on these results, it has been proposed that CERT extracts ceramide from the ER and carries it to the Golgi apparatus in a non-vesicular manner and that a particularly efficient cycle of CERT movement for trafficking of ceramide proceeds at MCSs between the ER and the Golgi apparatus (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 8Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol.

Mechanisms underlying regulation of the synthesis of lipids have been elucidated mainly in terms of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls of lipid synthases and their regulatory proteins, as best exemplified in the regulation of sterol synthesis (12Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). In addition, accumulating evidence that cells express various types of lipid transfer proteins raises the possibility that intracellular trafficking of lipids is another key process in the regulation of the synthesis of lipids. However, little is known about whether and how lipid trafficking events are regulated. In the present study, we show that the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide is down-regulated by hyperphosphorylation of a previously uncharacterized motif present in CERT and that this down-regulation requires an autoinhibitory interaction between the PH and START domains of CERT. In addition, perturbation of SM/cholesterol rafts at the plasma membrane induces dephosphorylation of CERT. These results revealed a novel mechanism for the regulation of the synthesis of lipids, in which a specific lipid trafficking process is controlled.

Transfection and Immunocytochemistry—HeLa-S3 cells were transfected with plasmids with Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain stable transformants, pcDNA 3.1/nHA-CERT WT was digested with PvuI, and the linearized plasmid was introduced into HeLa-S3 cells. The transfected cells were cultured in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Indirect immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (8Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol.

Immunopurification of HA-tagged CERT—For the purification of HA-tagged CERT from transiently overexpressing cells, HeLa-S3 cells (60∼80% confluent) in a 150-mm dish were transfected with HA-tagged CERT WT or mutant CERT using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents, and cultured for 24 h. Hereafter, all manipulations were carried out at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise indicated. The cells were washed twice with 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and suspended with 2.2 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, one tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)/50 ml) by scraping. The cell suspension was lysed with a tip-type sonicator, and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Then, 5 m NaCl was added into the supernatant fraction to a final concentration of 500 mm, the fraction was divided into two aliquots, and both of the aliquots were incubated with 15 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose for 4 h with gentle shaking. The agarose was washed three times with 1 ml of buffer B (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 500 mm NaCl). The agarose was resuspended in 90 μl of buffer B supplemented with a phosphatase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05 mm Na2EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% Brij 35, and 1 mm MnCl2) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with or without 4.4 units/μl of λPPase. After additional washing with 1 ml of buffer B three times, the agarose was suspended with 30 μl of buffer B containing 1 μg/μl HA peptides (Sigma) and incubated overnight for elution. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and 2 m sucrose was added to it to a final concentration of 250 mm. The purified CERT fraction was divided into aliquots and stocked at -80 °C. Mass Spectrometric Analyses—HeLa S3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged CERT were cultured in 4 liters of ES medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HA-tagged CERT immunopurified from the cells as described above was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The doublet bands of HA-tagged CERT, which were estimated to be totally ∼20 pmol equivalent by densitometric analysis with known amounts of bovine serum albumin for calibration, were excised together and trypsinized in gel as described previously (15Yanagisawa Y. Sato Y. Asahi-Ozaki Y. Ito E. Honma R. Imai J. Kanno T. Kano M. Akiyama H. Sata T. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Yamakawa Y. Watanabe S. Katano H. J. Pathol. 2006; 209: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The trypsinized CERT were extracted from the gel and concentrated to 5–10 μl by evaporation. The peptides were dissolved in 50 μl of 5% acetic acid, and the solution was applied toaGa3+-chelated resin (phosphopeptide isolation kit, Pierce). The resin was washed: twice with 50 μl of 0.1% acetic acid, twice with 50 μl of 0.1% acetic acid and 10% acetonitrile, and once with 75 μl of de-ionized water. Then the bound phosphopeptides were eluted with 20 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 9.0) twice. The eluted phosphopeptides were desalted with C18 Zip-Tip (Millipore), which was used according to the manufacturer's instructions except that we pre-equilibrated the resin with a 0.3% phosphoric acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was performed with the Voyager DE STR (PerSeptive Biosystems) in a linear mode with the matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (Sigma). The peptides of angiotensin I and an adrenocorticotropic hormone (amino acid 7–38) were used as external standards. PI4P Binding Assay—The affinity of CERT for PI4P was estimated from the ratio of the amount of CERT co-precipitated with PI4P-containing liposomes to the total amount of CERT. Purified CERT was precentrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C on the day of the assay, and the supernatant was used for the assay. Liposomes consisting of 1.6 μmol of egg phosphatidylcholine, 0.4 μmol of egg phosphatidylethanolamine, 0.2 μmol of lactosylceramide, and various amounts of PI4P per ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA) were prepared by sonication. The liposomes (10 μl) were mixed with 200 fmol of purified CERT in the buffer (40 μl) containing 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05 mm Na2EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.005% Brij 35, and the mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. After 15 μl of 2.5 mg/ml RCA120 was added, the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min to aggregate liposomes. Then, liposomes were precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The amounts of CERT in the supernatant and the pellet fractions were determined by Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody, and the ratio of the precipitated to the total amount (pellet/(pellet + supernatant)) was calculated. Other Methods—The reconstitution of ceramide transport from the ER to the Golgi in semi-intact cells was performed as described previously (4Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The transfer of ceramide between artificial phospholipid vesicles was done as described (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of VAP with CERT is described in supplementary data part 2. The treatment of TEV protease (Invitrogen) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions unless specific conditions were indicated. CERT Is Phosphorylated at Serine and Threonine Residues—We expressed HA epitope-tagged human wild-type CERT (HA-CERT WT) in HeLa cells and purified it using affinity chromatography. Purified CERT appeared as doublet bands upon SDS-PAGE: for simplicity, the form with a higher molecular weight (Mr)(∼77,000) is hereafter referred to as type I, and the form with a lower Mr (∼73,000) is referred to as type II (Fig. 1A). When treated with the protein phosphatase λPPase, the doublet bands of HA-CERT WT were converted to a single band (referred to as type III), the Mr of which was slightly lower than that of the type II form. Similar patterns were observed when HA-CERT WT was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown), whereas the Mr of a recombinant protein of CERT WT expressed in bacteria was not affected by λPPase treatment (Fig. 1A). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that CERT/GPBPΔ26 and its splicing variant CERTL/GPBP are phosphorylated in mammalian cells (16Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Raya A. Revert-Ros F. Martinez-Martinez P. Navarro S. Rosello E. Vieites B. Granero F. Forteza J. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40392-40399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The type I form clearly reacted with both anti-phosphoserine (Ser(P)) and anti-phosphothreonine (Thr(P)) polyclonal antibodies, while the type II form showed less reactivity with the anti-Ser(P) antibody and no appreciable reactivity with the anti-Thr(P) antibody (Fig. 1B). λPPase treatment of CERT almost completely abolished the reactivity with these antibodies. None of the type I-III forms appreciably reacted with an anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that (i) the type I form of CERT had multiple Ser(P) and Thr(P) residues, (ii) the type II form had Ser(P) residues to a lesser extent than the type I form, and (iii) the type III form represented a dephosphorylated form of CERT. Identification of a Motif for Hyperphosphorylation of CERT—To determine the phosphorylation sites of CERT, we stably expressed HA-CERT WT in HeLa cells and purified the expressed protein. The protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the bands were excised and digested by trypsin. Then, phosphopeptides purified from the trypsin-digested CERT were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Several pairs of signals with a 16-mass split, which is due to methionine oxidation, were detected (Fig. 1C). The peptides deduced from the signals were “RHGSMVSLVSGASGYSATSTSSFKK” with 7–9 phosphate groups and “HGSMVSLVSGASGYSATSTSSFKKGHSLR” with 8–10 phosphate groups (Fig. 1D). These peptides contain the same sequence: “HGSMVSLVSGASGYSATSTSSFKK.” This sequence has a characteristic feature, the S-X-X′ repeat and hereafter is referred to as a serine repeat (SR) motif. When the purified phosphopeptides were treated with hydrogen fluoride, a reagent that cleaves phosphoester bonds (18Kuyama H. Toda C. Watanabe M. Tanaka K. Nishimura O. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 1493-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), mass signals of dephosphorylated forms of the phosphopeptides assigned above were observed (data not shown). These results indicated that the SR motif of CERT is phosphorylated at 7–9 Ser/Thr residues. Mutations in the SR Motif Affect Phosphorylation of CERT—The SR motif is encoded by the fourth exon of the human CERT gene (Fig. 2A). This motif is a possible phosphorylation site for casein kinase I, a family of serine/threonine kinases, the typical recognition sequence of which is pSer/pThr (or Glu/Asp cluster)-X1–3-Ser/Thr (the underlined Ser or Thr is to be phosphorylated). Serine 132 of CERT, which is the most N-terminal serine in the SR motif, was predicted to serve as a phosphorylation site for leading sequential phosphorylations of all downstream Ser/Thr residues in the SR motif by a casein kinase I-type kinase. When HA-CERT S132A, which has an alanine residue substituted for the putative leading serine, was expressed in HeLa cells, it appeared as a single band with a Mr very similar to that of the type II form of HA-CERT WT on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). In addition, the λPPase-induced shift in the Mr of CERT S132A was slight, similar to the λPPase-induced shift in that of the type II form of CERT WT (Fig. 2B). On the basis of these results, we expected CERT S132A to act as a mimic of the type II form of CERT WT. In addition, for a mimic of the type I form of CERT WT, we made the mutant CERT 10E, in which all ten Ser/Thr residues in the SR motif were replaced with glutamic acid residues, because glutamic acid often mimics Ser(P)/Thr(P) (19Mohammadi A. Perry R.J. Storey M.K. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1062-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, the Mr of CERT 10E was also slightly reduced by λPPase treatment, like that of CERT S132A and the type II form of CERT WT (Fig. 2B), which indicated that one or a few phosphorylation sites other than the SR motif exist in CERT, although we have not identified the other site(s). With further analysis using MS, we confirmed that the type I form of CERT WT is highly phosphorylated at the SR motif and that the type II form of CERT WT and CERT S132A are far less phosphorylated or not phosphorylated at the motif (supplemental data part 3 and Fig. S1). The Function of CERT to Mediate Intracellular Trafficking of Ceramide Is Down-regulated by Phosphorylation of the SR Motif—We next examined effects of the phosphorylation of the SR motif on CERT-mediated intracellular trafficking of ceramide. HA-tagged CERT proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and purified to near homogeneity (supplemental data part 4 and Fig. S2), and the activity of the purified proteins to traffic ceramide from the ER to the Golgi was analyzed by using a reconstitution system within semi-intact cells. To assess the activity of exogenously added CERT, semi-intact cells were prepared from LY-A cells, in which endogenous CERT is impaired (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The purified CERT WT protein, which was composed of the type I and II forms of HA-CERT WT in approximately equivalent amounts (supplemental data part 4 and Fig. S2), was active as expected (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the activity of CERT S132A was ∼3-fold that of CERT WT, while the activity of CERT 10E was only 25% of the CERT WT level (Fig. 2C). We also purified the dephosphorylated form (type III form) of CERT WT after pretreatment of the HeLa cell lysate with λPPase. The activity of the type III form of CERT WT was ∼2-fold that of λPPase-untreated CERT WT, while λPPase pretreatment did not enhance the activity of CERT S132A or CERT 10E. These results indicated that the phosphorylation of the SR motif down-regulates the function of CERT to traffic ceramide from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Phosphorylation of the SR Motif Reduces the Affinity of CERT for PI4P—How does the phosphorylation of the SR motif down-regulate the ceramide trafficking activity of CERT? To answer this question, we analyzed subfunctions of CERT in vitro. The PH domain of CERT has PI4P binding activity, which is important for Golgi-targeting of CERT (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 8Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30279-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We determined the PI4P binding activity of CERT by a pull-down assay with artificial phospholipid vesicles (“liposomes”). The purified CERT WT protein from HeLa cells was co-precipitated with liposomes in a PI4P-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the type II form, but not type I form, of CERT WT co-precipitated preferentially with PI4P-containing liposomes (Fig. 3A). CERT S132A, a mimic of the type II form of CERT WT, efficiently interacted with PI4P: nearly 100% of CERT S132A was co-precipitated with vesicles containing 0.5 mol % PI4P (Fig. 3B). By contrast, CERT 10E, a mimic of the type I form of CERT WT, did not exhibit any PI4P-dependent co-precipitation (Fig. 3B). λPPase pretreatment resulted in a 4-fold increase in the PI4P binding activity of CERT WT (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas it did not affect the activity of CERT S132A or CERT 10E (Fig. 3B). The mutant CERT G67E has no PI4P-binding activity due to the mutation of a conserved glycine residue in the PH domain (5Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). As expected, CERT G67E exhibited no PI4P-dependent co-precipitation with liposomes regardless of λPPase pretreatment, and a CERT mutant with G67E/S132A double mutations also showed no affinity for PI4P (Fig. 3B). The requirement of a functional PH domain for the enhancement of the PI4P binding activity of CERT S132A ruled out the possibility that the S132A mutation generated a new PI4P-binding site other than the PH domain and then enhanced the PI4P binding activity. PI4P could not be replaced by phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PI3P) for the co-precipitation of CERT, confirming the specificity of this assay (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the SR motif represses the PI4P-binding subfunction of the PH domain of CERT. Phosphorylation of the SR Motif Reduces Ceramide Transfer Activity of CERT—We next examined the effects of the phosphorylation of the SR motif on the activity for the intermembrane transfer of ceramide, which is catalyzed by the START domain of CERT. In a cell-free assay system to determine the activity to transfer ceramide between liposomes, CERT S132A exhibited 2-fold more activity than CERT WT, and CERT 10E exhibited less than 30% that of CERT WT (Fig. 3C). Although λPPase pretreatment did not significantly affect the ceramide transfer activity of CERT S132A or CERT 10E, it enhanced the activity of CERT WT to the level of CERT S132A. The strong activity of CERT S132A for ceramide transfer was not due to its enhanced activity for PI4P binding, because (i) the in vitro ceramide transfer assay system was free of PI4P, (ii) the ceramide transfer activity of CERT G67E was almost identical to that of CERT WT, and (iii) dephosphorylation of CERT G67E, like CERT WT, enhanced the ceramide transfer activity to the level of CERT S132A. These results indicated that phosphorylation of the SR motif represses the ceramide transfer subfunction of the START domain of CERT. Effect of the Phosphorylation of the SR Motif on the CERT-VAP Interaction via a FFAT Motif—Another known subfunction of CERT is to interact with the ER resident protein VAP via a FFAT motif. To examine the interaction of CERT with VAP, we transiently expressed them in HeLa cells, treated the cells with a membrane-permeable chemical cross-linker, and then subjected the lysate of the cells to co-immunoprecipitation. CERT WT, but not the FFAT motif mutant CERT D324A, was co-immunoprecipitated with VAP (Fig. 3D), consistent with our previous study (8Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30279-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Both CERT S132A and CERT 10E were co-immunoprecipitated with VAP, like CERT WT. These results indicated that the phosphorylation of the SR motif does not greatly affect the FFAT motif-dependent interaction of CERT with VAP. Cooperative Regulation of PH and START Domains of CERT by Phosphorylation of the SR Motif—As described above, the phosphorylation of the SR motif of CERT repressed subfunctions of both the PH and START domains, although the two domains are separated by ∼250 amino acids. The findings led us to question whether the down-regulation of one domain would require the existence of another domain in the same molecule. To answer this question, we constructed two types of CERT 10E derivatives: one having a TEV protease-cleavable site after the PH domain (named CERT 10E TEV-A) and the other before the START domain (named CERT 10E TEV-B) (Fig. 4A). When these proteins purified from HeLa cel"

Here, we report functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence for extrapolation of scene layout information beyond what was physically presented, an illusion known as boundary extension. Consistent with behavioral reports, we observed boundary extension for scene-selective attenuation in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), but no such extrapolation of object representations in the lateral occipital complex (LOC). These results demonstrate that scene layout representations are extrapolated beyond the confines of the perceptual input. Such extrapolation may facilitate perception of a continuous world from discontinuous views."

Virus transcription is controlled by the upstream long terminal repeat (LTR), which includes cis-elements that recruit both cellular and viral factors. The HIV-1 LTR is often divided into functional elements: the Tat-activating region (TAR), the promoter, the enhancer, and the negative/modulatory regulatory element. The promoter, enhancer, and modulatory elements recruit host transcription factors, such as Sp-1, NF-κB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, necessary to initiate transcription (1Pierson T. McArthur J. Siliciano R.F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 665-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Rohr O. Marban C. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 736-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These factors also recruit coactivators, including histone acetyltransferases and SWI/SNF complexes, that influence the chromatin structure of integrated provirus (3Henderson A. Holloway A. Reeves R. Tremethick D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Lee E.S. Sarma D. Zhou H. Henderson A.J.

Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). For example, the 5′-untranslated leader region located downstream of the transcriptional start site is associated with a nucleosome in latent HIV proviruses, which is displaced upon induction of virus transcription. Furthermore, agents that inhibit histone deacetylases, such as trapoxin and trichostatin A, activate HIV provirus transcription, suggesting a critical role for chromatin remodeling in the repression of HIV transcription (7Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 8Sheridan P.L. Mayall T.P. Verdin E. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3327-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Transcription elongation has also been demonstrated to be a limiting step for HIV expression. HIV encodes a transcriptional activator (Tat) that binds the RNA stem-loop structure formed by TAR, and by recruiting P-TEFb to the LTR, HIV enhances processive transcription. P-TEFb, which is composed of cyclin T1 and CDK9, modifies RNA polymerase II (pol II) activity by hyperphosphorylating the C-terminal domain of pol II. In the absence of Tat, transcription elongation by RNA pol II from the HIV promoter is very inefficient (9Kao S.Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription analyses in the absence of chromatin revealed that the majority of elongation complexes initiating from the HIV-1 promoter prematurely terminate transcription within 500 bp of the transcriptional start site (10Marciniak R.A. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4189-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In vivo, it has been observed that cells infected with HIV accumulate short transcripts of ∼60 bases in the cytoplasm. The accumulation of these short transcripts and the identification of a site in this region where purified pol II strongly pauses elongation have led to speculation that transcription of the integrated provirus is repressed by premature termination (11Feinberg M.B. Baltimore D. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12Kessler M. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10018-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of Tat substantially increases the production of long transcripts (9Kao S.Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M.

Analysis of numerous cellular genes has revealed many cases in which pol II initiates transcription but pauses in the region 20–50 nucleotides downstream from the transcriptional start site. Pausing of pol II on the hsp70 heat shock gene in Drosophila requires two proteins called DSIF and NELF (14Wu C.H. Lee C. Fan R. Smith M.J. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Gilmour D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Wu C.H. Yamaguchi Y. Benjamin L.R. Horvat-Gordon M. Washinsky J. Enerly E. Larsson J. Lambertsson A. Handa H. Gilmour D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). NELF and DSIF associate with the elongation complex and inhibit elongation (16Yamaguchi Y. Inukai N. Narita T. Wada T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2918-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The inhibitory action of these two proteins is overcome by P-TEFb (17Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 18Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, NELF and DSIF have been implicated in regulating HIV transcription elongation. The E subunit of NELF associates with the TAR element (19Rao J.N. Neumann L. Wenzel S. Schweimer K. Rosch P. Wohrl B.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and ectopic expression of this NELF subunit inhibits transient basal transcription from the HIV LTR (20Fujinaga K. Irwin D. Huang Y. Taube R. Kurosu T. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Both DSIF and NELF contribute to Tat-dependent activation of HIV transcription and are phosphorylated by P-TEFb (20Fujinaga K. Irwin D. Huang Y. Taube R. Kurosu T. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Ping Y.H. Chu C.Y. Cao H. Jacque J.M. Stevenson M. Rana T.M. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation alters DSIF so that it stimulates elongation. NELF dissociates from the elongation complex during activation, but it is unclear if this dissociation is caused by phosphorylation of NELF (15Wu C.H. Yamaguchi Y. Benjamin L.R. Horvat-Gordon M. Washinsky J. Enerly E. Larsson J. Lambertsson A. Handa H. Gilmour D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The role that NELF plays in repressing transcription of the HIV provirus has not been investigated. Transient expression assays and RNA binding assays led to the conclusion that NELF represses HIV transcription by associating with TAR (20Fujinaga K. Irwin D. Huang Y. Taube R. Kurosu T. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This would require pol II to transcribe at least to +59. In contrast, NELF-mediated repression of several cellular genes appears to occur within 20–50 nucleotides of the start site (17Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 22Lis J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). If pol II pausing on the HIV LTR is similar to that of other genes, then NELF would repress transcription before synthesis of TAR is complete. In this study, we have investigated whether NELF repression of the HIV provirus might occur at a stage earlier than suggested by transient expression studies. Moreover, we provide the first detailed analysis of the behavior of pol II in the promoter proximal region of the latent HIV provirus. Antibodies—Anti-NELF-B antibody was the gift from Dr. Rong Li (University of Virginia). Anti-Spt5 (sc-28678), anti-p65 (A, sc-109), anti-p50 (H-119, sc-7178), anti-TATA-binding protein (TBP; sc-33736), anti-pol II (N-20, sc-899), and antiacetylated histone H4 (sc-8661-R) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse anti-β-actin was obtained from Sigma and served as a loading control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—U1 cells (25 ml, 2 × 106 cells/ml) were either left untreated or stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 4 h, and 675 μl of 37% formaldehyde stock solution was added directly to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 1%. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, transferred to centrifuge tubes on ice, collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min, and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequent steps were done according to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure described by Upstate Biotechnology to yield ∼3 ml of soluble chromatin. Ten μg of soluble chromatin (DNA) was used for each immunoprecipitation along with 5 μg of each antibody. The DNA was dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA). To prepare DNA representing input DNA, 10 μg of soluble chromatin was combined with elution buffer. Reversal of formaldehyde cross-links and isolation of the DNA were done as for DNA eluted from the immunoprecipitates. The final DNA was dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer and further diluted with TE buffer as needed. Two μl of immunoprecipitated DNA or input DNA was subjected to PCR in a final volume of 50 μl containing 10 pmol of each primer, 200 μm dNTP, 2 or 4 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and buffer (Roche Diagnostics). Each sample was subjected to 20 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min 57 °C for 55 s, and 72 °C for 50 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The following primers were used to amplify different regions of the HIV-1 gene: LTR –155 to +186, 5′-CCGAGAGCTGCATCCGGAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACT-3′; LTR +45 to +248, 5′-GGGAGCTCTCTGGCTAAC-3′ and 5′-AGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGAG-3′; and HIV +2415 to 2690, 5′-GTAACAGTACTGGATGTGGGTGATG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCCTATTTCTAAGTCAGATCC-3′. Ten μl of each PCR was run on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 20 min and then dried. Radioactivity was detected in the dried gel using a phosphoimager (GE Healthcare). The intensity of each band was quantified by volume analysis using ImageQuant software. Reverse Transcription-PCR—NELF-B small interfering RNA (siRNA) or control siRNA (250 nm) was delivered to 1 × 106 U1 cells using an Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector™ II. Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA or not for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer, and 4 μl was used for each reverse transcription reaction. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with either the LTR or Tat region primers in the presence or absence of reverse transcriptase in a 10-μl volume. cDNA was amplified by PCR for initiated short transcripts (+11 to +61) and elongated transcripts (∼5 kb downstream of the LTR) as described (23Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Verdin E. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). U1 cells treated with PMA were a positive control for induction of HIV transcription. Two μl of cDNA was subjected to a PCR in a final volume of 50 μl containing 10 pmol of each primer, 200 μm dNTP, 2 or 4 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and buffer (Roche Diagnostics). Each sample was subjected to 20 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 55 s, and 72 °C for 50 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The following primers were used to amplify different regions of the HIV-1 gene: initiated short transcripts, 5′-GTTAGACCAGATCTGAGCCT-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTTCCCTAGTTAGCCA-3′; and elongated transcripts, 5′-ACTCGACAGAGGAGAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGTCTGACTGTTCTGATGA-3′. The β-actin internal standard was included in all the PCRs. The β-actin gene was amplified with primers 5′-GTCGACAACGGCTCCGGC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTGGTGCCAGATTTTCT-3′. Ten μl of each PCR was run on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 20 min and then dried. Radioactivity was detected in the dried gel using a phosphoimager. The intensity of each band was quantified by volume analysis using ImageQuant software. Permanganate Footprinting—U1 or ACH-2 cells (2 × 106) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were treated with permanganate by adding 100 μl of ice-cold 20 mm KMnO4, which was prepared by dissolving solid KMnO4 in phosphate-buffered saline. The permanganate reaction was incubated on ice for 1 min and stopped by the addition of 200 μl of stop solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 40 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 400 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The solution was vigorously shaken until all coloration had vanished. Each sample was treated with 50 μg of proteinase K for at least 1 h and then extracted with a sequence of liquefied phenol, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49.5:49.5:1), and chloroform. Nucleic acid was precipitated with 0.6 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and ethanol. The DNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer (pH 7.5). To determine the pattern of permanganate reactivity, 500 ng of each DNA sample was diluted to 15 μl of TE buffer (pH 7.5). Seventy-five μl of H2O and 10 μl of piperidine were added, and each sample was incubated at 90 °C for 30 min. Three-hundred μl of H2O was added to each sample, and the samples were then extracted three times with 700 μl of isobutyl alcohol and one time with ether. The volume of the DNA was adjusted to 100 μl with H2O, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer (pH 7.5), transferred to a fresh siliconized tube, and used in a primer extension. Ligation-mediated PCR—Ligation-mediated PCR was performed with a set of nested primers (LM-1, LM-2, and LM-3). This series of primers spans the region +131 to +186 nucleotides downstream from the transcriptional start site of the HIV-1 gene. The sequence and annealing temperature used in the PCR for each of these were as follows: LM-1, 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACT-3′ and 54 °C; LM-2, 5′-CCACACTGACTAAAAGGGTCTG-3′ and 58 °C; and LM-3, 5′-GGGTCTGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCA-3′ and 62 °C. Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Assays—Restriction enzyme accessibility assays were performed as described previously (4Lee E.S. Sarma D. Zhou H. Henderson A.J. Virology. 2002; 299: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nuclei from 2 × 106 U1 cells were used for each assay. Depletion of NELF-B from U1 Cells with siRNA—Depletion of NELF-B with siRNA was done according to Aiyar et al. (24Aiyar S.E. Sun J.L. Blair A.L. Moskaluk C.A. Lu Y.Z. Ye Q.N. Yamaguchi Y. Mukherjee A. Ren D.M. Handa H. Li R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2134-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NELF-B (COBRA1) siRNA (250 nm; Dharmacon) was transfected into 1 ∼ 2 × 106 U1 cells using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector™ II and solutions and recovered in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four h post-transfection, fresh RPMI 1640 medium was added, and cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Characterization of RNA pol II and Associated Factors on the HIV LTR—U1 cells, a cell line derived from U937 promonocytic cells chronically infected with HIV-1, have been used as a model for HIV-1 latency (25Folkes T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S. Science. 1987; 238: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Provirus expression in U1 cells is poor in part because of defective Tat function (26Emiliani S. Fischle W. Ott M. Van Lint C. Amella C.A. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1666-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but is highly inducible following treatments with various cytokines or phorbol esters (25Folkes T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S. Science. 1987; 238: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 27Folkes T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Schnittman S. Orenstein J. Poli G. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). U1 cells have been used to examine the recruitment of transcription factors to the LTR as well as the changes in chromatin organization following induction of HIV-1 provirus transcription. Initially, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was employed to characterize transcription factor occupancy at the HIV LTR in unstimulated and stimulated U1 cells. ChIPs were performed with antibodies against NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 (which have been demonstrated to be necessary for induction of HIV expression), TBP, pol II, and the pol II-associated factors NELF and Spt5 (a DSIF subunit). As shown in Fig. 1, in unstimulated U1 cells, all of these factors were bound to the LTR. Furthermore, in the absence of U1 stimulation, no significant binding of pol II or the associated proteins NELF or Spt5 with downstream HIV genomic sequences was observed, as would be predicted if transcription elongation were being repressed. Following PMA treatment and induction of HIV transcription, p65 binding increased 3-fold, and p50 binding remained unchanged (Fig. 1, A and B). These results are in agreement with those reported previously (7Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), thus validating our ChIP analysis of the provirus in U1 cells. Following PMA treatment, ∼3-fold more pol II, TBP, and Spt5 were associated with the HIV LTR, whereas there was a <2-fold change in the level of NELF (Fig. 1, A and B). This suggests that a lower proportion of the pol II molecules associates with NELF under induced conditions. When factors binding downstream proviral sequences were examined, only pol II and Spt5 were detected (Fig. 1, C and D). The amount of pol II complexes associated with the LTR and genomic sequences was approximately equal in cells stimulated with PMA, suggesting that pol II is evenly distributed over the HIV genome, in contrast to unstimulated cells, in which the majority of pol II was found on the LTR. NELF was notably absent, suggesting that NELF does not travel with the elongation complex but dissociates from the elongation complex during transcriptional activation. Treating U1 cells with interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ resulted in similar changes in the occupancy of factors on the LTR and downstream proviral sequences, indicating that the changes were not unique to PMA induction but correlated with general events required for activation of HIV transcription (data not shown). A more detailed analysis of the behavior of pol II on the LTR in the context of U1 cells was done using permanganate genomic footprinting (Fig. 2). Permanganate footprinting detects transcriptionally engaged pol II molecules by reacting preferentially with single-stranded thymines located in the transcription bubble (28Giardina C. Perez-Riba M. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Unlike ChIP, which permits only the absence or presence of pol II on the LTR to be determined, permanganate footprinting allows the distribution of pol II to be mapped on DNA in vivo at a resolution of ∼10 bp. Fig. 2A shows the permanganate reactivity of thymines in unstimulated U1 cells. Comparison of this pattern with that observed with purified DNA reveals very reactive thymines at +41 and +45 and more modestly reactive thymines in the region extending from +49 to +85. This suggests that pol II is concentrated in the region 40–45 nucleotides downstream from the transcriptional start site, with a low level of pol II at +65, +75, +85, and +95 in unstimulated cells. In contrast, the pol II footprint generated in PMA-stimulated cells begins at +13 and extends through TAR to at least +111 (Fig. 2A). To confirm that this footprint is not unique to U1 cells, we examined the position of pol II on the HIV LTR in the chronically infected ACH-2 T-cell line. ACH-2 cells are similar to U1 cells in that transcription is not processive unless induced with cytokines or PMA. The defect in transcription has been mapped to a mutation in the TAR element (30Emiliani S. Van Lint C. Fischle W. Paras Jr., P. Ott M. Brady J. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Comparable with the pattern observe for U1 cells, the reactivity for thymines at +41 and +45 was high relative to naked DNA, indicating that pol II was present in this region. The reactivity between +49 and +85 was low, whereas treatment of ACH-2 cells with PMA increased the sensitivity of thymines within this region (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that HIV transcription in U1 and ACH-2 cells is limited in part by paused pol II in the region proximal to the promoter. Tat has been reported to stimulate the assembly of transcription complexes (31Raha T. Cheng S.W. Green M.R. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e44Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and to promote pol II processivity (9Kao S.Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 11Feinberg M.B. Baltimore D. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13Laspia M.F. Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether Tat can influence the behavior of the paused pol II complexes. Because we were concerned about low transfection efficiencies for U1 cells, cells were cultured with 10 μg/ml recombinant Tat (obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). Recombinant Tat is rapidly taken up by cells and transactivates HIV expression in U1 cells (32Ensoli B. Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Fiorelli V. Gendelman R. Morgan R.A. Wingfield P. Gallo R.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cannon P. Kim S.-H. Ulich C. Kim S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1993-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pol II pausing in the absence and presence of Tat was examined by permanganate footprinting. Fig. 2C shows that treating cells with Tat increased the permanganate reactivity of thymines downstream of +49, generating a pol II footprint that was similar to that observed in U1 cells cultured in PMA. In summary, these data suggest that when Tat is limiting, early HIV proviral transcription is repressed in part by a paused pol II complex located ∼40–45 nucleotides downstream from the transcriptional start site. Depleting NELF-B with siRNA Stimulates Transcription of HIV—NELF is a key factor in establishing a paused polymerase on the hsp70 gene in Drosophila and the junB gene in humans (15Wu C.H.

Chen Y. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6094-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and its association with the HIV LTR (but not downstream HIV sequences) suggests that it could be actively repressing HIV transcription elongation in U1 cells. To test this possibility, we used siRNA to deplete NELF-B, one of the four subunits of NELF. Successful depletion of NELF-B in cells was confirmed by immunoblots (Fig. 3A). More important, 70% less NELF-B was associated with the HIV LTR following siRNA treatment of U1 cells as determined by ChIP (Fig. 3, B and E). Diminishing NELF-B did not alter the binding of other transcription factors, including TBP, p65, and p50 (Fig. 3, B and E). Furthermore, reducing NELF-B had no effect on recruitment of Spt5 (a subunit of DSIF) or pol II to the HIV LTR (Fig. 3, B and E), demonstrating that diminishing NELF-B does not interfere with the association of pol II with the LTR. However, knocking down NELF-B did increase the amount of pol II associated with the HIV sequences 2415 bp downstream of the HIV-1 promoter by >5-fold in the absence of PMA stimulation (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that NELF-B negatively regulates HIV transcription elongation. The pol II ChIP data indicate that depletion of NELF-B could cause HIV transcription to increase. We tested this prediction by measuring the level of initiated HIV transcripts versus elongated transcripts in cells in which NELF-B was depleted. HIV transcription initiation and elongation were assayed in unstimulated U1 cells treated with control siRNA and NELF-B siRNA by reverse transcription-PCR using primers to TAR (+11 to +61) and to Tat exon 1 (∼5 kb downstream of the LTR), respectively, as described by Williams et al. (23Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Verdin E. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although there were no differences observed between control and NELF-B-depleted cells in their ability to initiate short transcripts, there was an increase in elongated transcripts in cells treated with NELF-B siRNA (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with this increase in transcription, we observed by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay a 2.5-fold induction in HIV replication in unstimulated cells that had reduced NELF-B (Fig. 4C). Therefore, NELF establishes a paused pol II complex at the HIV LTR that negatively regulates HIV-1 transcription elongation and HIV-1 replication. We wanted to determine whether NELF acts on pol II at a point prior to completion of the TAR element as would be predicted based on where NELF affects pol II on cellular genes. Depletion of NELF-B in unstimulated U1 cells led to changes in the pattern of permanganate reactivity on the LTR that were consistent with release of pol II from the region where it appeared to pause in control cells. As is readily apparent by inspection of the band intensities in lanes 4 and 5 in Fig. 4D and the densitometric trace of these two lanes (Fig. 4E), depletion of NELF-B caused the intensity of bands around the +41/+45 region to decrease and the intensity of bands downstream of +85 to increase. These results suggest that NEL"

As implantation of the fetus poses an immediate antigenic challenge, the immune system has to prepare itself for this event prior to implantation.Here, we show using quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry that regulatory T cells accumulate in the uterus not only during pregnancy, but also every time the female becomes fertile. Their periodic accumulation is accompanied by matching fluctuations in uterine expression of several chemokines, which have been shown to play a role in the recruitment and retention of regulatory T cells.The data lead us to propose that every time a female approaches estrus, regulatory T cells start to accumulate in the uterus in preparation for a possible implantation event. Once pregnancy is established, those regulatory T cells that have seen alloantigen need to be retained at their site of action. Whilst several chemokines appear to be involved in the recruitment and/or retention of regulatory T cells during estrus, in pregnancy this role appears to be taken over by CCL4."
https://openalex.org/W2122922838,"Prokineticins are potent angiogenic factors that bind to two G protein-coupled receptors to initiate their biological effects. We hypothesize that prokineticin receptor-1 (PKR1/GPR73) signaling may contribute to cardiomyocyte survival or repair in myocardial infarction. Since we showed that prokineticin-2 and PKR1 are expressed in adult mouse heart and cardiac cells, we investigated the role of prokineticin-2 on capillary endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte function. In cultured cardiac endothelial cells, prokineticin-2 or overexpression of PKR1 induces vessel-like formation without increasing VEGF levels. In cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells, prokineticin-2 or overexpressing PKR1 activates Akt to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress. The survival and angiogenesis promoting effects of prokineticin-2 in cardiac cells were completely reversed by siRNA-PKR1, indicating PKR1 involvement. We thus, further investigated whether intramyocardial gene transfer of DNA encoding PKR1 may rescue the myocardium against myocardial infarction in mouse model. Transient PKR1 gene transfer after coronary ligation reduces mortality and preserves left ventricular function by promoting neovascularization and protecting cardiomyocytes without altering VEGF levels. In human end-stage failing heart samples, reduced PKR1 and prokineticin-2 transcripts and protein levels implicate a more important role for prokineticin-2/PKR1 signaling in heart. Our results suggest that PKR1 may represent a novel therapeutic target to limit myocardial injury following ischemic events."
https://openalex.org/W2034573754,"Molecular studies have reported divergence times of modern placental orders long before the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and far older than paleontological data. However, this discrepancy may not be real, but rather appear because of the violation of implicit assumptions in the estimation procedures, such as non-gradual change of evolutionary rate and failure to correct for convergent evolution.New procedures for divergence-time estimation robust to abrupt changes in the rate of molecular evolution are described. We used a variant of the multidimensional vector space (MVS) procedure to take account of possible convergent evolution. Numerical simulations of abrupt rate change and convergent evolution showed good performance of the new procedures in contrast to current methods. Application to complete mitochondrial genomes identified marked rate accelerations and decelerations, which are not obtained with current methods. The root of placental mammals is estimated to be approximately 18 million years more recent than when assuming a log Brownian motion model. Correcting the pairwise distances for convergent evolution using MVS lowers the age of the root about another 20 million years compared to using standard maximum likelihood tree branch lengths. These two procedures combined revise the root time of placental mammals from around 122 million years ago to close to 84 million years ago. As a result, the estimated distribution of molecular divergence times is broadly consistent with quantitative analysis of the North American fossil record and traditional morphological views.By including the dual effects of abrupt rate change and directly accounting for convergent evolution at the molecular level, these estimates provide congruence between the molecular results, paleontological analyses and morphological expectations. The programs developed here are provided along with sample data that reproduce the results of this study and are especially applicable studies using genome-scale sequence lengths."
https://openalex.org/W2037223217,"Honeybees organize a sophisticated society, and the workers transmit information about the location of food sources using a symbolic dance, known as 'dance communication'. Recent studies indicate that workers integrate sensory information during foraging flight for dance communication. The neural mechanisms that account for this remarkable ability are, however, unknown. In the present study, we established a novel method to visualize neural activity in the honeybee brain using a novel immediate early gene, kakusei, as a marker of neural activity. The kakusei transcript was localized in the nuclei of brain neurons and did not encode an open reading frame, suggesting that it functions as a non-coding nuclear RNA. Using this method, we show that neural activity of a mushroom body neuron subtype, the small-type Kenyon cells, is prominently increased in the brains of dancer and forager honeybees. In contrast, the neural activity of the two mushroom body neuron subtypes, the small-and large-type Kenyon cells, is increased in the brains of re-orienting workers, which memorize their hive location during re-orienting flights. These findings demonstrate that the small-type Kenyon cell-preferential activity is associated with foraging behavior, suggesting its involvement in information integration during foraging flight, which is an essential basis for dance communication."
https://openalex.org/W2152828832,"Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) are designed to modify polypeptides in eukaryotes. Covalent binding of ubiquitin or Ubls to substrate proteins can be reversed by specific hydrolases. One particular set of cysteine proteases, the CE clan, which targets ubiquitin and Ubls, has homologs in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses.We have cloned and analyzed the E. coli protein elaD, which is distantly related to eukaryotic CE clan members of the ULP/SENP protease family that are specific for SUMO and Nedd8. Previously misannotated as a putative sulfatase/phosphatase, elaD is an efficient and specific deubiquitinating enzyme in vitro. Interestingly, elaD is present in all intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains, but conspicuously absent from extraintestinal pathogenic strains (ExPECs). Further homologs of this protease can be found in Acanthamoeba Polyphaga Mimivirus, and in Alpha-, Beta-and Gammaproteobacteria.The expression of ULP/SENP-related hydrolases in bacteria therefore extends to plant pathogens and medically relevant strains of Escherichia coli, Legionella pneumophila, Rickettsiae, Chlamydiae, and Salmonellae, in which the elaD ortholog sseL has recently been identified as a virulence factor with deubiquitinating activity. As a counterpoint, our phylogenetic and functional examination reveals that ancient eukaryotic ULP/SENP proteases also have the potential of ubiquitin-specific hydrolysis, suggesting an early common origin of this peptidase clan."

All biological systems require the biogenesis of functional respiratory or photosynthetic complexes for their viability. In bacteria, bioenergetic electron transfer chains are associated to the inner membrane. Biogenesis of these complexes is an intricate process that requires several steps such as the synthesis of the different subunits, their assembly, the incorporation of various types of metal or organic cofactors, and the anchoring of the complex to the membrane. In the case of exported metalloproteins, the assembly and cofactor incorporation steps need to be accomplished prior to translocation of the inner membrane via the twin arginine translocase apparatus (1Palmer T.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41398-41403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The location of this site over apoNarGH remains unclear. The other site is made of the first 40 amino acids of the N-terminal tail of NarG, which are responsible of the interaction of NarG with NarI (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as revealed by the x-ray structure of the NarGHI complex (13Bertero M.G.

It has been proposed that binding of NarJ to this site interferes with membrane anchoring of the apoenzyme, maintaining apoNarGH in a soluble form competent for Moco insertion (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observations raise the question concerning the possible role of NarJ in the coordination of subunit assembly and cofactor insertion processes. A major challenge in understanding the formation of multisubunit complexes is the spatial and temporal dissection of their assembly pathways. In this work, different stable folding maturation intermediates of the nitrate reductase complex are identified and characterized by using a systematic and thorough analysis by redox potentiometry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. A broad defect in metal incorporation is demonstrated in the absence of the accessory protein NarJ. Premature anchoring of the soluble nitrate reductase (NarGH) complex to the membrane leads to incomplete maturation of NarI with the specific absence of the cytoplasmically oriented bP heme. More important is that NarJ is involved in FS0 insertion within the catalytic subunit NarG in addition to Moco. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The E. coli strains and plasmids used in this work are described in Table 1. pNarGHHis6, allowing expression of a His-tagged NarGH complex, was constructed by cloning a BamHI/XbaI narHHis6 fragment into the pNarGHJI plasmid (15Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A XbaI/SphI narJ fragment was cloned into the pNarGHHis6 to yield the pNarGHHis6J. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pT25-NarG(Δ1–41) plasmid yielding the pT25-NarGH50S(Δ1–41) one. pNarGHJI and its derivatives are used to produce membrane-bound NarGHI, whereas pNarGHHis6 and its derivatives allow production of a soluble NarGH complex.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains or plasmidsDescriptionReferenceStrains LCB3064nar25(narGH), narZ::Ω, Δnap, thi-1, leu-6, thr-1, rpsL175, lacY, KanR, SpcRJ.

The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Soluble fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 90 min and then loaded onto a 10-ml Ni2+ ions affinity column (Qiagen), previously equilibrated in buffer A. The resin was washed with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and proteins were eluted in buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the nitrate reductase enzyme were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 (molecular cutoff 5 kDa) (Millipore). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C, and the proteins were stored at –80 °C. Bacterial Two-hybrid Assay—Protein interactions were detected using a bacterial two-hybrid approach as described previously (21Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol.

Redox Titration Experiment and EPR Spectroscopy—Redox titrations were performed at 25 °C in an airtight vessel flushed with oxygen-free argon in the same conditions as those described in Ref. 20Grimaldi S. Lanciano P. Bertrand P. Blasco F. Guigliarelli B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar. They were carried out under a range of redox potentials either by reduction with sodium dithionite or by oxidation with potassium ferricyanide (typically between +300 and –500 mV). Redox potentials are given in the text with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker-Biospin ElexSys E500 spectrometer equipped with a standard rectangular Bruker EPR cavity fitted to an Oxford Instruments helium flow cryostat (ESR900). EPR Quantitation of the NarGHI Redox Cofactors—EPR tubes were calibrated prior to be used for EPR experiments to allow for direct comparison of spin intensities in each preparation. To get rid of the differences in the concentration and expression level of NarGHI or NarGH in the different preparations used in this work, quantitation of their redox cofactor content was achieved relatively to the nitrate reductase [3Fe-4S] cluster (FS4) content in each preparation. For this purpose, EPR spectra of the cofactors having maximal signal intensity were recorded under non-saturating conditions in a fully oxidized state for heme bD and FS4, in a fully reduced state for FS0, and under a redox potential range for the MoV intermediate paramagnetic state. The double integral of the MoV EPR signal measured at 50 K was compared with the double integral of the FS4 signal measured at 12.5 K. In cases of FS0 and heme bD, the single integration of the low field feature of their EPR signal was compared with the double integral of the FS4 signal, in agreement with the method proposed by Aasa and Vänngard (23Aasa R. Vänngard T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). Then, the ratios so obtained for FS4, MoV, FS0, and heme bD relative to the amount of FS4 in a given enzyme were normalized to the same ratio calculated for the membrane-bound native enzyme NarGHI. This enables us to estimate the proportion of each center with respect to the FS4 center, and the results are reported in Table 2.TABLE 2Relative proportion of the cofactor contents in various preparations estimated with respect to the native enzyme from EPR experimentsEnzyme preparationFS0MovbdMembrane FractionNarGHI1.001.001.00NarGHInarJ1.3 ± 0.5NarGHImob0.7 ± 0.11.00 ± 0.2NarGH50SHI1.20 ± 0.2Δ1-41NarGHI0.80 ± 0.250.55 ± 0.152.2 ± 0.5Soluble fractionNarGH1.00 ± 0.151.00 ± 0.05NarGHnarJNarGHmob0.11 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab NarJ Is Required for the Insertion of FS0—In a previous study, we clearly demonstrated that, in the absence of NarJ, no Moco is present in the nitrate reductase complex (4Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Resolution of the crystallographic structure of the NarGHI complex revealed that the catalytic subunit NarG comprises a [4Fe-4S] cluster (FS0) in addition to Moco (12Jormakka M. Richardson D. Byrne B. Iwata S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Based on the close proximity of these two redox cofactors in NarG, we have investigated by EPR spectroscopy whether the insertion of the FS0 cluster is influenced by the absence of Moco either due to a synthesis defect (mob strain) or due to the absence of NarJ. This [4Fe-4S] cluster has an unusual coordination comprising one His residue and three Cys residues. As proposed later on, it was associated to an unusual EPR signature at g = 5.03 and g = 5.60 arising from a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster having a S = 3/2 high spin ground state (Fig. 1A) (24Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As the other FS clusters (FS1 to FS3) give, in the reduced state, a broad and unstructured signal in the g = 2.0 region (14Guigliarelli B. Asso M. More C. Augier V. Blasco F. Pommier J. Giordano G. Bertrand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), this peculiar EPR signature enables us to monitor unambiguously the FS0 center in the enzyme preparations. At first, EPR studies were performed on NarGHI-enriched membrane fractions from a mob strain defective in Moco biosynthesis (NarGHImob). Although the EPR signature of Moco is absent as shown previously (25Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Guigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the EPR signals of FS0 are clearly detected (Fig. 1B). The FS0 spectroscopic properties are, however, slightly altered as compared with the native enzyme, resulting in a broadening of its EPR spectral features. Its g-values are shifted from g = 5.60 and 5.03 in the native enzyme to g = 5.67 and 4.92 in the Moco-defective mutant for the Δms = ±3/2 and for the Δms =±1/2 EPR transitions, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). This can be explained by a slight decrease of the rhombicity parameter E/D (26Hagen W.R. Sykes A.G. Advances in Inorganic Chemistry. Vol. 38. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992: 165-222Google Scholar). Moreover, the FS0 redox potential decreases by about 150 mV with respect to its value in the native enzyme (data not shown). The proportion of the FS0 signal as measured with respect to the FS4 signal taken as reference (see “Experimental Procedures”) is comparable in NarGHImob and in NarGHI (Table 2). Our observations are consistent with the presence of FS0 cluster as revealed by the crystallographic structure of the purified NarGHImob complex (24Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to this previous study, we have shown that its EPR signature is detectable and not greatly modified. The spectral changes and redox potential shift arise likely from reported local structural changes (24Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Overall, our results indicate that the lack of Moco does not preclude the insertion of FS0. A similar analysis has been performed on NarGHI-enriched membrane fractions from a narJ strain (NarGHInarJ). In contrast to the native enzyme, neither the EPR signal of the Moco nor the EPR signal of the FS0 cluster were detected on a wide potential range, from +200 to –500 mV (Fig. 1D). By comparison with NarGHI-depleted membrane preparations (Fig. 1F), no signals were observed around g = 5. Moreover, EPR signals given in the g = 2.0 region by NarGHI and NarGHInarJ membrane fractions were compared with samples poised in the whole potential range, with a special care between +100 and –250 mV. No differences were observed between these two membrane preparations for EPR spectra recorded at low temperature (9–12.5 K) and using a microwave power ranging from 1 to 100 mW, which exclude any conversion of the FS0 spin state into a lower S = 1/2 spin state in the NarGHInarJ comple (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the absence of NarJ leads to the specific loss of both Moco and FS0 cluster from NarG and has no effect on the four iron-sulfur clusters from NarH (FS1 to FS4). Recently, we showed that Moco incorporation is a cytoplasmic event that must take place before membrane attachment of the apoenzyme (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is notable that, in the absence of NarJ, the apoenzyme interacts with NarI, leading to the formation of an inactive NarGHInarJ complex that can no longer be maturated. To investigate whether the absence of FS0 in the NarGHInarJ complex was a direct consequence of an early membrane anchoring or due to the absence of NarJ, EPR experiments were carried out onto purified soluble NarGH enzymes synthesized either in the absence of NarJ (NarGHnarJ) or in the absence of Moco biosynthesis (NarGHmob) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, no changes of the FS0 g-values and of its relative amount were observed in the NarGH enzyme as compared with the NarGHI-enriched membrane preparation (Figs. 1A and 2A and Table 2). This indicates that FS0 is retained in the soluble NarGH complex with no variation of its structural and electronic properties. Analysis of the NarGHmob enzyme reveals the presence of FS0. The g-values are slightly different (Fig. 2B), and its proportion is lower than that found in the NarGH enzyme (Table 2). Examination on a wide potential range of the soluble NarGHnarJ complex indicates the absence of the FS0 EPR signature (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the EPR signals related to the four iron-sulfur clusters present in NarH are unchanged in both NarGHmob and NarGHnarJ enzymes (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that Moco and FS0 insertion are cytoplasmic events occurring before membrane attachment of the enzyme complex and that NarJ is absolutely required for these events. It is notable that the NarGHmob and NarGHnarJ complexes can be reconstituted and activated in vitro in a so-called “activation assay” (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Such an assay consists of mixing, under anaerobic conditions, a crude extract containing the apoenzyme and the missing component, being either MobA (required for completion of Moco synthesis in a mob strain) or NarJ, and of measuring the recovered nitrate reductase activity. Based on this assay, we have observed a nearly complete activation of the NarGHmob, whereas a three times less activity was recovered with NarGHnarJ (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this latter case, a limiting factor or step most likely exists in the activation assay which may consist of the FS0 insertion step. On the contrary, efficient in vitro activation of the NarGHmob complex is likely due to the presence of the FS0 cluster. It should also be noted that a lower proportion of FS0 cluster was observed by EPR in the purified NarGHmob complex as compared with the NarGHImob one (Table 2). It is possible that the structure of the soluble NarGHmob adopts an open conformation amenable for Moco insertion with a less stable FS0 cluster, giving an explanation to the reduced amount of cluster. In a previous study, we showed that the NarG H50S substitution leads to the synthesis of an inactive nitrate reductase complex characterized by the specific loss of Moco (27Magalon A. Asso M. Guigliarelli B. Rothery R.A. Bertrand P. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7363-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present work, EPR titrations of NarGH50SHI were performed on a wide potential range and have indicated the absence of signal in the region around g = 5 (Fig. 1E). Further, no changes were observed in the g = 2.0 region excluding any conversion in a S = 1/2 spin state of FS0 (data not shown). As His-50 is a FS0 cluster ligand, our results demonstrate unambiguously that the S = 3/2 signature arises from the FS0 cluster. Therefore, the lack of Moco is likely correlated with the absence of FS0. To understand the origin of this relation in the maturation process, the two-hybrid methodology has been used. This approach allowed us to establish that NarJ binding onto a NarG protein truncated for the N-terminal tail is indispensable and sufficient to allow interaction of Δ1–41NarG with the proteins in charge of Moco transfer (MobA, MoeA, MogA, and MobB) (18Vergnes A. Gouffi-Belhabich K. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41398-41403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Given that the NarGH50SHI complex does not contain FS0 and Moco, we have investigated the effect of this substitution on the interaction between the Δ1–41NarGH50S protein with various interactants. At first, the interaction with NarJ is not affected by the H50S substitution (data not shown). This observation indicates that the absence of Moco is not due to the inability of the NarJ protein to interact with the substituted apoenzyme. In contrast, all of the pairwise interactions between Δ1–41NarGH50S and MobA, MoeA, MogA, or MobB are lost (data not shown). It is notable that examination of the crystallographic structure of the NarGH50SHI complex shows no major structural changes associated with the absence of both FS0 and Moco. 5J. H. Weiner and N. C. Strynadka, personal communication. These observations suggest that the substitution H50S or the consecutive absence of FS0 induces a local structural perturbation that affects the ability of the Moco biosynthetic proteins to deliver the Moco. Taken together, our results show that the presence of FS0 is a prerequisite for Moco insertion. Thus, in addition to the strong structural and functional relationship between FS0 and Moco, their respective insertion processes appear to be strongly coordinated and coupled in a NarJ-dependent manner. NarJ Coordinates Cofactor Acquisition by NarI and NarG—Assembly of the NarGHI complex is a multiple step process including metal cofactor insertion, subunit assembly, and membrane anchoring. The absence of NarJ or of Moco synthesis leads to a definitive membrane anchoring of the apoenzyme complex (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To evaluate the consequence of such a premature anchoring on the maturation of the NarI subunit, analysis of its heme content was performed by EPR spectroscopy on NarGHImob and NarGHInarJ complexes. Remarkably, the sharper typical EPR signal at g = 3.76 associated to the proximal heme bP in the NarGHI enzyme is clearly absent in the fully oxidized NarGHInarJ enzyme (Fig. 3, A and C). In contrast, the EPR peak at g = 3.34 associated to the distal heme bD is still present and in a comparable amount to the native enzyme (Table 2). Similar studies carried on the NarGHImob complex indicate that the EPR signals of both hemes are detected (Fig. 3B). The two peaks observed for heme bD presumably arise from a conformational heterogeneity related to the enzyme preparation as previously mentioned in the native enzyme (17Rothery R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Asso M. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Overall, this work shows that the NarJ protein is a key component of the biogenesis process of the multimeric nitrate reductase complex because none of the Moco, the FS0, and the heme bP are inserted when it is missing. Given that the insertion processes of both FS0 and Moco appear to be two correlated cytoplasmic events occurring before anchoring of the NarGH complex to the membrane, insertion of heme bP seems to be a late step in the maturation process of the NarI subunit. It is notable that in the absence of both NarGH and NarJ, NarI is fully mature (16Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Rothery R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Asso M. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, premature anchoring of the NarGH complex to the membrane in the absence of NarJ leads to the insertion of a single heme within NarI. This is further supported by the observation that the NarGHImob apoenzyme having experienced NarJ has inserted both hemes. These results strongly suggest that the presence of NarJ is indirectly required for complete maturation of NarI by a proper timing for membrane anchoring of the NarGH complex. Uncoupling Redox Cofactor Incorporation from the Membrane-anchoring Process by Deletion of the N-terminal Tail of NarG—NarJ binds on two distinct sites of NarG, one interfering with membrane anchoring of apoNarGH (located at the N-terminal tail of NarG) and another one being involved in NarGH maturation (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown above, the action of NarJ on the first site allows complete maturation of the NarI subunit prior to membrane anchoring of the catalytic dimer. To gain corroborative evidence of finely tuned coordination of the nitrate reductase biogenesis process by NarJ, we have examined the effect of the deletion of the N-terminal tail of NarG on both FS0 insertion and NarI maturation by EPR spectroscopy. Interestingly, both the EPR signals of FS0 cluster and the EPR signals of Moco are present in Δ1–41NarGHI (Fig. 1C, data not shown). The relative proportion of FS0 is comparable with that of the native enzyme, whereas that of Moco is significantly reduced (Table 2). These observations are consistent with the interpretation given above that the insertion of FS0 occurs before the insertion of Moco. The EPR spectrum of the heme region is shown in Fig. 3D. Although the signal of heme bD is present at g = 3.29, the g = 3.76 signal associated to the bP heme is lacking. Instead, a peak at g = 2.92 is clearly resolved. This peak has been well characterized in NarI-enriched membranes and attributed to the bP heme in a relaxed NarI conformation occurring upon the absence of the NarGH dimer (16Magalon A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The quantitation of the EPR signals associated to the bD heme shows that the proportion of this center is significantly higher than those of Moco and FS0 in Δ1–41NarGHI (Table 2). Therefore, only a fraction of the bD hemes detected is associated to a Δ1–41NarGHI complex, the rest being likely present in isolated NarI subunits. These observations are consistent with the fact that deletion of the N-terminal tail of NarG results in disturbed membrane anchoring of the Δ1–41NarGH complex and in the presence of isolated NarI subunits (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further, the specific absence of the bP heme is most likely responsible for the reported lack of physiological quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activity of the Δ1–41NarGHI enzyme (19Vergnes A. Pommier J. Toci R. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2170-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Overall, these observations provide spectroscopic evidence that NarJ is required for concerted coordination of the cofactor incorporation and membrane-anchoring processes. Concluding Remarks—A complete understanding of the biogenesis process of multimeric metalloproteins requires spatial and temporal dissection of the assembly intermediates. EPR spectroscopy has proven to be a valuable technique in characterizing several stable folding intermediates in the case of the nitrate reductase from E. coli. In this report, we demonstrate that the NarJ protein orchestrates the cofactor insertion, subunit assembly, and membrane-anchoring steps during the assembly of the NarGHI complex. A detailed biogenesis model of the nitrate reductase complex can be inferred from all these data (Fig. 4). An important point is the separate maturation of the NarI subunit involving sequential insertion of the two b-type hemes without the aid of NarJ. In parallel, the apoNarGH complex interacts with NarJ early on, promoting insertion of FS0 and Moco within NarG, likely in a sequential manner. In contrast, insertion of the four Fe-S clusters in NarH likely proceeds through the action of one of the resident Fe-S biosynthetic machineries (Isc, Suf) (29Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 30Barras F. Loiseau L. Py B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2005; 50: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Finally, the mature NarGH complex is directed to the membrane for interaction with a mature NarI subunit. It is notable that our findings provide the first hints concerning the stepwise maturation of a transmembrane b-type cytochrome, often involved in respiratory complexes such as the succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), cytochrome bc1 and b6f complexes, as well as in photosystem II of higher plants and cyanobacteria. Future investigations involve studies on the molecular mechanism underlying the strict requirement for NarJ in FS0 cluster insertion, which will most likely lead to the elucidation of a more general mechanism of FS0/Moco insertion by the NarJ protein. Another line of investigation will be to elucidate the molecular mechanism governing the release of NarJ upon redox cofactor incorporation within NarG. Our findings not only clarify the role of the NarJ protein in nitrate reductase assembly and assign another function to this multitask protein but also provide useful insights into a mechanism of coordination of the multiple steps required for the biogenesis of complex metalloproteins. It can be inferred from comparison with other multimeric molybdoenzymes that the global function played by NarJ in the biogenesis process of the nitrate reductase complex will be extended to other related systems. Indeed, the phylogenetic tree that can be inferred from sequence comparison of the catalytic subunit of all known molybdoenzymes belonging to the Me2SO reductase family allowed McEwan and co-workers (31McDevitt C.A. Hugenholtz P. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to distinguish three types. Type III is represented by monomeric enzymes (Dor, Tor, Bis) harboring Moco as the sole redox cofactor, and type I is represented by monomeric or multimeric enzymes (Nap, Fdh, Nas, Psr) harboring a [Fe-S] cluster in addition to Moco in their catalytic subunit. Finally, type II is represented by multimeric enzymes (Nar, Dms, Ebd, Ser, Ddh). Later, the x-ray structures of two members of the type II class, namely the nitrate reductase (13Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and the ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (32Kloer D.P. Hagel C. Heider J. Schulz G.E. Structure (Camb.). 2006; 14: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), revealed the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in close proximity of the Moco in their catalytic subunit. Accordingly, type I and II enzymes need to be grouped into a single class. A new classification can be made. Class 1 is represented by monomeric enzymes (Dor, Tor, Bis) harboring Moco as the sole redox cofactor. Class 2 represents those enzymes (Nar, Fdn, Dms, Nap, Ebd...) that are mono- or multimeric and harbor a [Fe-S] cluster in addition to Moco in their catalytic subunit. Genomic analyses indicate that most of prokaryotic molybdenum enzymes fall into the class 2. Accordingly, their enzyme-specific chaperones are markedly different. Chaperones specific for class 1 enzymes facilitate Moco insertion (with TorD as the prototype), whereas those specific for class 2 enzymes (with NarJ as prototype) are required for incorporation of both the [Fe-S] cluster and Moco into the catalytic subunit. In the particular cases of the periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap) and of the periplasmically oriented formate dehydrogenase (Fdn, Fdo), both members of class 2, two accessory proteins are required for their biogenesis instead of one (NapD and NapF or FdhD and FdhE, respectively) (33Potter L.C.

https://openalex.org/W1966962396,"The pathophysiologic mechanisms causing inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) remain obscure. The effects of proapoptotic agents on pancreatic and tracheal cell lines expressing wild-type CFTR (PANC-1 and NT-1, respectively) or the homozygous CFTRDeltaF508 mutation (CFPAC-1 and CFT-2, respectively) were assessed. An increased susceptibility to apoptosis was observed in CFPAC-1 and CFT-2 cells. Apoptosis was reduced by treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor and by incubation at 27 degrees C, allowing recruitment of CFTR deltaF508 at the plasma membrane. Inhibition of CFTR function in wild-type cells induced an increase of apoptosis. Apoptosis in CFPAC-1, but not in CFT-2 cells, was associated with overexpression of the proinflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. In CF cells, apoptosis was linked to NF-kappaB pathway activation. Conditioned medium from actinomycin D-treated CFPAC-1 cells produced an increase in apoptosis of wild-type cells, suggesting that proinflammatory mediators secreted by mutant cells promote apoptosis. This was confirmed through the induction of apoptosis in wild-type cells by exogenous interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. These results suggest that CFTR deltaF508 mutation, apoptosis, and activation of the NF-kappaB pathway contribute to the self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle, at least in pancreatic cells, and provide evidence that excessive apoptosis may account for the exaggerated proinflammatory response observed in CF patients."

Additionally, immobilized amidase can be used efficiently for production of acrylic acid from acrylamide, thus converting a toxic ambient contaminant into widely used industrial raw material (27Babu G.R.

Because microbial amidases are a class of enzymes that have potential value for the development of commercial bioprocesses (5Banerjee A. Sharma R. Banerjee U.C. Appl. Microbiol.

Moreover, the structural characterization of amidase may reveal new insights about the detailed catalytic mechanism of this enzyme.Recently, a preliminary study on the phase problem solution of crystals from the amidase from Geobacillus pallidus RAPc8 was described (30Agarkar V.B.

The extension of the phases to 1.0 Å using the “free lunch algorithm” (49Caliandro R. Carrozzini B. Cascarano G.L. De Caro L. Giacovazzo C. Siliqi D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The anisotropic atomic refinement using all available data to 1.25-Å resolution converged to Rwork/Rfree 10.1/12.6%.Amidase Architecture—The amidase monomer shows a four-layer αββα (33% of α-helical chains and 22% of β-strands) sandwich arrangement, with the two internal β-sheets, built up by seven and six strands, interconnected by two inter-sheets crossovers (Fig. 1). The structure topology corresponds to that of nitrilases, reference 3.60.110 in the CATH protein classification (50Pearl F. Todd A. Sillitoe I. Dibley M. Redfern O. Lewis T. Bennett C. Marsden R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), with an additional N-terminal short β-strand (residues 1–3) and a C-terminal long chain (residues 260–341) composed by 5 short α-helices connected by unstructured segments.The αββα sandwich shows recognizable pseudo-symmetry, with two sets of six strands (residues 13–158 and 159–258, respectively), related by a 2-fold rotation axis running through the middle of the sandwich, longitudinal to the strands directions (Fig. 1B). The superposition of the two halves reveals that despite a very low sequence identity of 5% in the structure-guided alignment, 71 homologous Cα overlap within a 3.5-Å distance cut-off with root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å (Fig. 1C).

https://openalex.org/W2145665728,"The genetic mechanisms that control the establishment of early polarities and their link with embryonic axis specification and patterning seem to substantially diverge across vertebrates. In amphibians and teleosts, the establishment of an early dorso-ventral polarity determines both the site of axis formation and its rostro-caudal orientation. In contrast, amniotes retain a considerable plasticity for their site of axis formation until blastula stages and rely on signals secreted by extraembryonic tissues, which have no clear equivalents in the former, for the establishment of their rostro-caudal pattern. The rationale for these differences remains unknown. Through detailed expression analyses of key development genes in a chondrichthyan, the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula, we have reconstructed the ancestral pattern of axis specification in jawed vertebrates. We show that the dogfish displays compelling similarities with amniotes at blastula and early gastrula stages, including the presence of clear homologs of the hypoblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. In the ancestral state, these territories are specified at opposite poles of an early axis of bilateral symmetry, homologous to the dorso-ventral axis of amphibians or teleosts, and aligned with the later forming embryonic axis, from head to tail. Comparisons with amniotes suggest that a dorsal expansion of extraembryonic ectoderm, resulting in an apparently radial symmetry at late blastula stages, has taken place in their lineage. The synthesis of these results with those of functional analyses in model organisms supports an evolutionary link between the dorso-ventral polarity of amphibians and teleosts and the embryonic-extraembryonic organisation of amniotes. It leads to a general model of axis specification in gnathostomes, which provides a comparative framework for a reassessment of conservations both among vertebrates and with more distant metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W1992738293,"Background APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G) has antiretroviral activity associated with the hypermutation of viral DNA through cytosine deamination. APOBEC3G has two cytosine deaminase (CDA) domains; the catalytically inactive amino-terminal domain of APOBEC3G (N-CDA) carries the Vif interaction domain. There is no 3-D structure of APOBEC3G solved by X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance. Methodology/Principal Findings We predicted the structure of human APOBEC3G based on the crystal structure of APOBEC2. To assess the model structure, we evaluated 48 mutants of APOBEC3G N-CDA that identify novel variants altering ΔVif HIV-1 infectivity and packaging of APOBEC3G. Results indicated that the key residue D128 is exposed at the surface of the model, with a negative local electrostatic potential. Mutation D128K changes the sign of that local potential. In addition, two novel functionally relevant residues that result in defective APOBEC3G encapsidation, R122 and W127, cluster at the surface. Conclusions/Significance The structure model identifies a cluster of residues important for packaging of APOBEC3G into virions, and may serve to guide functional analysis of APOBEC3G."
https://openalex.org/W1995692563,"Tuberous sclerosis complex is a dominant genetic disorder produced by mutations in either of two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and TSC2; it is characterized by hamartomatous tumors, and is associated with severe neurological and behavioral disturbances. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 deregulate a conserved growth control pathway that includes Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) and Target of Rapamycin (TOR). To understand the function of this pathway in neural development, we have examined the contributions of multiple components of this pathway in both neuromuscular junction assembly and photoreceptor axon guidance in Drosophila. Expression of Rheb in the motoneuron, but not the muscle of the larval neuromuscular junction produced synaptic overgrowth and enhanced synaptic function, while reductions in Rheb function compromised synapse development. Synapse growth produced by Rheb is insensitive to rapamycin, an inhibitor of Tor complex 1, and requires wishful thinking, a bone morphogenetic protein receptor critical for functional synapse expansion. In the visual system, loss of Tsc1 in the developing retina disrupted axon guidance independently of cellular growth. Inhibiting Tor complex 1 with rapamycin or eliminating the Tor complex 1 effector, S6 kinase (S6k), did not rescue axon guidance abnormalities of Tsc1 mosaics, while reductions in Tor function suppressed those phenotypes. These findings show that Tsc-mediated control of axon guidance and synapse assembly occurs via growth-independent signaling mechanisms, and suggest that Tor complex 2, a regulator of actin organization, is critical in these aspects of neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2011220926,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality varies across racial and ethnic groups in the U.S., and the extent that known risk factors can explain the differences has not been extensively explored.We examined the risk of dying from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and other heart disease (OHD) among 139,406 African-American (AA), Native Hawaiian (NH), Japanese-American (JA), Latino and White men and women initially free from cardiovascular disease followed prospectively between 1993-1996 and 2003 in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). During this period, 946 deaths from AMI and 2,323 deaths from OHD were observed. Relative risks of AMI and OHD mortality were calculated accounting for established CVD risk factors: body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, amount of vigorous physical activity, educational level, diet and, for women, type and age at menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use.Established CVD risk factors explained much of the observed racial and ethnic differences in risk of AMI and OHD mortality. After adjustment, NH men and women had greater risks of OHD than Whites (69% excess, P<0.001 and 62% excess, P = 0.003, respectively), and AA women had greater risks of AMI (48% excess, P = 0.01) and OHD (35% excess, P = 0.007). JA men had lower risks of AMI (51% deficit, P<0.001) and OHD (27% deficit, P = 0.001), as did JA women (AMI, 37% deficit, P = 0.03; OHD, 40% deficit, P = 0.001). Latinos had underlying lower risk of AMI death (26% deficit in men and 35% in women, P = 0.03).Known risk factors explain the majority of racial and ethnic differences in mortality due to AMI and OHD. The unexplained excess in NH and AA and the deficits in JA suggest the presence of unmeasured determinants for cardiovascular mortality that are distributed unequally across these populations."
https://openalex.org/W1996927830,"Phosphorylation can affect both the function and trafficking of GABA(A) receptors with significant consequences for neuronal excitability. Serine/threonine kinases can phosphorylate the intracellular loops between M3-4 of GABA(A) receptor beta and gamma subunits thereby modulating receptor function in heterologous expression systems and in neurons (1, 2). Specifically, CaMK-II has been demonstrated to phosphorylate the M3-4 loop of GABA(A) receptor subunits expressed as GST fusion proteins (3, 4). It also increases the amplitude of GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents in a number of neuronal cell types (5-7). To identify which substrate sites CaMK-II might phosphorylate and the consequent functional effects, we expressed recombinant GABA(A) receptors in NG108-15 cells, which have previously been shown to support CaMK-II modulation of GABA(A) receptors containing the beta3 subunit (8). We now demonstrate that CaMK-II mediates its effects on alpha1beta3 receptors via phosphorylation of Ser(383) within the M3-4 domain of the beta subunit. Ablation of beta3 subunit phosphorylation sites for CaMK-II revealed that for alphabetagamma receptors, CaMK-II has a residual effect on GABA currents that is not mediated by previously identified sites of CaMK-II phosphorylation. This residual effect is abolished by mutation of tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr(365) and Tyr(367), on the gamma2S subunit, and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. These results suggested that CaMK-II is capable of directly phosphorylating GABA(A) receptors and activating endogenous tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate the gamma2 subunit in NG108-15 cells. These findings were confirmed in a neuronal environment by expressing recombinant GABA(A) receptors in cerebellar granule neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2156006651,"Temporal sequence represents the main principle underlying episodic memory. The storage of temporal sequence information is thought to involve hippocampus-dependent memory systems, preserving temporal structure possibly via chaining of sequence elements in heteroassociative networks. Converging evidence indicates that sleep enhances the consolidation of recently acquired representations in the hippocampus-dependent declarative memory system. Yet, it is unknown if this consolidation process comprises strengthening of the temporal sequence structure of the representation as well, or is restricted to sequence elements independent of their temporal order. To address this issue we tested the influence of sleep on the strength of forward and backward associations in word-triplets.Subjects learned a list of 32 triplets of unrelated words, presented successively (A-B-C) in the center of a screen, and either slept normally or stayed awake in the subsequent night. After two days, retrieval was assessed for the triplets sequentially either in a forward direction (cueing with A and B and asking for B and C, respectively) or in a backward direction (cueing with C and B and asking for B and A, respectively). Memory was better for forward than backward associations (p<0.01). Sleep did not affect backward associations, but enhanced forward associations, specifically for the first (AB) transitions (p<0.01), which were generally more difficult to retrieve than the second transitions.Our data demonstrate that consolidation during sleep strengthens the original temporal sequence structure in memory, presumably as a result of a replay of new representations during sleep in forward direction. Our finding suggests that the temporally directed replay of memory during sleep, apart from strengthening those traces, could be the key mechanism that explains how temporal order is integrated and maintained in the trace of an episodic memory."
https://openalex.org/W1982484784,"In order to gain a more global view of the activity of histone demethylases, we report here genome-wide studies of the fission yeast SWIRM and polyamine oxidase (PAO) domain homologues of mammalian LSD1. Consistent with previous work we find that the two S. pombe proteins, which we name Swm1 and Swm2 (after SWIRM1 and SWIRM2), associate together in a complex. However, we find that this complex specifically demethylates lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9) and both up- and down-regulates expression of different groups of genes. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation, to isolate fragments of chromatin containing either H3K4me2 or H3K9me2, and DNA microarray analysis (ChIP-chip), we have studied genome-wide changes in patterns of histone methylation, and their correlation with gene expression, upon deletion of the swm1+ gene. Using hyper-geometric probability comparisons we uncover genetic links between lysine-specific demethylases, the histone deacetylase Clr6, and the chromatin remodeller Hrp1. The data presented here demonstrate that in fission yeast the SWIRM/PAO domain proteins Swm1 and Swm2 are associated in complexes that can remove methyl groups from lysine 9 methylated histone H3. In vitro, we show that bacterially expressed Swm1 also possesses lysine 9 demethylase activity. In vivo, loss of Swm1 increases the global levels of both H3K9me2 and H3K4me2. A significant accumulation of H3K4me2 is observed at genes that are up-regulated in a swm1 deletion strain. In addition, H3K9me2 accumulates at some genes known to be direct Swm1/2 targets that are down-regulated in the swm1Δ strain. The in vivo data indicate that Swm1 acts in concert with the HDAC Clr6 and the chromatin remodeller Hrp1 to repress gene expression. In addition, our in vitro analyses suggest that the H3K9 demethylase activity requires an unidentified post-translational modification to allow it to act. Thus, our results highlight complex interactions between histone demethylase, deacetylase and chromatin remodelling activities in the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2046909092,"Bestrophins (VMD2, VMD2L1, VMD2L2, and VMD2L3) are a new family of anion channels. The mechanisms of their regulation are not yet well understood. Recently, we found that a domain (amino acids 356–364) in the C terminus of mouse VMD2L3 (mBest3) inhibited channel activity when it was expressed in HEK293 cells (Qu, Z., Cui, Y., and Hartzell, H. C. (2006) FEBS Lett. 580, 2141–2214). Here we show that this auto-inhibitory (AI) domain in mBest3 and human (h)Best3 is composed of seven critical residues, 356IPSFLGS362. Replacement of any residue (except Pro357) in the domain with alanine activated Cl– currents. Substitution of Pro357 with other amino acids, especially phenylalanine, did activate currents. Membrane biotinylation demonstrated that nonfunctional mBest3 protein was trafficked to the plasma membrane, implying that the AI domain inhibited channel gating but not trafficking. mBest3-F359A and hBest3-G361A mutations induced outwardly rectifying currents, suggesting that the AI domain is associated with the channel pore or gating mechanism. Supporting this suggestion, the mBest3 AI domain was demonstrated to be located within a membrane-associated region. When the wild-type mBest3 C terminus (amino acids 292–669) was expressed in HEK293 cells, the protein was located mainly in the particulate fraction, but it became soluble when a sequence containing the AI domain was deleted (Δ353–404). There is an AI domain (357QPSFQGS363) in mouse VMD2L1 (mBest2) as well, but its inhibitory effect is competed by a downstream facilitatory sequence (amino acids 405–454). These results suggest that an auto-inhibitory mechanism in C termini may be universal among bestrophins investigated in the study. Bestrophins (VMD2, VMD2L1, VMD2L2, and VMD2L3) are a new family of anion channels. The mechanisms of their regulation are not yet well understood. Recently, we found that a domain (amino acids 356–364) in the C terminus of mouse VMD2L3 (mBest3) inhibited channel activity when it was expressed in HEK293 cells (Qu, Z., Cui, Y., and Hartzell, H. C. (2006) FEBS Lett. 580, 2141–2214). Here we show that this auto-inhibitory (AI) domain in mBest3 and human (h)Best3 is composed of seven critical residues, 356IPSFLGS362. Replacement of any residue (except Pro357) in the domain with alanine activated Cl– currents. Substitution of Pro357 with other amino acids, especially phenylalanine, did activate currents. Membrane biotinylation demonstrated that nonfunctional mBest3 protein was trafficked to the plasma membrane, implying that the AI domain inhibited channel gating but not trafficking. mBest3-F359A and hBest3-G361A mutations induced outwardly rectifying currents, suggesting that the AI domain is associated with the channel pore or gating mechanism. Supporting this suggestion, the mBest3 AI domain was demonstrated to be located within a membrane-associated region. When the wild-type mBest3 C terminus (amino acids 292–669) was expressed in HEK293 cells, the protein was located mainly in the particulate fraction, but it became soluble when a sequence containing the AI domain was deleted (Δ353–404). There is an AI domain (357QPSFQGS363) in mouse VMD2L1 (mBest2) as well, but its inhibitory effect is competed by a downstream facilitatory sequence (amino acids 405–454). These results suggest that an auto-inhibitory mechanism in C termini may be universal among bestrophins investigated in the study. Bestrophins are a new family of Cl– channels, some of which are sensitive to intracellular Ca2+ (2Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen.

There are four bestrophin genes in humans but three in mice, and there may be several alternatively spliced forms of bestrophins in the two species (7Kramer F. Stohr H. Weber B.H. Cytogenet.

Recently, there has been significant progress in uncovering the physiological functions of bestrophins. Using an RNAi strategy, Hartzell and co-workers (11Chien L.T. Zhang Z.R. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) demonstrated that bestrophins represent the endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl– channels in Drosophila S2 cells. S2 cells express four bestrophins (dbest1–4). The endogenous CaCl current (ICaCl) was abolished by RNAi to dbest1 or dbest2 but not to dbest3 or dbest4, suggesting that the endogenous CaCl channel is composed of a heteromer of dbest1 and dbest2. Also with an RNAi approach, Kunzelmann and co-workers (12Barro Soria R. Spitzner M. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar) showed that hBest1 was the molecular counterpart of the Ca2+-activated Cl– current (ICaCl) in epithelial tissues. Native ICaCl coincided with endogenous expression of hBest1 in 16HBE cells, but the current was absent in H441 cells that did not express hBest1 protein. Blocking expression of hBest1 in HT29 human colonic epithelial cells with short interfering RNA suppressed the whole-cell ICaCl induced by extracellular ATP application (which raises intracellular Ca2+ concentration). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the ICaCl in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which is important in amplification of olfactory transduction, is mediated by mouse VMD2L1 (mBest2) (13Pifferi S. Pascarella G. Boccaccio A. Mazzatenta A. Gustincich S. Menini A. Zucchelli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12929-12934Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). By single-cell reverse transcription-PCR, mBest2 was found to be expressed in OSNs but not in supporting cells. By immunocytochemistry, mBest2 was localized on the cilia of OSNs and colocalized with the CNGA2 channel subunit. Electrophysiological properties of ICaCl in dendritic knob/cilia of mouse OSNs were comparable with those induced by mBest2 expression in HEK293 cells. Therefore, the authors suggest that mBest2 is a molecular component of the olfactory CaCl channel. Despite rapid progress in the molecular characterization of bestrophins, not much is known about their regulation. We do not know how they are activated by Ca2+ or how their intraor extracellular domains regulate channel function. Although hBest1, hBest2, hBest4, and mBest2 have been shown to function as CaCl channels in heterologous expression systems, hBest3 and mBest3 3Mouse VMD2L3 was named as mBest4 in our previous publication (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). According to the bestrophin nomenclature by the HUGO gene (HGNC: 17105) and the Mouse Genome Database nomenclature committees (MGI: 3580298), mouse VMD2L3 has been corrected to mBest3 (17Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 580Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). did not induce significant currents within a physiological voltage range (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This phenomenon prompted us to search for regulatory domains in the C terminus of the Best3 proteins. We found an auto-inhibitory (AI) domain in the mBest3 C terminus, which turned off the channel. We narrowed the AI domain to the 356IPSFLGSTI364 sequence (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated further the function of the AI domain. We found that the AI domain of mBest3 is membrane-associated. An AI domain was also identified to be present in mBest2, which is competed by a downstream stimulatory sequence. Therefore, we suggest that the AI domain may be a common mechanism for the channel regulation of the bestrophins we have studied. Generation of Bestrophin Mutations and Heterologous Expression—mBest2 (mouse VMD2L1) in pSPORT6 expression vector was obtained from the ATCC (2Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). mBest3 (mouse VMD2L3) cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). hBest3 (human VMD2L3) was obtained from Dr. Jeremy Nathans (The Johns Hopkins University) (6Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations were generated using a PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Quickchange, Stratagene) as described previously (2Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The cDNA expression vectors were co-transfected with pEGFP (Invitrogen) into HEK293 cells (ATCC) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The transfected cells were identified by the pEGFP-expressed green fluorescence. The transfection efficiency was 20–30%. 0.1–0.3 μg of plasmid was used to transfect HEK293 cells on one 35-mm culture dish. The next day, cells were trypsinized and placed on the coverslips for electrophysiological recording. Electrophysiology—Recordings were performed at 22–24 °C using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp (14Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Voltage steps were used as indicated in the figure legends with a holding potential of 0 mV. The standard pipette solution (∼4.5 μm free Ca2+) contained (in mm) 146 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 (Ca2+)-EGTA, 10 sucrose, 8 HEPES, pH 7.3 (2Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The standard extracellular solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. This combination of solutions set Erev for Cl– currents to zero, whereas cation currents carried by Na+ or Cs+ had very positive or negative Erev, respectively (2Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To verify the currents were carried by Cl–, cells were exposed to a solution containing 100 mm Na2SO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Because SO4 is not permeant through bestrophin channels, this solution blocked outward current, if it was carried by bestrophin channels. The amplitude of whole-cell currents at the end of 100-mV pulse was measured and is shown as mean ± S.E. The Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Development of a Polyclonal Antibody to mBest3—The cDNA encoding the last 200 amino acids of the mBest3 C terminus was subcloned into pET-28a vector to produce a hexahistine-tagged protein. The protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic His·Bind resin (Novagen) and used to raise the polyclonal antibody to mBest3 in rabbits. The anti-mBest3 antibody (05619) recognizes mBest3 specifically. For Western blotting, 1/2000 dilution was used, but 1/1000 was used for immunocytochemistry. Biotinylation of the Proteins on the Plasma Membrane Surface—The mBest3 proteins in the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells were examined with membrane biotinylation, affinity purification, and Western blotting. Membrane surface biotinylation has been described previously (12Barro Soria R. Spitzner M. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected and native HEK293 cells were exposed to the membrane-impermeable Sulfo-NHS-LC biotin for 30 min at 4 °C. The biotinylated membrane proteins were solubilized and affinity-purified with streptavidin beads. The purified proteins were subjected to Western blotting probed with the antibody to mBest3 (05619) (1/2000 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/3000 dilution) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Anti-GAPDH (a cytoplasmic protein) antibody was used to probe immunoblots to indicate the specificity of membrane protein biotinylation. Solubility of Bestrophin C Termini—mBest3 C-terminal domains, 292–669 or 292–669(Δ353–404) cDNA, subcloned in the pcDNA3.1 vector (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were transfected into HEK239 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfection efficiency was about 60%. The transfected cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, sonicated briefly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1/200 (volume) protease inhibitor set III (Calbiochem), and ultracentrifuged at 42,500 × g (Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge, TLS 55 rotor). The supernatant was collected as a soluble fraction. The pellet was washed with PBS, dissolved in a nonionic detergent lysis buffer (mm) (1% Triton X-100, 150 NaCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 dithiothreitol, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1/200 protease inhibitor mixture III), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g. The supernatant contained the Triton-soluble membrane proteins. Protein concentrations were measured with the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Western blotting was performed with equivalent amounts (10 μg/lane) of protein from each sample. mBest3 C termini were detected with the anti-mBest3 antibody (05619) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig G and chemiluminescence. The Auto-inhibitory (AI) Domain in mBest3 or hBest3 Is Composed of Seven Residues—In our previous study, we showed that a domain in the C terminus of mBest3 inhibited its channel activity. By deletion or mutation of groups of amino acids, we localized the AI domain to nine residues (356IPSFLGSTI364) (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine which residues are responsible for the inhibition, we individually mutated each residue in the domain to alanine. Alanine substitution of residues 356 and 358–362 activated the mBest3 channel (Fig. 1A), whereas the D353A, Y354A, C355A, P357A, T363A, I364A, and Gln365 mutations were not effective in activating mBest3. hBest3 (6Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) is 86% identical to mBest3 (see alignment in Fig. 8A). It possesses an AI domain (boldface letters in Fig. 8A) identical to that of mBest3. Neither hBest3 nor mBest3 induced significant Cl– currents in HEK293 cells with voltage pulses in a physiological range (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that both channels share the same mechanism for their activation. As expected, mutation of the homologous residues in hBest3 AI domain activated the channel as well (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 8Alignment of bestrophin sequences.

Because proline residues often play important roles in protein secondary structure and Pro357 is flanked by residues that are important in the AI domain, we tested the possibility that substituting other amino acids for Pro357 might activate the channel. Substitution of Pro357 with Arg, Asp, Thr, and Gln resulted in small but distinct currents (Fig. 1C). The P357F mutation produced large currents. To test the specificity of the Pro to Phe mutation, we mutated Cys355 into Phe because the C355A mutant was nonfunctional (Fig. 1, A and B) and Cys355 is just one amino acid away from Pro357. The C355F mutation did not activate significant current (Fig. 1C), indicating that the effect of the P357F mutation on hBest3 is specific. Without a tertiary structure of VMD2L3, we do not have an explanation why the Phe but not the Ala substitution activates hBest3 currents, but these data show that Pro357 is also a critical residue for the inhibitory effect of the AI domain. mBest3 Is Trafficked to the Plasma Membrane—The observation that wild-type mBest3 and hBest3 did not evoke significant Cl– currents under physiological conditions could be explained by two mechanisms. The AI domain could block the channel in the plasma membrane by interacting with the channel pore or channel gating machinery, or the AI domain could prevent the channel protein from trafficking properly to the plasma membrane. To clarify the uncertainty, we developed an antibody to the last 200 amino acids of the mBest3 C terminus. This antibody recognizes a single protein band of ∼80 kDa from HEK cells expressing mBest3. This value is close to the calculated mBest3 molecular mass of 78 kDa (upper panels in Fig. 2). The band was absent in nontransfected HEK cells. To determine whether wild-type mBest3 was expressed in the plasma membrane, we biotinylated plasma membrane proteins with a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent and then examined the presence of mBest3 with the anti-mBest3 antibody. Fig. 2 shows that both the nonfunctional mBest3 and its functional mutant, mB3(Δ353–367) were located in the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells. The results strongly suggest that the inactivation of mBest3 by the AI domain occurs via inhibition of channel permeation or gating. Certain AI Domain Mutations Alter Channel Gating—Most of the currents that were induced by AI domain mutations in mBest3 or hBest3 were time- and voltage-independent. The mBest3-G361A mutation is shown as an example (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the F359A mutation in mBest3 (Fig. 3, C and D) and the G361A mutation in hBest3 (Fig. 3, E and F) induced currents that exhibited both time and voltage dependence. The currents were outwardly rectifying. This outward rectification was apparently a consequence of voltage-dependent closure of the channels at negative membrane potentials as evidenced by the time-dependent deactivation of the current at negative potentials. Interestingly, the deactivation kinetics of hBest3-G361A at negative potentials was much faster than deactivation of mBest3-F357A. The time constant of deactivation of the current upon repolarization to –100 from 0 mV was 573.5 ± 225.1 ms (n = 4) for hBest3-G361A, but it was more than five times slower (3038.9 ± 549.6 ms, n = 7) for mBest3-F359A (p = 0.01). The effect of these mutations on the voltage and time dependence of the current supports the idea that the AI domain associates with the channel pore or gating mechanism. I-V relationships indicate that the currents induced by the above mutations were carried by Cl– anions because the Vrev was close to ECl (0 mV) for each mutation (Fig. 3 B, D, and F), implying that the mutations did not change the anion/cation selectivity of the Best3 channels. We have not tested, however, whether they change relative anion permeability. Cysteine mutations of the pore residues have been useful for dissecting the pore structure of bestrophins (6Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Qu Z. Chien L.T. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5411-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand better the structure of the AI domain, we substituted Phe359 in mBest3 and Gly361 in hBest3 with cysteines. Unlike the alanine mutations, both cysteine substitutions (F359C and G361C) activated time- and voltage-independent whole-cell currents (data not shown). The membrane-permeable (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA+) or membrane-impermeable [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET+) and (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES–)(1 mm) applied extracellularly did not alter current amplitude or wave form (data not shown). The negative results can be interpreted by the possibility that the polar cysteine at position 359 (mBest3) or 361 (hBest3) may have already driven the AI domain dissociate from the pore structure, rendering the channel unresponsive to methanethiosulfonate reagent modification (see below). The AI Domain Is Membrane-associated—The result that certain mutations in the AI domain apparently affected the channel gating invited us to examine mBest3 topology to see if the AI domain is a membrane-associating structure. Hydropathy analysis by the MPEx program shows that the sequence, 355CIPSFLGSTIQMGLSGSNF373, including the AI domain (underlined), is more hydrophobic than the surrounding sequence, although it is not predicted to be a TMD (Fig. 4A). To test whether the AI domain is membrane-associated, we measured the association of the mBest3 wild-type or the AI domain-deleted mutant C terminus with the membrane. The mBest3 wild-type C terminus (amino acids 292–668) or the C-terminal mutant, 292–668(Δ353–404), in which amino acids 353–404, including the AI domain were deleted, was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, respectively. The cells were disrupted by sonication in PBS. The extract was ultracentrifuged to separate soluble (S) and particulate fractions. Then the particulate fraction was suspended in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize membrane proteins. The high speed supernatant from this extract contained membrane proteins. Proteins from soluble or membrane fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting probed with the anti-mBest3 antibody (Fig. 4B). The wild-type C terminus (292–668) was detected predominantly in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4B, M, lane 2), whereas the distribution of the C-terminal mutant, 292–668(Δ353–404), was in the soluble fraction (S, lane 3). The result strongly suggests that a region of the mBest3 C terminus that includes the AI domain is membrane-associated. Based on the suggestion, we assume that the AI domain may block the channel pore via binding to its “receptor” in a relatively hydrophobic environment of the plasma membrane. Introduction of the mBest3 AI Domain into mBest2 Does Not Inactivate the Channel—The region homologous to the mBest3 AI domain in mBest2 differs from mBest3 by only two amino acids (357QPSFQGS363 for mBest2; 356IPSFLGS362 for mBest3) (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because wild-type mBest2 is functional as a Cl– channel in HEK293 cells, we hypothesized that the difference in functionality of mBest2 and mBest3 was because of the two different amino acids. To test the hypothesis, we changed the 357QPSFQGS363 sequence in mBest2 to that of the mBest3 AI domain, IPSFLGS. We expected that this change would inactivate mBest2. However, unexpectedly, the Cl– current amplitude in the mBest2-Q357I/Q361L mutant was dramatically enhanced (Fig. 5). The single mutations Q357I, Q361L, or Q361A in mBest2 also significantly facilitated the Cl– current. These results suggest that 357QPSFQGS363 domain is probably an AI domain in mBest2 and functions to inhibit the channel activity, but its efficacy may be suppressed by other domains having facilitatory functions. Once the inhibitory structure of the AI domain is disrupted by mutations, the channel activity is augmented by the facilitatory domain. A Facilitatory Structure in the C Terminus of mBest2 Suppresses the Efficacy of Its AI Domain—To explain why the AI domain of mBest2 cannot completely inhibit the Cl– channel, we hypothesized that there might be other sequences existent in mBest2 that can suppress or compete the function of its AI domain. In an attempt to locate such a hypothetical domain, we truncated mBest2 at Leu294, Phe353, Val405, or Ser454 by introducing a stop codon (X) (Fig. 6C, upper panel). L294X(Δ294–508) and V405X(Δ405–508) were nonfunctional, whereas F353X(Δ353–508) and S454X(Δ454–508) were functional (Fig. 6, A–C). The currents induced by F353X and S454X were similar to wild-type mBest2 (Fig. 6B), both time- and voltage-independent (2Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The nonfunctionality of L294X is consistent with the idea that the well conserved sequence (amino acids 294–353) immediately after the last predicted TMD is essential for mBest2 channel function. Deletion of the C terminus starting with the AI domain (F353X) resulted in currents that were similar in amplitude to the wild-type mBest2 currents but smaller than mBest2-Q361A currents (Fig. 5). The data from the Q361A mutation and the F353X mutation taken together suggest that in addition to the AI domain, mBest2 may have another structure in the C terminus that facilitates the current amplitude. The nonfunctionality of F405X and functionality of S454X indicates that this facilitatory structure is located between amino acids 405 and 454. We hypothesized that nonfunctionality of the V405X mBest2 channel was because of inhibition of the channel by the AI domain in the absence of the facilitatory structure. To test this idea, residues 356–364 in and flanking the AI domain of the V405X(Δ405–508) mutant were substituted with alanines individually. Mutation of each of the residues except Q356A, P358A, and T364A stimulated the V405X current (Fig. 6D). These data show that an AI domain does exist in mBest2 and suggest that the current amplitude of mBest2 is determined by the competition between the AI domain (residues 357–363) and a facilitatory domain located within the region bounded by the residues 405 and 454. The Facilitatory Region (Residues 405–454) of mBest2 Is Functional in mBest3—To test the functionality of the region (residues 405–454) of mBest2 in other bestrophins, we swapped the corresponding residues 405–454 between mBest2 and mBest3. As shown in Fig. 7A, when the residues 405–454 of mBest3 were replaced with the residues 405–454 from mBest2, the mBest3 channel was activated, suggesting that the region (residues 405–454) of mBest2 is also functional in mBest3 as a facilitatory structure. To test the function of the residues 405–454 of mBest3, the residues 405–454 in mBest2 were replaced with the corresponding residues from mBest3. Consequently, the wild-type mBest2 channel activity was significantly reduced by about 70% (Fig. 7B), indicating that the residues 405–454 of mBest3 has much less facilitatory function than the matching sequence (405–454) in mBest2. This study shows that the activation of three bestrophin channels is regulated by a similar mechanism; a membrane-associated AI domain in the C terminus inhibits channel activity. The AI domain consists of seven amino acids. Each residue in the domain when mutated individually can activate or enhance the activities of the channels. The inhibitory effect exerted on the bestrophins is assumed to occur at the plasma membrane. Although the mechanism for the AI domain action is not clear yet, the data indicate that the AI domain is membrane-associated and regulates the channels via association with the channel pore or gating mechanism. AI Domain May Be Associated with Either the Channel Pore or the Gating Machinery—From the membrane biotinylation result, we concluded that inactivation of mBest3 occurs at the plasma membrane because wild-type mBest3 proteins were detected at the plasma membrane surface (Fig. 2). Supporting this conclusion, we also found that mBest3 AI domain is probably membrane-associated. The membrane association is indicated by hydropathy analysis but also by protein biochemistry (Fig. 4). When the AI domain is intact, the C-terminal protein was mainly distributed in the particulate or membrane fraction, whereas the C terminus became soluble when a short sequence, including the AI domain, was deleted. We hypothesize that the AI domain plays an inhibitory role as a blocker to block the channel pore from the cytoplasmic side via interacting with a hydrophobic receptor, such as the inner side of TMD2, which was demonstrated as the potential pore structure in mBest2 (15Qu Z. Chien L.T. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5411-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by our previous results (1Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The expression of a wild-type mBest3 C terminus blocked the functional mBest3(Δ353–669) mutant-induced currents in HEK293 cells, but an AI domain-deleted mBest3 C-terminal mutant, 292–669(Δ353–404), did not reduce mBest3(Δ353–669) currents, suggesting that the AI domain may inactivate the bestrophin channel as a physiological channel pore blocker. Evidence that the AI domain may be involved in channel gating is provided by the finding that certain point mutations in the AI domain (e.g. mBest3-F359A and hBest3-G361A) made the currents voltage-dependent (Fig. 3). Although the AI domains of mBest3 and hBest3 have identical residues, it was surprising that different residues in hBest3 and mBest3 produced voltage-dependent currents. It is possible that amino acids outside the AI domain introduce a subtle shift in the tertiary structure of the AI domain. After the AI domain, there is only 67% identity between mBest3 and hBest3, whereas between the last TMD and the AI domain there is complete identity. We presume that differences in the C terminus after the AI domains may influence, in different ways, the association of the AI domain with the channel pore or gating mechanism. The AI Domain Is a Potential Target Site for Protein Kinase C or PDK1—To elucidate how the residues in the AI domain regulate the activation of the channel, we searched consensus sites in the mBest2 C terminus by Scansite. Potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites were found in mBest2 (AFLLQQPSFQGSTFD; boldface letters represent the AI domain, and the phosphorylation site is underlined.). Further search revealed a potential PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1)-binding site, AADYCIPSFLGSTIQ (mBest3) or QPSFQGSTFDIALA (mBest2) around the phosphorylation sites. PDK1 plays a central role in activating AGC kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase G, and protein kinase C) (16Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). This implies that the bestrophin channel function may be regulated by protein phosphorylation of the AI domain. Among the vertebrate bestrophins, four residues within the AI domain are very highly conserved. The consensus sequence is SF(M/Q/L)GS (Fig. 8B). This domain follows a highly conserved proline-rich region that is likely to be a region of protein-protein interaction. The residues flanking this consensus sequence vary distinctly among the four bestrophin isoforms. The sequences flanking the consensus are (R/H)RX(...)TFNI in Best1, (Q/R)QP(...)TFDI in Best2, CIP(...)TXQMG in Best3, and RP(...)TFNLR in Best4, where (...) represents SFXGS. We have clearly demonstrated that this region has a functional consequence (AI domain) in both mBest2 and mBest3/hBest3, although their residues are not identical. Our results strongly suggest that the AI domains in the three bestrophins have similar inhibitory functions. It will be interesting to know if those domains in hBest1 and hBest4 also play an inhibitory role similar to Best2 and Best3. Interestingly, two residues in the AI domains of hBest3 and mBest3 (Fig. 8B, underlined G and F), which induce voltage-dependent currents when mutated to alanines, belong to the rigorously conserved residues. Besides the AI domain, there is a region in mBest2 (residues 405–454) that has a facilitatory effect. In mBest2, we hypothesize that the channel activity may be determined by the mutual competition between the AI domain and a facilitatory domain(s) located within the region bounded by the residues 405 and 454. When a stop codon was introduced at the position of 405, the mBest2 mutant (Δ405–508) lost channel function because of the effect of the AI domain was not opposed by the stimulatory domain (Fig. 6 C and D). Point mutations in the AI domain activated the deletion mutant, indicating that the AI domain was responsible for the inhibition when the facilitatory region (405–454) is removed. When the protein was truncated at position of 454 (Δ454–508), the protein behaved as an active Cl– channel similar to wild-type mBest2, indicating that residues 405–454 overpowered the inhibitory role of the AI domain and made the channel active. The facilitatory effect became prominent when the AI domain was inactivated by mutation. The facilitatory domain increased the channel activity by ∼8-fold when the inhibitory effect of the AI domain is eliminated (Fig. 5). At present, we do not know if the two domains compete with each other through direct interaction or via associating with a third structure. Additionally, what is more interesting about the mBest2 facilitatory domain is that its introduction into mBest3 can turn the channel from a nonfunctional into a functional one. This result further supports that the residues 405–454 of mBest2 is a functional facilitator in bestrophin channel activation. Does this region facilitate the channel activity through binding directly to the channel pore, or via interacting with the AI domain, or via some cellular factors? The mechanism by which the mBest2 facilatatory domain enhances the bestrophin channel activity will be an interesting subject to study."

The Internet uses a protocol-based architecture to facilitate rapid development and evolution; underlying complexities are hidden unless highlighted by catastrophic (often tiny) failure. But our dependence on robust, evolvable technological networks means the tools for engineering architectures and protocols are becoming more effective, and biologists can benefit from these developments in their work on complex living systems."
https://openalex.org/W2019547185,"BphD of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 catalyzes an unusual C-C bond hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA) to afford benzoic acid and 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid (HPD). An enol-keto tautomerization has been proposed to precede hydrolysis via a gem-diol intermediate. The role of the canonical catalytic triad (Ser-112, His-265, Asp-237) in mediating these two half-reactions remains unclear. We previously reported that the BphD-catalyzed hydrolysis of HOPDA (λmax is 434 nm for the free enolate) proceeds via an unidentified intermediate with a red-shifted absorption spectrum (λmax is 492 nm) (Horsman, G. P., Ke, J., Dai, S., Seah, S. Y. K., Bolin, J. T., and Eltis, L. D. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 11071-11086). Here we demonstrate that the S112A variant generates and traps a similar intermediate (λmax is 506 nm) with a similar rate, 1/τ ∼ 500 s-1. The crystal structure of the S112A:HOPDA complex at 1.8-Å resolution identified this intermediate as the keto tautomer, (E)-2,6-dioxo-6-phenyl-hex-3-enoate. This keto tautomer did not accumulate in either the H265A or the S112A/H265A double variants, indicating that His-265 catalyzes tautomerization. Consistent with this role, the wild type and S112A enzymes catalyzed tautomerization of the product HPD, whereas H265A variants did not. This study thus identifies a keto intermediate, and demonstrates that the catalytic triad histidine catalyzes the tautomerization half-reaction, expanding the role of this residue from its purely hydrolytic function in other serine hydrolases. Finally, the S112A:HOPDA crystal structure is more consistent with hydrolysis occurring via an acyl-enzyme intermediate than a gem-diol intermediate as solvent molecules have poor access to C6, and the closest ordered water is 7Å away.

Bacteria use meta-cleavage pathways to degrade a large variety of aromatic compounds, and some alicyclic compounds, such as steroids (1Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although each pathway has its own substrate specificity, they all employ the same underlying logic: vicinal dihydroxylation of an aromatic ring enables dioxygenase-catalyzed extradiol (or meta) ring opening. The resulting meta-cleavage product (MCP) 3The abbreviations used are: MCP, meta-cleavage product; HOPDA, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid; HPD, 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid; Bph, biphenyl; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl. 3The abbreviations used are: MCP, meta-cleavage product; HOPDA, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid; HPD, 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid; Bph, biphenyl; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl. is degraded by an MCP hydrolase, which adds water across a carbon-carbon bond to generate a dienoate and a carboxylic acid (Fig. 1). Enzymes of the meta-cleavage pathway have been of interest because of their roles in biodegradation. For instance, the biphenyl (Bph) catabolic pathway transforms a number of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This process is limited by the inhibitory effects of PCBs or their chlorinated metabolites (2Seah S.Y.K. Labbé G. Nerdinger S. Johnson M.R. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol.

More recently, it was discovered that Mycobacterium tuberculosis catabolizes cholesterol via a meta-cleavage pathway (4Van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E.

A better understanding of the meta-cleavage pathway enzymes should accelerate the development of their potential for biocatalysis and biodegradation, as well as facilitate the design of novel therapeutics for the treatment of tuberculosis.MCP hydrolases, exemplified by BphD of the Bph pathway and HsaD of the cholesterol catabolic pathway, contain the canonical structural fold and Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad characteristic of the α/β-hydrolase enzyme superfamily (6Bugg T.D.H.

Verscheuren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). This triad is associated with the classical hydrolytic mechanism typified by the serine proteases, in which the Asp-His dyad first activates Ser to nucleophilic attack at the substrate carbonyl, and subsequently activates water to release the resulting acyl-enzyme covalent intermediate. Although the catalytic Ser and Asp residues vary within the nucleophile-His-acid framework, all known α/β-hydrolase active sites contain the catalytic His and the oxyanion hole. The latter, which stabilizes the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion, is created by the partial positive charges of backbone amide protons.The proposed mechanism of MCP hydrolases differs from that of other α/β-hydrolases in two important respects: (i) it invokes an enol-keto tautomerization prior to hydrolysis (Fig. 1) (10Henderson I.M.J. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12252-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Lam W.W.Y. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12242-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and (ii) it asserts hydrolysis via a gem-diol intermediate rather than an acyl-enzyme (12Fleming S.M. Robertson T.A.

The two best studied MCP hydrolases are BphD from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, which hydrolyzes 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA) to benzoic acid and 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid (HPD), and MhpC involved in phenylpropionic acid degradation. Kinetic and structural studies of both enzymes have indicated that the catalytic His may mediate tautomerization, as well as help catalyze hydrolysis (13Li J.J. Li C. Blindauer C.A. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12461-12469Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Dunn G. Montgomery M.G. Mohammed F. Coker A. Cooper J.B. Robertson T. Garcia J.L. Bugg T.D.H. Wood S.P. J. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 346: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For instance, stopped-flow studies showed that substitution of the catalytic histidine decreased the rate of a process proposed to represent tautomerization in MhpC (18Li C. Montgomery M.G. Mohammed F. Li J.J. Wood S.P. Bugg T.D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and a polyhistidine-tagged BphD (Ht-BphD) (13Li J.J. Li C. Blindauer C.A. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12461-12469Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of an MhpC:substrate analog binary complex, the catalytic His was 3.2 Å from the C2 carbonyl and 3.9 Å from C5 of the analog (17Dunn G. Montgomery M.G. Mohammed F. Coker A. Cooper J.B. Robertson T. Garcia J.L. Bugg T.D.H. Wood S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), consistent with histidine's role in abstracting a proton from the C2 hydroxyl and protonating C5. More convincingly, the crystal structure of the S112C variant of BphD incubated with HOPDA revealed a complex with the product HPD and an interaction between the catalytic His-265 and the 2-hydroxy/oxo substituent of the dienoate, consistent with a general base role in substrate tautomerization (19Horsman G.P. Ke J. Dai S. Seah S.Y.K. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11071-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protonation by His-265 at HOPDA C5 was deemed possible because of the observed conformational flexibility of the former, allowing us to predict a His-265-to-C5 distance as short as 2.9 Å.A complicating factor in evaluating the catalytic role of His-265 is that the proposed keto intermediate has not been directly observed. Using single turnover ([E] > [S]) stopped-flow analysis, we recently identified an intermediate possessing an electronic absorption maximum that is red-shifted (λmax is 492 nm) from that of the free HOPDA enolate (λmax is 434 nm) (19Horsman G.P. Ke J. Dai S. Seah S.Y.K. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11071-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two kinetic models were proposed, differing in their assignment of the red-shifted intermediate (E:SRed) to either the enolate (E:Se) or keto (E:Sk) tautomer of enzyme-bound HOPDA. A priori, it is more logical to assign the red-shifted species to E:Se as ketonization disrupts the conjugated system of the HOPDA enolate. However, electronic transition energies of small molecule ligands may be greatly perturbed in a protein environment (20D'Ordine R.L. Tonge P.J. Carey P.R. Anderson V.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12635-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Tian F. Debler E.W. Millar D.P. Deniz A.A. Wilson I.A. Schultz P.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Engl. 2007; 46: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and assignment of E:SRed to an E:Sk species is more consistent with additional kinetic observations. First, under single turnover conditions, the decay of E:SRed was coupled to HPD formation, consistent with direct transformation of E:Sk to HPD. Second, increased solvent viscosity slowed a relaxation assigned to tautomerization in the E:Se model, and to diffusive HPD release in the E:Sk model. Because tautomerization is intramolecular and hence should not be affected by solvent viscosity, the E:Sk model provides a more reasonable interpretation of the data. Finally, the apparently ordered product release could be more readily explained via the E:Sk model. Identifying the E:SRed intermediate observed in BphD, therefore, represents an important step toward elucidating the mechanism of MCP hydrolases.Herein, we describe kinetic and structural studies of alanine substitutions of the active site catalytic triad residues Ser-112 and His-265 of BphD. Stopped-flow spectrophotometry of the variants revealed the catalytic contribution of each residue based on the accumulation of different intermediates, such as E:SRed. In parallel, substrate complexes of the BphD variants were characterized at high resolution by x-ray crystallography. Monitoring the ability of enzyme variants to catalyze tautomerization of HPD provided further insight into the catalytic roles of the substituted residues in the tautomeric half-reaction. Implications for catalysis in MCP hydrolases are discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—HOPDA was enzymatically generated from 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (DHB) using DHB dioxygenase (DHBD) as previously described (19Horsman G.P. Ke J. Dai S. Seah S.Y.K. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11071-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The preparation of DHB has been described (23Nerdinger S. Kendall C. Marchhart R. Riebel P. Johnson M.R. Yin C.F. Eltis L.D. Snieckus V. Chem. Commun. 1999; : 2259-2260Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HPD was generated together with benzoic acid by BphDLB400-catalyzed hydrolysis of HOPDA. Upon reaction completion (monitored by absorbance at 434 nm), the solution was acidified to pH ∼ 3 with 2 n HCl, extracted 3 times with 0.3 volumes of ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and rotary evaporated to dryness. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—BphD from B. xenovorans LB400 was produced and purified as previously described (19Horsman G.P. Ke J.

Ser-112 of BphD was substituted with alanine (S112A) using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis method (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, the S112A mutagenic primer (primer S112A: 5′-GCGCCCCCCATGGCGTTGCCGACCAG-3′) and a second mutagenic selection primer to remove an EcoRI site (primer ODM: 5′-AGCTCGAATTGGTAATCATGG-3′) were mixed with pSS184, the pEMBL18 vector carrying bphD (24Seah S.Y.K.

After second strand synthesis and ligation using T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), respectively, the DNA was digested with EcoRI to linearize wild-type plasmid, and transformed into Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 mutS. Plasmid isolated from this first transformation was subjected to a second round of EcoRI digestion and transformation, from which pSS184SA, carrying the mutated gene, was isolated. The mutated gene was cloned into pVLT31 using XbaI and HindIII restriction sites, and the resulting plasmid, pSS314SA, was used for protein production. Substitution of His-265 with alanine was performed using a 5′-phosphorylated primer (H265A: CTCCAAGTGCGGCGCTTGGGCGCAATGG-3′) and the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Genes encoding the single (H265A) and double (S112A/H265A) variants were generated using pSS184 and pSS184SA, respectively, yielding pSS184HA and pSS184SAHA. These constructs were used directly for protein production. The nucleotide sequences of variants were confirmed using an ABI 373 Stretch (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Big-Dye v3.1 terminators.Enzyme Activity Measurements—All enzyme kinetic experiments were performed using potassium phosphate buffer, I = 0.1 m, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. Steady-state enzyme activities were obtained by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 434 nm of the HOPDA enolate versus time using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Varian Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The latter was equipped with a thermostatted cuvette holder maintained at 25.0 ± 0.5 °C, controlled by Cary WinUV software version 3.00. To measure enzyme activity toward HPD, a small volume (<0.5% v/v) of HPD/benzoic acid in ethanol was added to a buffered solution, and absorbance at 270 nm was monitored before and after addition of enzyme.The half-life of the S112A:HOPDA complex was determined by mixing 25 μm S112A and 5 μm HOPDA, and recording the absorption spectrum at 0.5-1-h intervals. The absorbance at 506 nm was plotted against time, and described by a first order decay using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).Stopped-flow Spectrophotometry—Experiments were conducted using an SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) equipped with a photodiode array detector. The drive syringe chamber and optical cell were maintained at 25 °C by a circulating water bath. Multiple wavelength data from the time courses of single turnover experiments were acquired using the Xscan software (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) and exported to Excel where replicate measurements from at least three shots were averaged. To obtain more data at earlier time points, a single wavelength was monitored using the SX18MV software. The data from at least three shots were averaged and equations for single or double exponentials were fit using the same software to obtain reciprocal relaxation times and amplitudes. Good fits were characterized by random variation in the fit residuals.Crystallization of BphD and Preparation of Substrate Complexes—A 1.6-Å resolution structure of BphD was previously determined using crystals grown from a solution containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate (19Horsman G.P. Ke J. Dai S. Seah S.Y.K. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11071-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Seah S.Y.K. Terracina G. Bolin J.T. Riebel P. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22943-22949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These crystals had space group P64 with a = 135.0 Å, c = 66.7 Å, and a sulfate ion bound in the active site. The failure of many attempts to prepare crystalline complexes by incubation of crystals with substrates suggested sulfate binding or the crystal form restricts formation of E:S complexes leading us to seek alternative crystallization procedures.New protocols were established for both wild type and variant enzymes using both commercial (Hampton Research) and non-commercial sodium malonate grid screens and the vapor diffusion method. Sitting drops (1-μl each of reservoir and protein solutions) were equilibrated at 20 °C against 500- or 1000-μl reservoirs. The protein sample contained 9-28 mg/ml protein in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5. Crystals or crystalline precipitates were obtained between 1.5 and 2.4 m sodium malonate within a pH range of 6.0 and 7.0.Two crystal forms were obtained. Crystals of wild-type enzyme had space group P64, a = 135.2 Å, c = 66.3 Å, whereas crystals of the S112A and the S112A/H265A variants had space group I4122 with a = 117.3 Å, c = 87.3 Å. The hexagonal crystals are essentially isomorphous with the previously reported form obtained from ammonium sulfate and contain two protein monomers per asymmetric unit; the tetragonal form has one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of wild-type BphD grew over 12 weeks as hexagonal prisms in 2.0 m sodium malonate, pH 6.0 or 6.5. Crystals of S112A and S112A/H265A grew in 4-6 days as tetragonal rods in 1.9 m sodium malonate. The best crystals of the S112A variant were obtained at pH 7.0, whereas the best S112A/H265A crystals grew at pH 6.5.Crystals of HOPDA complexes were obtained by incubating crystals grown in the absence of HODPA in 30-60 μl of reservoir solution augmented with ∼15 mm HOPDA for 30-60 min at 20 °C.Diffraction Data Measurements and Processing—Crystals were prepared for flash-freezing by sequential transfer into solutions containing higher concentrations of sodium malonate. A mounting loop was used to transfer crystals from the growth drop into 60-μl volumes of reservoir solution, then into similar solutions containing 3.4 m and, finally, 3.7 m sodium malonate. The pH was held at the growth value; the incubation time was 3-6 s per step. After the last transfer crystals were flash-frozen by immersion into liquid nitrogen. For enzyme-substrate complexes, each solution was supplemented with HODPA (∼5-10 mm).Preliminary diffraction patterns were acquired with a typical laboratory instrument based on a rotating anode (Cu) generator equipped with focusing mirror or multilayer optics and an imaging plate detector (Rigaku/MSC). The diffraction data used for refinements of atomic models were acquired at SER-CAT beamline 22-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. For the latter experiments, crystals were maintained at ∼100 K, and diffraction images were recorded by a MarMosaic 300 CCD detector (Mar USA, Inc., Evanston, IL). For each crystal, ∼100 frames were collected with a 1° rotation per frame; exposure times were 1-10 s per degree. All images were processed using DENZO, and then intensities were merged and scaled using SCALEPACK; both programs were from the HKL2000 program suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Refinement—Programs from the CCP4 suite (26Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D: Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were used for phasing and refinement. The crystal structure of wild-type BphD (PDB code 2OG1, Ref. 19Horsman G.P. Ke J.

Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was followed by iterative cycles of restrained atomic parameter refinement using REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D: Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar) and manual density fitting using the molecular graphics program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar) was used to develop structures of substrates and malonate for density fitting and establishment of refinement restraints. The deviation of restrained torsion angles from their expected values was used to evaluate the compatibility of the x-ray data with different tautomers of HOPDA. In the final refinement cycles of HOPDA complexes, the torsion angles in the non-aromatic portion of HOPDA were not restrained; bond lengths and bond angles were restrained to values expected for the keto (S112A: HOPDA) or enol (S112A/H265A:HOPDA) forms. The stereo-chemical properties of the models and the hydrogen bonding were analyzed by programs PROCHECK (31Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and REDUCE (32Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar).Optical Spectroscopy with Single Crystals—Visible light absorption spectroscopy was performed using crystals of the S112A and S112A/H265A variants exposed to HOPDA (∼15 mm in 30-60 μl of reservoir solution) for 30 min. The spectra were recorded at room temperature using a 4DX single crystal microspectrophotometer (4DX Systems) equipped with a MS125™ 1/8m spectrograph (Thermo Oriel), DB401 CCD detector (Andor Technologies), and a CLX 500 xenon lamp (Zeiss). Spectra were generated from the integration of one hundred 19-ms exposures recorded over the wavelength range 300-800 nm. Data acquisition and analysis was controlled by the Andor MCD software package supplied with the detector.After recording the spectra, the crystals were flash-frozen and diffraction data were measured at 100 K using the Rigaku/MSC equipment described above. The data were processed and electronic density maps were analyzed as described above.RESULTSKinetic Analysis of Variant Enzymes—Catalytic triad residues His-265 and Ser-112 were substituted to construct three variants: S112A, H265A, and S112A/H265A. The extremely low activity of the S112A and S112A/H265A variants prevented steady state kinetic measurements. Transformation of HOPDA by H265A as measured by the decay of absorbance at 434 nm could only be detected using large quantities of enzyme (∼1 μm), and the progress curve was biphasic. In an experiment in which 4 μm HOPDA was mixed with 1.3 μm H265A, the first phase could be described by a single exponential decay with a rate constant of 5.8 (±0.4) × 10-3 s-1. In Table 1 this is presented as the third rate of decay, or reciprocal relaxation time (1/τ3), because it is preceded by two events observed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (see below). The value of 1/τ3 is similar to that of HOPDA tautomerization in solution, as observed by deuterium exchange NMR (19Horsman G.P. Ke J. Dai S. Seah S.Y.K. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11071-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The slope of the linear second phase approximately doubled upon increasing the H265A concentration to 2.6 μm. By contrast, doubling enzyme concentration did not affect the value of 1/τ3. The apparent burst is consistent with first order decay of an E:S complex followed by steady-state turnover. Curiously, the amplitude of the first phase corresponded to only 9 (±3)%of the total enzyme added, suggesting only this fraction of the active sites were functional. Similar behavior was observed in stopped-flow experiments (see below). Correcting for the active fraction of enzyme provides a rate of 0.0009 (±0.0002) s-1 for the steady state phase, which is about half of the kcat measured for the H265A variant of Ht-BphD (13Li J.J. Li C. Blindauer C.A. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12461-12469Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is in reasonable agreement considering the current experiments were performed using a substrate concentration below the Km of 37 μm measured for Ht-BphD.TABLE 1Kinetic data for BphD variantsBphD variant1/τ11/τ21/τ3S112A/H265A220 s−1 (69%)22 s−1 (22%)0.34 s−1 (9%)H265A78 s−1 (82%)1.3 s−1 (18%)0.0058 s−1 (−100%)aMeasured using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer as an exponential decay in absorbance at 434 nm.S112A~500 s−1 (−85%)76 s−1 (−11%)0.92 s−1 (−4%)a Measured using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer as an exponential decay in absorbance at 434 nm. Open table in a new tab To better characterize the catalytic impairment of the variants, stopped-flow spectrophotometry was employed under single turnover conditions (E = 8 μm, S = 4 μm) at 25 °C. The S112A variant rapidly generated an intermediate with similar kinetics as the E:SRed intermediate transiently observed in wild type BphD (1/τ1 ∼ 500 s-1, Ref. 19Horsman G.P. Ke J. Dai S. Seah S.Y.K. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11071-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The spectrum of E:SRed was more red-shifted and more intense in S112A (λmax = 506 nm; Table 1, Fig. 2A) than in the wild type (λmax = 492 nm, Fig. 2C). Moreover, E:SRed decayed extremely slowly in S112A, and was effectively trapped as an orange-colored complex. The half-life of this complex (S112A = 25 μm, HOPDA = 5 μm), determined by monitoring its absorbance at 506 nm, was 4.4 h at 25 °C.FIGURE 2Absorption spectra of intermediates in the BphD-catalyzed hydrolysis of HOPDA. A, spectra observed upon mixing 3.9 μm HOPDA (dashed line overlay) with 8 μm S112A. Spectra were recorded 1.1, 3.7, 8.8, 11, 14, 17, 19, 32, and 50 ms after mixing. The isosbestic point occurs at 461 nm. B, spectra observed upon mixing 3.4 μm HOPDA with 8 μm S112A/H265A. Spectra were recorded 3.7, 6.2, 8.8, 11, 14, and every ∼3 ms thereafter to 58 ms after mixing. C, spectral comparison of 4 μm HOPDA (solid line), the S112A:HOPDA complex (dashed line) and the E:SRed intermediate (dotted line) observed ∼20 ms after mixing 8 μm wild-type BphD with 4 μm HOPDA at 3.2 °C. Spectral intensities of the complexes were corrected based on Kd or rate constants. Spectra were recorded using potassium phosphate buffer (I = 0.1 m, pH 7.5) at 25"

The TolQR complex uses the proton-motive force to regulate TolA conformation and its interaction with the outer membrane Pal lipoprotein. It has been proposed that an ion channel forms at the TolQR transmembrane helix interface. This complex assembles with a minimal TolQ/TolR ratio of 4:2, therefore involving at least 14 transmembrane helices, which may form the ion pathway. The C-terminal periplasmic domain of TolR protein interacts with TolQ and has been proposed to control the TolQR channel activity. Here, we constructed unique cysteine substitutions in the last 27 residues of TolR. Each of the substitutions results in a functional TolR protein. Disulfide cross-linking demonstrates that the TolQR complex is dynamic, involving conformational modifications of TolR C-terminal domain. We monitored these structural changes by cysteine accessibility experiments and showed that the conformation of this domain is responsive to the proton-motive force and on the presence of critical residues of the ion pathway.

Gavioli M. Sturgis J.N. Lloubès R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). TolQ and TolR are two accessory proteins interacting with TolA in the inner membrane. Based on sequence comparisons and effects of amino acids substitutions, TolQR have been proposed to form a proton or ion channel, which converts PMF to mechanical energy (4Cascales E. Lloubès R.

Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TolQ is an integral inner membrane protein, with three transmembrane-spanning helices (TMHs) (6Vianney A. Lewin T.M. Beyer W.F.

TolR possesses one TMH with the largest portion of the protein protruding into the periplasm (7Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4485-4491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Muller M.M. Vianney A. Lazzaroni J.C. Webster R.E. Portalier R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6059-6061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This large domain, subdivided in central (called TolR-2) and C-terminal (called TolR-3) domains, is required for TolR dimerization (9Journet L. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Beéneédetti H. J.

It has been proposed that ion or proton flow at the interface of the TMHs of the TolQR complex regulates structural modifications within this complex and hence results in a conformational change within TolA (3Cascales E. Gavioli M. Sturgis J.N. Lloubès R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Cascales E. Lloubès R. Sturgis J.N. Mol.

This modification of TolA conformation has been shown by limited protease accessibility to be dependent upon PMF, TolQ, TolR, and a conserved motif within the TolA inner membrane anchor (14Germon P. Ray M.C. Vianney A. Lazzaroni J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4110-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that residues conserved on specific faces of the TolQ and TolR TMHs constitute a putative ion pathway, probably responsible for binding and releasing ions or protons (5Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved within the TolQ or TolR protein families but also in the homologous ExbB or ExbD and the orthologous MotA or MotB proteins (4Cascales E. Lloubès R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ExbBD proteins are auxiliary partners of TonB protein, which is responsible for the energy-dependent uptake of iron-charged siderophores (15Postle K. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). As for TolA, activity of TonB is dependent upon PMF, ExbB, ExbD, and a conserved motif within the TonB inner membrane anchor, regulating conformational modifications (16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Larsen R.A. Postle K. J. Biol.

MotA and MotB are the two components of the flagellar stator, responsible for coupling PMF with flagella rotation (18Blair D.F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Another similarity between Tol and TonB systems resides in their utilization by bacterial toxins produced and active against Escherichia coli strains. Group A colicins use a subset of the TolQRA and the TolB proteins, whereas group B colicins use the ExbBD-TonB proteins to penetrate and kill bacteria. However, group A colicins do not need any energy to enter the cell, whereas most group B colicins do (19Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Ducheé D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M.A. Slatin S.L. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Colicins 5 and 10, two group B colicins, do not need energy but do not require a TonB-dependent active transporter to cross the OM, suggesting that energy dependence of colicin transport is dictated by the difference of requirements to cross the OM. 3E. L. Goemaere, L. Journet, I. J. Schalk, R. Lloubès, and E. Cascales, manuscript in preparation. This behavior has been used recently to test point mutations within the TolQR helices. Mutations affecting assembly of the complex were shown to be nonfunctional for both energy-dependent OM stability and energy-independent colicin uptake, whereas a novel class of discriminative mutation has been described, affecting only the energy-dependent process. These residues have been proposed to be involved in ion transit or conformation regulation (5Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In order to function, ion channels, such as the TolQR, ExbBD, or MotAB complex, require control of ion selectivity and flow. In a membrane system in which control of ion selectivity or flow has been described, this generally occurs via a penetrating loop or a domain on the periplasmic side of the complex, allowing opening and closing of the channel entrance. In the TolQRA complex, candidates for such a role are the periplasmic loop of TolQ and the TolR C-terminal domain. This latter domain has been shown to co-fractionate with membranes when produced in the periplasm of wild-type (WT) cells (9Journet L. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Beéneédetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4476-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, suppressive mutations of nonfunctional TolQ TMH3 mutants have been isolated in this domain (5Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Lazzaroni J.C. Vianney A. Popot J.L. Beéneédetti H. Samatey F. Lazdunski C. Portalier R. Geéli V. J. Mol.

In the work reported here, we have used residue substitutions with cysteines, oxidative cross-linking, and cysteine accessibilities to assess the role of the TolR C-terminal domain. We show that a segment of the TolR C-terminal domain forming a putative amphipathic α-helix dimerizes. We further demonstrate that the TolR C-terminal domain undergoes conformational modifications dependent upon PMF and residues within the TolQR ion pathway. WT GM1 strain and its tolQR derivative TPS13 used in this study are E. coli K12 derivatives (20Sun T.P. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recA strain DH5α was used for cloning procedures. Cells were routinely grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. When required, medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Standard methods were used for DNA manipulations. Mutants were engineered as previously described (4Cascales E. Lloubès R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), using the pTPS304 plasmid (pUC19 derivative expressing tolQ and tolR) (20Sun T.P. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. Under laboratory growth conditions, Western blot analyzes showed that tolR is expressed from this plasmid at about WT levels (data not shown). Site-directed substitutions were introduced by quick change mutagenesis using complementary pairs of oligonucleotides (sequences available upon request). Recovered plasmids were first verified by restriction analyzes and then by DNA sequencing of the tolR gene, using 5′-CCGCGATTCTGCACCGCC as primer. Solid Growth Assays—Outer membrane permeability was assessed by measuring the level of detergent susceptibility and periplasmic leakage. Detergent susceptibility was estimated on sodium deoxycholate (DOC)-containing plates (1% final concentration), by spotting 2 μl of normalized serial dilution of the strain to be tested. This concentration of DOC is sufficient to completely inhibit growth of tol mutants without affecting WT strains. Periplasmic ribonuclease I leakage was estimated as previously described (3Cascales E. Gavioli M. Sturgis J.N. Lloubès R. Mol.

Strains were then diluted to an A600 = 0.05 in LB medium containing either 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2% SDS in the presence or absence of 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma). The A600 was measured after 90, 135, 180, and 225 min. Colicin activities were checked by the presence of halos on a lawn of the strain to be tested, as previously described (21Journet L. Bouveret E.

Data are reported as the maximal dilution of the colicin stock (1 mg/ml) sufficient to inhibit growth. 8 × 108 exponentially growing cells (A600 ∼ 0.6) were harvested and resuspended in 1.5 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (NaPi, pH 6.8). 500 μl were treated with 0.3 mm dichloro(1,10-phenanthroline) copper(II) (Cu-oP; Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Reduced thiol groups were blocked with 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; Sigma) for 10 min. 500 μl were treated for 10 min with 2.5 mm NEM. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer without reducing agent. 500 μl were centrifuged and resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer containing DTT. Proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and TolR was immunodetected by Western blot analyses. 3 × 109 exponentially growing cells were resuspended in 500 μl of HSEN buffer (100 mm Hepes, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). Cells were then treated with the cysteine-reactive Nα-(3-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin probe (MPB; Invitrogen) (100 μm final concentration) for 20 min at room temperature. For accessibility experiments in energy depletion conditions, cells were first treated with 20 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Sigma) for 10 min and washed with HSEN buffer prior to MPB labeling. As a negative control, cells were treated with 2.5 mm NEM for 20 min and washed with HSEN buffer prior to MPB labeling. MPB labeling was quenched by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (20 mm final concentration). After two washes using HSEN buffer, cells were resuspended in TES (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) supplemented with DNase (100 μg/ml final concentration) and a protease inhibitors mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Membrane proteins were solubilized at 37 °C for 30 min with vigorous shaking and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-TolR polyclonal antibodies (pAbs). TES-solubilized cell extracts were diluted 15-fold in TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. After incubation at room temperature with vigorous shaking, extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g to remove unsolubilized material. Supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were then washed three times with TNE supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, TNE supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, and Tween 0.1% and TNE supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively. Immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer without reducing agent, heated at 96 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection using streptavidin coupled to phosphatase alkaline. For immunodetection, blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Cysteine Scanning Mutagenesis—An alignment of TolR C-terminal sequences from different microorganisms shows that Tyr residue at position 117, Leu residue at position 137, and the Ala-Gly tandem at positions 130 and 131 are well conserved among all TolR proteins (Fig. 1A). The consensus sequences of TolR and homologous ExbD C-terminal domains are shown in Fig. 1B. The Tyr residue and the Ala-Gly tandem are also well conserved within the ExbD C terminus. Widely used computer algorithms predict the presence of an α-helical secondary structure between residues Tyr117 and Gly131 and of a β-strand between residues Ser134 and Thr139 (see Fig. 1B). To gain structural and functional information about the TolR C-terminal domain, we engineered single cysteine substitutions from residue 116 (the proline residue delimitating the central and C-terminal domains) (9Journet L. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Beéneédetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4476-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the C-terminal isoleucine residue (at position 142) (Fig. 1, A and B). Mutations were introduced into the pTPS304 plasmid, which expresses tolQR at WT levels, by a recombinant PCR technique. Steady-state levels of cysteine-substituted TolR proteins were determined after introduction of the mutated plasmids into the tolQR TPS13 strain. Initial studies using the polyclonal anti-TolR antibodies showed that most of the substituted TolR proteins migrated at the same position and accumulated at levels comparable with those of native TolR (Fig. 1C). However, I120C, L126C, L127C, and G131C mutants were expressed at lower levels, and the M138C TolR protein displayed a migration defect. Phenotypic Characterization of Single Cysteine Mutants—The 27 single substituted TolR mutants were tested for outer membrane stability, reflected by their capacity to grow on DOC-containing plates as well as the level of periplasmic component release. Unexpectedly, the TolR C-terminal domain was shown to be remarkably tolerant of cysteine substitution, because all but one mutant displayed the WT phenotype (Table 1). The Y117C TolR mutant released ribonuclease I and displayed an intermediate phenotype on DOC plates (see also Fig. 3A). Overnight colonies were translucent, suggesting that lysis occurs.TABLE 1Functional properties of TolR C-terminal domain substitutionsMutantOM stabilityColicinaColicin sensitivity estimated by 10-fold serial spot dilution (R, resistant bacteria; for sensible bacteria, the number indicates the maximal 10-fold dilution for which a growth inhibition occurs) uptakeDOCbGrowth on 1% DOC-containing plates (–, no growth; ++, WT growth; +, intermediate)Ribonuclease IcRelease of periplasmic ribonuclease I, estimated on RNA-containing plates. +, no leakage; –, leakageColE1ColAColNColE2dSimilar results were obtained with colicin E9ColDeGroup B colicins were tested using KP1038 (exbBD-tolQR) as the recipient strain,fSimilar results were obtained with colicins M and IaCol5eGroup B colicins were tested using KP1038 (exbBD-tolQR) as the recipient strain,gSimilar results were obtained with colicin 10WT+++432443Empty vector––3hTurbidity observed due to cross-complementation between tolQ and exbB genesRRRRRP116C, D118C to I142C+++432443Y117C+iGrowth was observed accompanied by a lysis phenomenon (see Fig. 3A)–43242jTurbidity observed due to the energy dependence of colicin D, Ia, and M uptake33Y117F+++432443Y117W+++432443D114A+–432443a Colicin sensitivity estimated by 10-fold serial spot dilution (R, resistant bacteria; for sensible bacteria, the number indicates the maximal 10-fold dilution for which a growth inhibition occurs)b Growth on 1% DOC-containing plates (–, no growth; ++, WT growth; +, intermediate)c Release of periplasmic ribonuclease I, estimated on RNA-containing plates. +, no leakage; –, leakaged Similar results were obtained with colicin E9e Group B colicins were tested using KP1038 (exbBD-tolQR) as the recipient strainf Similar results were obtained with colicins M and Iag Similar results were obtained with colicin 10h Turbidity observed due to cross-complementation between tolQ and exbB genesi Growth was observed accompanied by a lysis phenomenon (see Fig. 3A)j Turbidity observed due to the energy dependence of colicin D, Ia, and M uptake3 Open table in a new tab We then tested the collection of substituted TolR mutants for colicin uptake. All the mutants were susceptible to the different Tol-dependent colicins tested (Table 1). All of the substitutions (except Y117C) were thus classified as functional mutations, whereas the Y117C TolR mutant displays the characteristics of the recently described discriminative substitution (e.g. nonfunctional for the energy-dependent OM stability but functional for the energy-independent group A colicin uptake) (5Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We further tested the substitutions for the uptake of group B colicins after introduction of the mutated pTPS304 plasmids into the exbBD-tolQR strain. Group B colicins, except colicins 5 and 10, require energy from the ExbBD-TonB or the TolQR-TonB complex to penetrate the cell (19Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Ducheé D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M.A. Slatin S.L. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar).3 All of the mutants displayed a WT phenotype, whereas the TolRY117C-expressing strain presented a WT susceptibility to group B colicins 5 and 10 and an attenuated susceptibility to group B colicins D, M, and Ia (Table 1). This is reminiscent of the discriminative mutations that affect hydrophilic residues that lie within the putative TolQR ionic channel (5Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and further suggests that Tyr117 may participate in some way in the TolQR channel activities. Alternatively, we hypothesized that the Y117C TolR mutant might form cysteine-bound homodimers, which would affect the energy-dependent functions of the TolQR complex. Disulfide Bond Formation between TolR C-terminal Residues—To discriminate between these two hypotheses, we examined the TolR cysteine derivatives by immunoblotting with anti-TolR antibodies in the absence of reducing agent (Fig. 2, top). We observed that only the TolRY117C protein forms homodimers. When treated with the oxidative agent Cu-oP, Y117C as well as P116C, D118C, I121C, L124C, N125C, and K133C to I142C TolR derivatives form homodimers (Fig. 2, middle). It is noteworthy that both monomeric and dimeric forms of TolRY117C are observed, even upon Cu-oP treatment (Fig. 2). However, due to their weak production, dimerization of I120C, L126C, L127C, and M138C could not be determined accurately. Only the monomeric form of TolR was observed when cells were treated with the reducing agent DTT (Fig. 2, bottom). These experiments suggest that the phenotype associated with the Y117C mutation is probably due to a dimerization phenomenon. Y117C Blocks Conformation Modification, Which Results in TolQR Complex Dysfunction—To verify that abolition of the TolRY117C function is a result of a covalent TolR homodimer formation rather than mutation of a critical residue, we constructed two additional mutants at position Tyr117. Substitutions of Tyr117 by the aromatic phenylalanine or the bulky tryptophan residue were shown to be functional for both OM stability and colicin import (Table 1, Fig. 3A). Besides the high level of Tyr117 conservation within TolR proteins, these results suggest that this residue is not essential for function but that formation of a covalent cysteine-bound TolR dimer abolishes function. To confirm this result, we monitored growth cultures of Y117C, Y117W, and Y117F mutants and control vector expressed into the tolQR TPS13 strain in the presence of variable concentrations of SDS and in the absence or presence of the reducing agent DTT (Fig. 3B). As previously shown, tolQR cells were sensitive to low concentrations of SDS, whereas growth of complemented cells or cells expressing the Y117W or Y117F TolR mutants was not affected by concentrations of SDS up to 1%. The addition of 2 mm DTT did not affect the growth of any of these strains. However, the Y117C mutant displayed a distinct behavior, since its growth was slowed down, and partial cell lyses occurred after 3 h of culture in the presence of SDS, whereas such a phenomenon was not observed when cells were grown in the presence of DTT (Fig. 3B). To verify that formation of TolRY117C cross-linked dimers is not toxic for the cell and does not cause a leak of proton or a slow dissipation of PMF, we measured viability and growth rates. Comparison of viability of TolRY117C-expressing cells with TolRWT-expressing cells in the absence or presence of 0.5% SDS showed that (i) SDS is specifically deleterious for TolRY117C-expressing cells (comparison of foreground and background bars) and (ii) viability of TolRY117C-expressing cells in growth media is similar to the viability of TolRWT-expressing cells (comparison of background bars), demonstrating that formation of TolR cross-linked dimers is not toxic for the cell (Fig. 3C). Calculation of generation times in growth media shows no significant difference (31.8 min for TolRWT-expressing cells; 31.2 min for TolRY117C-expressing cells), suggesting that no proton leak is associated with formation of TolR cross-linked dimers. Overall, these data suggest that the TolR Tyr117 residue is not involved in the TolQR channel activities but rather that the specific Y117C mutation blocks conformational modifications of the TolQR complex. This further suggests that a conformationally dynamic TolQR complex, if essential for OM stability, is not required for colicin translocation. Accessibility of Cysteine Residues—To gain information about residues buried or accessible to solvent, we treated cells with the cysteine-reactive MPB probe. As a control, samples were treated with the nonbiotinylated cysteine-reactive derivative NEM prior to MPB treatment. Fig. 4 shows that TolR residues P116C, D118C, S129C, K133C, Q140C, P141C, and I142C and to a lesser extent E119C, I121C, K122C, N125C, H128C, S134C, G136C, L137C, and M138C are labeled by the biotinylated reagent (middle). As expected, NEM-treated samples did not display any labeling (Fig. 4, top). Conformational Changes Depending on Proton-motive Force Monitored by Cysteine Accessibility—Accessibility experiments were repeated after depletion of the cell energy. PMF was collapsed by the addition of the uncoupler carbonyl CCCP prior to labeling using the Cys-reactive MPB probe (Fig. 4, bottom). TolR L124C, N125C, H128C, G136C, and T139C mutants showed a higher level of labeling in the absence of PMF, whereas a slight increase was observed in the case of TolR E119C, I121C, K122C, and S134C proteins. Overall, this suggests that the TolR C-terminal sequence conformation is responsive to PMF and that solvent accessibility increase occurs for some residues when cells are depleted of energy. Conformational Changes Depending on Ion Channel Residues Monitored by Cysteine Accessibility—To determine whether this conformational change is depending upon ion transit through the putative TolQR ion channel, we constructed double mutants affected in one residue of the ion pathway and with a cysteine residue at position Tyr117, Leu124, or Thr139. Four mutations within TolQ and TolR TMHs have been described to affect ion transit (TolR Asp23, TolQ TMH2 Thr145, TolQ TMH3 Thr178 and Pro187) (5Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The aspartate residue located at the beginning of the TolR C terminus (Asp114) and conserved among TolR and ExbD proteins (see Fig. 1, A and B) has also been proposed to be specifically involved in the energy-dependent TolQR channel activity, since its substitution for an alanine residue results in a TolR protein nonfunctional for OM stability but still functional for colicin uptake (see Table 1). The different combinations were tested for dimerization (Y117C mutants) or accessibility to solvent (L124C and T139C). We showed that none of the secondary mutations affected the dimerization of Y117C TolR proteins (Fig. 5A). Mutation of the TolR Asp23 and Asp114 and TolQ Thr145 and Thr178 residues affected the accessibility of L124C and T139C (Fig. 5B). The accessibility observed was similar to the accessibility obtained in energy-depleted cells, suggesting that ion binding to these residues regulates the conformation of the TolR C-terminal domain in response to membrane potential. Mutation of the TolQ Pro187 residue has no effect on the accessibility of the TolR L124C or T139C mutants. Molecular motors using proton or ion-motive force for their activities must be regulated at different levels, such as (i) the selectivity (e.g. the ch"

Searching the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome data base for a UGDH has helped identify two open reading frames, PA2022 and PA3559, which may encode a UGDH. To elucidate their enzymatic identity, the two genes were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified. Both the gene products are active as dimers and are capable of utilizing UDP-glucose as a substrate to generate UDP-glucuronic acid. The Km values of PA2022 and PA3559 for UDP-glucose are ∼0.1 and 0.4 mm, whereas the Km values for NAD+ are 0.5 and 2.0 mm, respectively. Compared with PA3559, PA2022 exhibits broader substrate specificity, utilizing TDP-glucose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine with one-third the velocity of that with UDP-glucose. The PA2022 mutant and PA2022-PA3559 double mutant, but not the PA3559 mutant, are more susceptible to chloramphenicol, cefotaxime, and ampicillin. The PA3559 mutant, however, shows a reduced resistance to polymyxin B compared with wild type PAO1. Finally, real time PCR analysis indicates that PA3559 is expressed primarily in low concentrations of Mg2+, which contrasts with the constitutive expression of PA2022. Although both the enzymes catalyze the same reaction, their enzymatic properties and gene expression profiles indicate that they play distinct physiological roles in P. aeruginosa, as reflected by different phenotypes displayed by the mutants.

(EC 1.1.1.22) converts UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) to UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) accompanied by the reduction of two molecules of NAD+. The importance of UDP-GlcUA is readily apparent considering the downstream polymers that utilize this compound or its descendents, such as UDP-xylose, UDP-arabinose, and UDP-galacturonic acid (1Seifert G.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The cellular functions of UGDH have been investigated in a number of organisms, and these studies demonstrate its importance in detoxification, polysaccharide biosynthesis, and embryonic development (2Princivalle M. de Agostini A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 267-278PubMed Google Scholar). In the liver, glucuronide conjugation of xeno- and endobiotic compounds by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases is an important way to aid in solubilizing these metabolites (3Hauser S.C. Ziurys J.C. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4527-4533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, both UDP-GlcUA and its derivative, UDP-xylose, are essential to synthesizing cell wall polysaccharides such as hemicellulose (4Dalessandro G. Northcote D.H. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Animals require UDP-GlcUA to synthesize major structural polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid (HA), heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate (5Roden L. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980Google Scholar). An inability to synthesize these structural polysaccharides may partly explain why a UGDH deficiency disrupts the Wingless signal pathway in Drosophila melanogaster (6Binari R.C. Staveley B.E.

Cell. 2003; 114: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In many pathogenic bacteria, UDP-GlcUA is necessary for the synthesis of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The formation of these polysaccharides is critical to bacterial virulence (10Watson D.A. Musher D.M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3135-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wessels M.R. Goldberg J.B. Moses A.E. DiCesare T.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 433-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because it enables the bacteria to evade attacks by a host immune system, such as phagocytosis (12Cross A.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 87-95PubMed Google Scholar, 13Moxon E.R. Kroll J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 65-85PubMed Google Scholar). Some pathogens, including group A and C streptococci, can even synthesize nonimmunogenic EPS such as HA to prevent antibody-mediated killing (14Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that UGDH mutation in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans alters the cell integrity and nucleotide sugar pool. The cells also become temperature-sensitive and fail to grow in an animal model (15Griffith C.L. Klutts J.S. Zhang L. Levery S.B. Doering T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51669-51676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, is noted for its environmental versatility, resistance to antibiotics, and ability to cause life-threatening infections in cystic fibrosis, burn, and immunocompromised patients (16Rocchetta H.L. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 523-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epidemiological data indicate that P. aeruginosa is the third leading cause of nosocomial infection (17Rajan S. Saiman L. Semin. Respir. Infect. 2002; 17: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The significance of EPS in P. aeruginosa virulence is well documented in the cystic fibrosis strains, in which the synthesis of a large quantity of alginate has frequently been observed. However, many other pathogenic P. aeruginosa strains, such as PAO1, do not normally produce alginate. The precise structure and composition of the EPS and the genes required for EPS synthesis in these P. aeruginosa strains remain unclear. Because UDP-GlcUA is one of the most commonly found sugar donors for bacterial EPS synthesis, this study attempts to identify the UGDH encoding gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and to investigate the biochemistry and functional roles of this enzyme in this important pathogen. This study first demonstrates that at least two P. aeruginosa genes can encode a product with UGDH activity, each with a distinct expression pattern and enzyme kinetic parameters. The presence of two types of UGDH motivated the construction of deletion mutants for each of the genes, and this study analyzes and reports on the functional roles of these genes in several biological properties of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions, Plasmids, Oligonucleotide Primers, and Chemicals—Table 1 lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study. Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa were cultured in standard Luria-Bertani broth (LB: 10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter sodium chloride) or on LB agar. The basal medium employed in the determination of minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of antibiotics and in RNA extraction for quantitative PCR contained 30 mm glucose, 40 mm K2HPO4, 22 mm KH2PO4, 7 mm (NH4)2SO4, and either 2.0 or 0.02 mm MgSO4 for Mg2+-sufficient or Mg2+-deficient conditions, respectively. The following antibiotic concentrations were used to select recombinant E. coli: tetracycline, 10 μg/ml; ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 25 μg/ml. The concentration of tetracycline for selecting recombinant P. aeruginosa was 50 μg/ml. Unless indicated otherwise, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest purity available.

Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from either New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or MBI Fermentas (Hanover, MD) and were used according to supplier recommendations. The PA2022 and PA3559 overexpression clones were constructed using PCR amplification of the coding region of each respective gene. Specific primer sets and PAO1 genomic DNA served as the template in the reaction. The nucleotide sequence of PA3559 and PA2022 was retrieved from the Pseudomonas Genome Project. The forward and reverse primers for PA2022 were HY1001 and HY1002, and those for PA3559 were RJ004 and RJ003, containing BamHI and XhoI restriction endonuclease sites, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the pET30a expression vector at corresponding restriction sites to be in-frame with the His6 tag at the N terminus of the protein. The constructs were then introduced into E. coli NovaBlue (DE3) by the rubidium chloride method, and the transformants were selected on LB agar containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The DNA was sequenced to verify the correctness of the cloned gene and the reading frame fusion with the His6 tag. Overexpression and Purification of His6-tagged PA2022 and PA3559 Products—The production of PA2022 and PA3559 in E. coli was carried out by growing the recombinant strains in LB broth supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. The cells were first cultivated by shaking at 37 °C until the A600 = 0.5. Isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was subsequently added at a final concentration of 0.2 mm and growth continued for 5 h at 24 °C under shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), and lysed by sonication on ice with a macroprobe sonicator (model XL2020, Misonix) at a power setting of 4 for 15 min. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and the chromatography was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The eluting buffer consisted of 500 mm imidazole. The purity of the protein was then evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Ion Pair HPLC Analysis of Nucleotide Sugars—This study used a Waters HPLC system (Waters 2796 Bioseparations Module) composed of an autosampler and a UV detector (Waters 2996 photodiode array detector) to analyze the amount of nucleotide sugars in cells. Separation of nucleotide sugars, NAD+, and NADH was performed at 34 °C on a μBondapak C18 column (10-μm particle size, 3.9 × 300 mm) and a guard column cartridge (5-μm particle size, 4.6 × 20 mm, Atlantis®, Waters). The method was performed as described previously (19Ryll T. Wagner R. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 570: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Kochanowski N. Blanchard F. Cacan R. Chirat F. Guedon E. Marc A. Goergen J.L. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 348: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two buffers were used for the HPLC analysis. Buffer A was 100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 plus 8 mm tetrabutylammonium-bisulfate hydrogen sulfate used as the pairing reagent, pH 5.3. Buffer B was 70% buffer A plus 30% methanol, pH 5.9. Concentrate KOH or phosphoric acid was used for adjusting the buffer pH. All solutions were freshly prepared, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore), and degassed before use. The sequence of chromatographic gradient was as follows: 100% buffer A for 2.5 min, 0–40% buffer B for 14 min, 40–100% buffer B for 1 min, 100% buffer B for 6 min, 100–100% buffer B for 1 min, followed by an equilibration phase of 100% buffer A for 8 min. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Enzymatic Activity and Kinetic Characterization—UGDH activity was measured by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm, which accompanies the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The assay was performed at room temperature in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm UDP-Glc, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm NAD+. One unit of UGDH activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 2 μmol of NADH per min at room temperature. Prior to HPLC analysis, the reaction mixture was mixed thoroughly with an equal volume of methanol, and the protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The Km and Vmax values for UDP-Glc and NAD+ were determined independently using standard assay conditions. Kinetic parameters for UDP-Glc as the substrate were measured by holding NAD+ constant (5 mm) and varying UDP-Glc from 0.02 to 5 mm. Similarly, NAD+ kinetic measurements were made by holding UDP-Glc constant (5 mm) and varying NAD+ from 0.02 to 5 mm. GraphPad Prism4 software plotted the data, and Km and Vmax were calculated by fitting the data to the equation (V = Vmax [S]h/([S]h + Kmh)) where h is the Hill coefficient. Substrate specificity was measured by substituting UDP-Glc with the same concentration of ADP-Glc, TDP-Glc, GDP-Man, UDP-Gal, or UDP-GlcNAc in the standard reaction. To determine the Ki value of UDP-GlcUA, the Km value of UDP-Glc at a variety of concentrations of UDP-GlcUA was first measured. The results were then fitted onto a curve where X is the concentration of UDP-GlcUA, and Y is the observed Km value. Linear regression was used to determine the x axis intercept, which equals the negative Ki value. The measurement of Ki for NADH was carried out similarly in the presence of variable concentrations of the compound. Molecular Mass Determination—The molecular masses of PA2022 and PA3559 in aqueous solution were determined using a Superdex-200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) on a fast protein liquid chromatograph in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Size determination was made by comparing molecular mass standards (GE Healthcare) chromatographed under the same conditions. The molecular mass standards used were as follows: ferritin, 440 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; RNase A, 15 kDa. A calibration curve was plotted as the log (molecular mass) versus Kav, where Kav = (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0), giving correlation values above 0.99. The term Ve is the elution volume for the protein; V0 is the column void volume, and Vt is the column total bed volume. The molecular masses of PA2022 and PA3559 were subsequently determined from the calibration curve. Construction of PA2022 and PA3559 Deletion Strains—Constructing the PA3559 gene-specific deletion mutants in P. aeruginosa involved obtaining DNA fragments of ∼1 kb in size both upstream and downstream of the targeted sequences to be deleted by PCR amplification of genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Primers pmrE05 and pmrE03 were used for amplifying upstream fragments, and primers pmrE04 and pmrE06 (Table 2) were used for the downstream region. The amplified fragments were then cloned in tandem into the suicide vector pEX18Tc. For PA2022 mutant construction, a 4.1-kb DNA segment comprising the PA2022 gene was first cloned into the PstI and EcoRI sites of the suicide vector pSUP202. The next step was to insert a kanamycin resistance gene in the unique BamHI site of the PA2022 gene. In either case, the resulting gene replacement plasmids were transformed individually into E. coli SM10 and subsequently mobilized into P. aeruginosa PAO1 or its derivatives via conjugation. The transconjugants were selected on LB agar containing tetracycline (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml), which was used to counterselect donor E. coli. The surviving colonies were then propagated in LB broth containing 5% sucrose, which selected against cells containing the sacB gene harbored on pEX18Tc. These colonies were also tested for tetracycline sensitivity to ensure plasmid loss. The resultant mutants were confirmed by PCR amplification and Southern hybridization with a probe specific to each of the genes. Preparation of the Cell-free Extracts for UGDH Activity Determination—The bacteria grown overnight were refreshed in 50 ml of LB broth for 2 h and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5, disrupted by a brief ultrasonication, and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g to remove the debris. The clarified cell lysates were dialyzed overnight against 100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, prior to determination of the UGDH activity. The cell lysate (∼15 μg of protein) in this specific assay was first incubated with NAD+ to determine the endogenous NAD+ reduction rate. UDP-Glc was then added to the reaction mixture, and the difference in the NAD+ reduction rate was measured. Here the definition of 1 unit is the activity that produces 1 μmol of NADH per min. Extraction of Intracellular Nucleotide Sugars—Bacterial cells from the 0.5-ml overnight culture were collected by centrifugation. The pellet was briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 185 μl of a cold 0.5 m perchloric acid solution was added to the pellet and mixed vigorously. After incubation on ice for 2 min, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, for 5 min. The supernatants containing the soluble molecules were neutralized with 42 μl of ice-cold 2.5 m KOH in 1.5 m K2HPO4 and incubated on ice for 2 min. The neutralized samples were centrifuged again and filtered with 0.2-μm filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to remove potassium perchlorate precipitate. The samples were stored at -70 °C until analysis. Susceptibility to Antibiotics—Antibiotic-impregnated disks (BBL™, Oxoid or Difco) were used to measure the sensitivity of the bacterial strains to antibiotics. For the disk diffusion assay, overnight aerobically grown cultures in LB were diluted to an A600 of 0.1, and 100-μl aliquots were spread uniformly on an LB plate. The disk loads were as follows: ampicillin, 10 μg; polymyxin B, 300 IU; ceftazidime, 30 μg; cefotaxime, 30 μg; chloramphenicol, 30 μg; gentamicin, 10 μg; imipenem, 10 μg; kanamycin, 30 μg; lincomycin, 2 μg; and tetracycline, 30 μg. Comparing the zone of inhibition to a standard sensitivity chart (BD Biosciences) revealed the resistance to an antibiotic. The MIC of each antibiotic was determined by the microdilution method in multiple-well plates. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic that prevented growth of the testing bacterial strains after 18 h of incubation at 37 °C. Bacterial Motility Assays—For swimming motility assays (21Rashid M.H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), tryptone swim plates (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.3% agar) were inoculated with a sterile toothpick and incubated for 12–14 h at 25 °C. Motility was then assessed qualitatively by examining the circular turbid zone formed by the bacterial cells migrating away from the point of inoculation. For the twitching motility assay, cells were stab-inoculated with a toothpick through a thin (∼3 mm) LB agar layer (1% agar) to the bottom of the Petri dish. After incubation from 24 to 48 h at 37 °C, a hazy zone of growth at the interface between the agar and the polystyrene surface was revealed by crystal violet staining (1% (w/v) solution) (22Darzins A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5934-5944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS Analysis—The hot phenol-water method (23Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the proteinase K digestion method (24Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were utilized to extract LPS. The LPS preparations were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and silver-stained according to a previously published method (25Fomsgaard A. Freudenberg M.A. Galanos C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription and Real Time-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 5 μm DTT (both from Invitrogen), 40 units of RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega) 0.5 μm of random hexanucleotide primers (GE Healthcare), and 500 μm of dNTP mixture. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 50 °C for 60 min. Heating the reaction mixture at 70 °C for 15 min was subsequently performed to terminate the reaction, and the cDNA was stored at -20 °C. All real time PCR analyses were performed on an ABI PRIZM 7000 instrument. Each reaction included a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 0.1 μm of each primer, 10 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystem, including AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase with buffer, dNTPs mix, SYBR Green I dye, Rox dye, and 10 mm MgCl2), and 1 μl of the template cDNA. The typical amplification program included activation of the enzyme at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. The CT (cycle threshold) value for each gene was determined by automated threshold analysis function of the ABI instrument and normalized to CT(G3PDH) to obtain dCT (= CT(G3PDH) - CT(test)). The difference in gene expression at different Mg2+ concentrations was indicated with the ddCT values, which were calculated as dCT(low Mg2+) - dCT(high Mg2+). The difference of n between two CT or dCT values indicates a 2n-fold difference in amount of the target sequence between the two cDNA samples being compared. Biofilm Assay—The kinetics of biofilm formation in a static system was measured as described by O'Toole and Kolter (26O'Toole G.A. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Briefly, LB was inoculated with an overnight culture of each strain at a 1/100 dilution, and 100-μl aliquots of the diluted bacterial suspension were added to a 96-well polystyrene microtiter dish. The microtiter dish was incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The liquid culture was removed by aspiration, and the wells were rinsed thoroughly two times with phosphate-buffered saline at each time point. Samples were stained by adding 100 μl of 1% crystal violet solution to each well and allowing them to sit for 15 min. After staining, the wells were washed three times with water, and any remaining crystal violet in the wells was dissolved in 100 μl of 95% ethanol, and the absorbance at 595 nm was determined. Alternatively, the biofilm-forming capability of these strains was evaluated by using a polydimethylsiloxane flow cell connected to a bacterial culture system, which allowed the culture media flowing through the flow cells at uni-direction. Before perfusion, 10 ml of mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5) P. aeruginosa was injected into the microchannels by a polypropylene syringe. The flow cells were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C to allow initial bacteria attachment. A peristaltic pump then passed a 1:10 dilution of LB broth through the flow cell at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. After 24 h, the biofilms formed in the flow cell were labeled with SYBR Green solution for 5 min and then examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Optical sections with a step size of 3 μm in the z axis were collected and reconstructed into three-dimensional cross-sections. Identification of UGDH Homologs in P. aeruginosa PAO1 Genome—Because the Streptococcus pyogenes UGDH (SpUGDH) molecular structure was solved previously (27Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the protein sequence was used as a template to search for UGDH homologs in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Four genes, PA2022, PA3159, PA3540, and PA3559, were capable of encoding a protein with a sequence identity ranging from 22 to 25% compared with that of SpUGDH. Among them, PA3540 (algD) and PA3159 (wbpA) have been characterized previously as GDP-Man dehydrogenase (GMDH) (28Deretic V. Gill J.F. Chakrabarty A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4567-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and UDP-GlcNAc 6-dehydrogenase encoding gene, respectively (29Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Larocque S. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but PA2022 and PA3559 have not been investigated. Alignment of the putative protein sequences of these genes indicates that, in comparison with PA3540 and PA3159, PA2022 and PA3559 resemble SpUGDH with a BLASTP e value of 2 × 10-23 and 7 × 10-22, respectively. PA3559 and PA2022 are closely related to each other and share 52% identity and 67% similarity. Both proteins contain a NAD+ dinucleotide-binding domain in the N-terminal regions and a nucleotide sugar-binding domain in the"
https://openalex.org/W2076897564,"The survival of vertebrate species is dependent on the ability of individuals to adequately interact with each other, a function often mediated by the olfactory system. Diverse olfactory receptor repertoires are used by this system to recognize chemicals. Among these receptors, the V1rs, encoded by a very large gene family in most mammals, are able to detect pheromones. Teleosts, which also express V1r receptors, possess a very limited V1r repertoire. Here, taking advantage of the possibility to unequivocally identify V1r orthologs in teleosts, we analyzed the olfactory expression and evolutionary constraints of a pair of clustered fish V1r receptor genes, V1r1 and V1r2. Orthologs of the two genes were found in zebrafish, medaka, and threespine stickleback, but a single representative was observed in tetraodontidae species. Analysis of V1r1 and V1r2 sequences from 12 different euteleost species indicate different evolutionary rates between the two paralogous genes, leading to a highly conserved V1r2 gene and a V1r1 gene under more relaxed selective constraint. Moreover, positively-selected sites were detected in specific branches of the V1r1 clade. Our results suggest a conserved agonist specificity of the V1R2 receptor between euteleost species, its loss in the tetraodontidae lineage, and the acquisition of different chemosensory characteristics for the V1R1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2037221738,"Shigellosis or bacillary dysentery, an acute bloody diarrhoea, is a major public health burden in developing countries. In the absence of prompt and appropriate treatment, the infection is often fatal, particularly in young malnourished children. Here, we describe a new diagnostic test for rapid detection, in stool, at the bedside of patients, of Shigella flexneri 2a, the most predominant agent of the endemic form of the disease.The test is based on the detection of S.flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using serotype 2a-specific monoclonal antibodies coupled to gold particles and displayed on one-step immunochromatographic dipstick. A concentration as low as 20 ng/ml of LPS is detected in distilled water and in reconstituted stools in under 15 minutes. The threshold of detection corresponds to a concentration of 5x10(7) CFU/ml of S. flexneri 2a, which provides an unequivocal positive reaction in three minutes in distilled water and reconstituted stools. The specificity is 100% when tested with a battery of Shigella and unrelated strains, in culture. When tested in Vietnam, on clinical samples, the specificity and sensitivity were 99.2 and 91.5%, respectively. A decrease of the sensitivity during the evaluation on stool samples was observed after five weeks at room temperature and was due to moistening of the dipsticks caused by the humidity of the air during the fifth week of the evaluation. This drawback is now overcome by improving the packaging and providing dipsticks individually wrapped in waterproof bags.This simple dipstick-bases test represents a powerful tool for case management and epidemiological surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2071852752,"Background Sub-Saharan Africa is the continent with the highest prevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Genotype 2 HCV is thought to have originated from West Africa several hundred years ago. Mechanisms of transmission remain poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings To delineate mechanisms for HCV transmission in West Africa, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of individuals aged ≥50 years in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Dried blood spots were obtained for HCV serology and PCR amplification. Prevalence of HCV was 4.4% (47/1066) among women and 5.0% (27/544) among men. In multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for HCV infection were age (baseline: 50–59 y; 60–69 y, adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.67, 95% CI: 0.91–3.06; ≥70 y, AOR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.89–6.39), belonging to the Papel, Mancanha, Balanta or Mandjako ethnic groups (AOR: 2.45, 95% CI:1.32–4.53), originating from the Biombo, Cacheu or Oio regions north of Bissau (AOR: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.18–14.73) and having bought or sold sexual services (AOR: 3.60, 95% CI: 1.88–6.89). Of 57 isolates that could be genotyped, 56 were genotype 2. Conclusions Our results suggest that transmission of HCV genotype 2 in West Africa occurs through sexual intercourse. In specific locations and subpopulations, medical interventions may have amplified transmission parenterally."
https://openalex.org/W2070269954,"Syk, a 72-kDa tyrosine kinase, is involved in development, differentiation, and signal transduction of hematopoietic and some non-hematopoietic cells. This study determined if Syk is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and contributes to angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling and protein synthesis. Syk was found in VSMC and was phosphorylated by Ang II through AT1 receptor. Ang II-induced Syk phosphorylation was inhibited by piceatannol and dominant negative but not wild type Syk mutant. Syk phosphorylation by Ang II was attenuated by cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitor pyrrolidine-1 and retrovirus carrying small interfering RNAs (shRNAs) of this enzyme. Arachidonic acid (AA) increased Syk phosphorylation, and AA- and Ang II-induced phosphorylation was diminished by inhibitors of AA metabolism (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid) and lipoxygenase (LO; baicalein) but not cyclooxygenase (indomethacin). AA metabolites formed via LO, 5(S)-, 12(S)-, and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, which activate p38 MAPK, increased Syk phosphorylation. p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and dominant negative p38 MAPK mutant attenuated Ang II- and AA-induced Syk phosphorylation. Adenovirus dominant negative c-Src mutant abolished Ang II - and AA-induced Syk phosphorylation and SB202190, and dominant negative p38 MAPK mutant inhibited Ang II-induced c-Src phosphorylation. Syk dominant negative mutant but not epidermal growth factor receptor blocker AG1478 also inhibited Ang II-induced VSMC protein synthesis. These data suggest that Syk expressed in VSMC is activated by Ang II through p38 MAPK-activated c-Src subsequent to cytosolic phospholipase A2 and generation of AA metabolites via LO, and it mediates Ang II-induced protein synthesis independent of epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation (Ang II → cPLA2 → AA metabolites of LO → p38 MAPK → c-Src → Syk → protein synthesis).

The present study was conducted to determine whether Syk is expressed and is involved in Ang II signaling process and its relationship to EGFR in its growth promoting effects in rat VSMC. The results of our study show that Syk is expressed in VSMC and is activated by Ang II through generation of AA metabolites via LO, most likely HETEs, consequent to cPLA2 activation. AA metabolites via p38 MAPK-activated c-Src phosphorylate and activate Syk, which contributes to Ang II-induced VSMC protein synthesis independent of EGFR transactivation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Anti-phospho-Syk (Tyr-525/526), phosphotyrosine, phospho-cPLA2, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-c-Src antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).

Pyrrolidine-1 was generously provided by Dr. M. H. Gelb (University of Washington, Seattle, WA).Cell Culture—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 250–350 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (Abbott, North Chicago, IL), and the thoracic aorta was excised and rapidly removed. VSMC were isolated and cultured as described (23Uddin M.R. Muthalif M.M. Karzoun N.A. Benter I.F. Malik K.U. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were maintained under 5% CO2 in Medium M-199 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.01% amphotericin-B (all from Sigma) at 37 °C. Cells between 4 and 8 passages were made quiescent for 48 h with M-199 containing 0.5% FBS before exposure to different agents for all experiments. Viability of VSMC did not change after any treatment, transfection, or infection, determined by trypan blue exclusion assay.Western Blot Analysis—VSMC were isolated in lysis buffer (1% IGEPAL CA-630, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein (30–50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked and incubated with primary antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then exposed to their respective secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and developed by using West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The density of bands was calculated with NIH ImageJ program. To confirm equal amounts of protein in each sample, the blots were probed with anti-α-actin smooth muscle antibody.Transfection of VSMC with Plasmids—60–80% confluent VSMC were transiently transfected with the empty vector (pALTER®MAX) alone, wild type (WT), or dominant negative (DN; Y525F/Y526F) Syk (kindly provided by Dr. H. Band, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) or WT (pCMV-FLAG-p38) or DN (pCMV-FLAG-p38(agf)) p38 MAPK mutant (generously provided by Dr. R. J. Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in a ratio of 25 μl of Effectene to 1 μg of plasmid in M-199 containing 5% FBS for 48 h according to manufacturer's instructions. Then the transfected cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The transfection efficiency was determined by Western blot analysis by co-transfection of plasmid containing the GFP sequence along with plasmids of interest and visualizing GFP bands.Preparation of shRNA and Transient Transfection of VSMC with Retroviral Gene Suppressor System—shRNA cPLA2 was synthesized and used to transfect VSMC as previously described (5Li F. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the primers with forward (5′-TCGAGACAGTAGTGGTTCTACGTGCCgagtactgGGCACGTAGAACCACTACTGTTTTTT-3′) and reverse (5-CTAGAAAAAACAGTAGTGGTTCTACGTGCCcagtactcGGCACGTAGAACCACTACTGTC-3′) sequences for cPLA2 were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into linearized pSuppressorRetro viral vector using ready-to-go T4 DNA ligase kit (Amersham Biosciences). Competent DH5α cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with ligated plasmid DNA. After transformation, the colonies were amplified and purified using a Qiagen miniprep purification kit, and plasmid DNAs were sequenced using primer complementary to suppressor retroviral vector. Then the plasmids with correct sequences were amplified and purified with Qiagen Maxi Plasmid DNA kit and used to transfect human embryonic kidney 293 cells along with pECO packaging vector for the preparation of the retrovirus containing cPLA2 shRNA insert as described (5Li F. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The virus was harvested by filtering the virus-containing supernatant. VSMC were made quiescent and infected with the viral supernatant in M-199 containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene and 0.1% FBS for 48 h before exposure to Ang II. The infection efficiency was confirmed by β-galactosidase staining (Invitrogen) of cells infected with retrovirus containing control LacZ.Amplification and Transduction of Adenovirus Carrying Partially Active and DN c-Src in VSMC—The subconfluent low passage human embryonic kidney 293 cells were infected with adenovirus stock containing partially active (AxSrcY416F/Y527F) and DN (AxSrc Kinase Dead) c-Src (kindly provided by Dr. R. Baron, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) for about 3–5 days. As the cytopathic effect was complete, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, and supernatant was removed and kept in a separate sterile tube. The pellet was subjected to freeze-thaw cycle three times, re-suspended, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. After mixing the first and second supernatants, they were filtered through a filter-top bottle and stored at –80 °C. Before storing, the number of viral particles in stock was determined using the physical particles method. The optical density of viral stock in 0.05% SDS (1:50) was measured at 260 nm, and multiplicity of infection was calculated by infecting VSMC with a different volume of viral stock (24Mittereder N. March K.L. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of infection was confirmed by increased expression of c-Src kinase in VSMC by Western blot analysis. Subconfluent VSMC were then incubated with adenovirus carrying partially active or DN c-Src (10 multiplicity of infection) in M-199 containing 5% FBS for 48 h. The cells were washed with M-199 medium and then exposed to Ang II (200 nm) or its vehicle for 5 min and lysed in lysis buffer, and an equal amount of cell lysate protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Immunoblotting and in Vitro Kinase Assay—After various treatments, the VSMC were lysed, and equal amounts of protein from each cell lysates were incubated with the antibodies against the protein of interest at 4 °C overnight. The next day the agarose-bound protein A (Vector, Berlingame, CA) was added and incubated for 6 h at 4°C. After centrifugation of the lysates and washing the pellet with 1× lysis buffer, 100 μl of 4× sample buffer were added to the pellet and used for Western blot analysis. For in vitro p38 MAPK kinase assay, the immunoprecipitate was washed with 1× kinase buffer and suspended in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer containing ATP (200 μm) and the substrate (ATF-2, 1 μl) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and reaction was stopped by adding 4× sample buffer. The activity of p38 MAPK was determined by measuring phosphorylation of ATF-2 by Western blot analysis. For in vitro Syk assay, the immunoprecipitate was washed with kinase buffer and suspended in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer containing ATP (200 μm), [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi, Amersham Biosciences), and MBP (5 μg) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× sample buffer, and the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The Syk activity was determined by measuring the density of radioactive MBP bands by autoradiography.RNA Extraction and Real-time Quantitative PCR—5-LO primers (GenBank™ accession number NM_012822, forward, ccccgagatatccagtttga, and reverse, aggttctccatcgcttttga), 12/15-LO primers (GenBank™ accession number NM_031010, forward, aaggatggctcaatcctgaa, and reverse, tcctctcgaaatcgttggtc), and 18 S RNA primers (GenBank™ accession number X01117, forward, ccgcagctaggaataatgga, reverse, ccctcttaatcatggcctca) were designed to have ∼50% or less G/C content and a melting temperature less than 60 °C. RNA was extracted from quiescent VSMC and used for real-time quantitative PCR as described (25Parmentier J.H. Lavrentyev E.N. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Malik K.U. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).DNA and Protein Synthesis Determination in VSMC—DNA and protein synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine or [3H]leucine, respectively, in VSMC as described (26Parmentier J.H. Pavicevic Z. Malik K.U. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Subconfluent VSMC were plated in 24-well plates for 24 h, transfected with DN or WT Syk mutant or empty vector for 48 h, and exposed to Ang II (100 nm) or EGF (100 ng/ml) for the last 24 h. [3H]Leucine (0.25 μCi/well) or [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was also added to the plates along with Ang II or EGF. The cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline, trichloroacetic acid (10%), and ethanol/ether (2:1) each three times. 3H-Labeled cells were collected with 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m NaOH, and radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation spectroscopy. [3H]Leucine and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as disintegrations per min (dpm) per well and expressed as -fold change from vehicle. To directly measure the DNA and protein content, VSMC in each plate were counted using a hemocytometer, protein content was measured by the Bradford method and DNA content was determined by a DNA extraction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly VSMC were harvested and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 min. After resuspending and homogenizing the pellet, the nucleic acids were isolated by incubation with Pronase (0.44 μl/ml) on a shaker overnight. DNA from samples was purified by adding RNase, precipitated by ethanol, and measured using Biophotometer.Data Analysis—The densitometric analysis was performed using NIH ImageJ program. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance; the unpaired Student's t test was used to determine the difference between two groups. The values of at least three different experiments is expressed as the mean ± S.E. p values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.RESULTSSyk Is Expressed in Rat VSMC and Phosphorylated and Activated by Ang II through AT1 Receptor—The Western blot analysis of rat VSMC lysates showed that Syk (72 kDa) is expressed in these cells (Fig. 1A). To determine the effect of Ang II on phosphorylation of Syk, the serum-deprived confluent VSMC were treated with Ang II at different concentrations (25–200 nm) and with 200 nm Ang II for different time periods (1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 min). Ang II increased Syk phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner with the maximal effect at 200 nm (Fig. 1B). The increase in Syk phosphorylation was evident as early as 2 min, peaked at 5 min, and was maintained in the presence of Ang II for 20 min (Fig. 1C). Therefore, VSMC were treated with 200 nm Ang II for 5 min in all subsequent experiments. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was also measured by Western blot analysis of Syk, immunoprecipitated from Ang II-treated VSMC, and by probing with phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1A). VSMC express both AT1 and AT2 receptors (27Brogelli L. Parenti A. Ledda F. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ang II-induced Syk phosphorylation was inhibited by AT1 receptor blocker losartan (10 μm) but not by AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (1 μm), suggesting that Ang II induces Syk phosphorylation through AT1 receptor in VSMC (Fig. 1D).Piceatannol Treatment or Transfection of VSMC with DN Syk Plasmid Inhibits Ang II-induced Syk Phosphorylation—To determine the effect of Syk inhibitor piceatannol (22Raeder E.M. Mansfield P.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Shayman J.A. Boxer L.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6785-6793PubMed Google Scholar) on Ang II-induced Syk phosphorylation, rat VSMC were pretreated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of piceatannol (10 and 20 μm) before exposure with Ang II (200 nm) for 5 min. Piceatannol at 20 μm blocked Ang II-induced phosphorylation of Syk (supplemental Fig. S1A). Ang II also increased the Syk activity, as measured by increased phosphorylation of MBP by Syk, immunoprecipitated from VSMC treated with Ang II (200 nm for 5 min). Ang II-induced increase in Syk activity was reduced by pretreatment with piceatannol (20 μm, 30 min) (supplemental Fig. S1B). To further assess the effect of Ang II on Syk phosphorylation, we transiently transfected 60–70% confluent quiescent VSMC with EV, WT, or DN Syk plasmid for 48 h using Effectene reagent, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2A, transient transfection of VSMC with DN Syk but not EV or WT Syk plasmid significantly diminished Ang II-induced Syk phosphorylation. To determine the efficiency of transfection, the cells were co-transfected with GFP-expressing plasmid along the vectors, subjected to Western blot, and probed with GFP polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). Ang II-induced Syk activity was also diminished in VSMC transfected with DN Syk, but not EV or WT Syk plasmid, as determined by in vitro kinase assay by measuring the phosphorylation of MBP (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2DN but not the WT Syk mutant inhibits Ang II-induced phosphorylation and activity of Syk in rat VSMC. Subconfluent VSMC were transfected with EV, WT, and DN Syk mutants or its vehicle for 48 h and then treated with Ang II (200 nm) for 5 min (n = 6). Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection of VSMC with GFP carrying plasmid along with each EV and Syk mutant plasmids (A, upper panel, lowest blot). A, equal amounts of protein from each cell lysates were used for SDS-PAGE, and p-Syk and Syk bands were detected, and their density was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The upper panel is a representative blot, and the lower panel is the ratio of densitometric analysis of p-Syk/Syk and is presented as in Fig. 1. B, transfected VSMC with EV, WT, or DN Syk mutants after 48 h were treated with Ang II (200 nm) for 5 min (n = 3). The cells were lysed, Syk was immunoprecipitated with Syk antibody, and equal amounts of protein were used for measuring its activity by in vitro kinase assay using MBP as the substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation of MBP was determined by incorporation of 32P by autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the upper panel is a representative autoradiogram, and the lower panel is the densitometric analysis of autoradiograms. Values are the mean ± S.E. The asterisk denotes a value significantly different from corresponding value obtained in the absence of Ang II (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ang II-induced Syk Phosphorylation Is Dependent upon Both Extra- and Intracellular Ca2+—Ang II is known to cause a biphasic [Ca2+]i response, an initial transient phase mediated by [Ca2+]i mobilization from intracellular stores, and a sustained phase caused by influx of extracellular [Ca2+]i (28Cirillo M. Quinn S.J. Canessa M.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Touyz R.M. Wu X.H. He G. Park J.B. Chen X. Vacher J. Rajapurohitam V. Schiffrin E.L. J. Hypertens. 2001; 19: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of extra- and intracellular [Ca2+]i to Ang II-induced Syk phosphorylation, we examined the effect of extracellular Ca2+ depletion, Ca2+ chelator (EGTA, 1 mm), and intracellular Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM, 20 μm), respectively. Extracellular Ca2+ was depleted by replacing Ca2+-containing M-199 medium (1.8 mm) with the Ca2+-free Hanks'-buffered saline solution, and VSMC were exposed to Ang II (200 nm) for 5 min. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ abolished Ang II-induced Syk phosphorylation, which was reversed by adding exogenous CaCl2 (1.8 mm) (Fig. 3A). In addition, treatment of VSMC with EGTA (1 mm) for 30 min significantly decreased phosphorylation of Syk (Fig. 3B). Because intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM also blocked Syk phosphorylation elicited by Ang II (Fig. 3C), it appears that increased levels of cytosolic [Ca2+]i caused by influx of extracellular Ca2+ promotes Syk phosphorylation.FIGURE 3Ang II-induced phosphorylation of Syk is dependent on extra- and intra"
https://openalex.org/W2084854467,"Mannan-binding protein (MBP) is a C-type mammalian lectin specific for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. MBP is mainly synthesized in the liver and occurs naturally in two forms, serum MBP (S-MBP) and intracellular MBP (I-MBP). S-MBP activates complement in association with MBP-associated serine proteases via the lectin pathway. Despite our previous study (Mori, K., Kawasaki, T., and Yamashina, I. (1984) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 232, 223-233), the subcellular localization of I-MBP and its functional implication have not been clarified yet. Here, as an extension of our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the expression of human MBP cDNA reproduces native MBP differentiation of S-MBP and I-MBP in human hepatoma cells. I-MBP shows distinct accumulation in cytoplasmic granules, and is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in COPII vesicle-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport. However, the subcellular localization of either a mutant (C236S/C244S) I-MBP, which lacks carbohydrate-binding activity, or the wild-type I-MBP in tunicamycin-treated cells shows an equally diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting that the unique accumulation of I-MBP in the ER and COPII vesicles is mediated by an N-glycan-lectin interaction. Furthermore, the binding of I-MBP with glycoprotein intermediates occurs in the ER, which is carbohydrate- and pH-dependent, and is affected by glucose-trimmed high-mannose-type oligosaccharides. These results strongly indicate that I-MBP may function as a cargo transport lectin facilitating ER-to-Golgi traffic in glycoprotein quality control. Mannan-binding protein (MBP) is a C-type mammalian lectin specific for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. MBP is mainly synthesized in the liver and occurs naturally in two forms, serum MBP (S-MBP) and intracellular MBP (I-MBP). S-MBP activates complement in association with MBP-associated serine proteases via the lectin pathway. Despite our previous study (Mori, K., Kawasaki, T., and Yamashina, I. (1984) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 232, 223-233), the subcellular localization of I-MBP and its functional implication have not been clarified yet. Here, as an extension of our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the expression of human MBP cDNA reproduces native MBP differentiation of S-MBP and I-MBP in human hepatoma cells. I-MBP shows distinct accumulation in cytoplasmic granules, and is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in COPII vesicle-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport. However, the subcellular localization of either a mutant (C236S/C244S) I-MBP, which lacks carbohydrate-binding activity, or the wild-type I-MBP in tunicamycin-treated cells shows an equally diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting that the unique accumulation of I-MBP in the ER and COPII vesicles is mediated by an N-glycan-lectin interaction.

These results strongly indicate that I-MBP may function as a cargo transport lectin facilitating ER-to-Golgi traffic in glycoprotein quality control.

Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1983; 94: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because its discovery as a vital serum component associated with innate immunity, this lectin has been regarded as a multifunctional protein. MBP occurs naturally in two forms, secretory serum MBP (S-MBP) and intracellular MBP, which is termed I-MBP in this study and was called liver MBP (L-MBP) in our previous studies (2Mori K. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 232: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Mori K. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Ma Y. Shida H. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Human S-MBP and I-MBP are mainly synthesized in the liver and translated from a single form of mRNA. Both S-MBP and I-MBP are homooligomers composed of 32-kDa subunits. Each subunit has an NH2-terminal region containing cysteines involved in interchain disulfide bond formation, a collagen-like domain containing hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine residues, and a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with an amino acid sequence highly homologous to those of other C-type lectins (5Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CRD is specific for high-mannose oligosaccharide structures on exogenous and endogenous ligands, whereas the collagen-like domain is believed to be responsible for interactions with other effector proteins involved in host defense. S-MBP activates complement through interaction with three novel MBP-associated serine proteases, which is called the lectin pathway (6Fujita H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Furthermore, S-MBP was shown to exhibit novel cytotoxic activity toward some in vivo colorectal carcinoma cell experiments, which we proposed to term MBP-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (4Ma Y. Shida H. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Ma Y. Uemura K. Oka S. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the subcellular localization and physiological significance of I-MBP. Recently, the functions of glycoprotein glycan chains in protein quality control have been attracting more attention, high-mannose-type oligosaccharides especially having been shown to play important roles in this process (8Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 9Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Glycosylation with an asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides is a co-translational process that occurs in the ER. High-mannose-type oligosaccharides, presumably representing nascent core-glycosylated proteins, are subsequently transferred to the Golgi apparatus, where multiple processing reactions occur to produce more differentiated oligosaccharides, i.e. complex-type and hybrid-type oligosaccharides, followed by targeting to the respective destinations, i.e. lysosomes, various membranes, and the extracellular milieu (10Hauri H. Appenzeller C. Kuhn F. Nufer O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized secretory glycoproteins must undergo a complex series of events that results in their correct folding, quality control, and ongoing sorting along the secretory pathway (9Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Several intracellular proteins, such as lectins, chaperones, and glycan-processing enzymes, are involved in glycoprotein quality control, including calnexin/calreticulin, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, cargo receptors (ERGIC-53 and VIP36), mannose-like proteins (EDEM and Htm1p), and ubiquitin ligase (Fbs) (11Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). All of them are thought to recognize high-mannose-type glycans similar to I-MBP with subtly different structures, although the precise specificities have yet to be clarified. This prompted us to investigate whether I-MBP is also involved in glycoprotein quality control. In previous studies, we isolated and characterized MBP ligands from rat liver and primary cultured hepatocytes by affinity chromatography and showed that the carbohydrate portion consisted of high-mannose-type oligosaccharides, Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 (3Mori K. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we inferred that the possible function of I-MBP may be associated with the intracellular transport of glycoproteins and quality control in the ER. In this study, we have demonstrated that the expression of human MBP cDNA reproduces the native MBP differentiation of S-MBP and I-MBP depending on the different post-translational modifications in human hepatoma cell lines, and have also determined that I-MBP molecules accumulate predominantly as punctate structures in the ER and ER-to-Golgi COPII vesicles. Interestingly, this unique localization profile seems to depend on the carbohydrate binding activity of the lectin and also on the presence of endogenous carbohydrate ligands in the ER network system. Moreover, we have detected the interaction of I-MBP with processing high-mannose-type oligosaccharides on a lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) in the ER and on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein gp120 in the cytoplasm. These results suggested that I-MBP, as a putative cargo transport intracellular lectin, is associated with the intracellular transport and sorting of some glycoproteins through recognizing processing high-mannose-type oligosaccharides on them.

Anti-Sec 13 pAb was kindly provided by Dr. Yoshio Misumi (School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan). All Alexa-conjugated and horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Biotin-labeled Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, Man9GlcNAc2, and Man8GlcNAc2 (isomer B) were prepared from corresponding oligosaccharide-glycine conjugates (12Totani K. Ihara Y. Matsuo I. Koshino H. Ito Y. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). [35S]Met-[35S]Cys was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

All chemicals for gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were supplied by ATTO (Tokyo, Japan) and Bio-Rad. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of Expression Vectors—HIV envelope protein gp120 and wild-type and point mutation human MBPs were modulated with enhanced red fluorescent protein (pDsRed2-N1) and green fluorescent protein (pEGFP), respectively, from Clontech. The gp120 or MBP is located on the NH2-terminal of the fluorescent protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out based on PCR, followed by subsequent sequencing to confirm the desired sequences. The point mutation MBP construct with a cytoplasmic tail CRD was mutated to C236S/C244S in pEGFP, and is termed MBP(C236S/C244S) in this study. It lacks carbohydrate binding capacity, which results in loss of lectin activity. Cell Culture and Treatment with N-Glycosylation Inhibitors—Human hepatoma cell lines, HuH7 and HLF, and human cervix and kidney epithelial cell lines, HeLa and HEK293, were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard tissue culture conditions. HuH7 and HLF cells stably expressing the wild-type and mutant (C236S/C244S) MBP-GFP fusion proteins, HIV gp120 envelop protein-RFP fusion protein, and both MBP-GFP and gp120 fusion proteins were maintained in the presence of 1 mg/ml of G418 sulfate. Fig. 4B shows a schematic representation of the N-linked carbohydrate processing pathway in the ER and demonstrates the specific sites of action of the inhibitors used in this study. N-Linked carbohydrate processing inhibitors were used at optimum concentrations, as described previously (13Ma B.Y. Mikolajczak S.A. Yoshida T. Yoshida R. Kelvin D.J. Ochi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar): CST and DMJ (1 mm) and TM (1 μg/ml). Cells were treated with the inhibitors for 24 h at 37 °C prior to transfection. After transfection, the cells were cultured in the presence of inhibitors again for 24 h under the same conditions prior to harvesting for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Confocal Laser Scan Microscopic Study—All experiments were carried out on two-well chamber glass slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). To determine the subcellular localization of the wild-type and point mutation I-MBPs and the interaction of I-MBPs with gp120 in the cells, GFP fusion proteins encoding the wild-type or mutant (C236S/C244S) MBP and RFP fusion protein encoding the gp120 were transfected into HeLa, HuH7, and HLF cells, respectively, with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The cells were subsequently incubated overnight at 37 °C and monitored by laser confocal microscopy (FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For double immunofluorescence, the transfected cells were stained with anti-organelle marker proteins followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The double stably transfected HLF cells were visualized by laser confocal microscopy for the colocalization. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Cryo-ultramicrotomy and immunogold staining were followed as described previously (14Yamamoto A. Otsu H. Yoshimori T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1991; 16: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min. Fixed cells were processed for ultrathin cryosectioning. Frozen sections were incubated with anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG coupled with 10-nm gold particles. Stained sections were negatively stained, embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (15Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and examined under a Hitachi H7600 electron microscope. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions of HLF cells stably expressing the wild-type and mutant (C236S/C244S) MBP-GFPs were fractionated by OptiPrep Density Gradient Media centrifugation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Norway). Briefly, the cells in two confluent 75-cm2 flasks were resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer (comprising 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose and protease inhibitors), and then homogenized by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer followed by 5-10 passages through a 27-gauge needle to obtain about 95% broken cells. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer. The resuspended pellet was loaded onto the top of a linear 5-30% (w/v) Nycodenz gradient. After centrifugation at 126,000 × g for 30 min (model MLS-50 rotor; Beckman Max-E Ultracentrifuge, Fullerton, CA), 13 fractions were collected, and organelle marker proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with specific monoclonal GFP antibodies, respectively. To separate the membrane and cytosol fractions of the ER and Golgi, the ER fractions (numbers 6-10) and Golgi fractions (numbers 1-5) of the wild-type and mutant I-MBP-GFPs were collected and incubated with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.0, to extract soluble proteins from the lumen before collecting membranes, followed by ultracentrifugation at 126,000 × g. The pellet and soluble fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with GFP antibodies. Chemical Cross-linking—All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline and cross-linking buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm CaCl2), and then incubated for 30 min with 1 mm DSP (Pierce) for cross-linking on a rocking platform. The reaction was quenched by rinsing the cells with 50 mm ethanolamine in the cross-linking buffer, followed by two incubations, 15 min each, in the same ethanolamine buffer. Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase Experiment—Monolayer cultures of HLF-gp120-RFP stable transfectant cells followed transfecting wild-type or mutant (C236S/C244S) MBP-GFP, and wild-type and mutant (C236S/C244S) HLF-MBP-GFP stable transfectant cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine (Met)- and cysteine (Cys)-free MEM prior to labeling, respectively. Incorporation was initiated with fresh Met- and Cys-free MEM to which [35S]Met and [35S]Cys had been added. For pulse-chase experiments, cells plated into 25-cm2 flasks were labeled for 1 h. The pulse was terminated by removal of the [35S]Met- and [35S]Cys-containing medium and washing with MEM, followed by a chase of varying length in the presence of unlabeled 1 mm Met and 1 mm Cys. The medium was collected and concentrated, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. S- and I-MBP-GFP and gp120-RFP were immunoprecipitated from the concentrated medium and Nonidet P-40-solubilized cells with mAb against GFP and pAb against gp120, respectively. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on a 5-20% Tris-HCl gradient gel (ATTO) under reducing conditions, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane being analyzed with a BAS 2500 image analyzer (FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan) or Typhoon 9400 (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For the immunoprecipitation of complexes of I-MBP-FGP and glycoproteins (e.g. LAMP-1, gp120, etc.), I-MBP-GFP was immunoprecipitated from 1% Nonidet P-40-solubilized cells with mAb against MBP or pAb against GFP in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 5-20% Tris-HCl gradient gel (ATTO) under reducing conditions, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with primary anti-LAMP-1, BiP, gp120, MBP, or GFP antibodies followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescent method (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Pierce). Bands were visualized with a Fuji LAS 3000 (FUJIFILM). Carbohydrate-binding Assay of Wild-type and Mutant I-MBPs—A binding assay for MBP was described previously (4Ma Y. Shida H. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding buffer containing a wild-type or mutant I-MBP-GFP extract of stable transfected HLF cells was incubated with mannan-Sepharose 4B beads in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the bound proteins were collected and eluted with elution buffer containing 4 mm EDTA. The eluted proteins were resolved on a 5-20% Tris-HCl gradient gel (ATTO) under reduced or unreduced conditions and then detected by immunoblotting with anti-GFP mAb. Solid Phase Binding Assay Based on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—The affinity between MBP and Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 or Man9GlcNAc2 was measured with a BIAcore X instrument (BIACORE). Biotin-labeled Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, Man9GlcNAc2, and Man8GlcNAc2 (isomer B) were covalently immobilized on a sensor chips SA by the biotin-streptavidin coupling method, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C and with a flow rate of 20 μl/min for both the association and dissociation phases in HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.0) supplied by the manufacturer. The interaction was monitored as the change in the SPR response. The association and dissociation rate constants, ka and kd, were generated from the association and dissociation curves obtained in the BIAcore experiments by nonlinear fitting of the primary sensorgram data using BIAevaluation 3.0 software. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD was determined from the ratio of the two rate constants (kd/ka). NH2-terminal Sequencing—The recombinant wild-type and mutant (C236S/C244S) I-MBP-GFPs expressed in stably transfected HLF cells were purified by affinity chromatography on a Sepharose 4B-mannan column as described previously (4Ma Y. Shida H. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the recombinant I-MBP-GFPs were determined by BIOSUMS Co., Ltd. (Shiga, Japan). Subcellular Localization of I-MBP in the ER—To investigate the subcellular localization of I-MBP, we first expressed GFP-tagged human MBP in human hepatoma HLF cells. The GFP tag just showed equally diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distributions within cells (data not shown). I-MBP-GFP showed distinct accumulation in cytoplasmic granules, and revealed a pattern of vesicular structures (Fig. 1A, left panels). Although these structures can be found throughout a cell, they are concentrated in the perinuclear region. The two major subcellular compartments in the perinuclear region are the ER and Golgi apparatus. To further identify the subcellular compartment of I-MBP accumulation, multiple markers were used. Double staining of I-MBP and ER- or Golgi-associated protein markers indeed revealed a high degree of co-localization of these two proteins in the ER and a low degree in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1B, right panels). However, I-MBP accumulation did not appear to be co-localized directly with mitochondrial and lysosomal markers (data not shown). To verify the immunofluorescent staining of I-MBP, electron microscopy involving immunogold labeling of frozen sections of fixed cells was performed. Immunogold labeling of I-MBP-GFP can be found within the ER and ERGIC, and around the Golgi stacks with low expression (Fig. 1C), and is particularly enriched in the ER lumen with high expression (Fig. 1D) at the ultrastructural level in the same cell. Therefore, consistent with the results obtained at the laser confocal microscopy level, I-MBP is abundant in the ER, distributed less in the ERGIC and Golgi, and not present at all in the mitochondria. I-MBP Accumulates at ER Exit Sites and ER-to-Golgi Traffic Vesicles—Next, we tried to determine the possible functional significance of I-MBP predominantly localized in the ER. Because COPII, ER-to-Golgi traffic vesicles bearing anterograde-targeted cargos, and COPI, Golgi-to-ER traffic vesicles bearing retrograde-targeted cargos, are two major transport vesicles present around the perinuclear region, it was likely that I-MBP was localized to these two compartments and associated with ER-to-Golgi transport. This consideration led us to hypothesize that I-MBP could be associated with ER-to-Golgi transport of glycoproteins via anterograde and retrograde traffic vesicles. Therefore, we co-stained I-MBP with various COP-associated marker proteins to more functionally and specifically elucidate the accumulation pattern of I-MBP in these compartments. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the subcellular localization of I-MBP revealed a high degree of co-localization in COPII and less in COPI transport vesicles. As mentioned above, the majority of I-MBP-GFP fluorescence accumulated as bright punctate structures throughout the ER network, although more diffuse fluorescence of I-MBP also was observed in the ER network. ER exit sites are defined by the presence of budding COPII vesicles, so COPII components, such as Sec 13 and Sec 24D, are well characterized markers of these structures (16Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, double staining of I-MBP with Sec 13 indicated that generally the accumulated I-MBP-GFP fluorescence overlapped with similar punctate structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that I-MBP accumulates at ER exit sites and ER-to-Golgi COPII vesicles, suggesting that it may be associated with ER-to-Golgi transport of glycoproteins via anterograde traffic. Newly Synthesized LAMP-1 Interacts with I-MBP—With respect to the subcellular localization of I-MBP described above, it is possible to speculate that I-MBP may serve as a cargo transport lectin for the trafficking of biosynthetic intermediates of some glycoproteins with high-mannose-type oligosaccharides from the ER-to-Golgi apparatus. Recently, an effort to isolate the endogenous ligands (or the cargo recognition components) of MBP from mouse tissues through affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein), 5M. Nonaka, B. Y. Ma, Nana Kawasaki, M. Hirano, Nobuko Kawasaki, and T. Kawasaki, unpublished data. which is extensively glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides. To determine whether LAMP-1, as a cargo recognition component of I-MBP, is conserved in humans, we examined the interaction of the I-MBP with the endogenous LAMP-1 using MBP-GFP-transfected HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, immunoblotting following in situ cross-linking, indeed demonstrated the presence of an I-MBP-LAMP-1 complex in the immunoprecipitates, suggesting the interaction of I-MBP with LAMP-1 occurred in the same subcellular compartment. Interestingly, BiP (immunoglobulin-binding protein), which is known as a molecular chaperone that interacts transiently with non-native substrates to enhance and correct their folding in the ER, was found in the I-MBP-LAMP-1 complex (Fig. 3C). The action of BiP involves multiple cycles of association and dissociation, and requires Ca2+ and ATP, and it interacts optimally with hydrophobic peptides, which are normally buried in the hydrophobic core of properly folded proteins (17Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). These results suggest that I-MBP undergoes a specific interaction with newly synthesized LAMP-1 participating in the folding in the ER. There is the possibility that BiP plays a pivotal role in the ER-to-Golgi transport of selected glycoproteins mediated by I-MBP. Effects of Calcium and N-Glycosylation Inhibitor Treatment on the I-MBP/LAMP-1 Interaction—Because it is well known that C-type lectin I-MBP requires Ca2+ for carbohydrate binding, and the ER has a high Ca2+ concentration, we examined whether the binding of I-MBP to LAMP-1 in the ER is Ca2+-dependent. MBP-GFP-transfected HEK293 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of the ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. As shown in Fig. 4A, thapsigargin efficiently prevented the I-MBP-LAMP-1 interaction, suggesting that the binding of I-MBP with the biosynthetic glycoprotein intermediates in the ER is Ca2+-dependent and is probably mediated by the carbohydrate binding activity of I-MBP. We next tried to corroborate the roles of glucose trimming and mannose trimming in the physiological interaction between I-MBP and N-glycosylated cargos by using N-glycosylation inhibitor TM, glucosidase inhibitor CST, or mannosidase inhibitor DMJ (see Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, when cells were treated with TM, the LAMP-1 band could not be visualized, indicating that non-glycosylated LAMP-1 could no longer interact with I-MBP. Meanwhile, when the cells were treated with CST, the inhibitor slightly reduced the efficiency of the I-MBP-LAMP-1 interaction, suggesting that glucose trimming in the I-MBP-cargo interaction may not be essential and that the presence of glucose partly prevents optimal binding. However, when the cells were treated with the mannose trimming inhibitor DMJ, it enhanced the efficiency of the I-MBP/LAMP-1 interaction, suggesting that binding to high-mannose-type oligosaccharides is more efficient than that to glucosylated high-mannose-type oligosaccharides, and that the mannose residues are required in cargo binding. Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of I-MBP with precursory LAMP-1, as one of the biosynthetic intermediates of glycosylated cargos, that occurs in the ER is carbohydrate- and Ca2+-dependent, and is also affected by both untrimmed and trimmed glucose residues.

https://openalex.org/W2047273632,"Short ClC3 isoform (sClC3) functions as a volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying anion channel (VSOAC) in some cell types. In previous studies, we have shown that the hypotonic activation of sClC3 is linked to cell swelling-mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that the cytosolic tails of sClC3 bind to actin directly and that binding modulates the hypotonic activation of the channel. Co-sedimentation assays in vitro demonstrated a strong binding between the glutathione S-transferase-fused cytosolic C terminus of sClC3 (GST-sClC3-CT) to filamentous actin (F-actin) but not to globular monomeric actin (G-actin). The GST-fused N terminus (GST-sClC3-NT) exhibited low binding affinity to both G- and F-actin. Co-sedimentation experiments with progressively truncated GST-sClC3-CT indicated that the F-actin binding region is located between amino acids 690 and 760 of sClC3. Two synthetic peptides mapping basic clusters of the cytosolic sClC3-CT (CTP2, isoleucine 716 to leucine 734; and CTP3, proline 688 to proline 709) prevented binding of GST-sClC3-CT to F-actin in vitro. Dialysis into NIH/3T3 cells of these two peptides (but not of synthetic peptide CTP1 (isoleucine 737 to glutamine 748)) reduced the maximal current density by 60 and 38%, respectively. Based on these results, we have concluded that, by direct interaction with subcortical actin filaments, sClC3 contributes to the hypotonic stress-induced VSOACs in NIH/3T3 cells. Short ClC3 isoform (sClC3) functions as a volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying anion channel (VSOAC) in some cell types. In previous studies, we have shown that the hypotonic activation of sClC3 is linked to cell swelling-mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that the cytosolic tails of sClC3 bind to actin directly and that binding modulates the hypotonic activation of the channel. Co-sedimentation assays in vitro demonstrated a strong binding between the glutathione S-transferase-fused cytosolic C terminus of sClC3 (GST-sClC3-CT) to filamentous actin (F-actin) but not to globular monomeric actin (G-actin). The GST-fused N terminus (GST-sClC3-NT) exhibited low binding affinity to both G- and F-actin. Co-sedimentation experiments with progressively truncated GST-sClC3-CT indicated that the F-actin binding region is located between amino acids 690 and 760 of sClC3. Two synthetic peptides mapping basic clusters of the cytosolic sClC3-CT (CTP2, isoleucine 716 to leucine 734; and CTP3, proline 688 to proline 709) prevented binding of GST-sClC3-CT to F-actin in vitro. Dialysis into NIH/3T3 cells of these two peptides (but not of synthetic peptide CTP1 (isoleucine 737 to glutamine 748)) reduced the maximal current density by 60 and 38%, respectively. Based on these results, we have concluded that, by direct interaction with subcortical actin filaments, sClC3 contributes to the hypotonic stress-induced VSOACs in NIH/3T3 cells. Cell volume regulation is a complex and well coordinated process that requires activation of ion transporters. The family of voltage-regulated chloride channels includes at least two hypotonic cell swelling-sensitive channels, ClC2 and sClC3, whose activation contributes to the maintenance of physiological cell volume in Xenopus oocytes and NIH/3T3 cells (1Furukawa T.

Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These channels have different biophysical properties; ClC2 exhibits inward rectification, whereas sClC3 exhibits outward rectification (2Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B.

Both channels form homo- or heterodimers that are required for a functional double-barreled configuration (6Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Weinreich F. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The cytosolic N termini play key roles in the activation of both channels, whereas N-terminal truncations produce constitutively active channels in isotonic environment, no longer responsive to hypotonic stress (9Grunder S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 10Rossow C.F. Duan D. Hatton W.J. Britton F. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2006; 187: 5-19Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The regulatory role of the N termini may depend on phosphorylation, as activation of protein kinase C (PKC) 2The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PASMC, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; pA/pF, picoamp(s)/picofarad(s); CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase. by phorbol esters causes inactivation of both channels in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons (11Staley K.

(Lond.). 2000; 523: 705-717Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other protein kinases can also regulate these channels. Phosphorylation by p34cdc2/cyclin B attenuates the ClC2 current and supports progression through the cell cycle of rabbit ClC2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes (14Furukawa T. Ogura T. Zheng Y.J. Tsuchiya H. Nakaya H. Katayama Y. Inagaki N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 883-893Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in NIH/3T3 cells, HEK293 and NRK-49F cells (15Zheng Y.J. Furukawa T.

Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H533-H544Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) may cause activation of sClC3 in tsA and PASMCs, respectively. Finally, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton modulates the activation of ClC2 in Xenopus oocytes (18Ahmed N. Ramjeesingh M. Wong S. Varga A. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and of sClC3 in PASMCs (19Wang G.X. Dai Y.P. Bongalon S. Hatton W.J. Murray K. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 208: 15-26Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated a link between PKC and the activation of sClC3. PKC was shown to provide an inhibitory signal required for maintenance of inactive sClC3 in NIH/3T3 cells (12Duan D. Cowley S. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Studies in PASMCs have expanded on these observations and have corroborated the PKC requirement for activation of VSOAC/sClC3 by showing that dialysis into patched cells of a specific PKC inhibitory peptide activates chloride current under isotonic conditions (20Zhong J. Wang G.X. Hatton W.J. Yamboliev I.A. Walsh M.P. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1627-C1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To understand how PKC regulates VSOAC in intact cells, we have previously carried out experiments that show co-localization of PKC and sClC3 at the surface membrane of resting cells, but dissociation of PKC localization from sClC3 in hypotonically swollen cells (19Wang G.X. Dai Y.P. Bongalon S. Hatton W.J. Murray K. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 208: 15-26Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated further that translocation of PKC to perinuclear sites coincides with a hypotonic swelling-induced dissociation of peripheral actin filaments (19Wang G.X. Dai Y.P. Bongalon S. Hatton W.J. Murray K. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 208: 15-26Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Together, these studies establish PKC as a regulatory molecule for the activation of sClC3 current during hypotonic stress. Furthermore, these studies point to the loss of binding sites for active PKC (RACK) in the vicinity of membrane chloride channels as a mechanism for removal of the inhibitory effect of PKC on VSOAC/sClC3. However, these studies do not rule out the possibility that actin may mediate a mechanical PKC-independent component for activation of sClC3. In the present study, we have addressed this possibility by testing the hypothesis that the cytosolic tails of sClC3 bind to actin directly and that this binding modulates the hypotonic activation of the channel. Our results demonstrate that the cytosolic C terminus of sClC3 binds to filamentous actin (F-actin) and that inhibition of this interaction leads to a reduced hypotonic activation of sClC3. These results suggest that hypotonic activation of sClC3 depends at least partially on direct interactions with proximal actin filaments. Production of GST-fused Cytosolic Tails of Human Short sClC3—The cytosolic N-terminal tail of human short sClC3 without the start codon (sClC3-NT, nucleotides 4–207) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with primers that included 5′-BamHI and 3′-XhoI cloning sites. The PCR product was ligated into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The whole cytosolic C terminus of sClC3 (sClC3-CT, nucleotides 1672–2283) was amplified and cloned into pGEX-4T-3 as well. Cloning was verified by nucleotide sequencing. GST fusion peptides (i.e. GST, GST-sClC3-NT, and GST-sClC3-CT) were expressed in BL21 cells and purified by column chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix and 10 mm reduced glutathione as the elution buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Fig. 1 demonstrates successful cloning and expression and good quality of GST fusion peptides for actin binding assays. Although the cytosolic N terminus of sClC3 associated with F-actin as well, the binding of the cytosolic C terminus was more prominent. To identify regions that mediate binding to F-actin, we PCR-amplified progressively truncated C-terminal peptides and ligated them into pGEX-4T-3 (Fig. 2). GST fusion peptides were expressed in BL21 cells and purified by column chromatography as described in the previous paragraph. Immunoblot analysis verified the molecular size and the purity of the produced peptides for binding experiments. Binding of GST-sClC3-NT and GST-sClC3-CT to F-actin (Sedimentation Assay)—For this assay, we used an actin-binding protein Biochem kit (catalogue number BK001; Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) and followed the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, F-actin stock solution (23 μm) was mixed with GST-sClC3-NT or -CT fusion peptides that were precleared by centrifugation (200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C). The reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 1 h, and after a second centrifugation (150,000 × g for 1 h at 22 °C), pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Sypro Ruby, a protein-specific stain with high sensitivity (1–10 ng of total protein) and a linear range that extends over three orders of magnitude (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against N-terminal (amino acids 1–14, dilution 1:500) or C-terminal (amino acids 670–687, dilution 1:1000) epitopes of sClC3 (21Hatton W.J. Yamboliev I.A. Hume J.R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 242cGoogle Scholar). To assess the results, immunoreactive bands of GST fusion peptides pelleted in the absence of F-actin (negative controls) were subtracted from immunoreactive bands of GST fusion peptides pelleted in complex with F-actin. Other control reactions tested the binding of recombinant GST with F-actin to assess whether association was mediated by the GST-region of the fusion peptides. Sedimentation Assays with Inhibitory Peptides—Synthetic inhibitory peptides were used to identify the amino acid domains of the cytosolic C terminus of sClC3 that mediate association with F-actin. Sedimentation analyses using progressively truncated C termini demonstrated that domains involved in the binding to F-actin reside in the remote 90 amino acids of the C terminus (Fig. 3). Peptides complementary to three basic amino acid clusters (CTP1, Ile737-Gln748; CTP2, Ile716-Leu734; and CTP3, Pro688–Pro709) were synthesized (Genotide Biosciences, LLC, Lawrence, KS) and added into binding reactions at concentrations ranging between 3 and 100 μm. The sedimentation assay was carried out and quantified as described in the previous section. Binding of GST-sClC3-NT and -CT to G-actin (Pulldown Assay)—G-actin solutions with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 30 μm were incubated at room temperature with fixed concentrations of GST, GST-sClC3-NT, or GST-sClC3-CT peptides immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 2.6 mm KCl, and 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then mixed with Laemmli buffer and boiled. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Sypro Ruby or transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with a polyclonal actin antibody (dilution 1:1000; Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Western Immunoblot Analysis—Western immunoblot analyses were carried out essentially as described previously (19Wang G.X. Dai Y.P. Bongalon S. Hatton W.J. Murray K. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 208: 15-26Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in LI-COR blocking buffer (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE) for 30 min prior to protein labeling with primary antibodies diluted in LI-COR blocking buffer as well. Secondary antibodies coupled to infrared fluorescent markers with emission wavelengths of 800 nm (IR800, Rockland Immunochemicals) or 680 nm (Alexa Fluor 680, Molecular Probes) were diluted 1:100,000 in LI-COR buffer. Double-color fluorescent images were obtained with an Odyssey scanner and quantified with the Odyssey software version 2.0 (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE). Electrophysiology—Membrane currents of cultured NIH/3T3 cells were measured using a whole cell voltage clamp technique as previously described (17Wang G.X. McCrudden C. Day Y.P. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H533-H544Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Wang G.X. Dai Y.P. Bongalon S. Hatton W.J. Murray K. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 208: 15-26Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All bath and pipette solutions were chosen to facilitate VSOAC current recording. Activation of VSOAC was induced using a hypotonic solution (250 mosm) containing (in mm); 125 NaCl, 2.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2.5 CaCl2, pH 7.2 (22Britton F.C. Wang G.L. Huang Z.M. Ye L. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. Duan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25871-25880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Osmolarity was adjusted with d-mannitol to give isotonic (310 mosm) and hypertonic (350 mosm) bath solutions. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES, 2 EGTA, and 135 N-methyl-d-glutamine (pH 7.2, 295 mosm). Changes in membrane currents were recorded by application of repetitive voltage clamp steps to ±80 mV every 30 s from a holding potential of –40 mV. To test whether native sClC3 contributes to VSOAC, we dialyzed into patched NIH/3T3 cells either antibody raised against an antigen mapping the C-terminal amino acids 670–687 of guinea pig short sClC3 (GSSRVCFAQHTPSLPAES) (21Hatton W.J. Yamboliev I.A. Hume J.R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 242cGoogle Scholar) or antigen-preabsorbed antibody prepared by overnight incubation of antigen peptide and antibody in a molar ratio of 10:1 (23Wang G.X. Hatton W.J. Wang G.L. Zhong J. Yamboliev I.A. Duan D. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1453-H1463Google Scholar). sClC3-CT antibody or antigen-preabsorbed antibody was added to the pipette solution at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Each cell was dialyzed in isotonic solution for 10 min followed by hypotonic solution until the maximal currents were elicited and then in hypertonic solution (23Wang G.X. Hatton W.J. Wang G.L. Zhong J. Yamboliev I.A. Duan D. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1453-H1463Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the sClC3 peptides CTP1, CTP2, and CTP3 on the hypotonic activation of VSOACs, patch electrodes were filled with pipette solutions supplemented with the peptide at 100 μm. Each cell was dialyzed for 12–15 min with the peptide in isotonic solution prior to exposure to hypotonic solution. All electrophysiological experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). GST-sClC3-NT and GST-sClC3-CT Exhibit Low Binding Affinity for Monomeric G-actin—To evaluate the binding efficiency of the cytosolic tails of sClC3, we first immobilized GST-sClC3-NT or -CT on glutathione-Sepharose beads and then carried out binding experiments with G-actin. The amounts of G-actin that sedimented in the pellets were used for quantification of the G-actin binding to GST-sClC3-NT or -CT. Staining with Sypro Ruby indicated that actin remained primarily in the reaction supernatants (Fig. 4, A1–C1). Staining of pellets with Sypro Ruby revealed GST (Fig. 4, A2), the GST-sClC3-NT doublets (Fig. 4, B2), and GST-sClC3-CT (Fig. 4, C2) as the major proteins associated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Immunoblotting of the pellets detected measurable amounts of actin only in the reaction with GST-sClC3-CT (Fig. 4, C3). Because actin did not sediment with GST (Fig. 4, A3), the presence of actin in the pellet is the result of its binding to sClC3-CT. GST-sClC3-CT Readily Binds to F-actin—For these experiments, we first induced actin polymerization prior to testing the binding affinity of the cytosolic N and C termini to F-actin by co-sedimentation. Staining of sedimented proteins with Sypro Ruby demonstrated that the reaction conditions enabled actin polymerization and sedimentation of actin filaments (Fig. 5, A and C, lanes 1, 2, and 4), association of F-actin with α-actinin (positive control, lanes 1), and lack of binding of GST to F-actin (negative control, lanes 2). A band corresponding to GST-sClC3-CT (52 kDa) was also visible in Sypro Ruby-stained gels (Fig. 5C), indicating that GST-sClC3-CT binds to F-actin. However, a band of sedimented GST-sClC3-NT (39 kDa) was indistinguishable due to overlap with the strong actin band (42–44 kDa) (Fig. 5A). To avoid this overlap, we transferred the reaction protein onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed them with sClC3-NT and -CT antibodies. These antibodies exhibited low cross-reactivity with actin but demonstrated strong binding of GST-sClC3-CT and a moderate binding of GST-sClC3-NT to F-actin. Because GST alone did not bind to F-actin, association was mediated by the cytosolic termini of sClC3. The results from these experiments demonstrate that the cytosolic N terminus of sClC3 has low binding affinity for both G- and F-actin; however, the C terminus exhibits higher binding affinity particularly for F-actin. Binding to F-actin Is Mediated by a Domain Localized in the Distal C Terminus of sClC3—To identify the region of sClC3-CT that mediates binging to F-actin, we carried out sedimentation experiments in which F-actin was incubated with progressively truncated C-terminal sClC3 peptides fused to GST (Fig. 2). Whereas the preparations of fusion peptides CT0, CT3, and CT4 were homogeneous, fusion peptides CT1, and to a lesser extent CT2, co-purified with other peptides with smaller molecular sizes (Fig. 6, top panel, lanes 3–6). These by-products were also recognized by the sClC3-CT antibody used in these experiments and may represent shorter fragments of GST-sClC3-CT1 or -CT2. Only the immunoreactive bands of the full-length GST-sClC3-CT peptides (Fig. 6, top bands), but not the bands of the shorter by-products, were taken into account for evaluation of binding to F-actin. Fusion peptides GST-sClC3-CT1 (lacking 30 C-terminal amino acids) and GST-sClC3-CT2 (lacking 60 C-terminal amino acids) bound to F-actin in a manner similar to the whole C-terminal tail; i.e. GST-sClC3-CT0 (Fig. 6). However, fusion peptides GST-sClC3-CT3 and -CT4, failed to associate with F-actin (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the binding of sClC3 to F-actin is mediated by regions located in the distal 60 amino acids of the cytosolic C terminus of the channel. Synthetic Inhibitory Peptides CTP1, CTP2, and CTP3 Differ in Their Ability to Inhibit Binding between GST-sClC3-CT0 and F-actin—To further characterize the binding of the C terminus of sClC3 with F-actin, we synthesized synthetic peptides, mapping basic clusters within the distal 60 amino acids of sClC3-CT (Fig. 3). We carried out co-sedimentation assays between GST-sClC3-CT0 and F-actin in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitory peptides. CTP1 insignificantly changed the binding of GST-sClC3-CT0 to F-actin (Fig. 7, top panel and bar graph), suggesting that the basic cluster in the sequence mapped by this peptide (i.e. Ile737-Gln748) has little or no effect on the association of sClC3-CT with F-actin. Increasing concentrations of CTP2 (amino acids Ile716-Leu734) reduced the binding of GST-sClC3-CT0 by ∼60% at 100 μm (Fig. 7, second panel from the top and bar graph), whereas at the same concentration of CTP3 (amino acids Pro688–Pro709) reduced the GST-sClC3-CT0 binding to F-actin by >90% compared with controls (Fig. 7, third panel from top and bar graph). These results are consistent with the notion that binding with F-actin is mediated by the C-terminal stretch mapped by CTP2 and CTP3; i.e. between amino acids Pro688 and Leu734 of sClC3. Intracellular Dialysis of C-terminal sClC3 Antibody Inhibits Native VSOAC Currents in Cultured NIH//3T3 Cells—To test whether native sClC3 is responsible for VSOACs in cultured NIH/3T3 cells, we dialyzed cells with C-terminal sClC3 antibody (10 μg/ml) prior to exposure to hypotonic solution. The antibody dialysis caused little change in leak currents under isotonic conditions (1.89 ± 0.43) compared with control cells dialyzed with antibody-free pipette solution (0.93 ± 0.22 pA/pF) (Fig. 8B). However, the sClC3 antibody effectively decreased the maximum hypotonic stress-activated currents from 65.22 ± 9.14 pA/PF in control cells to 4.19 ± 0.14 (Fig. 8). To test whether this VSOAC inhibition was an antibody-specific event, we repeated the experiment but this time dialyzing antigen-preabsorbed antibody. Hypotonic exposure of these cells resulted in a maximal current density of 55.48 ± 4.77 pA/pF that was not significantly different from the maximal VSOAC current density of control cells dialyzed with antibody-free solution (65.22 ± 9.14 pA/pF) (Fig. 8). These results indicate that sClC3 is a molecular constituent of native VSOACs elicited by hypotonic swelling of NIH/3T3 cells. Synthetic Peptides CTP2 and CTP3 (but Not CTP1) Inhibit VSOAC Currents in Cultured NIH//3T3 Cells—To test whether association between the C terminus of sClC3 and F-actin occurs also in vivo, we examined the effect of synthetic peptides on VSOAC current activation. For this experiment, we dialyzed cells with 100 μm inhibitory peptide through the patch electrode while applying 100-ms step pulses to +80 mV from a holding potential of –40 mV every 30 s. The maximum current density in the control cells (65.22 ± 9.14 pA/pF) was significantly reduced by dialysis of CTP2 (to 40.41 ± 7.42 pA/pF) and more so by CTP3 (to 26.00 ± 5.79 pA/pF). CTP1 had no affect on VSOAC current density (Fig. 9, A and B). None of these inhibitory peptides altered the activation kinetics of VSOAC (Fig. 9C). These results also corroborate that sClC3 is at least partially responsible for the hypotonic stress-activated VSOACs in NIH/3T3 cells. Our results also suggest that the hypotonic activation of sClC3 may require interaction between the cytosolic C terminus of sClC3 and subcortical actin filaments. Although the role of the short isoform of sClC3 as a candidate protein responsible for native VSOACs has been questioned in some cell types (24Weylandt K.H. Valverde M.A. Nobles M. Raguz S. Amey J.S.

The functional role of recombinant sClC3 as a volume-regulated Cl– channel has also been confirmed in sClC3 cDNA-transfected A10 cells (5Zhou J.G. Ren J.L. Qiu Q.Y. He H. Guan Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7301-7308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that sClC3 may represent a component of a VSOAC multiprotein complex, and there may be subpopulations of native VSOACs expressed in different cell types (32Greenwood I.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 343Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have demonstrated that dialysis of three antibodies raised against different intracellular epitopes of sClC3 produces essentially the same response, inhibition of hypotonic stress-activated VSOAC in canine PASMCs and guinea pig cardiac myocytes. However, inhibition was not observed when an antibody raised against an extracellular epitope linking transmembrane domains 1 and 2 of sClC3 was dialyzed into PASMCs and cardiac myocytes (23Wang G.X. Hatton W.J. Wang G.L. Zhong J. Yamboliev I.A. Duan D. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1453-H1463Google Scholar). We have extended these studies to demonstrate that intracellular dialysis of a C-terminal antibody obliterates hypotonic stress-induced VSOAC in NIH/3T3 cells as well. Together, our previous and present results support the role of sClC3 as a molecular constituent of native VSOACs in different cell types. In the present study, we have provided biochemical evidence that the 202-amino-acid-long cytosolic C terminus of the human short sClC3 contains a previously unknown binding sequence located between amino acids proline 688 and leucine 734, which binds directly to filamentous actin in vitro. We have also provided evidence that synthetic peptides encompassing basic amino acid clusters in this region inhibit binding and sedimentation of the C terminus with actin filaments in vitro. When dialyzed in patched NIH/3T3 cells, these peptides inhibit >60% of the hypo-osmolarity-induced maximal VSOACs. Because the inhibitory peptides inhibit VSOAC by binding to the C terminus of sClC3, our results provide new evidence that the C-terminal tail is involved in the hypotonic activation of the channel. Because the inhibitory peptides bind to basic amino acids in the sClC3-CT, the association of sClC3 with F-actin is most likely electrostatic in nature. Finally, our results suggest that the interaction between the cytosolic termini of sClC3 and adjacent actin filaments represents a mechanical component in the signal transduction events leading to hypotonic activation of sClC3. Previous studies have shown that dynamic structural rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton can activate various chloride channels in different cells (18Ahmed N. Ramjeesingh M. Wong S. Varga A. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Wang G.X. Dai Y.P. Bongalon S. Hatton W.J. Murray K. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. J. Membr.

Mollard P. Garber S.S. J. Membr.

Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Actin filaments appear to be involved in the activation of at least two Cl– channels of the ClC family (ClC2 (18Ahmed N. Ramjeesingh M. Wong S. Varga A. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and sClC3 (19Wang G.X. Dai Y.P. Bongalon S. Hatton W.J. Murray K. Hume J.R. Yamboliev I.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 208: 15-26Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar)), which may be responsible for regulatory volume decrease. Although both channels are activated during hypotonic cell swelling, the expressed Cl– currents differ in their biophysical characteristics and in the way they interact with F-actin. ClC2 binds to F-actin with its cytosolic N terminus (18Ahmed N. Ramjeesingh M. Wong S. Varga A. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the sClC3 binding to F-actin occurs primarily through the C terminus. The ability of the C terminus to affect the hypotonic activation of sClC3 is consistent with previous studies in which C termini of other ClC family members modulate channel excitability and gating (36Hebeisen S. Biela A. Giese B. Muller-Newen G. Hidalgo P. Fahlke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13140-13147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Bennetts B. Rychkov G.Y. Ng H.L.

The regulatory effects of the C termini have been attributed to their 60-amino-acid-long tandem cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains. Although the functions of CBS domains are largely undefined or controversial (38Ignoul S. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1369-C1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the importance of the CBS pairs is emphasized by the correlations between mutations of these domains and Cl– channel-associated hereditary diseases, such as myotonia congenita (mutated ClC1 (39Koch M.C.

Stein V. Birkenhager R. Otto E. Hildebrandt F. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2001; 414: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar)). The cytosolic C terminus of sClC3 also contains a tandem repeat of CBS-like domains, i.e. a 60-amino-acid-long CBS1 domain (amino acids 596–656) and a 60-amino-acid-long CBS2 domain (amino acids 698–749 (GenBank™ accession number P51790). Crystal structures of a bacterial homologue predict tightly folded conformation of CBS pairs composed of two symmetrical CBS motifs arranged in an anti-parallel manner (38Ignoul S. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1369-C1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 44Scott J.W. Hawley S.A. Green K.A. Anis M. Stewart G. Scullion G.A. Norman D.G. Hardie D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). However, a variety of experimental methods have revealed only a partially folded conformation and a larger than predicted Stokes radius of a water-soluble C terminus of rat sClC3 (45Li S.J. Kawazaki M. Ogasahara K. Nakagawa A. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of sClC3 demonstrates that the actin binding domain (amino acids 685–750) overlaps with the CBS2 domain (amino acids 697–738) of sClC3. Because folding of some proteins may depend on association with binding partners (46Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), one can speculate that, by binding to the CBS2 domain, F-actin may induce intramolecular associations for ordered folding of the CBS tandem and for expression of functional sClC3 channels. By interfering with the binding of the C terminus to adjacent F-actin, inhibitory peptides may prevent normal activation of sClC3. At this time, it can only be speculated whether the interactions between sClC3 and F-actin in cultured cells has functional significance at the organ or tissue level, as no animal or human pathological condition has yet been linked to abnormalities of sClC3. However, disruption of the ClCN3 gene in mice causes severe retinal degeneration, loss of hippocampus and ileal mucosa (26Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and development of a phenotype similar to human neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (47Yoshikawa M. Uchida S. Ezaki J. Rai T. Hayama A. Kobayashi K. Kida Y. Noda M. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Marumo F. Kominami E. Sasaki S. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because interference with the binding of sClC3 to adjacent actin filaments results in activation-deficient sClC3 channels, these intermolecular interactions could underlie developmental abnormalities observed in mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a direct association of the cytosolic C terminus of human short sClC3 with subcortical actin filaments. Interaction between the two proteins is required for the activation of sClC3 by hypotonic cell swelling, whereas inhibition of this interaction produces channels with limited capacity for hypotonic activation. It remains to be tested whether mutations in the actin binding region or CBS2 domain render actin binding and/or activation-deficient sClC3 channels responsible for phenotypic and/or functional abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2117329934,"CDKN2A (encodes p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF)) deletion, which results in both Rb and p53 inactivation, is the most common chromosomal anomaly in human cancers. To precisely map the deletion breakpoints is important to understanding the molecular mechanism of genomic rearrangement and may also be useful for clinical applications. However, current methods for determining the breakpoint are either of low resolution or require the isolation of relatively pure cancer cells, which can be difficult for clinical samples that are typically contaminated with various amounts of normal host cells. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed a novel approach, designated Primer Approximation Multiplex PCR (PAMP), for enriching breakpoint sequences followed by genomic tiling array hybridization to locate the breakpoints. In a series of proof-of-concept experiments, we were able to identify cancer-derived CDKN2A genomic breakpoints when more than 99.9% of wild type genome was present in a model system. This design can be scaled up with bioinformatics support and can be applied to validate other candidate cancer-associated loci that are revealed by other more systemic but lower throughput assays."
https://openalex.org/W1988081161,"Epicutaneous immunization is a potential non-invasive technique for antigen-specific immune-modulation. Topical application of protein antigens to barrier-disrupted skin induces potent antigen-specific immunity with a strong Th2-bias. In this study, we investigate whether the autoimmune inflammatory response of chronic collagen-induced arthritis (CCIA) in DBA/1-TCR-beta Tg mice can be modified by epicutaneous immunization. We show that epicutaneous immunization with type II collagen (CII) inhibited development and progression of CCIA and, importantly, also ameliorated ongoing disease as indicated by clinical scores of disease severity, paw swelling and joints histology. Treated mice show reduced CII-driven T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production, as well as significantly lower levels of CII-specific IgG2a serum antibodies. In contrast, CII-driven IL-4 production and IgE antibody levels were increased consistent with skewing of the CII response from Th1 to Th2 in treated mice. IL-4 production in treated mice was inversely correlated with disease severity. Moreover, T cells from treated mice inhibited proliferation and IFN-gamma production by T cells from CCIA mice, suggesting induction of regulatory T cells that actively inhibit effector responses in arthritic mice. The levels of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were however not increased following epicutaneous CII treatment. Together, these results suggest that epicutaneous immunization may be used as an immune-modulating procedure to actively re-programme pathogenic Th1 responses, and could have potential as a novel specific and simple treatment for chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2084458106,"Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) is crucial for accumulation of monoamine neurotranmitters into neuronal secretory vesicles and histamine into secretory granules of the enterochromaffin-like cell in the acid-secreting gastric mucosa. Gastric VMAT2 expression is regulated by the antral hormone gastrin acting at the CCK<sub>2</sub> receptor. We demonstrate a gastrin response element <sup>–56</sup>ccgccccctc<sup>–47</sup> in the proximal VMAT2 promoter that binds in a gastrin-sensitive manner to nuclear proteins from gastric epithelial cell lines. Mutations within this sequence prevented nuclear protein binding and significantly reduced gastrin-stimulated expression of VMAT2 promoter-reporter constructs in gastric epithelial cells. In a yeast one-hybrid screen of an AR42J cell cDNA library, using the gastrin response element as bait, we identified a beta subunit of the 20 S proteasome, PSMB1, as a potential binding partner. In supershift assays, antibodies to PSMB1 and other proteasome beta subunits disrupted gastrin sensitive nuclear protein binding to the VMAT2 promoter. Moreover, RNA interference of PSMB1 significantly inhibited gastrin-mediated VMAT2 transcription. These data suggest that elements of the 20 S proteasome interact with the VMAT2 promoter to enhance G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated transcription."
