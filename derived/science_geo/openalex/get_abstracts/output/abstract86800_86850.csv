https://openalex.org/W2031331787,"The pathophysiology of autoimmune arthritis was studied by selecting and isolating lines of effector T lymphocytes from rats administered an arthritogenic dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freund's adjuvant to induce adjuvant arthritis. Irradiated rats were intravenously inoculated with a cell line characterized by proliferative reactivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and, to a lesser degree, to rat collagen type II. This produced arthritis in all the irradiated rats. Nonirradiated recipients failed to develop arthritis. However, such rats, and those recovering from cell-mediated arthritis, were resistant to subsequent attempts to induce adjuvant arthritis. Lines of T lymphocytes selected for responsiveness to other antigens had no effect. Therefore, a line of T lymphocytes responsive to bacteria or to collagen type II could either induce autoimmune arthritis or serve as an agent of vaccination against it."
https://openalex.org/W2006512810,"Human insulin produced by recombinant DNA technology is the first commercial health care product derived from this technology. Work on this product was initiated before there were federal guidelines for large-scale recombinant DNA work or commercial development of recombinant DNA products. The steps taken to facilitate acceptance of large-scale work and proof of the identity and safety of such a product are described. While basic studies in recombinant DNA technology will continue to have a profound impact on research in the life sciences, commercial applications may well be controlled by economic conditions and the availability of investment capital."
https://openalex.org/W1986949138,"We have made deletions of the HIS4 5' noncoding region in vitro and inserted these deletions into the yeast genome by transformation. Deletions that extend from -588 to -235 have no detectable effects on either promoter or regulatory functions. Deletions that extend to -138 affect promoter function, but are still regulated by the general control of amino acid biosynthesis. A deletion that extends to -136 cannot derepress HIS4 mRNA in response to the general control. This deletion removes all copies of the sequence 5'-TGACTC-3', which appears at positions -194, -182 and -138 in strains without the deletion. The importance of at least one copy of this repeat for regulation of HIS4 is shown by the reappearance of this sequence in revertants of the -136 deletion that have regained the regulatory response. The fact that deletion of this sequence leads to the inability to derepress suggests that HIS4 is under positive control."
https://openalex.org/W1858856929,"Metabolically labeled proteoglycans were isolated both from the culture medium and from the cell layer of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Proteoglycans were fractionated by sequential gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, and CsCl density gradient centrifugation. The culture medium contained two distinct proteoglycans: a large proteoglycan (Kav = 0.07) of low buoyant density containing heparan sulfate side chains (Mr congruent to 36,000) and a smaller proteoglycan (Kav = 0.45) of high density containing chondroitin sulfate chains (Mr congruent to 20,000). The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan fraction contained a small amount (less than 10%) of dermatan sulfate. A very similar low density heparan sulfate proteoglycan was extracted from the cell layer with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate in the presence of enzyme inhibitors. In addition, there was a high density proteoglycan of small size (Kav = 0.43) containing heparan sulfate side chains (Mr congruent to 20,000) in the cell layer. Analyses of proteoglycans synthesized by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells gave similar results, except that these cells produced more dermatan sulfate and unidentified oversulfated chondroitin sulfate chains. Morphologically atypical endothelial cells contained reduced levels of the large heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Both indirect immunofluorescence and direct immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the basement membrane-like matrix under monolayers of bovine endothelial cells reacted with antibodies against the basement membrane proteoglycan isolated from a basement membrane-producing tumor. By electron microscopy, this material was shown to consist of a fine filamentous meshwork containing discrete 10-20-nm diameter ruthenium red positive granules resembling those present in basement membranes of intact arteries."
https://openalex.org/W1592978800,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the glucose-repressed alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (ADR2) from yeast has been established together with its 5'- and 3'-flanking regions. The limits of the gene have been determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of the 5'-ends and by S1 nuclease mapping of the 3'-ends of the mature ADR2 mRNA. Comparison of the alcohol dehydrogenase I gene (ADC1) sequence (Bennetzen, J. L., and Hall, B.D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3018-3025) with that of ADR2 indicated four regions of sequence conservation in the 5'-flanking DNAs. One of these conserved regions contains the sequence TCAAG which may function as a yeast cap sequence. The coding sequence of ADR2 is 89% homologous with that of ADC1 and exhibits a bias in its codon utilization. Evidence is presented that the intergenic region at the 3'-end of the ADR2 gene is less than 550 base pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2074275408,"Transcription of the structural gene URA3, coding for the orotidine 5′-phosphate decarboxylase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by the product of the gene PPR1. Constitutive and noninducible mutant alleles of PPR1 have been cloned and separately introduced with the URA3 structural gene into a hybrid plasmid able to replicate in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Despite the extensive divergence between both yeasts, the cloned constitutive allele PPR1 selectively stimulates 4–9 fold the transcriptional rate of the S. cerevisiae gene URA3 introduced in S. pombe. Study of the strand-specific transcription of URA3 indicates moreover that the PPR1 gene product can exert its regulatory action even when URA3 mRNA is transcribed from a flanking plasmid promoter."

https://openalex.org/W1596414641,"The classical, fermentative alcohol dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which previously was thought to be constitutive, has been shown to be repressed by growth on nonfermentative carbon sources. The rate of alcohol dehydrogenase I protein synthesis declined 6-fold within 3 to 4 after yeast were transferred from medium containing glucose to medium containing ethanol, and it declined 10-fold after glucose became depleted from the medium during diauxic growth. The decreased rate of alcohol dehydrogenase I protein synthesis was shown not to be the result of an increased rate of degradation of the alcohol dehydrogenase I protein. The decline in alcohol dehydrogenase I protein synthesis was correlated with a 6- to 10-fold decrease in the amount of functional alcohol dehydrogenase I mRNA within 3 to 4 h after transfer from glucose-containing medium to medium containing ethanol. A similar decrease in alcohol dehydrogenase I functional mRNA occurred when cells were depleted of glucose by diauxic growth. Total alcohol dehydrogenase I mRNA, as detected by hybridization to the cloned ADC1 gene, was found in the same relative abundance as the amount of translatable alcohol dehydrogenase I mRNA during the different growth conditions. These results suggest that the alcohol dehydrogenase I protein is transcriptionally regulated."

https://openalex.org/W2016101910,"The calcium-dependent fusion of cultured rat myoblasts to multinucleate myotubes appears to require the activity of a neutral metalloendoprotease at the time of fusion. Metalloendoprotease inhibitors and synthetic dipeptide substrates prevent myoblast fusion when added to fusion-competent myoblasts with the addition of calcium. Metalloendoprotease activity has been identified and partially characterized in myoblast membranes with a fluorogenic protease substrate, and is inhibited by the same compounds that prevent fusion."

https://openalex.org/W2055204177,"The mating type locus (MAT) determines the three yeast cell types, a, alpha, and a/alpha. It has been proposed that alleles of this locus, MATa and MAT alpha, encode regulators that control expression of unlinked genes necessary for mating and sporulation. Specifically, the alpha 1 product of MAT alpha is proposed to be a positive regulator of alpha-specific genes. To test this view, we have assayed RNA production from the alpha-specific STE3 gene in the three cell types and in mutants defective in MAT alpha. The STE3 gene was cloned by screening a yeast genomic clone bank for plasmids that complement the mating defect of ste3 mutants. Using the cloned STE3 gene as a probe, we find that alpha cells produce STE3 RNA, whereas a and a/alpha cells do not. Furthermore, mat alpha 1 mutants do not produce STE3 RNA, whereas mat alpha 2 mutants do. These results show that the STE3 gene, required for mating only by alpha cells, is expressed only in alpha cells. They show also that production of RNA from the STE3 gene requires that alpha 1 product of MAT alpha. Thus alpha 1 positively regulates at least one alpha-specific gene by increasing the level of that gene's RNA product."
https://openalex.org/W1560135653,"Multicopy plasmids bearing the structural gene (fabB) for beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase I were constructed in vitro and transformed into various Escherichia coli strains. Introduction of these plasmids into fabB strains resulted in a fabB+ phenotype and a large (8- to 10-fold) overproduction of synthase I activity. Strains carrying these plasmids were also unusually resistant to cerulenin (an antibiotic that specifically inhibits beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase activity) and overproduced cis-vaccenic acid. Strains (fabF-) lacking beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II are deficient in both cis-vaccenic acid synthesis and thermal regulation. Introduction of the fabB plasmids into these strains resulted in the restoration of cis-vaccenic acid synthesis. However, the plasmid-engendered cis-vaccenic acid synthesis of these strains was unaffected by temperature. These results demonstrate that synthase II, the product of the fabF gene, is the sole enzyme regulating the temperature-dependent composition of the membrane phospholipid acyl chains."
https://openalex.org/W1525279530,"This study concerned the fragmentation of the nonapeptides arginine-vasopressin (AVP-(1-9)) and oxytocin (OXT-(1-9)) by proteolytic enzymes present in a brain synaptic membrane preparation. The peptides formed during digestion of arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography and chemically characterized by amino acid composition, NH2-terminal amino acid residues, and the presence of 14C radioactivity in tyrosine-2 and glycinamide-9. The major peptide fragments of arginine-vasopressin were [Cyt6]-AVP-(2-9), [Cyt6]-AVP-(3-9), [less than Glu4, Cyt6]-AVP-(4-9), and a peptide having the AVP-(4-8) sequence. The characterized fragments of oxytocin were [Cyt6]-OXT-(2-9), [Cyt6]-OXT-(3-9), [Cyt6]-OXT-(4-9), [less than Glu4, Cyt6]-OXT-(4-9), and [Cyt6] OXT-(5-9). Employing differentially 14C-labeled arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin, the proteolysis of the two peptides into fragments was followed with time. The results showed the sequential formation of peptide fragments by proteolytic cleavage from the NH2 terminus onward, demonstrating the action of an aminopeptidase-like enzyme. Arginine-vasopressin was converted significantly more rapidly by the amino-peptidase activity than oxytocin. In contrast to known brain aminopeptidases, the synaptic membrane-associated activity cleaved the nonapeptides without prior reduction of the disulfide bridge. From the present data it is concluded that aminopeptidases predominate in the proteolytic mechanism by which brain synaptic membranes convert arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin. The role of the proteolytic events and the significance of formed peptide fragments is discussed in view of the concept that arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin are precursors for neuropeptides in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1496519351,"The intracellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of creatine phosphokinase expression in the BC3H1 muscle-like cell line have been examined under conditions of enzyme induction and repression. In the presence of low serum concentrations, BC3H1 cells cease to grow and synthesize high levels of creatine phosphokinase. When differentiated BC3H1 cultures are exposed to media containing high serum concentrations, cell division is reinitiated and further induction of creatine phosphokinase is inhibited. Accumulation of creatine phosphokinase-mRNA appears to be intimately coupled to the state of growth of BC3H1 cells. Log phase cells do not contain detectable levels of translatable creatine phosphokinase-mRNA; however, following cessation of growth, creatine phosphokinase-mRNA accumulates in approximate proportion to the increase in creatine phosphokinase activity. Reinitiation of cell division in quiescent differentiated cultures results in the arrest of further accumulation of creatine phosphokinase-mRNA but does not inhibit the translation of pre-existing creatine phosphokinase-mRNA. Under conditions of enzyme repression, however, the newly synthesized creatine phosphokinase appears to be enzymatically inactive. These results indicate that the expression of the muscle phenotype in BC3H1 cells is regulated by components present in serum and that myogenic differentiation is at least partially reversible following re-entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1567737567,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from Escherichia coli D31m4, a heptoseless mutant, was studied by 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Modified isolation and purification procedures are described which permitted high resolution NMR spectra to be obtained from samples of intact LPS. 31P NMR was used to monitor the purity and native heterogeneity of LPS samples. The anomeric carbon region of the 13C NMR spectrum taken at pH 7 contained five resonances that were assigned on the basis of chemical shift correlation, 13C-1H couplings, and T1 relaxation times. Two resonances, at 99.9 and 100.8 ppm, were attributed to two residues of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) of which both were tentatively assigned to the alpha configuration. The Lipid A moiety gave rise to resonances at 94.0 and 94.9 ppm, both assigned to GlcNI, and a resonance at 103.1 ppm, assigned to GlcNII. The two anomeric carbon resonances observed for GlcNI reflected the variable substitution of C-1 with monophosphate or diphosphate groups. GlcNI and GlcNII were ascertained to be of the alpha and beta anomeric configuration, respectively, through chemical shift comparisons with model saccharides. The accepted KDO linkage site at C-3' of GlcNII appears not to be supported by the 13C chemical shift data."
https://openalex.org/W1588766342,"The ventricles of rabbit heart contain three isomyosins (V1, V2, and V3) whose proportions change during development, and after treatment with thyroid hormone. The V1 isomyosin accumulates rapidly after administration of thyroid hormone and we have shown that this results from marked change in the synthesis rates of the heavy chains of both V1 (HC alpha) and V3 (HC beta). The fractional rates of synthesis were calculated from the specific radioactivities of leucine in plasma and in HC alpha and HC beta after continuous infusion with [3H] leucine for 1 h. The V1 and V3 isomyosins were separated by affinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies and the heavy chains were then isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis. In 32- to 35-day-old euthyroid rabbits, the fractional rates of synthesis of the two heavy chains were not significantly different with a combined mean rate of 0.14 day-1. Administration of 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (200 micrograms/kg/day) caused a 3-fold increase in the synthesis rate of HC alpha and a comparable decrease in that of HC beta. The fractional synthesis rate of atrial myosin heavy chain also changed when 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine was administered, increasing from 0.15 day-1 to an average of 0.20 day-1 after 1 day of treatment. This was not accompanied by any change in the heavy chain type as determined by radioimmunoassay."
https://openalex.org/W1619557094,"Mac-1 is a macrophage surface antigen containing noncovalently associated alpha and beta subunits of Mr = 170,000 and 95,000, respectively (Kurzinger, K., and Springer, T.A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12412-12418). To determine whether the subunits are derived from a common or separate precursor, the biosynthesis of Mac-1 was studied. [35S]Methionine pulse-chase-labeled material was immunoprecipitated with either a monoclonal antibody recognizing an alpha chain determinant present in the associated alpha 1 beta 1 complex or a polyclonal antiserum recognizing the alpha 1 beta 1 complex as well as the free beta subunit. In peritoneal exudate macrophages, the alpha subunit was derived from a precursor of Mr = 161,000 which was converted to the mature Mr = 170,000 chain with a t1/2 of 30 to 45 min. The beta subunit was derived from a Mr = 87,000 precursor which became associated with the alpha subunit and was converted to Mr = 95,000 with a t1/2 of 2 h. Labeled beta chain took longer than alpha to become associated with the alpha 1 beta 1 complex in a number of different types of peritoneal macrophage populations, correlating with synthesis of an excess of beta. In the P388D1 macrophage-like tumor line, alpha and beta were processed with t1/2s of about 2 and 1 h. Both alpha and beta precursors were present in the complex, suggesting that complex formation preceded processing."
https://openalex.org/W1575999626,"The levels of initiation factors and other translational components were compared in crude lysates of Escherichia coli grown at different rates. Cells were grown in media containing [35S]sulfate and different carbon sources, and harvested during mid-exponential phase after about 10 generations of balanced growth. Initiation factors (IF), elongation factors (EF), and a number of ribosomal proteins were identified unambiguously in gel patterns following two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molar concentration of each protein was calculated from measurements of the radioactivity in excised gel spots and knowledge of the sulfur content of each protein. We found that the ribosomal proteins and elongation factors were present in equimolar amounts except for L7/L12 and EF-Tu which were 4-fold and 5-fold more abundant, respectively, and that the levels of each protein increased in proportion to growth rate. These results are similar to ones obtained previously by other methods, and serve to confirm the validity of our method. We found that the levels of IF2a and IF3 also were approximately proportional to growth rate. We also measured the levels of all three initiation factors using a radioimmune assay, showed that the factors are present in equimolar amounts, and confirmed that their abundance increased in parallel with ribosomes. We conclude that initiation factor levels are coordinately regulated with one another and with ribosome and elongation factor levels."
https://openalex.org/W2002486658,"The type 1 killer phenotype in S. cerevisiae, mediated by secretion of an 11.5 kilodalton (kd) protein toxin, is cytoplasmically determined by the 1.9 kb M1-dsRNA plasmid. Maintenance of M1-dsRNA is dependent on the 4.5 kb L1-dsRNA because L1 encodes the capsid protein of the virus-like particles that separately encapsidate both dsRNA species. We have shown that in vitro translation of denatured M1-dsRNA produces M1-P1, a 32 kd protein containing the toxin peptides. We now demonstrate the presence of an unstable, 42 kd, membrane-associated, glycosylated protoxin in killer cells, probably derived from M1-P1 by cotranslational processing, and glycosylation. In vitro cotranslational processing of M1-P1, derived both from in vivo mRNAs and from denatured M1-dsRNA, produces a product resembling protoxin. Processing involves loss of 1.6 kd of protein, presumably an N-terminal leader peptide, and glycosylation. This information, together with data on in vitro expression of suppressive deletion mutants of M1-dsRNA, allows construction of testable models for the functional sequence of M1-P1 and for its maturation to toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2067299712,"We have isolated spontaneous temperature-resistant revertants of a temperature-sensitive mutation (rpoD800) in the sigma subunit of E. coli K12 RNA polymerase. These revertants still contained the rpoD800 allele. They were mucoid, and sensitive to ultraviolet light and the radiomimetic agent nitrofurantoin, which are characteristics of lon mutants. One revertant, Tr29, was mapped to the lon region of the chromosome. Lon− rpoD800 double mutants were constructed, and were phenotypically indistinguishable from the spontaneous temperature-resistant revertant. It is the degradation-deficient property of lon mutants that is responsible for the suppression of the temperature-sensitive phenotype. We show that the rpoD800 sigma polypeptide is a substrate for the lon proteolytic system, and that mutations in lon decrease the rate of mutant sigma degradation. The rate of synthesis of mutant sigma was also affected in lon− strains. The net effect of lon− mutations was to increase the concentration of mutant sigma. We conclude that the temperature-sensitive phenotype results from insufficient concentration, rather than altered function, of the mutant protein."

https://openalex.org/W2124391709,"RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange is greatly stimulated by the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) of Escherichia coli. Stimulation is not a consequence of the binding of SSB to excess single-stranded DNA. It results instead from stabilization of recA protein-single-stranded DNA complexes formed in the presence of ATP and SSB. In the presence of SSB, recA protein does not measurably dissociate from these complexes for up to 90 min. However, in its absence, recA protein moves rapidly between two populations of single-stranded DNA, and complete equilibration occurs with t 1/2 of 17 s. Rapid transfer of recA protein to single-stranded DNA occurs during all stages of DNA strand exchange and does not require ATP. The transfer involves an equilibrium between free and bound recA protein rather than a direct redistribution between single-stranded DNA molecules. Thus, SSB prevents dissociation of recA protein from single-stranded DNA, rendering the binding of the recA protein to single-stranded DNA irreversible. Under these conditions, the pairing phase of the strand exchange reaction is accelerated to the point that it is no longer rate-limiting. These results can explain the relative inefficiency of DNA strand exchange in the absence of SSB."
https://openalex.org/W1538092129,"The complete exchange of strands between circular single-stranded and full length linear duplex DNAs promoted by the recA protein of Escherichia coli is dependent upon the hydrolysis of ATP and is strongly stimulated by the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). In the presence of SSB, stable complexes of recA protein and single-stranded DNA are formed as an early step in the reaction. These complexes dissociate when the ADP/ATP ratio approaches a value of 0.6-1.5, depending upon reaction conditions. Thus, ATP hydrolysis never proceeds to completion but stops when 40-60% of the input ATP has undergone hydrolysis. recA protein can participate in a second round of strand exchange upon regeneration of the ATP. While 100-200 mol of ATP are hydrolyzed/mol of heteroduplex base pair formed under standard reaction conditions in the presence of SSB, this value is reduced to 16 at levels of ADP lower than that required to dissociate the complexes. ATP hydrolysis appears to be completely irreversible since efforts to detect exchange reactions using 18O probes have been unsuccessful."
https://openalex.org/W1578306377,"The leader peptidase of Escherichia coli cleaves a 23-residue leader sequence from M13 procoat to yield mature coat protein in virus-infected cells. We have reconstituted pure leader peptidase into vesicles of E. coli lipids and found that these liposomes are active in the conversion of procoat to coat. Trypsin removes all but 10% of the leader peptidase, yet the vesicles retain nearly full capacity to convert procoat to coat, suggesting that only procoat which inserts across the liposomal membrane is a substrate for leader peptidase. This is confirmed by the finding that over 70% of the coat protein produced by these liposomes spans the membrane. The rate at which leader peptidase inside protease-treated liposomes cleaves externally added procoat is comparable to the rate of procoat cleavage by the same amount of leader peptidase in detergent micelles. Thus, procoat can rapidly integrate across a liposomal membrane and be cleaved to coat protein. These findings confirm the central part of the membrane trigger hypothesis that certain proteins (such as procoat) can cross a bilayer without the aid of a proteinaceous pore or transport system."
https://openalex.org/W2074647097,"Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (LHCP) synthesis is highly regulated during the cell cycle in light-dark synchronized C. reinhardi cells. LHCPs are a family of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins which are imported into the chloroplast. LHCPs are derived from at least two precursor proteins (32 kd and 30 kd) that are synthesized in vitro and immunoprecipitated by antiserum against chlorophyll-protein complex II proteins. A DNA copy of the mRNA encoding a 32 kd LHCP precursor was cloned from cDNA synthesized from poly(A) RNA obtained from mid-light-phase synchronous cells. Using cloned cDNA (pHS16) as a hybridization probe, we found that a single 1.2 kb RNA complementary to pHS16 accumulates in a wave-like manner during the mid-light phase of the 12 hr light-12 hr dark cycle and correlates with the pattern of chlorophyll synthesis. Light, during the light phase in the light-dark cycle, is required for accumulation of this RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2091254143,"[123I]Insulin was injected intravenously into rats and the distribution and kinetics of radioactivity were analyzed by external detection with a scintillation camera connected to a computer. When injected alone, [123I]insulin was rapidly taken up by the liver and to a smaller extent by the kidneys. After reaching a maximum at 3 to 5 minutes after injection, liver radioactivity rapidly declined and free iodide appeared in the plasma. After previous saturation of the insulin receptor compartment, [123I]insulin was concentrated by the kidneys only and the rate of appearance of free iodide was markedly decreased. The results demonstrate the potential usefulness of this noninvasive technique to visualize insulin interaction with the liver and kidneys and to study the rate of insulin degradation by each organ in vivo. Preliminary experiments in man demonstrate its feasibility and low radiotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1581994124,"Insulin metabolism by isolated rat hepatocytes was studied, utilizing A14 [125I]monoiodoinsulin, [3H]PheB1 semisynthetic insulin, and [3H]insulins synthesized by rat islets. Degradation was assessed by gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, precipitation by anti-insulin antibody, and binding to specific insulin receptors on IM-9 human lymphocytes. When incubations were performed at 15 degrees C or less, insulin bound to hepatocytes remained intact for up to 2 h. At 37 degrees C we detected the generation of an insulin fragment with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 5000 whose electrophoretic mobility was greater than that of insulin. The fragment bound well to anti-insulin antibodies but poorly to insulin receptors. Information about the structure of the fragment was obtained by comparing the metabolism of [3H]PheB1 semisynthetic insulin with that of [3H]PheB1,24,25 insulin. The data suggest that the fragment contains PheB1 but is missing the PheB24 and PheB25. Treatment of the fragment with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B did not affect its electrophoretic mobility indicating that the fragment is also missing ArgB22. Incubation in the presence of 0.1 mM chloroquine led to accumulation of both intact insulin and the insulin fragment, suggesting that both are degraded by lysosomes. The results of this study suggest the presence of two pathways for insulin degradation in liver: a chloroquine-insensitive pathway by which a portion of the B chain consisting of at least 10 amino acids is removed and a chloroquine-sensitive pathway by which both insulin and the fragment are degraded."

https://openalex.org/W1499272745,"The tRNA modifying enzyme, tRNA (guanine-1)methyltransferase has been purified to near homogeneity from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain harboring a multicopy plasmid carrying the structural gene of the enzyme. The preparation gives a single major band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is probably a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 32,000. The amino acid composition is presented and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was established to be H2N-Met-Trp-Ile-Gly-Ile-Ile-Ser-Leu-Phe-Pro. The enzyme has a pI of 5.2. The tRNA (guanine-1)-methyltransferase has a pH optimum of 8.0-8.5, an apparent Km of 5 microM for S-adenosylmethionine. S-adenosylhomocysteine is a competitive inhibitor for the enzyme with an apparent Ki of 6 microM. Spermidine or putrescine are not required for activity, but they stimulate the rate of methylation 1.2-fold with optima at 2 and 6 mM, respectively. Ammonium ion is not required and is inhibitory at concentrations above 0.15 M. Magnesium ion inhibited the activity at a concentration as low as 2 mM. Sodium and potassium ions were inhibitory at concentrations above 0.1 M. The molecular activity of tRNA (guanine-1)-methyltransferase was calculated to 10.0 min-1. It was estimated that the enzyme is present at 80 molecules/genome in cells growing with a specific growth rate of 1.0."
https://openalex.org/W1544116028,"The biological activities of pancreatic presecretory and secretory proteins synthesized in vitro were compared in studies of (a) the binding of nascent amylase to its substrate, glycogen, (b) the binding of nascent trypsinogen 1, trypsinogen 2+3, and chymotrypsinogen 1 to Sepharose-bound soybean trypsin inhibitor, and (c) the activation of nascent trypsinogen by porcine enterokinase. Nascent secretory proteins synthesized in vitro using a mRNA-dependent gel-filtered reticulocyte lysate translation system supplemented with canine pancreas rough microsomes or canine pancreas mRNA and micrococcal nuclease-treated microsomal membranes showed biological activities similar to authentic secretory proteins if oxidized glutathione was added during their synthesis. Proteins synthesized in the presence of membranes and the absence of glutathione showed significantly less biological activity due to incorrect development of conformation. Presecretory proteins synthesized in vitro with canine pancreas mRNA in the absence of microsomal membranes had little or no activity after translation in either the absence or presence of glutathione. These and previous findings (Scheele, G. A., and Jacoby, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12277-12282) indicate that proteolytic removal of the NH2-terminal transport peptide is necessary to allow correct conformational development, including the formation of native disulfide bonds, which not only stabilizes the molecule but allows expression of authentic biological and probiological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1586776039,"Specific binding of purified proteins from the large ribosomal subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 5.8 S rRNA was examined by three different methods: nitrocellulose membrane filtration, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and RNA-Sepharose column chromatography. RNA-protein complex formation was proportional to the amount of proteins added to the reaction mixture. The binding of proteins to the RNA could be saturated. Such RNA-protein complexes were isolated on sucrose density gradients. Protein species present in these complexes were isolated, iodinated, and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eleven proteins, L13, L14, L17, L19, L21, L24, L25, L29, L30, L33, and L39, were identified. By comparison, only six proteins interacted with the 5.8 S rRNA-Sepharose under similar ionic conditions. They were proteins L14, L21, L24, L27, L29, and L30. To better characterize these binding proteins, the interaction of individual proteins with 5.8 S rRNA was studied by nitrocellulose membrane filtration. Proteins L14, L19, L21, L29, L33, and L39 were observed to bind individually with 5.8 S rRNA. Binding of each protein to the RNA could be saturated. The apparent association constants (K'a), measured at 4 degrees C and in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2, 330 mM KCl, and 6 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, ranged from 1.05 to 3.70 X 10(6) M-1."

Both enzyme activities of the highly purified isozyme, beta 2 beta 2, were inhibited by a chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline, for Zn which resides in the active site of the enzyme, the pKiapp value of which was 4.1 for both activities. They were also inhibited by a known competitive inhibitor, isobutyramide, in the same fashion and the Ki values calculated from both activities were the same (2.0 mM). From these results it was suggested that both enzyme activities are catalyzed by the same active site of the same enzyme protein. Kinetic studies of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,26-tetrol dehydrogenase have shown that neither Theorell-Chance mechanism nor simple Ordered Bi Bi mechanism holds in the reaction; instead a mechanism which is asymmetric in both directions is operative."
https://openalex.org/W1585012800,"Treatment of isolated hepatocytes with the alpha-agonist phenylephrine led to a rapid increase in the activity of phosphorylase a and an increase in the rate of 32P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol. After pretreatment of the cells with insulin, this activation of phosphorylase was reduced by about 50% but there was no alteration in either the basal or phenylephrine-stimulated rate of phosphatidylinositol turnover. This difference in the sensitivity of these two processes to insulin was observed at all times and concentrations of phenylephrine examined. Direct measurement of phosphatidylinositol breakdown and phosphatidic acid formation confirmed that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol cycle by phenylephrine was not blocked by insulin. These data suggest that insulin antagonism of alpha-adrenergic effects on glycogenolysis in liver is mediated at a step distal to hormone binding to the alpha 1-receptor and activation of inositol lipid breakdown but prior to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1573621750,"125I-Insulin binding to rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes increased, rather than decreased, when these transformed cells were maintained for 1-8 days in primary culture with incremental concentrations of insulin (3 to 1000 ng/ml). The increase in 125I-insulin binding was reversible and depended on the concentration of insulin in which the cells had been previously cultured. The chondrocytes did not change their phenotype in response to the incremental insulin concentrations in the culture medium. The variations in binding of radioligand were not due to different rates of internalization of the ligand-receptor complex, to protease degradation of the radioligand, to shedding of the insulin receptor, or to secretion of an inhibitory insulin binding component. Scatchard analyses of 125I-insulin binding data indicated the induction of a high affinity insulin receptor in the cells cultured in the presence of insulin. The insulin-induced increase in 125I-insulin binding was not associated with an increase in the binding of 125I-labeled multiplication-stimulating activity (125I-MSA), an insulin-like growth factor. Conversely, culturing the chondrocytes in 0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml of MSA did not alter the subsequent binding of either 125I-MSA or 125I-insulin. The insulin-induced increase in insulin binding to these transformed cells may be an abnormality in metabolic control that facilitates growth of the tumor in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1515442913,"Insulin receptor molecules in rat adipocyte plasma membranes were shown to be monovalent with respect to their capacity to bind insulin. The 1:1 stoichiometry for insulin binding was determined by a double-probe procedure, wherein 125I-insulin (probe 1) was affinity cross-linked to its receptor in the presence of an excess saturating concentration of an unlabeled biotinylated insulin derivative (probe 2). If the receptor were competent to bind more than one insulin molecule, any receptor molecule that was cross-linked to probe 1 also should have been cross-linked to probe 2 in the double probe labeling procedure. The monovalent character of the insulin receptor was indicated by the failure of the probe 1-linked receptor to be cross-linked to probe 2. This was indicated by the failure of succinylavidin to increase the molecular weight of the probe 1-linked receptor. Control experiments indicated that succinylavidin increased the molecular weight of receptor that had been cross-linked to probe 2. The 1:1 stoichiometry for insulin binding demonstrated here indicates that if insulin receptors contain more than one insulin binding subunit, the binding of insulin to its receptor must be a highly negatively cooperative process."
https://openalex.org/W1679042648,"An in vitro system using an enzyme extract containing ATP:L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase from Escherichia coli MRE 600 cells was used to synthesize 8-azido-S-adenosyl-L-methionine from methionine and 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate. In the absence of ultraviolet light and analog can serve as a methyl donor for porcine catechol O-methyltransferase. Photolysis of 8-azido-S-adenosyl[35S]methionine in the presence of catechol O-methyltransferase results in covalent incorporation. Addition of either authentic S-adenosylmethionine or S-adenosylhomocysteine, but not adenosine 5'-monophosphate, to the photolysis reaction mixture eliminates the photoincorporation. These results indicate that the incorporation is occurring at the S-adenosylmethionine binding site in the catechol O-methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1485667312,"Incubation of [3'-3H]2'-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (CldUTP) with adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), reductant, and ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii results in the production of 3H2O, uracil, tripolyphosphate, 5'-deoxyadenosine, and cob(II)alamin. The rate of 3H2O release (0.19 mumol/min/mg) is almost identical with the rate of UTP reduction (0.24 mumol/min/mg). The amount of 3H2O release is dependent upon the enzyme to cofactor ratio. With a ribonucleotide reductase: AdoCbl ratio of 1:1000, approximately 500 eq of 3H2O are released. At this time the enzyme is still active, but further destruction of cofactor and turnover of CldUTP is prevented by competitive inhibition of Co(II) + 5'-deoxyadenosine with AdoCbl for binding to ribonucleotide reductase. The 5'-deoxyadenosine and AdoCbl reisolated during incubation of [3'-3H]CldUTP and ribonucleotide reductase contains no detectable radioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1578562519,"We studied release of trp leader RNA and trp template DNA from RNA polymerase during transcription termination at the attenuator of the trp operon of Escherichia coli. Preliminary evidence had suggested that a stable ternary complex was formed at the trp attentuator. We observed that the complexes between RNA polymerase and trp leader RNA and the DNA template produced during transcription were labile at high salt concentrations and were undetectable when transcription was performed in the presence of heparin. These characteristics are atypical of the stable transcription termination complexes described by others (Richardson, J. P., and Conaway, R. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 4293-4299; Shigesada, K., and Wu, C. (1980) Nucleic Acids Res. 8, 3355-3369). We successfully reconstituted polymerase-trp leader RNA complexes in simple mixing experiments; these and other studies indicated that it is core polymerase that binds the leader transcript and the DNA template. In agreement with this conclusion, it was observed that sigma factor inhibited binding of RNA polymerase to the trp leader transcript and the DNA template and displaced leader RNA from RNA polymerase during transcription. It seems likely that small amounts of core polymerase present in the holoenzyme preparation, or generated during transcription, are responsible for the nonspecific binding of RNA transcript and DNA template. Our findings, therefore, suggest that the transcription termination event at the trp attenuator normally involves spontaneous dissociation of polymerase, template, and RNA transcript."

https://openalex.org/W1596573581,"The colicin I outer membrane receptor was solubilized from the cell envelope of Escherichia coli K12 by extraction with Triton X-100 and purified to homogeneity by a combination of ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography as well as isoelectric focusing. The receptor was isolated as a single polypeptide and retained capacity to form a complex with pure colicin. The apparent molecular weight of the receptor as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecy sulfate was 74,000 or 54,000 depending on whether the preparation was boiled or not in sodium dodecyl sulfate, respectively, prior to electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing of the receptor in the presence of Triton X-100 revealed that the protein was slightly acidic (pI 4.75)."
https://openalex.org/W1578482279,"Arsenite strongly inhibits the activation by thiols of a fraction of the valyl-tRNA synthetase in yeast extracts that precipitates in low concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Once activated, however, the enzyme is insensitive to arsenite. It is suggested that arsenite blocks the function of an enzyme-bound hydrogen-transferring agent that mediates reduction of the enzyme and normally serves as part of an oxido-reduction regulatory mechanism. On gel filtration, much of the arsenite-sensitive activity behaves as a complex of about 500,000 molecular weight, whereas the behavior of the arsenite-insensitive activity is consonant with the molecular weight of 130,000 previously reported for yeast valyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1565804743,"The citrate synthase from Escherichia coli B has been crystallized in a cubic space group with a unit cell spacing of 220 A. X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, symmetry considerations, and low resolution projection Patterson syntheses are consistent with a model proposed in which 24 tetrameric molecules of Mr = 188,000 +/- 12,000 occupy the unit cell. The space group is apparently P23, although at low resolution the observed systematic absences in reflections are consistent with the space group P43n, a space group not allowed for asymmetric molecules. Estimates of VM suggest that in the true space group, P23, two tetrameric molecules occupy the asymmetric unit."
