In the one case the enzyme used was the whole homogenate, the optimum pH was near 6.2, there was an obligatory requirement of calcium, and the incorporation was independent of oxygen. This set of conditions is designated below as the “acid calcium” condition. In the other case the enzyme system was the precipitate obtained by centrifuging the homogenate diluted 15-fold with Ringer’s solution at 2500 X g, the optimum pH was near to 7.3, the reaction was accelerated a little by calcium but the presence of calcium was not obligatory, and the incorporation was a little less under nitrogen than under oxygen. This set of conditions is designated below as the “alkaline” condition."

The growth of C. albicans was not affected by either drug. Results obtained from these preliminary studies suggest that both di-phenyl-pyraline and pyribenzamine possess properties which are inhibitory to pathogenic fungus species and that their activities, therefore, are not limited to the alleviation of allergic manifestations incited by these organisms. The results also suggest that further clinical study is imperative to determine the effectiveness of these drugs in vivo."

Evidence for this conversion in mammals is found in the report that 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid can maintain the growth of rats on a nicotinic acid-deficient diet and in the work of Albert, Scheer, and Deuel, who found an increased excretion of N-methylnicotinamide by rats fed this substance. The isotopic experiments of Heidelberger, Abraham, and Lepkovsky demonstrated that the carboxyl carbon of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid is the precursor of the carboxyl carbon atom of nicotinic acid. To study the mechanism of the conversion of the benzene ring into a pyridine derivative, a mutant strain of Neurospora crassa C-86, requiring 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid or a precursor for growth, was grown in a medium which contained non-labeled synthetic 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and Nls ammonium chloride as the only sources of nitrogen. Thus the absence of N16 in excess in nicotinic acid isolated from the mold would indicate that the amino group of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid is the precursor of the pyridine nitrogen in nicotinic acid."
