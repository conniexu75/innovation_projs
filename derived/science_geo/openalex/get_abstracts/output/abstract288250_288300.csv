https://openalex.org/W2092551092,"The strontium to calcium ratio of skeletal aragonite in three genera of reef-building corals varies as a simple function of temperature and the strontium to calcium ratio of the incubation water. The strontiumlcalcium distribution coefficients of coral aragonite apparently differ from the corresponding coefficient of inorganically precipitated aragonite. With some care, coral skeletons can be used as recording thermometers."
https://openalex.org/W2061371525,"gamma-Aminobutyric acid (a simple amino acid and potent neurotransmitter in human brain and other tissues of higher animals) and certain of its congeners rapidly and synchronously induce planktonic larvae of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, to settle and commence behavioral and developmental metamorphosis. These naturally occurring inducers of algal origin apparently are responsible, in part, for the substrate-specific recruitment, induction of settling, and the onset of metamorphosis of abalone and other planktonic larvae upon specific algae which provide naturally favorable habitats for the young of these species in coastal waters. These observations provide a convenient experimental model for further analysis of the basic molecular mechanisms by which environmental and endogenous factors control the recruitment and development of planktonic larvae. Halogenated organic pesticides significantly interfere with larval settling, as quantified in a new bioassay based upon these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2089616139,"The species concept is a central tenet of biological diversity. Attempts to describe diversity have led to empirical concepts of species based on assumptions found wanting for plants. Plant species lack reality, cohesion, independence, and simple evolutionary or ecological roles. The concept of species for plant taxonomists and evolutionists can only serve as a tool for characterizing diversity in a mentally satisfying way. Diversity is idiosyncratic. ft is impossible to reconcile idiosyncrasy with preconceived ideas of diversity. The search for hidden likenesses is unlikely to yield a unifying species concept. The concept that is most operational and utilitarian for plants is a mental abstraction which orders clusters of diversity in multidimensional character space."
https://openalex.org/W2060996677,"Female crickets can recognize conspecific calling song from its temporal pattern alone. In Teleogryllus oceanicus, the song pattern consists of three classes of interpulse intervals arranged in a stereotyped sequence. Females recognize a model song in which the sequential order of intervals is random. This argues against the hypothesis that recognition results from matching auditory input to an internal template of the song."
https://openalex.org/W2074360987,"Bees in the genus Colletes make their brood cells in the ground and coat them with a highly resistant, waterproof, transparent membrane. This membrane is a polyester constructed mainly from 18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and 20-hydroxy-eicosanoic acid, which are stored as their corresponding lactones in the Dufour's gland of the bee. When lining the cells, the bee secretes its glandular content, and the membrane is apparently a product of polycondensation reaction of its contents. This appears to be the first report of a naturally occurring linear polyester. The term laminester (lamina approximately layer + ester) for this class of compounds is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2085879683,"Growth rates were significantly suppressed in juvenile thalli (less than 0.1 square millimeter in initial size) of the saxicolous lichen Pseudoparmelia baltimorensis from a Potomac River island with high atmospheric lead burden as compared to the case for a similar island with a lower lead burden. However, larger thalli showed no significant changes in growth response as a result of atmospheric pollution stress. Disruptions in lichen growth thus appear to affect life stages when growth is most rapid andfood reserves are low. Once a minimnum thallus size is attained, the stress tolerance of the lichen increases."
https://openalex.org/W2076333896,"Episodes of explosive noises of natural origin, or brontides, have been well documented, often in association with seismic activity and in a few cases as precursors to major earthquakes. Ground-to-air acoustic transmission from shallow earthquakes can account for many of these episodes, but not for all, and other causes, such as the sudden eruption of gas from high-pressure sources in the ground may at times have been responsible. Confusion with distant thunder or artillery at times of anomalous sound propagation complicates the analysis, and more recently the greatly increased frequency of artificial explosive noises and sonic booms has tended to mask the recognition of natural brontides."

If this trend continues for another 100 years, two capelike features will develop. The process responsible for this island-chain pattern may be a standing edge wave trapped between Assateague Island and Cape Charles."
