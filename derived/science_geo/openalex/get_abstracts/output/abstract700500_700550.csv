https://openalex.org/W4295419264,"Abstract Mammalian embryos sequentially differentiate into trophectoderm and an inner cell mass, the latter of which differentiates into primitive endoderm and epiblast. Trophoblast stem (TS), extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) and embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from these three lineages can self-assemble into synthetic embryos, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that a stem cell-specific cadherin code drives synthetic embryogenesis. The XEN cell cadherin code enables XEN cell sorting into a layer below ES cells, recapitulating the sorting of epiblast and primitive endoderm before implantation. The TS cell cadherin code enables TS cell sorting above ES cells, resembling extraembryonic ectoderm clustering above epiblast following implantation. Whereas differential cadherin expression drives initial cell sorting, cortical tension consolidates tissue organization. By optimizing cadherin code expression in different stem cell lines, we tripled the frequency of correctly formed synthetic embryos. Thus, by exploiting cadherin codes from different stages of development, lineage-specific stem cells bypass the preimplantation structure to directly assemble a postimplantation embryo."
https://openalex.org/W4295482869,"The public health response to the global COVID-19 pandemic has varied widely by region. In Africa, uptake of effective COVID-19 vaccines has been limited by accessibility and vaccine hesitancy. The aim of this study was to compare perceptions of COVID-19 infection and vaccination between pregnant women and non-pregnant adults in four regions of Cameroon, located in Central Africa.A cross-sectional survey study was conducted at urban and suburban hospital facilities in Cameroon. Participants were randomly selected from a convenience sample of adult pregnant and non-pregnant adults in outpatient clinical settings between June 1st and July 14th, 2021. A confidential survey was administered in person by trained research nurses after obtaining written informed consent. Participants were asked about self-reported sociodemographics, medical comorbidities, perceptions of COVID-19 infection, and vaccination. Descriptive statistics were used for survey responses and univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were created to explore factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptability.Fewer than one-third of participants were interested in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (31%, 257/835) and rates did not differ by pregnancy status. Overall, 43% of participants doubted vaccine efficacy, and 85% stated that the vaccine available in Africa was less effective than vaccine available in Europe. Factors independently associated with vaccine acceptability included having children (aOR = 1.5; p = 0.04) and higher education (aOR = 1.6 for secondary school vs primary/none; p = 0.03). Perceived risks of vaccination ranged from death (33%) to fetal harm (31%) to genetic changes (1%). Health care professionals were cited as the most trusted source for health information (82%, n = 681).COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and misinformation in Cameroon was highly prevalent among pregnant and non-pregnant adults in 2021 while vaccine was available but not recommended for use in pregnancy. Based on study findings, consistent public health messaging from medical professionals about vaccine safety and efficacy and local production of vaccine are likely to improve acceptability."
https://openalex.org/W4295430589,"Early research on the impact of COVID-19 on academic scientists suggests that disruptions to research, teaching, and daily work life are not experienced equally. However, this work has overwhelmingly focused on experiences of women and parents, with limited attention to the disproportionate impact on academic work by race, disability status, sexual identity, first-generation status, and academic career stage. Using a stratified random survey sample of early-career academics in four science disciplines (N = 3,277), we investigated socio-demographic and career stage differences in the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic along seven work outcomes: changes in four work areas (research progress, workload, concern about career advancement, support from mentors) and work disruptions due to three COVID-19 related life challenges (physical health, mental health, and caretaking). Our analyses examined patterns across career stages as well as separately for doctoral students and for postdocs/assistant professors. Overall, our results indicate that scientists from marginalized (i.e., devalued) and minoritized (i.e., underrepresented) groups across early career stages reported more negative work outcomes as a result of COVID-19. However, there were notable patterns of differences depending on the socio-demographic identities examined. Those with a physical or mental disability were negatively impacted on all seven work outcomes. Women, primary caregivers, underrepresented racial minorities, sexual minorities, and first-generation scholars reported more negative experiences across several outcomes such as increased disruptions due to physical health symptoms and additional caretaking compared to more privileged counterparts. Doctoral students reported more work disruptions from life challenges than other early-career scholars, especially those related to health problems, while assistant professors reported more negative changes in areas such as decreased research progress and increased workload. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately harmed work outcomes for minoritized and marginalized early-career scholars. Institutional interventions are required to address these inequalities in an effort to retain diverse cohorts in academic science."
https://openalex.org/W4295434396,"Background Using data from electronic health registries, this study intended to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population aged 65 years and more, against symptomatic infection, COVID-19-related hospitalizations, and deaths, overall and by time since complete vaccination for the period February to September 2021 Methods We established a cohort of individuals aged 65 and more years old, resident in Portugal mainland, using the National Health Service User number to link eight electronic health registries. Outcomes included were symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths. The exposures of interest were the mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty or Spikevax) and the viral vector (Vaxzevria) vaccine. Complete schedule VE was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio, for each outcome, estimated by time-dependent Cox regression with time-dependent vaccine exposure. Results For the cohort of individuals aged 65–79 years, complete scheme VE against symptomatic infection varied 43 (95%CI: 37–49) (Vaxzevria) and 65 (95%CI: 62–68) (mRNA vaccines). This estimate was slightly lower in the ≥80 years cohort (53, 95%CI: 45–60) for mRNA vaccines). VE against COVID-19 hospitalization varied between 89% (95%CI: 52–94) for Vaxzevria and 95% (95%CI: 93–97) for mRNA vaccines for the cohort aged 65–79 years and was 76% (95%CI: 67–83) for mRNA vaccines in the ≥80 years cohort. High VE against COVID-19-related deaths was estimated, for both vaccine types, 95% and 81 (95%CI:76–86) for the 65–79 years and the ≥80 years cohort, respectively. We observed a significant waning of VE against symptomatic infection, with VE estimates reaching approximately 34% for both vaccine types and cohorts. Significant waning was observed for the COVID-19 hospitalizations in the ≥80 years cohort (decay from 83% (95%CI:68 to 91) 14–41 days to 63% (95%CI:37 to 78) 124 days after mRNA second dose). No significant waning effect was observed for COVID-19-related deaths in the period of follow-up of either cohort. Conclusions In a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed higher overall VE estimates against more severe outcomes for both age cohorts when compared to symptomatic infections. Considering the analysis of VE according to time since complete vaccination, the results showed a waning effect for both age cohorts in symptomatic infection and COVID-19 hospitalization for the 80 and more years cohort."
https://openalex.org/W4295447714,"The liver is the main organ that regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. Ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), mainly expressed in the adipose tissue and muscle, is a key enzyme that regulates lipid metabolism via the hydrolysis of triglyceride in chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the suppression level of hepatic lipid accumulation via overexpression of LPL in mouse liver leads to improved metabolism. To overexpress LPL in the liver, we generated an LPL-expressing adenovirus (Ad) vector using an improved Ad vector that exhibited considerably lower hepatotoxicity (Ad-LPL). C57BL/6 mice were treated with Ad vectors and simultaneously fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Lipid droplet formation in the liver decreased in Ad-LPL-treated mice relative to that in control Ad vector-treated mice. Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance were remarkably improved in Ad-LPL-treated mice compared to those in control Ad vector-treated mice. The expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA oxidase 1, were 1.7-2.0-fold higher in Ad-LPL-treated mouse livers than that in control Ad-vector-treated mouse livers. Furthermore, hepatic LPL overexpression partly maintained mitochondrial content in HFD-fed mice. These results indicate that LPL overexpression in the livers of HFD-fed mice attenuates the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver and improves glucose metabolism. These findings may enable the development of new drugs to treat metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W4295517392,"In June 2020, Massachusetts implemented a law prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes. This law was associated with significant declines in overall cigarette and menthol cigarette sales in Massachusetts, however it is unknown whether the law has increased cross-border sales in neighboring states where menthol cigarettes are still sold.U.S. cigarette retail scanner data were licensed from the IRi Company. Cigarette pack sales were summed in 4-week periods during January 2020-December 2021 (n = 832). Outcomes were state-level pack sales per 1000 population, overall and by flavor status (menthol and non-flavored). A difference-in-differences analysis was used to examine adjusted sales for Massachusetts border states (New Hampshire, Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island) before (January 2020-May 2020) and after (June 2020-December 2021) the Massachusetts's law, compared to 28 non-border states. Control variables included state and time fixed effects; real price per pack; tobacco control policies; COVID-19 cases and deaths, and related statewide closure; and state sociodemographic characteristics.Following the law, unadjusted sales of menthol, non-flavored, and overall cigarettes trended upward in border states; however, these increases were not statistically significant or different from sales patterns in non-border states. This finding persisted after accounting for product prices, tobacco control policies, the COVID-19 pandemic, sociodemographic factors, and fixed effects.Laws prohibiting the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol products, reduce access to these products, while having no significant impact on cross-border sales in neighboring states where menthol cigarettes are sold."
https://openalex.org/W4295422381,"Although codeine has been reported to enhance sexual activity by improving penile reflexes, it has been shown to impair fertility indices. Also, codeine impairs ovarian steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis. Nonetheless, whether or not codeine exerts an epigenetic effect remains unclear. On the other hand, arginine has been speculated to enhance penile reflexes by upregulating NO/cGMP Signaling.The study evaluated the effect of maternal codeine exposure and prepubertal codeine and arginine treatments on F1 male sexual function and fertility indices, as well as the outcome of F2 progenies. In addition, the epigenetic programming mechanism was also explored.Forty three-week-old female rats were randomized into two groups (n = 20 rats/group); the control that received 0.5 ml of distilled water and the codeine-treated that received 5 mg/kg of codeine via gavage for eight weeks. Afterward, the female rats were paired for mating with sexually mature male rats. Rats were maintained on their pre-pregnancy treatments throughout pregnancy and lactation. FI progenies from each cohort (control and codeine-treated cohorts) were weaned at three weeks and randomized into four groups; the control, codeine-treated, L-arginine-treated (300mg/kg), and codeine + L-arginine-treated (n = 10 rats/group). Administration commenced a week post-weaning and lasted for eight weeks via gavage.Maternal codeine exposure did not alter body weight, but significantly reduced anogenital distance and anogenital index of F1 male offspring. Also, maternal codeine delayed preputial membrane separation, impaired male sexual competence, and penile reflexes of F1 male offsprings. These were associated with reduced dopamine, gonadotropins, and testosterone levels as well as suppressed expression of androgen receptor mRNA. In addition, maternal codeine downregulated NO/cGMP signaling, impaired fertility indices, and reduced the litter size, weight, and survival of F2 progenies. These alterations were observed to be aggravated by prepubertal codeine exposure but improved by prepubertal arginine treatment.In conclusion, codeine programmed sexual dysfunction by suppressing the levels of dopamine and testosterone, as well as repressing the expression of androgen receptor mRNA. In addition, codeine-induced epigenetic reprogramming was expressed in the F2 offsprings as reduced litter size and weight, and survival rate. Notably, these observations were worsened by prepubertal codeine exposure, but dampened by prepubertal arginine treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4295507819,"Soft tissue sarcomas are pleiotropic tumors of mesenchymal cell origin. These tumors are rare in humans but common in veterinary practice, where they comprise up to 15% of canine skin and subcutaneous cancers. Because they present similar morphologies, primary sites, and growth characteristics, they are treated similarly, generally by surgical resection followed by radiation therapy. Previous studies have examined a variety of genetic changes as potential drivers of tumorigenesis and progression in soft tissue sarcomas as well as their use as markers for soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. However, few studies employing next generation sequencing approaches have been published. Here, we have examined gene expression patterns in canine soft tissue sarcomas using RNA-seq analysis of samples obtained from archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumors. We provide a computational framework for using resulting data to categorize tumors, perform cross species comparisons and identify genetic changes associated with tumorigenesis. Functional overrepresentation analysis of differentially expressed genes further implicate both common and tumor-type specific transcription factors as potential mediators of tumorigenesis and aggression. Implications for tumor-type specific therapies are discussed. Our results illustrate the potential utility of this approach for the discovery of new therapeutic approaches to the management of canine soft tissue sarcomas and support the view that both common and tumor-type specific mechanisms drive the development of these tumors."

https://openalex.org/W4295466468,"In recent years reported cases of Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, have increased substantially in Victoria, Australia, with the epidemic also expanding geographically. To develop an understanding of how M. ulcerans circulates in the environment and transmits to humans we analyzed environmental samples collected from 115 properties of recent Buruli ulcer cases and from 115 postcode-matched control properties, for the presence of M. ulcerans. Environmental factors associated with increased odds of M. ulcerans presence at a property included certain native plant species and native vegetation in general, more alkaline soil, lower altitude, the presence of common ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and overhead powerlines. However, only overhead powerlines and the absence of the native plant Melaleuca lanceolata were associated with Buruli ulcer case properties. Samples positive for M. ulcerans were more likely to be found at case properties and were associated with detections of M. ulcerans in ringtail possum feces, supporting the hypothesis that M. ulcerans is zoonotic, with ringtail possums the strongest reservoir host candidate. However, the disparity in environmental risk factors associated with M. ulcerans positive properties versus case properties indicates the involvement of human behavior or the influence of other environmental factors in disease acquisition that requires further study."

Intriguingly, the inhibition from local somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SST-INs) plays an important role in regulating the PN plasticity and thus new motor skill acquisition. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Here, we identified that the early-response transcription factor, NPAS4, is selectively expressed in SST-INs during motor learning. By utilizing in vivo two-photon imaging in mice, we found that cell-type-specific deletion of Npas4 in M1 disrupted learning-induced spine reorganization among PNs and impaired motor learning. In addition, NPAS4-expressing SST-INs exhibited lower neuronal activity during task-related movements, and chemogenetically increasing the activity of NPAS4-expressing ensembles was sufficient to mimic the effects of Npas4 deletion. Together, our results reveal an instructive role of NPAS4-expressing SST-INs in modulating the inhibition to downstream task-related PNs to allow proper spine reorganization that is critical for motor learning.

https://openalex.org/W4295440221,"Sleep apnea (SA) is a common disorder involving the cessation of breathing during sleep. It can cause daytime hypersomnia, accidents, and, if allowed to progress, serious, chronic conditions. Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective SA treatment. However, long waitlists impede timely diagnosis; overnight sleep studies involve trained technicians scoring a polysomnograph, which comprises multiple physiological signals including multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Therefore, it is important to develop simplified and automated approaches to detect SA. In the present study, we have developed an explainable convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect SA events from single-channel EEG recordings which generalizes across subjects. The network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers. We tuned hyperparameters using the Hyperband algorithm, optimized parameters using Adam, and quantified network performance with subjectwise 10-fold cross-validation. Our CNN performed with an accuracy of 69.9%, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.38. To explain the mechanisms of our trained network, we used critical-band masking (CBM): after training, we added bandlimited noise to test recordings; we parametrically varied the noise band center frequency and noise intensity, quantifying the deleterious effect on performance. We reconciled the effects of CBM with lesioning, wherein we zeroed the trained network's 1st-layer filter kernels in turn, quantifying the deleterious effect on performance. These analyses indicated that the network learned frequency-band information consistent with known SA biomarkers, specifically, delta and beta band activity. Our results indicate single-channel EEG may have clinical potential for SA diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4295441858,"The impact of collusion during the bidding processes of Chinese government investment projects is a major concern in academic and policy circles, as collusion breeds corruption and destroys the credibility of governments. Furthermore, it negatively impacts successful project completion, leading to cost overruns and the illegitimate enrichment of colluding agents, regardless of the intended social benefits. Using data from 166 selected regional policy implementations as the research sample, this paper uses the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis method to conduct a group analysis of typical cases. The purpose of this study is to identify and better understand the cooperative regional policy implementation environments in China and to identify effective methods to improve the governance quality of collusion controls in construction investment project bidding processes. Five key control paths are identified, covering 94% of the cases. It is also found that in lower social collusion situations, reasonable market competition regulations can directly reduce collusive behavior. The research results will help the government to formulate more adaptive control policies and promote high-quality development of government investment projects."

https://openalex.org/W4295511570,"Characterizing genetic structure across a species' range is relevant for management and conservation as it can be used to define population boundaries and quantify connectivity. Wide-ranging species residing in continuously distributed habitat pose substantial challenges for the characterization of genetic structure as many analytical methods used are less effective when isolation by distance is an underlying biological pattern. Here, we illustrate strategies for overcoming these challenges using a species of significant conservation concern, the Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), providing a new method to identify centers of genetic differentiation and combining multiple methods to help inform management and conservation strategies for this and other such species. Our objectives were to (1) describe large-scale patterns of population genetic structure and gene flow and (2) to characterize genetic subpopulation centers across the range of Greater Sage-grouse. Samples from 2,134 individuals were genotyped at 15 microsatellite loci. Using standard STRUCTURE and spatial principal components analyses, we found evidence for four or six areas of large-scale genetic differentiation and, following our novel method, 12 subpopulation centers of differentiation. Gene flow was greater, and differentiation reduced in areas of contiguous habitat (eastern Montana, most of Wyoming, much of Oregon, Nevada, and parts of Idaho). As expected, areas of fragmented habitat such as in Utah (with 6 subpopulation centers) exhibited the greatest genetic differentiation and lowest effective migration. The subpopulation centers defined here could be monitored to maintain genetic diversity and connectivity with other subpopulation centers. Many areas outside subpopulation centers are contact zones where different genetic groups converge and could be priorities for maintaining overall connectivity. Our novel method and process of leveraging multiple different analyses to find common genetic patterns provides a path forward to characterizing genetic structure in wide-ranging, continuously distributed species."

However, the prognostic value of the PARIS thrombotic risk score for long term all-cause and cardiac mortalities, as well as hospitalization due to heart failure, has not yet been evaluated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the PARIS thrombotic risk score for all-cause and cardiac mortalities and hospitalization due to heart failure following PCI.Consecutive 1,061 patients who underwent PCI were divided into three groups based on PARIS thrombotic risk score; low- (n = 320), intermediate- (n = 469) and high-risk (n = 272) groups. We followed up on all three groups for all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that all outcomes were highest in the high-risk group (P < 0.001, P = 0.022 and P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, adjusted for confounding factors, showed that the risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure of the high-risk group were higher than those of the low-risk group (hazard ratios 1.76 and 2.14, P = 0.005 and P = 0.017, respectively).The PARIS thrombotic risk score is a significant prognostic indicator for all-cause mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure in patients after PCI."
https://openalex.org/W4295426732,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, children have been mentally and physically burdened, particularly due to school closures, with an associated loss of learning. Therefore, efficient testing strategies with high sensitivity are necessary to keep schools open. Apart from individual rapid antigen testing, various methods have been investigated, such as PCR-based pool-testing of nasopharyngeal swabs, gargle, or saliva samples. To date, previous validation studies have found the PCR-based saliva swab pool testing method to be an effective screening method, however, the acceptability and feasibility of a widespread implementation in the school-setting among stakeholders has not been comprehensively evaluated.In this pilot study, SARS-CoV-2 saliva swab pool testing of up to 15 swabs per pool was conducted in ten primary and special schools in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, over a period of one month. Thereafter, parents, teachers and school principals of the participating schools as well as the participating laboratories were surveyed about the feasibility and acceptability of this method, its large-scale implementation and challenges. Data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively.During the study period, 1,630 saliva swab pools were analyzed, of which 22 tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (1.3%). A total of N = 315 participants took part in the survey. Across all groups, the saliva swab pool testing method was perceived as more child-friendly (>87%), convenient (>82%), and easier (>81%) compared to rapid antigen testing by an anterior nasal swab. Over 80% of all participants favored widespread, regular use of the saliva swab method.In school settings in particular, a high acceptability of the test method is crucial for a successful SARS-CoV-2 surveillance strategy. All respondents clearly preferred the saliva swab method, which can be used safely without complications in children six years of age and older. Hurdles and suggestions for improvement of an area-wide implementation were outlined."
https://openalex.org/W4295457309,"COVID-19 pandemic has become a global major public health concern. Examining the meteorological risk factors and accurately predicting the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic is an extremely important challenge. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 transmission in SAARC countries. We also compared the predictive accuracy of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMAX) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods for precise modelling of COVID-19 incidence. We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed COVID-19 case counts, minimum and maximum temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), surface pressure (kPa), precipitation (mm/day) and maximum wind speed (m/s) from the onset of the disease to January 29, 2022, in each country. The data were divided into training and test sets. The training data were used to fit ARIMAX model for examining significant meteorological risk factors. All significant factors were then used as covariates in ARIMAX and XGBoost models to predict the COVID-19 confirmed cases. We found that maximum temperature had a positive impact on the COVID-19 transmission in Afghanistan (β = 11.91, 95% CI: 4.77, 19.05) and India (β = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.35). Surface pressure had a positive influence in Pakistan (β = 25.77, 95% CI: 7.85, 43.69) and Sri Lanka (β = 411.63, 95% CI: 49.04, 774.23). We also found that the XGBoost model can help improve prediction of COVID-19 cases in SAARC countries over the ARIMAX model. The study findings will help the scientific communities and policymakers to establish a more accurate early warning system to control the spread of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4295486423,"Cross-pollination can increase fruit production in both self-incompatible and self-compatible fruit crops. However, it is often unclear what proportions of the fruit crop result from cross-pollination. We quantified the proportion of cross-pollinated seeds and the proportion of fertilised seeds in two strawberry cultivars, Red Rhapsody and Sundrench, at increasing distances from a cross-pollen source. We assessed whether fully self-pollinated fruit and partly cross-pollinated fruit differed in fruit size, colour, firmness, Brix and acidity. We also assessed whether fruit size and quality were affected by the number or percentage of fertilised seeds. Almost all seeds of both cultivars resulted from self-pollination (~98%), even at only 1 m from a cross-pollen source. Distance from a cross-pollen source did not affect the proportion of partly cross-pollinated fruit or the proportion of cross-pollinated seeds per fruit. The mass and diameter of fully self-pollinated Sundrench fruit, and the redness and Brix of fully self-pollinated Red Rhapsody fruit, were higher than partly cross-pollinated fruit. Fruit mass, length and diameter increased, and acidity decreased, with increasing numbers of fertilised seeds in both cultivars. Fruit mass also increased with the percentage of fertilised seeds. Our results show that cross-pollination was not required for Red Rhapsody and Sundrench fruit production, and that cross-pollination was a rare occurrence even close to cross pollen source. Self-pollen deposition on stigmas is required to maximise the number of fertilised seeds, and consequently fruit size and quality. Our research indicates that bees improve strawberry fruit size by increasing the number of stigmas that receive pollen. Our results suggest that placing bee hives on strawberry farms during flowering and establishing nearby pollinator habitat to support wild pollinators could improve strawberry yield and fruit quality."

Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws, which create a path through a civil court process to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be at risk of harming themselves or others and are one strategy designed to reduce firearm violence. Maryland was the first state to authorize clinicians as ERPO petitioners. Objective We aim to document a sample of Maryland physicians’ perspectives about the utility of, any barriers to, and other thoughts on clinicians as ERPO petitioners. Design A series of semi-structured interviews with Maryland physicians identified through a combination of purposive and snowball sampling. We coded the transcribed interviews and analyzed the coded transcripts for themes using deductive content analysis. Setting/Participants 13 Maryland-based physicians interviewed over Zoom in and around Baltimore City, Maryland. Results The interviewees had overall positive feedback about ERPO as a gun violence prevention tool in the clinical setting. They identified several barriers to effective implementation such as time spent on paperwork and in court, a lack of awareness among clinicians about ERPO, threats to therapeutic alliance, and a sense of futility in a culture where firearms are easy to obtain. Solutions such as providing clinician education about ERPO laws, allowing for virtual court testimony, and creating a consult service with ERPO specialists to manage ERPO petitions were discussed. Limitations This study includes a small sample of Maryland-based physicians. Conclusions The physicians we interviewed expressed interest in knowing more about ERPO laws and emphasized education as an important tool for improving implementation. Addressing physicians’ concerns about ERPO implementation will improve their ability to be effective and efficient petitioners."
https://openalex.org/W4295508472,"Introduction Traditionally, single critical concentrations of drugs are utilized for Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) drug susceptibility testing (DST); however, the level of drug resistance can impact treatment choices and outcomes. Mutations at the katG gene are the major genetic mutations in multidrug resistant (MDR) Mtb and usually associated with high level resistance. We assessed the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MDR or rifampin resistant (RR) and isoniazid (INH) resistant Mtb isolates to determine the quantification of drug resistance among key anti-tuberculosis drugs. Methods The study was conducted on stored Mtb isolates collected as part of a national drug resistance survey in Ethiopia. MIC values were determined using Sensititre ™ MYCOTB plates. A line probe assay (MTBDR plus ) was also performed to identify genetic determinants of resistance for all isolates. Results MIC testing was performed on 74 Mtb isolates including 46 MDR, 2 RR and 26 INH phenotypically resistant isolates as determined by the Löwenstein Jensen (LJ) method. Four (15%) INH resistant Mtb isolates were detected as borderline rifampin resistance (MIC = 1 μg/ml) using MYCOTB MIC plates and no rifampin resistance mutations were detected by LPA. Among the 48 MDR/RR TB cases, 9 (19%) were rifabutin susceptible (MIC was between ≤0.25 and 0.5μg/ml). Additionally, the MIC for isoniazid was between 2–4 μg/ml (moderate resistance) for 58% of MDR TB isolates and 95.6% (n = 25) of the isolates had mutations at the katG gene. Conclusion Our findings suggest a role for rifabutin treatment in a subset of RR TB patients, thus potentially preserving an important drug class. The high proportion of moderate level INH resistant among MDR Mtb isolates indicates the potential benefit of high dose isoniazid treatment in a high proportion of katG gene harboring MDR Mtb isolates."

We started from the hypothesis that such an event stimulates the creative industries, but also induces tensions, which can degenerate into blockages. Quantitative and qualitative methods (20 observation sheets; 19 interviews and 227 press articles) combine to portray the dynamics and effectiveness of the city's creative spaces and the role actors play in local territorial co-production, the press analysis providing additional data. The article supplements previous literature on politico-territorial arenas by spotlighting spatio-temporal reconfigurations that spark synergies and tensions within an urban environment with a long-standing multicultural tradition. The results of our research highlight, on the one hand, the tensions and blockages in the public sector in the implementation of the project, marked by political rivalries at various levels, and on the other hand the critical attitude and difficulties in coagulating the energies of the local creative cultural sector. The press analysis reflects a complex and contradictory reality, with both positive aspects (cultural events, dynamics, public involvement, etc.) and negative ones (leadership, dissensions, underfunding). We demonstrate the response of creative industries facing a major cultural project with great potential for stimulating urban development but whose success may be threatened by weaknesses in leadership, in participating governance, and in local civic involvement."
https://openalex.org/W4295514618,"The brown dog tick ( Rhipicephalus sanguineus ) is the most prevalent tick in the world and a well-recognized vector of many pathogens affecting dogs and occasionally humans. Pathogens exploit tick salivary molecules for their survival and multiplication in the vector and transmission to and establishment in the hosts. Tick saliva contains various non-proteinaceous substances and secreted proteins that are differentially produced during feeding and comprise of inhibitors of blood congealing and platelet aggregation, vasodilatory and immunomodulatory substances, and compounds preventing itch and pain. One of these proteins is Evasin-1, which has a high binding affinity to certain types of chemokines. The binding of Evasin-1 to chemokines prevents the detection and immune response of the host to R . sanguineus , which may result in the successful transmission of pathogens. In this study, we screened potential Evasin-1 inhibitor based on the pharmacophore model derived from the binding site residues. Hit ligands were further screened via molecular docking and virtual ADMET prediction, which resulted in ZINC8856727 as the top ligand (binding affinity: -9.1 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation studies, coupled with MM-GBSA calculations and principal component analysis revealed that ZINC8856727 plays a vital role in the stability of Evasin-1. We recommend continuing the study by developing a formulation that serves as a potential medicine aid immune response during R . sanguineus infestation."
https://openalex.org/W4295433667,"In Tajikistan, owning beef cattle is an important survival mechanism for smallholder farmers to alleviate poverty. Therefore, beef cattle farming enterprises should indeed strive to maximize profit to excel and flourish in a free economy. Nevertheless, smallholder beef cattle farmers are known for making little profit. Thus, this study was set to evaluate the profitability of beef cattle farming and its determinants to enhance profit maximization among smallholder beef cattle farmers in the Baljovan District of Khatlon region, Tajikistan. A total of 388 farming households were chosen at random and purposive for the study. The cross-sectional data collected using questionnaires was analyzed by using descriptive, gross margin (GM), and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Based on the descriptive analyses, the mean age of beef cattle farmers was 52.73 years, with a household size of 7.07 members. The beef cattle farmers had an average of 18.23 cattle herd size with 8.54 years of farming experience. The average land area possessed by farmers was 10.59 hectares. Among farmers, men (98.2%) dominated beef cattle farming activities. Around 83.8% of farmers had a college grade (higher literacy). Besides, around 89.4% of farmers had access to farm credits. However, only 71.4% of farmers used farm credit points to produce beef cattle. Most of the farmers (89.7%) had access to accurate market information. Such market information enabled 75.8% of farmers to sell their beef cattle to open market (profitable) outlets rather than middlemen. About 89.4% had access to veterinary services. Additionally, about 82.7% of farmers acknowledged the availability of pasture for grazing, which motivated 87.6% of farmers to be involved in selling contracts. Furthermore, economic investigation results revealed that on average, farmers had a gross margin (GM-profit) of 353.77 US$ per cattle, with feed costs (58.6%) and medications costs (26.1%) accounting for the largest share of total variable costs. Meanwhile, the profitability of beef cattle farming among farmers was significantly influenced by education level, family size, farming experience, pasture availability, land size owned, selling contract, feed costs, medications expenses, access to credits, and sales costs (P &lt; 0.05). This study concluded that beef cattle production is a feasible business. However, the potential for increased profitability is significant if existing resources are efficiently coordinated and production expenses, notably feed and healthcare costs, are minimized. Thus, the government should develop additional measures for addressing concerns such as capacity building, suitable and freely available pasture as well as health management, to boost beef cattle profitability among farmers in Tajikistan."
https://openalex.org/W4295445031,"In the last decade, a large number of clinical trials have been deployed using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) to evaluate cardioprotective strategies aiming at reducing the irreversible myocardial damage at the time of reperfusion. In these studies, segmentation and quantification of myocardial infarct lesion are often performed with a commercial software or an in-house closed-source code development thus creating a barrier for reproducible research. This paper introduces CMRSegTools: an open-source application software designed for the segmentation and quantification of myocardial infarct lesion enabling full access to state-of-the-art segmentation methods and parameters, easy integration of new algorithms and standardised results sharing. This post-processing tool has been implemented as a plug-in for the OsiriX/Horos DICOM viewer leveraging its database management functionalities and user interaction features to provide a bespoke tool for the analysis of cardiac MR images on large clinical cohorts. CMRSegTools includes, among others, user-assisted segmentation of the left-ventricle, semi- and automatic lesion segmentation methods, advanced statistical analysis and visualisation based on the American Heart Association 17-segment model. New segmentation methods can be integrated into the plug-in by developing components based on image processing and visualisation libraries such as ITK and VTK in C++ programming language. CMRSegTools allows the creation of training and testing data sets (labeled features such as lesion, microvascular obstruction and remote ROI) for supervised Machine Learning methods, and enables the comparative assessment of lesion segmentation methods via a single and integrated platform. The plug-in has been successfully used by several CMR imaging studies."
https://openalex.org/W4295453556,"Liver-related diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), are significant causes of mortality globally. Specific causes and predictors of liver-related mortality in low resource settings require assessment to help inform clinical decision making and develop strategies for improved survival. The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of liver-related deaths associated with liver cirrhosis, HCC, and their known risk factors, and secondly to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality among cirrhosis and HCC patients in Ghana. We first performed a cross-sectional review of death register entries from 11 referral hospitals in Ghana to determine the proportion of liver-related deaths and the proportion of risk factors associated with these deaths. Secondly, we conducted a retrospective cohort review of 172 in-patient liver cirrhosis and HCC cases admitted to a tertiary referral centre and determined predictors of in-hospital mortality using binary logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In total, 8.8% of deaths in Ghanaian adults were due to liver-related causes. The proportion of liver-related deaths attributed to HBV infection was 48.8% (95% CI: 45.95-51.76), HCV infection was 7.0% (95% CI: 5.58-8.45), HBV-HCV co-infection 0.5% (95% CI: 0.1-0.9) and alcohol was 10.0% (95% CI: 8.30-11.67). Of 172 cases of HCC and liver cirrhosis, the in-patient mortality rate was 54.1%. Predictors of in-patient mortality in cirrhotic patients were increasing WBC (OR = 1.14 95% CI: 1.00-1.30) and the revised model for end-stage liver disease with sodium (MELD-Na) score (OR = 1.24 95% CI: 1.01-1.54). For HCC patients, female sex (OR = 3.74 95% CI: 1.09-12.81) and hepatic encephalopathy (grade 1) were associated with higher mortality (OR = 5.66 95% CI: 1.10-29.2). In conclusion, HBV is linked to a high proportion of HCC-related deaths in Ghana, with high in-hospital mortality rates that require targeted policies to improve survival."

With the increasing use of these cell lines to investigate novel therapeutic approaches prior to in vivo translation, a much more detailed understanding regarding the genomic landscape of these lines is required to ensure accurate interpretation of findings. Here we report the first whole genome characterization of eight canine OS cell lines, including single nucleotide variants, copy number variants and other structural variants. Many alterations previously characterized in primary canine OS tissue were observed in these cell lines, including TP53 mutations, MYC copy number gains, loss of CDKN2A, PTEN, DLG2, MAGI2, and RB1 and structural variants involving SETD2, DLG2 and DMD. These data provide a new framework for understanding how best to incorporate in vitro findings generated using these cell lines into the design of future clinical studies involving dogs with spontaneous OS."
https://openalex.org/W4295484282,"Leopardus tigrinus is among the least known carnivore species in the Neotropics, including considerable taxonomic uncertainty. Here we model the distribution, connectivity and overlap with existing conservation areas for the species in Colombia. Using a Species Distribution Modeling approach, we estimated current potential range of the species in Colombia and identified potential habitat blocks remaining in the country. In addition, we designed a connectivity network across the available cores, using a circuit theory approach, to evaluate habitat linkage. Finally, we defined a prioritization scheme for the remaining habitat cores and assessed the level of coverage of protected areas for the country. L. tigrinus is potentially present across the three Andean branches of Colombia, with still considerable continuous habitat cores, mostly located on the eastern and central Andean ranges. Most habitat cores are theoretically connected, but nearly 15% are isolated. Priority areas were located across the eastern and central ranges, but with very significant and promising cores in the northern eastern and western ranges. Current level of protection indicates nearly 30% of the range is ""protected"", but only about 25% is under national strict protected areas. Evolution of this coverage showed some periods of significant increase but interestingly the number of cores grew at a faster rate than overall proportion protected, likely indicating numerous discontinuous fragments, and not contiguous functional landscapes. This represents the most updated assessment of the distribution and conservation status for the species in Colombia, and indicates the numerous conservation opportunities, especially in most populated areas of the country. We found unique business environmental passive's opportunities, including compensation and development potential, which are becoming more available in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4295494474,"Introduction Accelerating rates of dementia worldwide coupled with older adults living longer in the community calls for greater focus on quality home care support services. Few frameworks for quality dementia home care exist though prior findings have found elements considered to be important for “good” home care for people living with dementia. This study aimed to identify core components of a quality home care experience for people with dementia and their caregivers. Methods As part of a larger research study, in-depth interviews were conducted with persons living with dementia and caregivers (n = 25) to explore hospital-to-home care transitions. The design used for this study was a qualitative description. We used deductive-inductive thematic analysis, which was informed by previous work in this area. Open codes were mapped to pre-determined themes, and for codes not accommodated by an a pior i framework, new themes were developed. Findings Our findings resulted in 4 overarching themes. Two themes were identified deductively (Availability and Acceptability of Home Care Services) and two inductively (Adaptability and Affordability of Home Care Services). Findings highlight the roles of family—care provider partnerships and responsive support in receiving quality home care, and the cost associated with unmet needs. Interpretation With an aging population, an increase in home care client acuity, and post-COVID-19 concerns over long-term care, more attention is needed to improve the quality of home care. The demand for these services will continue to increase particularly for those living with dementia and their families. The findings of availability, acceptability, adaptability, and affordability as core to quality care can help lay the groundwork for a home care framework for persons living with dementia and their caregivers. Future research could benefit from comparative analyses to evaluate the applicability of the findings to non-dementia home care service users and caregivers."

Combining an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor with a control algorithm to deliver insulin is an alternative to patient self-management of insulin doses to control blood glucose levels in diabetes mellitus patients. In this work, we propose a closed-loop control for blood glucose levels based on deep reinforcement learning. We describe the initial evaluation of several alternatives conducted on a realistic simulator of the glucoregulatory system and propose a particular implementation strategy based on reducing the frequency of the observations and rewards passed to the agent, and using a simple reward function. We train agents with that strategy for three groups of patient classes, evaluate and compare it with alternative control baselines. Our results show that our method is able to outperform baselines as well as similar recent proposals, by achieving longer periods of safe glycemic state and low risk."

In Pakistan, wild germplasm of grapevine viz Dakh, Toran, and Zarishk belong to Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris and Fatati belong to Vitis vinifera subsp. sativa is naturally present in humid and sub-humid areas of mountainous and sub-mountainous regions and showed varying level of tolerance against drought stress but have not been evaluated as rootstock. In this study, different tolerant behavior of wild grapevines as rootstock in grafted scion varieties were explored under different levels of PEG-6000 mediated drought stress i.e., -4.00, -6.00, and -8.00 bars. In response to drought stress, wild grapevines evoked several non-enzymatic and enzymatic activities. Among non-enzymatic activities, total chlorophyll contents of commercial varieties were sustained at higher level when grafted on wild grapevines Dakh and Fatati which subsequently reduced the damage of cell membrane via MDA. Whereas, to cope the membranous damage due to excessive cellular generation of ROS, wild grapevines triggered the enhanced activities of SOD to dismutase the free oxygen radicals into H 2 O 2 , then CAT enzyme convert the H 2 O 2 into water molecules. Higher accumulation of ROS in commercial scion varieties were also coped by wild grapevines Dakh and Fatati through the upregulation of POD and APX enzymes activities. Based on these enzymatic and non-enzymatic indices, biplot and cluster analysis classified the wild grapevines as rootstock into three distinct categories comprises on relatively tolerant i.e., Dakh ( Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris ) and Fatati ( Vitis vinifera subsp. sativa ), moderate tolerant i.e., Toran ( Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris ) and relatively susceptible category i.e., Zarishk ( Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris )."

To counteract this lack of physical activity, more and more people are engaging in physical activity through exercise and training. Virtually opposite training modalities are endurance and strength. We asked if back muscle endurance capacity is influenced by training mode. 38 healthy male subjects (age range 19-31 years, mean age 22.6 years) were investigated: sedentary (Control, n = 12), endurance trained (ET, n = 13), and strength trained participants (ST, n = 13). They underwent a ten-minutes isometric extension task at 50% of their upper body weight. Surface EMG was measured in the low-back region utilizing quadratic 4*4 monopolar electrode montages per side. Relative amplitude and mean frequency changes were analysed with respect to electrode position and group during the endurance task. Eight ST subjects failed to complete the endurance task. Relative amplitude and frequency changes were largest in the ST group, followed by Control and ET groups (amplitude: F 6.389, p 0.004, frequency: F 11.741, p<0.001). Further, independent of group largest amplitude increase was observed for the most upper and laterally positioned electrodes. Mean frequency changes showed no systematic spatial distribution pattern. Although, in the light of an aging population, strength training has its merits our results question the functional suitability of frequent and isolated high-impact strength training for everyday endurance requirements like doing the dishes. Fatigue related amplitude elevations are systematically distributed in the back region, showing least fatigue signs for the most caudal and medial, i.e. the lumbar paravertebral region."

Learning these motor skills may be further enhanced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We aimed to investigate whether tDCS leads to faster attainment of a motor skill, and to confirm prior work showing it improves skill acquisition and retention performance. Fifty-two participants were tested; half received tDCS with the anode on primary motor cortex and cathode on the contralateral forehead while concurrently practicing a sequential visuomotor isometric pinch force task on Day 1, while the other half received sham tDCS during practice. On Day 2, retention of the skill was tested. Results from a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that participants in the anodal group attained a pre-defined target level of skill faster than participants in the sham group (χ2 = 9.117, p = 0.003). Results from a nonparametric rank-based regression analysis showed that the rate of improvement was greater in the anodal versus sham group during skill acquisition (F(1,249) = 5.90, p = 0.016), but there was no main effect of group or time. There was no main effect of group or time, or group by time interaction when comparing performance at the end of acquisition to retention. These findings suggest anodal tDCS improves performance more quickly during skill acquisition but does not have additional benefits on motor learning after a period of rest."
https://openalex.org/W4295242255,"Prenatal environmental insults increase the risk of neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions in the offspring. Structural modifications of dendritic spines are central to brain development and plasticity. Using maternal immune activation (MIA) as a rodent model of prenatal environmental insult, previous results have reported dendritic structural deficits in the frontal cortex. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying MIA-induced synaptic structural alterations in the offspring. Using prenatal (E12.5) injection with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid potassium salt as a mouse MIA model, we show here that upregulation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is at least in part responsible for some of the effects of prenatal insults on frontal cortex dendritic spine structure and sensorimotor gating processes. Mechanistically, we report that this upregulation of frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression is associated with MIA-induced reduction of nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, consequently, a decrease in the enrichment of GR at the 5-HT2AR promoter. The translational significance of these preclinical findings is supported by data in postmortem human brain samples suggesting dysregulation of GR translocation in frontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects. We also found that repeated corticosterone administration augmented frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression and reduced GR binding to the 5-HT2AR promoter. However, virally (adeno-associated virus) mediated augmentation of GR function reduced frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression and improved sensorimotor gating processes via 5-HT2AR. Together, these data support a negative regulatory relationship between GR signaling and 5-HT2AR expression in the mouse frontal cortex that may carry implications for the pathophysiology underlying 5-HT2AR dysregulation in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders."

We establish the presence of a logarithmic relationship between NTL and lumber mill production capacity (R2 = 0.69-0.82). The ability of NTL to temporally identify mill closures is then demonstrated by differentiating pairs of active and closed mills. We also identify Granger causality and co-integration between NTL and monthly lumber production, highlighting the predictive capability of NTL to forecast production. We then utilize this relationship to build linear regression models that utilize NTL data to estimate monthly (R2 = 0.33), quarterly (R2 = 0.58), and annual (R2 = 0.90) lumber production without reported data."

The goal of this study was to determine the magnitude of occupational exposure to hepatitis C virus infection as well as the factors associated to this exposure among HCWs at a Tunisian University Hospital in 2017.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out at Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital in Monastir Governorate (Tunisia) from 01 June 2017 to 31 August 2017. Data were collected using an anonymous questionnaire. To determine factors associated with occupational exposure to hepatitis C virus infection, we performed multivariate analysis.Among the 1493 included participants, more than half (56.7) had at least one exposure to blood or body fluid. A history of needle stick injury was reported by 48.3% of the respondents. Exposure to blood or body fluid splash into the face was announced by 32.1% HCWs. Doctors had the highest risk of exposure (AOR = 12.425; 95% CI: [05.310-29.075]). Participants working at surgical departments were the most exposed comparing to workers at others departments (AOR = 7.440; 95% CI: [4.461-12.408]). Two exposed female HCWs were tested positive corresponding to a HCV infection prevalence of 0.13% (95% IC: [0.11-0.16%]).Occupational exposure to hepatitis C virus infection was high at the university hospital of Monastir.

https://openalex.org/W4295428996,"Liking and pleasantness are common concepts in psychological emotion theories and in everyday language related to emotions. Despite obvious similarities between the terms, several empirical and theoretical notions support the idea that pleasantness and liking are cognitively different phenomena, becoming most evident in the context of emotion regulation and art enjoyment. In this study it was investigated whether liking and pleasantness indicate behaviourally measurable differences, not only in the long timespan of emotion regulation, but already within the initial affective responses to visual and auditory stimuli. A cross-modal affective priming protocol was used to assess whether there is a behavioural difference in the response time when providing an affective rating to a liking or pleasantness task. It was hypothesized that the pleasantness task would be faster as it is known to rely on rapid feature detection. Furthermore, an affective priming effect was expected to take place across the sensory modalities and the presentative and non-presentative stimuli. A linear mixed effect analysis indicated a significant priming effect as well as an interaction effect between the auditory and visual sensory modalities and the affective rating tasks of liking and pleasantness: While liking was rated fastest across modalities, it was significantly faster in vision compared to audition. No significant modality dependent differences between the pleasantness ratings were detected. The results demonstrate that liking and pleasantness rating scales refer to separate processes already within the short time scale of one to two seconds. Furthermore, the affective priming effect indicates that an affective information transfer takes place across modalities and the types of stimuli applied. Unlike hypothesized, liking rating took place faster across the modalities. This is interpreted to support emotion theoretical notions where liking and disliking are crucial properties of emotion perception and homeostatic self-referential information, possibly overriding pleasantness-related feature analysis. Conclusively, the findings provide empirical evidence for a conceptual delineation of common affective processes."
https://openalex.org/W4295434403,"Species with low effective population sizes are at greater risk of extinction because of reduced genetic diversity. Such species are more vulnerable to chance events that decrease population sizes (e.g. demographic stochasticity). Dipodomys elator, (Texas kangaroo rat) is a kangaroo rat that is classified as threatened in Texas and field surveys from the past 50 years indicate that the distribution of this species has decreased. This suggests geographic range reductions that could have caused population fluctuations, potentially impacting effective population size. Conversely, the more common and widespread D. ordii (Ord's kangaroo rat) is thought to exhibit relative geographic and demographic stability. We assessed the genetic variation of D. elator and D. ordii samples using 3RAD, a modified restriction site associated sequencing approach. We hypothesized that D. elator would show lower levels of nucleotide diversity, observed heterozygosity, and effective population size when compared to D. ordii. We were also interested in identifying population structure within contemporary samples of D. elator and detecting genetic variation between temporal samples to understand demographic dynamics. We analyzed up to 61,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that genetic variability and effective population size in contemporary D. elator populations is lower than that of D. ordii. There is slight, if any, population structure within contemporary D. elator samples, and we found low genetic differentiation between spatial or temporal historical samples. This indicates little change in nuclear genetic diversity over 30 years. Results suggest that genetic diversity of D. elator has remained stable despite reduced population size and/or abundance, which may indicate a metapopulation-like system, whose fluctuations might counteract species extinction."
https://openalex.org/W4295441343,"An essential consideration in urban transit facility planning is service efficiency and accessibility. Previous research has shown that reducing the number of facilities along a route may increase efficiency but decrease accessibility. Striking a balance between these two is a critical consideration in transit planning. Transit facility consolidation is a cost-effective way to improve the quality of service by strategically determining the desirable allocation of a limited number of facilities. This paper develops an optimization framework that integrates Geographical Information systems (GIS), decision-making analysis, and quantum technologies for addressing the problem of facility consolidation. Our proposed framework includes a novel mathematical model that captures non-linear interactions between facilities and surrounding demand nodes, inter-facility competition, ridership demand and spatial coverage. The developed model can harness the power of quantum effects such as superposition and quantum tunnelling and enables transportation planners to utilize the most recent hardware solutions such as quantum and digital annealers, coherent Ising Machines and gate-based universal quantum computers. This study presents a real-world application of the framework to the public transit facility redundancy problem in the British Columbia Vancouver metropolitan area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by reducing the number of facilities by 40% while maintaining the same service accessibility. Additionally, we showcase the ability of the proposed mathematical model to take advantage of quantum annealing and classical optimization techniques."

The association between the EAT and the variation of myocardial function is still unclear in amateur marathoners. Consequently, by using some sedentary individuals as the control, this study aims to evaluate the correlation between the EAT volume and the myocardial strain in the left and right ventricles of Chinese amateur marathoners by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).A total of 30 amateur marathoners were included as the exercise group and 20 sedentary people as a control group. All participants received the cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to measure the left and right ventricular end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and volume index, stroke volume and index, cardiac output index, ejection fraction and myocardial mass, the EAT volume, global radial, circumferential, and longi-tudinal strains, and the strain rates of left and right ventricular myocardium.There was a significant difference in the EAT volume (EATV) index between the exercise group and the control group (26.82±11.76ml/m2 vs 37.82±17.15ml/m2, P = 0.01). Results from the multivariate linear regression analysis showed that BMI (standardized β = 0.458; P < 0.001) had an independent positive correlation with the EATV index. The EATV index was negatively correlated with the left ventricular global radial strain (GRS) (r = -0.505; P = 0.004) in the exercise group, while it is negatively correlated with right ventricular GRS (r = -0.492; P = 0.027) and positively correlated with global longitudinal strain (GLS) (r = 0.601; P = 0.005) in the control group. In the exercise group, the multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the EATV index (standardized β = -0.429; P = 0.021) was an independent determinant of the left ventricular GRS, and being a male (standardized β = 0.396; P = 0.029) was an independent determinant of the right ventricular GLS.The EATV index is independently correlated with the left ventricular GRS in the amateur Chinese marathoners, also, the amateur marathon reduces the EATV index and increases the left ventricular myocardial mass, which consequently reduces the adverse effects on myocardial function."

APAP is widely used during pregnancy as it is considered safe when used as directed by regulatory authorities. However, a significant amount of epidemiological and experimental research suggests that prenatal exposure potentially alters fetal development. In this paper, we summarize the potentially harmful adverse effects of APAP and the limitations of the current evidence. It highlights the urgent need for a clinical trial, and the aim of the presented qualitative pilot study on APAP use during pregnancy is the feasibility of a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). In the qualitative study, we included 232 Danish women from three hospitals in the spring of 2021. After recognizing the pregnancy, 48% had taken any APAP, and 6% had taken it weekly or more than weekly. A total of 27% who had taken APAP in the first trimester of pregnancy (even rarely) would potentially participate in an RCT. In a potential clinical trial, the women would need to be included early in the 1st trimester as the suspected harmful effects of APAP lies within this early reproductive developmental window. A possible recruitment strategy was explored. These data suggest that the target population appears positive towards an RCT. As a negative attitude among users has been considered the major hindrance for such a study, we cannot see hindrances for performing an RCT."

Possible biological mechanisms through which physical activity could affect cancer progression include reduced systemic inflammation and positive changes in metabolic markers. Chronic and acute hyperglycemia could have downstream effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. One novel strategy to motivate cancer survivors to be more active is to provide personalized biological-based feedback that demonstrates the immediate positive impact of physical activity. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have been used to demonstrate the acute beneficial effects of physical activity on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolisms in controlled lab settings. Using personal data from CGMs to illustrate the immediate impact of physical activity on glucose patterns could be particularly relevant for cancer survivors because they are at a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). As a pilot project, this study aims to (1) test the preliminary effect of a remotely delivered physical activity intervention that incorporates personalized biological-based feedback on daily physical activity levels, and (2) explore the association between daily glucose patterns and cancer-related insulin pathway and inflammatory biomarkers in cancer survivors who are at high risk for T2D. We will recruit 50 insufficiently active, post-treatment cancer survivors who are at elevated risk for T2D. Participants will be randomly assigned into (1) a group that receives personalized biological feedback related to physical activity behaviors; and (2) a control group that receives standard educational material. The feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this wearable sensor-based, biofeedback-enhanced 12-week physical activity intervention will be evaluated. Data from this study will support the further refinement and enhancement of a more comprehensive remotely delivered physical activity intervention that targets cancer survivors.

https://openalex.org/W4295484283,"This study investigates granger causal linkages among six Asian emerging stock markets and the US market over the period 2002-2020, taking into account several crisis periods. The pairwise Granger causality tests for investigating the short-run causality show significant bi- and uni-directional causal relationships in those markets and evidence that they have become more internationally integrated after every crisis period. An exception is Bangladesh with almost no significant short-term causal linkages with other markets. For understanding, how the financial linkages amplify volatility spillover effects, we apply the GARCH-M model and find that volatility and return spillovers act very inversely over time. However, market interface is weak before the crisis periods and becomes very strong during the financial crisis and US-China economic policy uncertainty periods. The US market plays a dominant role during the financial crisis and COVID-19 periods. Further analysis using the VAR model shows that a large proportion of the forecast variance of the Asian emerging stock markets is affected by the S&P 500 and that market shock starts to rise notably from the 1 to 10 period. The overall findings could provide important policy implications in the six countries under study regarding hedging, trading strategies, and financial market regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4295491952,"The fatty liver index (FLI) is frequently used as a non-invasive clinical marker for research, prognostic and diagnostic purposes. It is also used to stratify individuals with hepatic steatosis such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and to detect the presence of type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The FLI is calculated using a combination of anthropometric and blood biochemical variables; however, it reportedly excludes 8.5-16.7% of individuals with NAFLD. Moreover, the FLI cannot quantitatively predict liver fat, which might otherwise render an improved diagnosis and assessment of fatty liver, particularly in longitudinal studies. We propose FLI+ using predictive regression modelling, an improved index reflecting liver fat content that integrates 12 routinely-measured variables, including the original FLI.We evaluated FLI+ on a dataset from the UK Biobank containing 28,796 individual estimates of proton density fat fraction derived from magnetic resonance imaging across normal to severe levels and interpolated to align with the original FLI range. The results obtained for FLI+ outperform the original FLI by delivering a lower mean absolute error by approximately 47%, a lower standard deviation by approximately 20%, and an increased adjusted R2 statistic by approximately 49%, reflecting a more accurate representation of liver fat content.Our proposed model predicting FLI+ has the potential to improve diagnosis and provide a more accurate stratification than FLI between absent, mild, moderate and severe levels of hepatic steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W4295512427,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different Small-Sided games (SSG) formats and simulated match handball training (SMHT) on handball player's physical performance and game activity profile. Twenty-four youth female handball players (age: 16.2 ± 1.5 years) participated in this study. The study was conducted during the first part of the competitive handball season and lasted for 10 weeks with 2 sessions per week in non-consecutive days: 1 week of pretesting, 8 weeks of specific training, and 1 week of post-testing. A two-group parallel randomized, pre- to post-test design was used to compare 2 different training groups: SSG training group (n = 12) and SMHT group (n = 12). The results showed larger improvements in drop jump height, jump power, absolute and relative anaerobic alactic power and 10 m sprint performances following the SSG training compared with the SMHT (p<0.05, ηp2 = ranging from 0.219 to 0.368). Game performance characteristics showed significant effect in SSD training in average sprint distance, total number of sprints and time between sprints (p<0.05, ηp2 = ranging from 0.08 to 0.292). The results of this study show that handball SSGs represent an adequate in-season strategy to promote a wide range of physical adaptations with improvements in running and jumping performance. This represents important information for coaches, since SSGs develop handball players' physical profiles while replicating tactical and technical features of the game. Nevertheless, simulated match training may be judiciously used to improve players' aerobic performance."
https://openalex.org/W4295514397,"Purpose To investigate changes in peripapillary and macular vessel density (VD) in vascular paralytic strabismus using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods Medical records of patients who recovered from monocular vascular paralytic strabismus were retrospectively analyzed. Age, sex, presence of underlying diseases, strabismus type and severity, time to recovery, and visual acuity at diagnosis were evaluated. VD in the optic disc area and macular capillary plexus density were estimated using OCTA. The effect of paralytic strabismus on intraocular VD was investigated by comparing VD between the paralysis and contralateral eyes. To analyze hemodynamic changes, VD changes in the paralysis eye during the attack and recovery were compared. Results Thirty-one patients (mean age, 64.1±13.0 years; 21 males, 10 females) were included and mean recovery time was 3.0±1.6 months. The most common paralysis was sixth nerve palsy (54.8%). When comparing OCTA results between the paralysis and contralateral non-paralysis eyes, foveal VD in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) was significantly lower in the paralysis eye (P = 0.034); however, VD in the optic disc area was not different. In the paralysis eye, foveal VD in the SCP significantly increased after paralysis recovery (P = 0.04). During attack, the maximal deviation angle and severity of duction limitation were significantly related to foveal VD in SCP. The greater the deviation angle and the more severe the eye movement restriction, the lower the foveal VD in SCP. Conclusions Transient retinal ischemia of the paralysis eye was observed in a patient with paralytic strabismus, which corresponded to the degree of deviation angle and ocular motor restriction. Ischemic factors, which are the etiology of vascular paralytic strabismus, affect intraocular blood flow."
https://openalex.org/W4295519653,"3D human pose estimation has always been an important task in computer vision, especially in crowded scenes where multiple people interact with each other. There are many state-of-the-arts for object detection based on single view. However, recovering the location of people is complicated in crowded and occluded scenes due to the lack of depth information for single view, which is the lack of robustness. Multi-view Human Pose Estimation for Multi-Person became an effective approach. The previous multi-view 3D human pose estimation method can be attributed to a strategy to associate the joints of the same person from 2D pose estimation. However, the incompleteness and noise of the 2D pose are inevitable. In addition, how to associate the joints itself is challenging. To solve this issue, we propose a CTP (Center Point to Pose) network based on multi-view which directly operates in the 3D space. The 2D joint features in all cameras are projected into 3D voxel space. Our CTP network regresses the center of one person as the location, and the 3D bounding box as the activity area of one person. Then our CTP network estimates detailed 3D pose for each bounding box. Besides, our CTP network is Non-Maximum Suppression free at the stage of regressing the center of one person, which makes it more efficient and simpler. Our method outperforms competitively on several public datasets which shows the efficacy of our center point to pose network representation."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a human exclusive pathogen that is transmitted by aerosols and causes the disease tuberculosis (TB). Although TB can be effectively treated with several antibiotics, treatment is prolonged, which often results in poor compliance and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. In an effort to find new targets for TB treatment, a screen for mutants sensitive to the host effector nitric oxide (NO) identified mutations in components of the bacterial proteasome system (1Darwin K.H.

The proteasome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required for resistance to nitric oxide.Science. 2003; 302: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation are posttranslationally modified by the small protein ubiquitin (reviewed in (2Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar)), whereas bacteria have a different modification called Pup. In M. tuberculosis, Pup is translated as a 64 amino acid protein ending in glutamine (Gln) that must be deamidated to glutamate (Glu) by deamidase of Pup (Dop) prior to attachment by the only known Pup ligase, proteasome accessory factor A (PafA), to substrate lysines (3Pearce M.J.

In fact, the accumulation of a single proteasome substrate, Log, results in a buildup of aldehydes that synergize with NO to kill bacteria and attenuate growth in mice, demonstrating the essential robustness of the PPS for resistance to host defenses and potentially other stressors (15Samanovic M.I.

The expression of M. tuberculosis dop, pup, and pafA in Escherichia coli, which lacks a PPS, results in the pupylation of numerous proteins (16Cerda-Maira F.A. McAllister F. Bode N.J. Burns K.E.

While PafA catalyzes a reaction similar to glutamine synthetases, Dop does not. Dop has an amidase activity that appears unique to it and its close homologs (17Ozcelik D. Barandun J. Schmitz N.

Structures of prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup in complex with depupylase Dop reveal the mechanism of catalytic phosphate formation.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dop has a disordered loop sequence that is absent in PafA and is a highly conserved region among Dops from diverse actinobacterial species (17Ozcelik D. Barandun J. Schmitz N. Sutter M. Guth E. Damberger F.F. et al.Structures of Pup ligase PafA and depupylase Dop from the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like modification pathway.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Deletion of the ""Dop loop"" does not diminish its activity nor does it convert Dop into a ligase. However, deletion of the loop and addition of an alpha helix from PafA confers ligase activity to Mycobacterium smegmatis Dop (21Hecht N. Monteil C.L. Perriere G. Vishkautzan M. Gur E. Exploring protein space: from hydrolase to ligase by substitution.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2021; 38: 761-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In a study by the Gur lab, in vitro analysis found that deletions in the M. smegmatis Dop loop result in enzymes that more rapidly depupylate model substrates. Steady state pupylomes in M. smegmatis expressing mutant dop are reduced compared to the pupylome from a strain expressing wild-type (wt) dop, suggesting these Dop loop mutant alleles also hyperdepupylate in vivo (22Hecht N. Becher M. Korman M. Vishkautzan M. Gur E. Inter- and intramolecular regulation of protein depupylation in Mycobacterium smegmatis.FEBS J. 2020; 287: 4389-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The authors of this work also showed that Dop binding to one substrate, Pup∼IdeR, is unaffected by the Dop loop deletion, concluding the Dop loop regulates catalysis and not substrate binding. In contrast, the Weber-Ban lab found that replacement of loop residues with different amino acids made Corynebacterium glutamicum Dop more slowly depupylate a model substrate. Moreover, the authors proposed that the Dop loop promotes the dephosphorylation of an active site nucleotide (ATP), releasing a phosphate needed for amidase activity (20Cui H. Muller A.U. Leibundgut M. Tian J. Ban N. Weber-Ban E. Structures of prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup in complex with depupylase Dop reveal the mechanism of catalytic phosphate formation.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It is possible that differences in Dop loop function described in these studies were in part due to the use of Dop from different species (M. smegmatis Dop is 50% identical/75% similar to C. glutamicum Dop). We sought to understand how this highly conserved and unstructured region of Dop affects the proteome of M. tuberculosis. We complemented a dop transposon mutation with either integrative or overexpression plasmids encoding various dop alleles, including a large deletion encompassing most of the conserved amino acids or several smaller deletions within the loop, and assessed the pupylomes of these strains. Deletion of the Dop loop resulted in an overall reduced pupylome and the accumulation of several established proteasome substrates, supporting observations in M. smegmatis (22Hecht N. Becher M. Korman M. Vishkautzan M. Gur E. Inter- and intramolecular regulation of protein depupylation in Mycobacterium smegmatis.FEBS J. 2020; 287: 4389-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Smaller deletions of the Dop loop had variable effects, affecting only a handful of established PPS substrates. Most interestingly, the overexpression of mutant dop loop alleles resulted in dramatically different pupylomes. In particular, the expression of a specific dop loop deletion allele resulted in the accumulation of a single pupylated protein, suggesting the deleted amino acids are important for depupylating this substrate. Collectively, we propose that residues in the Dop loop help regulate depupylation, possibly by affecting access to substrates. In M. smegmatis, Dop lacking the loop depupylates faster than wt Dop in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the Dop loop inhibits depupylation (22Hecht N. Becher M. Korman M. Vishkautzan M. Gur E. Inter- and intramolecular regulation of protein depupylation in Mycobacterium smegmatis.FEBS J. 2020; 287: 4389-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To test if deletion of the loop would have a similar effect in M. tuberculosis, we complemented an M. tuberculosis dop transposon mutation with an integrative plasmid encoding various deletions from the dop loop sequence; dop alleles were expressed from the native dop promoter (see Table 1). We deleted the coding sequence for the 24 most conserved amino acids (“Δloop”) as well as made shorter deletions within the loop (Fig. 1A) and assessed pupylome levels at steady state by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). As previously reported in M. tuberculosis, complementation of this dop mutant with WT dop restores a robust pupylome (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 versus 2) (13Cerda-Maira F.A. Pearce M.J. Fuortes M. Bishai W.R.

The strain complemented with Δloop had a reduced pupylome (Fig. 1B, lane 3), similar to what was previously observed in M. smegmatis producing Dop lacking either 14 or 37 residues from its loop (22Hecht N.

Deletions nearer to the amino terminus had greater decreases in pupylome levels; the strain producing Dop lacking the amino acids tryptophan, aspartate, tyrosine, glutamate, and valine (“ΔWDYEV”) had the most similar pupylome to the Δloop strain (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 versus 4). This decrease in pupylome abundance was specifically due to the deleted residues and not just the shortening of the Dop loop, given that deletion of six residues (arginine, serine, alanine, glycine, proline, proline; ΔRSAGPP) at the carboxyl terminus of the loop resulted in a pupylome like the wt-complemented strain (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 versus 8). Deletion of the loop from M. smegmatis Dop does not affect deamidation activity (22Hecht N. Becher M. Korman M. Vishkautzan M. Gur E. Inter- and intramolecular regulation of protein depupylation in Mycobacterium smegmatis.FEBS J. 2020; 287: 4389-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed unlikely that the decreases in pupylome levels seen in Figure 1 were due to the reduced conversion of newly translated PupGln to PupGlu. Instead, we hypothesized that the reduced pupylome levels were due to either slower or faster depupylation by the various Dop alleles. Hypodepupylation would result in more protein getting targeted to the proteasome, thus reducing the abundance of known proteasome substrates. In contrast, hyperdepupylation could rescue these substrates from degradation, thereby increasing the amount of a substrate relative to its abundance in wt bacteria. To determine which of these scenarios was more likely, we quantified and compared the proteome of the dop-null mutant to the proteomes of strains producing wt, Δloop, and ΔWDYEV Dop using tandem-mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS). As expected, the dop-null mutant had the highest accumulation of several established proteasome substrates given that there is no pupylation in this strain (Tables 2, and S1). In the strains producing Δloop or ΔWDYEV alleles, several proteasome substrates accumulated but to a lesser degree than what were observed in the dop-null strain (Tables 2 and S1). Nonetheless, this result suggested these mutant loop Dop alleles hyperdepupylated several known proteasome substrates, rescuing them from proteasomal degradation.Table 2Mutations in the Dop loop resulted in increased levels of a subset of pupylated substrates.

Open table in a new tab See Table S1 for full list of quantified proteins. Abbreviation: MW, molecular weight. Defective protein degradation by proteasomes is associated with an increased susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to NO due to the failed degradation of the proteasome substrate Log (15Samanovic M.I. Tu S. Novak O. Iyer L.M. McAllister F.E. Aravind L. et al.Proteasomal control of cytokinin synthesis protects Mycobacterium tuberculosis against nitric oxide.Mol. Cell. 2015; 57: 984-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Log did not accumulate in any of the tested loop mutants (Table S1), but we nonetheless tested whether or not the small loop deletions affected NO susceptibility. Consistent with our observation that Log did not accumulate in any of the tested loop mutant strains, none of these strains was hypersensitive to NO (Fig. 1C). The decrease in pupylome levels was unlikely due to changes in the abundance of the proteasome subunits (PrcA and PrcB) and mycobacterial proteasome activator Mpa because they were present at similar levels in the analyzed strains (Table S1). In contrast, there was less Pup in the mutant strains relative to the strain making wt Dop (Table S1). Pup is highly unstable when not conjugated to another protein in M. tuberculosis (13Cerda-Maira F.A. Pearce M.J. Fuortes M. Bishai W.R. Hubbard S.R. Darwin K.H. Molecular analysis of the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) conjugation pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduced Pup levels in the Dop loop mutants, along with the accumulation of known proteasome substrates, is consistent with a model in which hyperdepupylation occurs in these bacteria. However, we could not rule out an alternative explanation in which Dop loop mutations negatively influenced the ability of Dop to depupylate certain substrates, an activity that could also affect the overall Pup pool. While the relative amounts of pupylated protein varied, the banding pattern of the pupylomes in our immunoblots did not appear different among the strains expressing the various loop alleles (Fig. 1B). However, an accumulated species of about 100 kD was apparent in the strain producing the ΔWDYEV allele (Fig. 1B, lane 4, arrowhead). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that specific residues in the Dop loop contributed to the depupylation of certain proteins. To begin to test this hypothesis, we overexpressed wt dop and mutant loop alleles in the dop-null M. tuberculosis strain, with the expectation that overexpression might magnify differences among the Dop alleles. We performed immunoblot analysis on total cell lysates of these strains and observed that several of the mutant dop allele-expressing strains had distinct pupylomes, with multiple pupylated proteins that were more prominent in several strains compared to each other or the WT dop-expressing strain (Fig. 2, lane 2 versus lanes 3–8). In most of the loop mutants, an approximately 100 kD species, herein called “protein X,” was present at greater levels than in the wt dop-expressing strain and most dramatically accumulated in the ΔWDYEV strain (Fig. 2, lane 4); it was likely that protein X was the same species seen in Figure 1B, lane 4. We hypothesized that the identity of protein X could give some insight into the significance of the WDYEV sequence in the Dop loop. To identify protein X, we performed immunoprecipitations using mAbs to Pup. After separating immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE, we excised the region around 100 kD for MS analysis. After tryptic digestion and MS analysis, the top proteins with more than five peptide spectral matches included Pup and NuoG (Fig. 3A). NuoG is an 85 kD protein and part of the 14-subunit type 1 NADH dehydrogenase complex that is encoded by the nuoA operon (23Vilcheze C. Weinrick B. Leung L.W. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Plasticity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis NADH dehydrogenases and their role in virulence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To further test if NuoG was indeed protein X, we tested for protein X accumulation in a ΔnuoAN mutant lacking the entire operon and overexpressing wt or ΔWDYEV dop alleles. Robust pupylomes were seen in both the parental and ΔnuoAN strains when transformed with empty vector (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 4), whereas the overexpression of wt dop resulted in dramatically reduced pupylomes (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 5), most likely due to hyperdepupylation. Nonetheless, the overproduction of the ΔWDYEV mutant resulted in the appearance of protein X in the parental strain as seen in Figure 2 but not in the ΔnuoAN strain. Because none of the other proteins encoded in the nuoA operon was identified by our proteomics analysis and all of the Nuo proteins except NuoG are 66 kD or smaller, we concluded that protein X is Pup∼NuoG. NuoG is a part of the peripheral arm of the type 1 NADH dehydrogenase complex (24Schimpf J. Oppermann S. Gerasimova T. Santos Seica A.F. Hellwig P. Grishkovskaya I. et al.Structure of the peripheral arm of a minimalistic respiratory complex I.Structure. 2022; 30: 80-94.e84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and has never been identified as a proteasome substrate in M. tuberculosis. Under routine culture conditions used in this work, we did not observe an accumulation of NuoG in the dop mutant, which we would expect if NuoG were a proteasome substrate (Table S1). In contrast, NuoE, which is also a part of this complex, is a confirmed pupylated substrate that accumulated in the dop-null mutant (Table 2) (9Festa R.A. McAllister F. Pearce M.J. Mintseris J. Burns K.E. Gygi S.P. et al.Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [corrected].PLoS One. 2010; 5e8589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we do not know which lysine in NuoG is pupylated, it is possible that access to this residue is affected by its location within the NADH dehydrogenase complex (Fig. 4). In this study, we sought to understand the in vivo function of a highly conserved loop sequence in the M. tuberculosis amidase Dop. We showed that the effect of the loop deletions depended on which residues were deleted, and deletion of as few as three amino acids from the Dop loop had global effects on pupylome levels. The overexpression of a specific dop allele, ΔWDYEV, resulted in the dramatic accumulation of Pup∼NuoG, suggesting this substrate could not be efficiently depupylated by this mutant Dop. Thus, our data suggest highly conserved amino acids in the Dop loop regulate the ability of Dop to depupylate certain substrates in M. tuberculosis. Previous work by two other groups worked to understand the function of the Dop loop. Both studies concluded that the loop affected the rate of catalysis by Dop but in contradictory ways (20Cui H.
