https://openalex.org/W2007051067,"The sequences of the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) show little homology with other members of the G protein-coupled receptor family and exhibit several distinctive features, including a large N-terminal extracellular domain with 17 cysteines in conserved positions. Here we demonstrate that mGluR5, as well as other mGluRs, behave as species approximately twice as large as expected from their sequence, but reducing conditions cause a decrease to the predicted molecular mass. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using wild type and epitope-tagged receptors demonstrate that this is due to specific, disulfide-dependent dimerization of the receptor. The intermolecular disulfide that mediates dimerization occurs in the extracellular domain, within about 17 kDa from the N terminus."

To identify molecules which transduce CD40 signalings, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to clone cDNAs encoding proteins that bind the cytoplasmic tail of CD40. A cDNA encoding a putative signal transducer, designated TRAF6, has been molecularly cloned. TRAF6 has a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF) domain in its carboxyl terminus and has a RING finger domain, a cluster of zinc fingers and a coiled-coil domain, which are also present in other TRAF family proteins. TRAF6 does not associate with the cytoplasmic tails of TNFR2, CD30, lymphotoxin-β receptor, and LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus. Deletion analysis showed that residues 246-269 of CD40 which are required for its association with TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 are dispensable for its interaction with TRAF6, whereas residues 230-245 were required. Overexpression of TRAF6 activates transcription factor NFκB, and its TRAF-C domain suppresses NFκB activation triggered by CD40 lacking residues 246-277. These results suggest that TRAF6 could mediate the CD40 signal that is transduced by the amino-terminal domain (230-245) of the CD40 cytoplasmic region and appears to be independent of other known TRAF family proteins.

Biochemical purification of receptor-associated proteins or the recently developed cDNA cloning system that uses yeast genetic selection led to the discovery of two groups of signal transducer molecules that are utilized by members of the TNFR superfamily. Members of the first group are proteins with a highly conserved domain known as the TRAF domain and include TRAF1, TRAF2 (20Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar), and TRAF3, also known as CD40bp, LAP-1, or CRAF1 (21Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Google Scholar, 22Cheng G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Google Scholar) have recently cloned a cDNA encoding TRAF5 which mediates signals emanating from CD40 and the lymphotoxin-β receptor. The second group includes proteins with a death domain involved in Fas and TNFR1 signaling such as FADD (26Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Google Scholar) also known as MORT1 (27Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar). Among various CD40 signaling events, the Rel/NFκB activation was demonstrated to be mediated by TRAF2 (30Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Google Scholar), TRAF5 (24Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Google Scholar). To further characterize the initial stage of signaling by CD40, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of CD40. Here we report the identification of a novel member of the TRAF family, designated TRAF6, that binds to the amino-terminal region of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail, which is distinct from the binding domain for TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5. A DNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic tail of mouse CD40 (amino acids 216-306) was cloned into the yeast LexA DNA-binding domain vector pBTM116. The resulting plasmid, pBTM40cyt, was used as bait in a two-hybrid screening of a murine C57 Black Kaplan cDNA library fused to the activation domain of Gal4 in the pACT plasmid (Clontech). Seventy-two out of the 2 × 106 transformants screened grew in the absence of histidine and had detectable β-galactosidase staining within 20 min of incubation. Ten clones were used in a cotransformation assay with pBTM40cyt or control pBTMLamin bait to reconfirm the specificity. A fragment of approximately 400 bp derived from the 5′-region of the C40-65 cDNA (probe D, see Fig. 2B) was used as a probe to screen a murine T cell leukemia line EL-4 cDNA library in λZAPII. Two independent positive clones were obtained and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. A mouse multiple tissue RNA blot (Clontech) was incubated with 32P-labeled 65-69 cDNA (Fig. 2B) and β-actin cDNA at 65°C as described (19Ishida T. Kobayashi T. Tojo T. Ishida S. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5527-5535Google Scholar). The filter was finally washed with 0.5 × SSC, 0.2% (w/v) SDS at 65°C for 30 min. Total RNA from WEHI-231 and EL-4 cell lines was prepared, and the purification of poly(A)+ RNA was performed using oligo(dT) latex (Takara). Five micrograms of the poly(A)+ RNA was separated by 1% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham). The filter was then incubated with 32P-labeled probe A or B (Fig. 2B) and then washed as described above. Mouse spleen total RNA was converted to cDNA with random hexanucleotide primers (pd(N)6, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The PCR primers were designed based on the C40-65 cDNA sequence (see Fig. 2B). A pair of primers (primer a, 5′-CAAGCAGTGGGAGAGGTG-3′; primer b, 5′-GTTGCTGTCATCATCCACGAG-3′) were used to amplify a 782-bp fragment. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham). The filter was incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (probe c, 5′-ATCACCACTGCCTGTGCTGGTGCC-3′) at 30°C and then washed with 1 × SSC, 0.2%(w/v) SDS at 25°C for 30 min. For in vivo binding assay, human 293T kidney cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged TRAF6 or TRAF2 and GST-tagged cytoplasmic tail of CD40 or its mutants (24Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Google Scholar). Thirty-six hours after transfection, 1 × 107 transfected cells were harvested and lysed with TNE buffer (24Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Google Scholar) followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (GSH-beads) for 2 h at 4°C. After washing the beads, the GST fusion protein complexes were separated on a 8.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and the FLAG-TRAF6 or FLAG-TRAF2 protein was detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody M2 and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. For in vitro binding assays, purified GST and various GST fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (BL-21) were immobilized onto GSH-beads. Extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged TRAF6 and mixed with GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on beads. After washing, FLAG-TRAF6 bound to GST fusion proteins was detected as described above. Human Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the reporter plasmid, [κB]6TK-CAT or [κBM]6TK-CAT (32Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Bengal E. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3715-3719Google Scholar), 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector driven by β-actin promoter (β-actin-β-gal), and indicated amounts of various expression plasmids by the DEAE-dextran method. The amount of DNA transfected was always adjusted to 5 μg with a control expression vector, pME18S-FLAG. Forty hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing followed by centrifugation. β-Galactosidase activity was used to standardize transfection efficiency, and CAT assays were performed for 1 h at 37°C as described (32Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Bengal E. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3715-3719Google Scholar). From 2 × 106 clones of a murine C57 Black Kaplan T cell lymphoma cDNA library, 10 independent clones were isolated that met all specific criteria for binding to the cytoplasmic tail of mouse CD40 in yeast. Nucleotide sequencing of all cDNA fragments revealed that one of them (clone C40-65) encoded a peptide which has a TRAF domain in its carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1A). Since it is the sixth member of the TRAF family of proteins, we termed this protein “TRAF6.” Using the C40-65 cDNA as a probe, a cDNA encompassing the entire coding region was obtained from a cDNA library prepared from the murine EL-4 T cell line. The longest cDNA clone (clone 65-69) contained 2312 base pairs (bp) including a potential poly(A) tail (Fig. 2B). An in-frame stop codon 69 nucleotides upstream from the first methionine indicates that the clone 65-69 encodes the full-length TRAF6 protein. However, Northern blotting of poly(A)+ RNA from various murine tissues and cell lines revealed that the TRAF6 mRNA is 5.5 kb (Fig. 2, A and C). The C40-65 cDNA starts at nucleotide 829 of the 65-69 cDNA and has an extra 2986 bp of 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 2B). To further investigate the relation between the 65-69 and the C40-65 cDNAs, Northern blotting was performed using the 5′-region of the 65-69 cDNA (probe A) and the 3′-region of the C40-65 (probe B) as probes (Fig. 2B). Both probes hybridized to a 5.5-kb mRNA (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the C40-65 cDNA was not artificially generated by ligating two independent cDNAs during the preparation of the cDNA library, because a TRAF6 cDNA obtained from spleen mRNA contains an extra 3′-untranslated region identical with that of the C40-65 cDNA (Fig. 2D). Thus, these short cDNAs could be generated due to the minor poly(A) addition site at 2291 or misannealing of oligo(dT) primer for cDNA synthesis. The length of combined TRAF6 cDNAs is 5277 bp, which is consistent with the size of the TRAF6 mRNA (Fig. 2A). The TRAF6 cDNA can encode a protein of 530 amino acids (Fig. 1B) with a calculated molecular weight of 60,083. The carboxyl terminus of the encoded protein is homologous to that of TRAF family protein for approximately 150 amino acids, called TRAF-C domain (20Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar). Although the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 is most homologous to that of TRAF2 (35.9% identity), identities among other TRAF family proteins range from 41.7% to 66.2%. In addition to the TRAF-C domain, TRAF6 has three potential domains including a coiled-coil domain, a cluster of five zinc fingers, and a RING finger, which are also present in other members of the TRAF family of proteins. The TRAF6 mRNA is expressed in all tissues examined, especially high in brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig. 2A). Low levels of the transcripts were detected in heart, spleen, and testis. To characterize the CD40-TRAF6 interaction, we carried out in vivo binding assays using GST pull down experiments. Cell extracts were prepared from 293T cells cotransfected with FLAG-tagged TRAF6 or TRAF2, and GST-tagged CD40 or its mutants. Whereas the interaction of TRAF2 (middle), TRAF3 (34Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Google Scholar), or TRAF5 (24Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Google Scholar) with CD40 is mediated by residues 246-269 of CD40, the interaction of TRAF6 with CD40 does not fully require residues 245-269 and is mediated by 230-245 (lanes 2-5, top). The interaction of TRAF6 with CD40 was little affected when Thr254 of CD40 was converted to Ala (TA mutant, our amino acid numbering includes the signal peptide) (lane 6, top), an alteration known to impair CD40 signaling linked to growth inhibition (33Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Clark E.A. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1747-1753Google Scholar), whereas this mutation abolished the interaction of CD40 with TRAF2 (lane 6, middle), TRAF3 (21Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Google Scholar), and TRAF5 (24Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Google Scholar). However, we could not rule out the possibility that TRAF6 might also recognize residues 245-269, because the amount of TRAF6 bound to GSTΔ246 or GST-TA was about 65% of that bound to GSTΔ270 or GST-WT. These results suggest that TRAF6 could mediate CD40 signaling events that are distinct from those mediated by TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF5. Since it is possible that the tertiary structure of CD40 cytoplasmic region in GST fusion protein is different from that in natural membrane-bound CD40, our conclusion described above should be interpreted in consideration of this point. We next analyzed the interaction of TRAF6 with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily by in vitro binding assay. TRAF6 did not bind to any other receptor examined including TNF receptor type 2, CD30, and lymphotoxin-β receptor (Fig. 3C, lanes 3-5), and to LMP-1 of Epstein-Barr virus (lane 6) to which TRAF3 binds (23Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Google Scholar). One of the signals emanating from CD40 is the activation of the transcription factor NFκB. It has been demonstrated that TRAF2 and TRAF5, but not TRAF3 (24Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Google Scholar, 25Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Google Scholar, 30Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Google Scholar), mediate signals linked to NFκB activation (26Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Google Scholar). To examine the possible role of TRAF6 in CD40-mediated NFκB activation, transient transfection experiments were performed to determine whether TRAF6 expression might lead to activation of transcription from a κB-site-dependent reporter gene. The κB-site-dependent reporter construct ([κB]6TK-CAT) (32Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Bengal E. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3715-3719Google Scholar) was cotransfected with a TRAF6 expression vector (pME-FLAG-TRAF6) into human Jurkat T cells. To confirm the specificity of transcription, the same reporter construct carrying mutant κB sites ([κBM]6TK-CAT) was transfected. In Jurkat cells, TRAF6 as well as TRAF2 activates κB-site-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Cheng and Baltimore (34Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of two non-overlapping regions in the cytoplasmic tail of CD40, each of which is sufficient for NFκB activation. One region, called TIMct, consists of 17 amino acids (residues 250-266) and is required and sufficient for the association of CD40 with TRAF2 and TRAF3. The other is a more amino-terminal region which partly overlaps with the TRAF6 binding region. We have also shown here that residues 230-245 of CD40 required for NFκB activation (19Ishida T. Kobayashi T. Tojo T. Ishida S. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5527-5535Google Scholar) coincide with the region required for the binding of TRAF6, suggesting that activation of NFκB by CD40 signaling could be partly mediated by TRAF6. To further elucidate the role of TRAF6 in CD40-mediated NFκB activation, we asked whether the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 acts as a transdominant negative mutant to suppress NFκB activation induced by CD40Δ246 mutant in which the binding site for TRAF2 was removed. Expression of the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 resulted in the suppression of NFκB activity, while expression of the TRAF-C domain of TRAF2 had little effect (Fig. 4B). Thus, it is possible that NFκB activation through TIMct could be mediated by either TRAF2 or TRAF5 or both, whereas NFκB activation from a more amino-terminal region is mediated by TRAF6. The TNF receptor family of proteins, including Fas, CD40, CD30, and the lymphotoxin-β receptor, have been shown to associate with downstream signal transducer molecules carrying either a TRAF or a death domain (20Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar, 21Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Google Scholar, 22Cheng G. Cleary A.M.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar), indicating that cross-talk between TRAF proteins and death domain proteins could mediate diverse signaling processes emanating from the TNF receptor family members. Accumulating evidence indicated that three members of the TRAF family proteins including TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 can directly associate with CD40 (21Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Google Scholar, 22Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1497Google Scholar, 23Mosialos G. Birkenbach M.

We have now identified and characterized a new member of CD40-associated factors, designated as TRAF6. We have previously shown that CD40 residues 246-266, which contains the TIMct domain (34Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Google Scholar), were required for blocking apoptosis of WEHI 231 cells induced by surface IgM signaling (19Ishida T. Kobayashi T. Tojo T. Ishida S. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5527-5535Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRAF5 also requires this region to associate with CD40 (24Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T. Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Google Scholar). In contrast, TRAF6 can recognize a more amino-terminal region of CD40 (230-245) and does not fully require TIMct to associate with CD40 (Fig. 3A). Whether the TRAF6-binding region in CD40 is required for other biological signaling events in addition to NFκB activation is unclear; however, it is likely that two distinct signals could emanate from different regions of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail and those signals could cooperate to induce biological phenomena such as blocking of apoptosis or immunoglobulin class switch. Since TRAF1 associates with TRAF2, CD40 could potentially recruit five members of the TRAF family members to transduce signals. Extensive studies to define complex formation of CD40 with the TRAF family of proteins and the discovery of the downstream signal transducers will clarify further the mechanisms of CD40 signal transduction.

Here, we demonstrate that ligation of the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) molecule on Jurkat cytoplasts induces dramatic PS externalization similar to that observed during apoptosis of intact cells.

Fodrin, a component of the cortical cytoskeleton, also underwent proteolytic cleavage during apoptosis of both cytoplasts and intact cells. Strikingly, CPP32 activation, fodrin proteolysis, and PS externalization were all inhibited in the presence of peptide inhibitors of ICE/CED-3 family proteases. These data provide strong support for the notion that the cell death machinery is extranuclear and is likely to be comprised of one or more members of the ICE/CED-3 family and that activation of this machinery does not require nuclear participation.

In Alzheimer's disease tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated, no longer binds microtubules, and self-assembles to form paired helical filaments that likely contribute to neuron death. Here we demonstrate that normal bovine tau is multiply modified by Ser(Thr)-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, a dynamic and abundant post-translational modification that is often reciprocal to Ser(Thr)-phosphorylation. O-GlcNAcylation of tau was demonstrated by blotting with succinylated wheat germ agglutinin and by probing with bovine milk β(1,4)galactosyltransferase. Structural analyses confirm the linkage and the saccharide structure. Tau splicing variants are multiply O-GlcNAcylated at similar sites, with an average stoichiometry of greater than 4 mol of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine/mol of tau. However, the number of sites occupied appears to be greater than 12, suggesting substoichiometric occupancy at any given site. A similar relationship between average stoichiometry and site-occupancy has also been described for the phosphorylation of tau. Site-specific or stoichiometric changes in O-GlcNAcylation may not only modulate tau function but may also play a role in the formation of paired helical filaments.

Tau is a group of closely related microtubule-associated proteins that constitute an important component of the neuronal cytoskeleton (1Drubin D.G. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2739-2746Google Scholar). Tau proteins are generated by differential mRNA splicing of a single gene resulting in multiple isoforms in the adult mammalian brain (2Goedert M.

Analysis of PHF-tau by ion spray mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing has revealed that 19 sites are at least partially phosphorylated (7Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Google Scholar). Other post-translational modifications of PHF-tau have been reported. For example, PHF-tau is both nonenzymatically glycated (14Ledesma M.D. Boney P. Colaco C. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21614-21619Google Scholar) and ubiquitinated (15Mori H. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Science. 1987; 235: 1641-1644Google Scholar, 16Bancher C. Grundke-Iqbal I.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Google Scholar). Recently, the presence of N-linked and (mucin-type) O-linked oligosaccharides on PHF-tau has also been suggested (18Wang J.-Z. Iqbal I.-G. Iqbal K. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 871-875Google Scholar). However, the presence of these types of oligosaccharides on cytosolic proteins is highly controversial and has yet to be definitively documented for any protein (19Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S.

Cytoskeletal proteins such as neurofilaments (21Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.C. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Google Scholar), synapsins (22Luthi T. Haltiwanger R.S. Greengard T. Bahler M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1493-1498Google Scholar), and cytokeratins (23Chou C.-F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3901-3906Google Scholar) are modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Recently, the high molecular weight microtubule associated proteins MAP1, MAP2, and MAP4 have been shown to contain O-GlcNAc (24Ding M. Vandre D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12555-12561Google Scholar). This type of glycosylation is dynamic, consisting of a single monosaccharide, N-acetylglucosamine, glycosidically linked to side chain hydroxyls of serine and threonine residues on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins of eukaryotes (25Torres C.-R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Google Scholar) (for reviews see Refs. 26Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G. Roquemore E.P. Blomberg M.A. Dong D.L.-Y. Kreppel L. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Biochem.

Wieland F. Reutter W. DNA Replication and the Cell Cycle. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 91-103Google Scholar). Although the exact function of this modification is not well understood, many lines of evidence suggest it to be an essential and abundant regulatory modification present in virtually all eukaryotes. For example, unlike other forms of protein glycosylation, O-GlcNAc turns over much more rapidly than the peptide backbone (29Roquemore E.P. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3578-3586Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc is postulated to have modulatory functions similar to phosphorylation (30Holt G.D. Snow C.M. Senior A. Haltiwanger R.S. Gerace L. Hart G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1157-1164Google Scholar, 31Kearse K.P. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1701-1705Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that O-GlcNAc bearing sites on certain proteins have been demonstrated to coincide with known sites of phosphorylation (32Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Google Scholar, 33Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Google Scholar). Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation appears to regulate DNA binding by the p53 tumor suppressor protein (34Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R. Iggo R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930Google Scholar) and to regulate protein synthesis by controlling the activity of EIF2-kinase (35Datta B. Chakrabarti D. Roy A.L. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given phosphorylation's likely role in the formation of PHF-tau and the discovery that many cytoskeletal phosphoproteins are also O-GlcNAcylated (20Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66 (in press)Google Scholar, 37Hart G.W. Greis K.D. Dong D.L.-Y. Blomberg M.A. Chou T.-Y. Jiang M.-S. Roquemore E.P. Snow D.M. Kreppel L.K. Cole R.N. Hayes B.K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1995; 67: 1637-1645Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the possible glycosylation of normal tau. This study demonstrates that tau isolated from bovine brain is extensively modified by O-GlcNAc. UDP-[6-3H]galactose (38 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. [3H]Glucosamine (40 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Bovine milk galactosyltransferase was from Sigma. Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington, and saccharide standards were from Dionex. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated succinyl wheat germ agglutinin, Triticum vulgaris (sWGA-horseradish peroxidase), was from E-Y Laboratories. The tau monoclonal antibody Tau2 (6Watanabe A. Takio K. Hasegawa M. Arai T. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 960-966Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. L. Binder. All other reagents were of the highest commercial grade available. Tau was purified to homogeneity from bovine brains (RJO Biologicals) as described previously (38Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Binder L.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1505-1511Google Scholar, 39Fleming L.M. Weisgraber K.H. Strittmatter W.J. Troncoso J.C. Johnson G.V.W. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 138: 252-260Google Scholar). Tau polypeptides were probed for terminal GlcNAc using Galβ(1-4)galactosyltransferase (galactosyltransferase) and UDP-[3H]galactose as described by Roquemore et al. (40Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Google Scholar). Bovine tau was separated into individual isoforms by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Individual polypeptide bands were excised from the gel with a blade and extracted with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS. Radiolabeled tau glycopeptides were isolated from SDS-polyacrylamide gels after digesting with trypsin as described by Rosenfeld et al. (41Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 203: 173-179Google Scholar). Glycopeptides were separated by RP-HPLC on a Rainin HPLC system equipped with a Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) through a linear 2-h gradient of acetonitrile (0-40%) in buffer containing 0.1 M sodium perchlorate and 1% phosphoric acid, pH 2.1, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (42Meek J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1632-1636Google Scholar). Absorbance of the eluent was monitored at 214 nm, and tritium was detected with an on-line Flo1β scintillation detector. Purified bovine tau polypeptides were labeled with [3H]galactose using galactosyltransferase followed by β-elimination and saccharide analysis, which was performed as described previously (21Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.C. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Google Scholar, 43Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 54-62Google Scholar). Stoichiometry analysis was performed in triplicate as described by Roquemore et al. (44Roquemore E.P. Dell A. Morris H.R. Panico M. Reason A.J. Savoy L.-A. Wistow G.J. Zigler J.S. Earles B.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 555-563Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, purified bovine tau polypeptides in 20 mM MES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4 were desalted by gel filtration, precipitated with six volumes of acetone, and resuspended in deionized water, and protein levels were determined by Micro bicinchoninic acid (45Hill H.D. Straka J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 203-208Google Scholar) or Amido Schwarz (46Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 197: 65-68Google Scholar). A relative molecular mass of 46.2 kDa, which represented an average of all bovine isoforms (3Himmler A. Dreschel D. Kirschner M.W. Martin Jr., D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1381-1388Google Scholar), was used in all calculations. Prior to hydrolysis, [3H]glucosamine (100,000 cpm) was added to each sample to determine percent recovery. Amino sugars were isolated on 0.5 ml of Dowex AG 50W-X8 ([H+] form) columns with 2 M HCl after washing with 20% methanol. The amount of glucosamine released from acid hydrolysis was quantified by peak areas of glucosamine standards on a Dionex CarboPac PA1 column. Identity of the glucosamine peak was confirmed by comigration with GlcNAc after re-N-acetylation (47Hayes B.K. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16170-16178Google Scholar). Tau proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), treated with 2-Hydroxybenzoic acid, dried, and exposed to X-OMAT film (Kodak). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) or nitrocellulose membranes equilibrated in 25 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 190 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. After blocking the membranes with 5% bovine serum albumin in 125 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), proteins were probed for GlcNAc with sWGA-horseradish peroxidase in TBST (1:5,000) and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or by enhanced chemiluminescence. Blots were probed for tau with the monoclonal antibody Tau2 (1:10,000), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG in TBST (1:2000) prior to developing. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry et al. (49Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.R. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar), micro bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), or Amido Schwarz dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The presence of terminal GlcNAc residues on bovine tau is demonstrated by labeling tau with [3H]galactose using galactosyltransferase. Tau purified from bovine brain migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as five polypeptides with relative molecular masses between 45 and 60 kDa (3Himmler A. Dreschel D. Kirschner M.W. Martin Jr., D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1381-1388Google Scholar, 38Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Binder L.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1505-1511Google Scholar), and all are reactive with the tau monoclonal antibody Tau2 (Fig. 1A). The identification of terminal GlcNAc residues with galactosyltransferase is highly specific (26Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G. Roquemore E.P. Blomberg M.A. Dong D.L.-Y. Kreppel L. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 264-269Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of [3H]Galβ(1-4)GlcNAc moieties on a glycoprotein. After incubating tau with galactosyltransferase in the presence of UDP-[3H]galactose, labeling of all tau isoforms is observed (Fig. 1B). The radiolabel observed in lane 2 is due to incorporation into bovine tau because there is no detectable labeling of the enzyme alone (lane 1). The lectin sWGA also documents the presence of multiple terminal GlcNAc residues on bovine tau. sWGA binds specifically to GlcNAc (50Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Sene C. Maget-Dana R. Delmotte F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 147-153Google Scholar). Lectin blots shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that sWGA binds to purified bovine tau. The specificity of the sWGA lectin for GlcNAc is illustrated by effectively competing the lectin with 0.5 M GlcNAc, whereas 0.5 M galactose has little effect (Fig. 2). Together, these data indicate the existence of multiple terminal GlcNAc containing moieties on purified bovine tau. To determine the nature of the [3H]galactose-labeled residues on tau, labeled protein was first treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), an enzyme that specifically cleaves N-linked carbohydrates from the peptide backbone (51Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Google Scholar). Treatment of tau with PNGase F did not remove the [3H]galactose from tau, indicating that the carbohydrates on tau are not N-linked. In contrast, [3H]galactosylated ovalbumin, a protein known to contain N-linked carbohydrates (52Huang C.C. Mayer H.E. Montgomery R. Carbohydr. Res. 1970; 13: 127-137Google Scholar), is PNGase F-sensitive (data not shown). The [3H]galactose-labeled carbohydrates on tau are, however, susceptible to alkaline β-elimination (Fig. 3A), indicating that they are linked to the polypeptide via O-glycosidic linkages. TSK-Gel filtration of the [3H]galactose-labeled compounds released by alkaline β-elimination demonstrate their migration as reduced disaccharides (Fig. 3B). Further analysis of the [3H]galactose-labeled material by Dionex high pH anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection shows that the labeled saccharides are derived from O-GlcNAc. Fig. 3C shows the co-migration of the [3H]galactose-labeled compounds with Galβ(1-4)GlcNAcitol, the expected product of a galactose-labeled O-GlcNAc released by reductive, alkaline β-elimination. Thus, purified bovine tau is modified with O-GlcNAc. To determine if any differences exist in the glycosylation of the different bovine tau isoforms, tryptic maps of each [3H]galactose-labeled tau isoform were generated by RP-HPLC. The purified galactosyltransferase-treated polypeptide mixture was separated into its major species by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4A). In-gel trypsin digestion was performed on each isoform, and the peptides released from the gel were separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 4B). The resulting profiles clearly suggest that the tau isoforms contain numerous sites of O-GlcNAcylation. The similar retention times for many of the peaks indicate that all of the isoforms appear to share similar sites of glycosylation. The minor differences between the different isoforms could represent some stoichiometry differences at individual sites of glycosylation or differential trypsin cleavage due to amino acid sequence diversity. The number of glycosylation sites observed on tau appears to be relatively high as compared with certain other known O-GlcNAc-modified proteins (21Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.C. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Google Scholar, 29Roquemore E.P. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3578-3586Google Scholar, 44Roquemore E.P. Dell A. Morris H.R. Panico M. Reason A.J. Savoy L.-A. Wistow G.J. Zigler J.S. Earles B.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 555-563Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of tau glycosylation was determined and found to be 4.2 ± 0.9 mol O-GlcNAc/mol tau (n = 3 separate determinations). Initial site mapping data indicate that one major attachment site for O-GlcNAc on tau is localized to a domain involved in microtubule binding (2Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Google Scholar, 3Himmler A. Dreschel D. Kirschner M.W. Martin Jr., D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1381-1388Google Scholar). These data are further supported by the finding that a synthetic peptide based upon these mapping studies, and containing the tau sequence VKSKIGSTENLKHQ is a substrate in vitro (data not shown) for the O-GlcNAc transferase (53Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Google Scholar). Further analysis of the in vivo tau glycosylation sites is being facilitated by the development of more sensitive methods (54Hayes B.K. Greis K.D. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 115-212Google Scholar, 55Greis K.D. Hayes B.K. Comer F.I. Kirk M. Barnes S. Lowary T.L. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 38-49Google Scholar). The high degree of glycosylation of bovine tau indicates a possible structural role for these glycoconjugates on tau. The O-GlcNAcylation of other microtubule-associated proteins, MAP1, MAP2, and MAP4, also suggests a role for O-GlcNAc in mediating the interactions of the MAPs with tubulin. Recently, tau has been shown to be associated with the neural plasma membrane (56Brandt R. Leger J. Lee G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 131: 1327-1340Google Scholar) and also localized to the nucleus (57Loomis P.A. Howard T.H. Castlebury R.P. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8422-8426Google Scholar). The O-GlcNAcylation of tau may play a role in its subcellular localization. The demonstration of O-GlcNAc attachment to known phosphorylation sites of nuclear proteins, c-Myc (33Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Google Scholar) and RNA polymerase II (32Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Google Scholar), and the exclusive reciprocity of O-GlcNAc and phosphate on some O-GlcNAc modified proteins (33Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Google Scholar) suggest that tau glycosylation and phosphorylation may also be reciprocally related. Phosphorylation modulates tau's interactions with tubulin and the proteolysis of tau (58Wang X. An S. Wu J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 591-597Google Scholar). Therefore, tau O-GlcNAcylation could potentially regulate tau degradation. The fact that O-GlcNAc has not been detected on PHFs (14Ledesma M.D. Boney P. Colaco C. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21614-21619Google Scholar), which are extensively phosphorylated at numerous sites (7Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Google Scholar), supports this hypothesis concerning the reciprocal nature of these two modifications. Thus, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that in Alzheimer's disease, PHF-tau formation may result from the defective O-GlcNAcylation of tau, thus allowing or even promoting abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation. O-GlcNAc's putative involvement in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is made more intriguing by the recent finding of O-GlcNAc on the cytoplasmic domain of the β-amyloid precursor protein (59Griffith L.S. Mathes M. Schmitz B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 270-278Google Scholar) and by the direct observation of altered O-GlcNAcylation in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (60Griffith L.S. Schmitz B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 424-431Google Scholar). Future investigations will directly evaluate the role(s) of O-GlcNAcylation in microtubule assembly and organization. One obvious implication predicted from the present study is that inhibitors of enzymes specific for the removal of O-GlcNAc (61Dong L.-Y.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Google Scholar) could prevent PHF-tau formation by not allowing tau hyperphosphorylation to occur. We thank K. Morrison for peptide sequencing, M. Zinnerman for technical assistance, Dr. L. Binder for generously providing the monoclonal antibody Tau2, and the members of the Hart lab for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2064797437,"To analyze how estrogen blocks osteoclastogenesis, we investigated the effects of ovariectomy on osteoclast (OC) formation in co-cultures of purified OC precursors and purified stromal cells (SC). OC formation was higher in co-cultures containing SC from ovariectomized mice than in those containing SC from sham-operated mice, thus suggesting that estrogen regulates osteoclastogenesis by targeting SC. Ovariectomy also increased the mononuclear cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the SC production of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF). Osteoclastogenesis and SC production of M-CSF were not blocked by in vitro estrogen treatment but were decreased by in vivo treatment of donor mice with either estrogen or a combination of the IL-1 inhibitor, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and the TNF inhibitor, TNF binding protein. IL-1 and TNF production were also blocked by in vivo estrogen treatment, demonstrating that the increased bone marrow levels of IL-1 and TNF characteristic of ovariectomized mice induce the formation of a SC population characterized by a high production of M-CSF and increased pro-osteoclastogenic activity. Since in co-cultures of SC and OC precursors M-CSF levels correlated with OC production (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001), the data also indicate that the pro-osteoclastogenic activity of SC is proportional to their secretion of M-CSF. The ability of estrogen to decrease SC production of M-CSF and the pro-osteoclastogenic activity of these cells by regulating IL-1 and TNF production is a previously undescribed mechanism by which estrogen down-regulates osteoclastogenesis.

This asymmetric distribution is in sharp contrast to the localization of AP-2 that shows an even distribution along the same types of clathrin-coated structures. These findings suggest several possible regulatory roles of Eps15 during the formation of coated pits. Clathrin-coated membranes represent specialized organelles involved in the formation of transport vesicles that traffic from the plasma membrane or the trans-Golgi network to the endosomal compartment (1Kirchhausen T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 182-188Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Google Scholar, 3Schmid S.L. Damke H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1445-1453Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane, clathrin-coated pits serve to selectively concentrate and internalize proteins destined to be retrieved from the surface, in some cases to deliver nutrients to the cell and in others to down-regulate the surface expression of membrane receptors. At the trans-Golgi network, this organelle operates in the secretory pathway leading to lysosomal targeting of several lysosome-resident proteins. The assembly of clathrin into basket-shaped lattices on the cytosolic side of the membrane initiates the formation of the coated pit, and a section of captured membrane becomes a coated vesicle (4Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 1983; 33: 650-652Google Scholar). The major proteins that drive clathrin coat formation are the AP 1The abbreviations used are: AP-2plasma membrane clathrin-associated protein complex also referred to as adaptorAP-1Golgi clathrin-associated protein complexCMF-PBSCa2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered salineEGFepidermal growth factorGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). complexes or adaptors which also have a number of other functions in vesicle trafficking (1Kirchhausen T.

AP-1 and AP-2 complexes are both heterotetramers, consisting of two large chains (γ- and either β1- or β2-adaptin for AP-1 and α- and either β1- or β2-adaptin for AP-2), a medium chain (μ1 or μ2), and a small chain (σ1 or σ2). AP-1 is found in vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network, whereas AP-2 is specific for the plasma membrane-coated vesicles. μ1 and μ2 are the recognition molecules for the tyrosine-sorting signals present in the cytoplasmic tail of proteins that traffic through clathrin-coated vesicles (5Boll W. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 6Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Google Scholar). The β-subunits interact with clathrin and in vitro they drive the formation of coats that are structurally indistinguishable from clathrin coats obtained from cells (7Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Google Scholar). The α-subunits also bind to clathrin, but their role in coat formation has not been established (8Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23768-23773Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that several other molecules might also interact with the α-subunit of AP-2. They include the membrane protein synaptotagmin (9Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Google Scholar), GRB2 adapter protein (10Wang L.H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Google Scholar), and a group of small molecules containing phosphorylated inositol rings that includes phosphatidylinositide 4,5-diphosphate and inositol 6-phosphate (11Voglmaier S.M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that another protein, named Eps15, also interacts with the α-subunit (13Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Begue B. Megarbane B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Google Scholar). This interaction involves regions at the carboxyl terminus of Eps15 and of the α-chain of AP-2, respectively (14Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Google Scholar). plasma membrane clathrin-associated protein complex also referred to as adaptor Golgi clathrin-associated protein complex Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline epidermal growth factor guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Eps15 is a 100-kDa protein, currently of unknown function, that was originally discovered as a phosphorylation substrate of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase (15Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Google Scholar). A prominent feature of Eps15 is the existence of three relatively conserved domains of about 70 amino acid residues referred to as EH domains which are located in its amino terminus (16Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Google Scholar). EH domains are also found in several other molecules, including the yeast protein End3p, a molecule required for the endocytosis of α-factor pheromone in yeast cells (17Benedetti H.S. Paths F. Crausaz F. Riesman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Google Scholar). As a step in understanding the function of Eps15 in mammalian cells, we have investigated the intracellular distribution of Eps15. Here we show that there is a pool of Eps15 that is membrane-bound and that virtually all of these molecules are complexed to AP-2. Furthermore, we have used a combination of immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy techniques to demonstrate that the membrane-bound form of Eps15 localizes to endocytic clathrin-coated pits and coated vesicles. An unexpected result was the strong asymmetric localization of Eps15 in the coated structures, most notably to the edges of forming coated pits and to the rims of budding coated vesicles. Based on these observations, we discuss several possible roles of Eps15 in the clathrin-mediated traffic pathway. Polyclonal antibodies to αC (Ab31) and β-subunits (Ab32) and the monoclonal antibody to the β-subunit have been described previously (18Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Google Scholar). 2K. Clairmont, W. Boll, and T. Kirchhausen, submitted for publication. The monoclonal antibody AC1-M11 that recognize α-subunits of AP-2 was a gift from Dr. M. S. Robinson (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK). Polyclonal (Ab577) and monoclonal (6G4) antibodies to Eps15 were kindly provided by Dr. P. P. Di Fiore (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) and Dr. N. Cerf-Bensussan (INSERM, Paris, France), respectively. A monoclonal antibody to the clathrin heavy chain (X-22) and α-subunit (AP-6) were a gift of F. Brodsky (UCSF, San Francisco). Clathrin-coated vesicles were isolated from bovine brain as described (7Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Google Scholar, 19Shih W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31083-31090Google Scholar). EGF was purchased from Collaborative Research Inc. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells expressing approximately 4 × 105 human EGF receptors per cell were derived by single-cell cloning of pCO 11 cells (20Velu T.J. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Beguinot L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1772-1778Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 35-100-mm dishes (Costar) as described (18Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Google Scholar) and used for experiments when confluent. Cells treated or not treated with EGF were washed with Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS) and lysed in TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 544 μM iodoacetamide, 10 g/ml aprotinin). This procedure allows the complete solubilization of the cytosolic pool and the partial solubilization of membrane-associated pools of AP-2 (18Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Google Scholar, 21Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Google Scholar). In other experiments designed to separate the cytosol and membrane fractions, cells were mildly permeabilized by incubation in 0.02% saponin in CMF-PBS, containing 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors, for 30 min at 4°C. After removal of the saponin fraction, the permeabilized cells containing the membrane-bound proteins were washed with CMF-PBS and solubilized by scraping the cells away from the dish with a rubber policeman in TGH containing 1% sodium deoxycholate (TGH-deoxycholate) followed by gentle rotation for 10 min at 4°C. The TGH lysates, the saponin, and TGH-deoxycholate fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and incubated with antibodies to APs (Ab31, Ab32) or Eps15 (6G4, Ab577) for 3 h at 4°C and then 1 h after the addition of Protein A-Sepharose. Unrelated rabbit IgG (Zymed) were used to control for nonspecific immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with cold CMF-PBS or TGH supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and then once without NaCl. The SDS-gel electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blot analysis were carried out as described (18Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Google Scholar, 21Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Google Scholar). The top (above the 116-kDa molecular mass marker) and bottom portions of the nitrocellulose membrane were blotted with antibody to Eps15 and α-subunits (AC1-M11, Ab31), respectively. Sheep antibodies to mouse IgG (Cappel Inc.) or Protein A (Zymed Inc.) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used, with the enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, DuPont NEN, or Pierce), to detect primary mouse or rabbit antibodies, respectively. A Bio-Rad PhosphorImager was used for quantitation. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature and permeabilized with CMF-PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal X-22 or AP-6 and rabbit polyclonal Ab577 precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min), washed intensively, and then incubated with secondary anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Texas Red or fluorescein (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in the same buffer at room temperature. A Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope equipped with 100 × objective lens, and the single fluorochrome filter sets for either Texas Red, fluorescein, or simultaneous Texas Red/fluorescein fluorescence were used for visualization and recording the images. Cells grown in tissue culture dishes were rinsed once with CMF-PBS and then released from the dishes by incubation with CMF-PBS supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA. 800 μl of the cell suspension was layered in an Eppendorf tube on top of a 200-μl cushion solution containing 8% paraformaldehyde (in 200 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 3 min at 3,000 rpm. The supernatant was carefully removed, and fresh 8% paraformaldehyde solution was added. After 1 h fixation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm and left overnight at 4°C. The pellets were then infiltrated for 15 min with a solution containing 2.1 M sucrose in PBS and then frozen by placing the Eppendorf tube in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were sectioned at −120°C, and the sections were transferred to formvar-carbon-coated copper grids; the grids were then placed on top of a drop of PBS and processed for immunogold labeling as described previously (22Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, FRG1993Google Scholar). Briefly, stock solutions containing the antibodies and the gold-conjugated protein A were dissolved in 0.5% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm prior to labeling. Grids were floated on drops with 0.5% fish skin gelatin for 10 min to prevent nonspecific labeling and then transferred for 3 min to 5-μl drops containing the primary antibodies (rabbit serum specific for Eps15, Ab577, or mouse mAb specific for the β-subunit of AP-1 and AP-2). The grids were rinsed by transfer onto 0.5-ml drops of PBS (15 min) followed by incubation on 5 μl of protein A-gold for 20 min. In the case of the mAb, an additional incubation step with a rabbit-anti-mouse antibody was needed prior to protein A-gold incubation. Two final 15-min washes in 0.5 ml of PBS and in double-distilled water were performed prior to a 10-min contrasting/embedding step in 0.3% uranyl acetate dissolved in 2% methyl cellulose. The grids were examined in a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope and images recorded at a primary magnification of 25,000. Triton X-100 lysates of NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with the polyclonal antibodies directed against the αC-subunit (Ab31) or against the β-subunit of AP-2 (Ab32), and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of Eps15 by Western blot analysis. As was originally shown by Benmerah and co-workers (13Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Begue B. Megarbane B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Google Scholar), Eps15 co-immunoprecipitates with AP-2 (Fig. 1A). The observed co-precipitation of Eps15 with anti-β antibody was 5- to 6-fold more efficient than with anti-αC antibody. The low efficiency of Ab31, specific for epitopes located in the αC-ear/hinge domain (18Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Google Scholar) to co-immunoprecipitate Eps15, is probably due to its inability to recognize AP-2 complexes containing αA-subunit, and by steric hindrance presented by Eps15 when bound to the α-ear/hinge (14Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Google Scholar). In the converse experiment, immunoprecipitation with antibody specific for Eps15 brings down about 5-10% of the total AP-2 present in the TGH lysate as monitored by the appearance of signals for αA and αC chains (Fig. 1A). The Triton X-100 extraction allows the release of the cytosolic and, partially, the membrane pool of AP-2 while 40-50% of total cellular AP-2 remains insoluble (21Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Google Scholar). To differentiate between the cytosolic and the membrane-bound forms of AP-2, a two-step detergent extraction was used. The cells, still adherent to the tissue culture dish, were permeabilized with 0.02% saponin which permits the release of cytosolic components including APs while preserving the membrane-bound form of AP-2. Retention of membrane-bound forms of AP-2 and clathrin in coated pits was confirmed from the inspection of the images of these cells generated by immunofluorescence labeling of clathrin and AP-2 (not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that the association of Eps15 with AP-2 in the cytosolic fraction is maintained after the saponin treatment (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, it was found that these proteins also remain in association in the membrane-bound fraction (Fig. 1B). The association is robust enough that it even survives treatment of the membrane-bound fraction with a mixture of Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate (TGH-deoxycholate), a condition previously shown to release all AP-2 complexes from membranes (26Takel K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Google Scholar). Analysis of the remaining supernatants revealed that the fractions were almost completely depleted of Eps15 by the antibody to β-subunit Ab32 (Fig. 1C). Within the limits of sensitivity of the assay, the data are consistent with a situation where most if not all Eps15 is complexed with AP-2 in the cell. In contrast, when the Eps15 antibody is used to bring down the complexes, not more than 10-20% of the total cytosolic and 2-3% of membrane-bound AP-2 is able to co-immunoprecipitate with Eps15 (Fig. 1B). These results are in agreement with earlier observations indicating that most AP-2 complexes are not bound to Eps15 (13Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Begue B. Megarbane B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that a limited portion of AP-2 is associated at any given time with Eps15. Since Eps15 becomes phosphorylated upon cell stimulation with EGF, it has been proposed that Eps15 may play a direct role in the recruitment of AP-2 to the EGF receptor (23Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Google Scholar). We were unable, however to observe any effect of EGF on Eps15/AP-2 association in NIH 3T3 or in A-431 cells stimulated with 80 nM EGF for 3-60 min (data not shown). To study whether Eps15 and AP-2 are located in the same membrane compartments, double immunofluorescence staining of NIH 3T3 cells with Eps15 and AP-2 antibodies was performed. Fig. 2 shows that Eps15 staining produced a punctate pattern that is typical of clathrin-coated pits. In fact, most dots corresponding to Eps15 co-localize with dots corresponding to AP-2 (Fig. 2, A-C). Some labeling was observed with Eps15 which did not co-localize with AP-2, especially in the perinuclear region; this region, corresponding to the trans-Golgi network, is identified by immunolocalization of AP-1 (data not shown). That the co-localization of Eps15 with AP-2 is indeed taking place in clathrin-coated areas was established by co-staining the cells with the Eps15 and the clathrin antibody (Fig. 2, D-F). The majority but not all clathrin spots contain detectable amounts of Eps15 suggesting that some coats do not contain Eps15, or the amounts of Eps15 are not sufficient to be detected by the immunofluorescence method. A similar pattern of co-localization of Eps15 and clathrin was observed in A-431 cells (data not shown). From these data we conclude that clathrin-coated areas, containing AP-2 complexes, define the cellular region containing most if not all of the membrane-bound Eps15. The intracellular localization of Eps15 in NIH 3T3 cells was further investigated by immunoelectron microscopic visualization of ultrathin sections incubated with the polyclonal antibody specific for Eps15 followed by labeling with protein A-gold (Fig. 3). Analysis of many fields showed the presence of gold particles at the plasma membrane, mostly along the profiles containing the electron-dense appearance at the cytosolic phase that is characteristic of clathrin-coated pits. The gold particles were also found in membrane profiles that are characteristic of clathrin-coated vesicles. The same types of structures were labeled by the monoclonal antibody specific for the β-subunits of AP-1 and AP-2, confirming their assignment as clathrin-coated structures. Closer inspection of the pattern of Eps15 labeling showed, however, a surprising result. In every coated pit analyzed, the gold particles were always found at the edge of the coated area. Likewise, when the pit was deeper and more invaginated, the gold particles were concentrated at the rim of the coat. These results suggest a relative depletion of Eps15 in the deeper parts of the invaginations. We note the possibility that clathrin/AP coats (or other unknown proteins) might interfere with the accessibility of the Eps15 antibody preventing labeling of Eps15 within the coat. Although this possibility cannot be completely ruled out, it would seem unlikely, since Eps15 labeling was readily detected throughout the outline of profiles corresponding to coated vesicles (Fig. 3) even though these structures are completely surrounded by the same clathrin/AP coat of coated pits. In contrast to the asymmetric distribution of Eps15 in coated pits, labeling for AP-2 was always detected along the complete coated pit profile (Fig. 3). A-431 cells studied in the same way also showed preferential labeling of the edges and rims of coated pits (data not shown). These observations suggest that the unexpected localization of Eps15, presumably to the growing portion of the coat, is a common feature in all clathrin pits and in all cells. Presence of Eps15 in clathrin-coated vesicles was confirmed biochemically by Western blot analysis of coated vesicles isolated from bovine brains. An immunogenic protein of the same electrophoretic mobility as Eps15 derived from NIH 3T3 cells could be readily detected in purified coated vesicles (data not shown). It is presumed that Eps15 also interacts with AP-2 in the coated vesicles, but this remains to be determined. The general conclusion from the observations presented here is that endocytic clathrin-coated areas, containing AP-2 complexes, define the cellular region where most if not all of the membrane-bound Eps15 is found. We were surprised by the preferential position of Eps15 to the rims of coated pits and can only make some suggestions of possible functions of this protein. Sequence analysis of Eps15 predicts an extended α-helical region on the middle of the protein; it is possible that Eps15 exists as a dimer that interacts simultaneously with two AP-2 complexes. This could change the local concentration of AP-2 at the edge of an assembling coated pit, promoting local curvature by facilitating the formation of pentagonal facets in the clathrin lattice. A second possibility is that Eps15 is an adaptor that recruits other proteins to the forming clathrin/AP-2 coat. These proteins could be membrane receptors that become trapped in the coated pit. It has been suggested that Eps15 aids in the recruitment of the EGF receptor (23Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Google Scholar), although there is no evidence to date that a complex is formed in vivo between Eps15 and EGF receptors (15Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Google Scholar, 24Schumacher C. Knudsen B.S. Ohuchi T. Di Fiore P.P. Glassman R.H. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15341-15347Google Scholar). As a third possibility, Eps15 could recruit molecules involved in the membrane budding process itself perhaps acting at the stage of pit invagination or vesicle scission. It is believed that the latter stage is regulated by dynamin, a protein that also displays a preferential localization to the membrane portion connecting the budding vesicle to the donor membrane (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Google Scholar, 26Takel K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Google Scholar). An interesting difference between Eps15 and dynamin, is that, as has been shown here, the localization of Eps15 to the rim of pits is detected with wild-type Eps15 and under normal physiological conditions. In contrast, only cells containing mutant forms of dynamin or cell fragments incubated with modified nucleotides like GTPγS show the asymmetric distribution of dynamin (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Google Scholar, 26Takel K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Google Scholar). A fourth possibility is that Eps15 is a part of the putative docking machinery responsible for the specific targeting of AP-2 to the plasma membrane. Lastly, it has been noted that EH domains bind to several cytosolic proteins, although their identity and function is still unknown (16Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P.

These studies were performed in strains expressing a conditional temperature-sensitive mutant allele of the hsp82 gene, which encodes Hsp90 protein. At the restrictive temperature in the mutant, there is a decrease in hormone-dependent transactivation by the AR, although steady state levels of AR protein are unchanged. Quantitative hormone binding studies at the permissive temperature revealed the presence of both high affinity and low affinity hormone binding states.

The change in hormone binding affinity was further investigated by a competition assay with the anti-androgen hydroxyflutamide. Under permissive conditions, hydroxyflutamide competes poorly for the synthetic androgen R1881, but under restrictive conditions in the hsp82 mutant strain, hydroxyflutamide was shown to be a potent competitive inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W2030858690,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of cytosolic superoxide dismutase (Sod1) results in several air-dependent mutant phenotypes, including methionine auxotrophy and oxygen sensitivity. Here we report that these two sod1Δ phenotypes were specifically suppressed by elevated expression of the TKL1 gene, encoding transketolase of the pentose phosphate pathway. The apparent connection between Sod1 and the pentose phosphate pathway prompted an investigation of mutants defective in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting NADPH-producing step of this pathway. We confirmed that zwf1Δ mutants are methionine auxotrophs and report that they also are oxygen-sensitive. We determined that a functional ZWF1 gene product was required for TKL1 to suppress sod1Δ, leading us to propose that increased flux through the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway can rescue sod1 methionine auxotrophy. To better understand this methionine growth requirement, we examined the sulfur compound requirements of sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutants, and noted that these mutants exhibit the same apparent defect in sulfur assimilation. Our studies suggest that this defect results from the impaired redox status of aerobically grown sod1 and zwf1 mutants, implicating Sod1 and the pentose phosphate pathway as being critical for maintenance of the cellular redox state.

Aerobic organisms are constantly exposed to potentially harmful reactive oxygen species that are generated as by-products of cellular metabolism. These oxygen free radicals have the potential to damage critical cellular components such as DNA, proteins, and lipids (see Refs. 1Bostek C. J. Am. Assoc. Nur. Anes. 1989; 57: 231-237Google Scholar and 2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York1985Google Scholar for review). However, aerobic organisms have evolved with both enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidant defense mechanisms that are designed for protection against such assaults. Non-enzymatic defenses include the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and the small peptide thioredoxin (Trx), while enzymatic defenses include catalases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutases (Ref. 1Bostek C. J. Am. Assoc. Nur. Anes. 1989; 57: 231-237Google Scholar; review). Superoxide dismutases (SOD) 1The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutasePAPSphosphoadenylyl sulfate. are metallo-enzymes that scavenge the potentially harmful superoxide anion (O⨪2) and represent a critical component of the oxidant stress protection system (3Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 239-257Google Scholar). superoxide dismutase phosphoadenylyl sulfate. The unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or bakers' yeast, provides an ideal model system in which to study the metabolism of oxygen free radicals. Yeast contain the same oxidative stress defense mechanisms present in higher eukaryotes (see Ref. 4Moradas-Ferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Google Scholar for review), and are extremely amenable to genetic, biochemical, and molecular biological manipulation. S. cerevisiae contains two forms of SOD, encoded by the SOD1 and SOD2 genes. Sod2 is a mitochondrial, manganese-bound SOD (Mn-SOD), which is thought to provide protection from respiratory sources of oxygen radicals (5Marres C. Loon A.V. Oudshoorn P. Steeg H.V. Grivell L. Slater E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 153-161Google Scholar, 6Guidot D.M. McCord J.M. Wright R.W. Repine J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26699-26703Google Scholar). SOD1 encodes a copper- and zinc-bound SOD (Cu,Zn-SOD), which is reported to be cytosolic or peroxisomal (7Bermingham-McDonogh O. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4789-4793Google Scholar, 8Chang L. Slot J.W. Geuza H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Google Scholar, 9Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 7381-7385Google Scholar), yet the precise function of this SOD is not completely understood. Yeast mutants that lack the Cu,Zn-SOD, due to gene deletion, exhibit several mutant phenotypes when grown in air. These sod1Δ mutants are auxotrophic for the amino acids lysine and methionine, but only when grown aerobically (see Ref. 11Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Google Scholar for review). The molecular basis of these phenotypes remains elusive. The lysine auxotrophy may be due to a defect in lysine biosynthesis caused by oxidative inactivation of an, as yet undetermined, enzyme (12Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Google Scholar). The sod1 methionine auxotrophy is also not fully understood, but thought to be due to a defect in sulfur metabolism (13Chang E. Kosman D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar). In addition, the sod1Δ mutants are also sensitive to oxygen and exhibit extreme sensitivity to the O⨪2-generating agent, paraquat (11Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Google Scholar). Several suppressors of sod1 null mutations have been isolated in our laboratory that have the ability to reverse sod1 mutant phenotypes. The pmr1(bsd1) (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar) and bsd2 (15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Google Scholar) mutational suppressors were isolated as spontaneous suppressors of sod1Δ lysine auxotrophy. The ATX1 (16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar) and ATX2 2S. J. Lin and V. C. Culotta (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, in press. genes were isolated as multi-copy suppressors, also based upon their reversal of sod1Δ lysine auxotrophy. These suppressors share in common the ability to alleviate all sod1-related defects, including lysine and methionine auxotrophies, oxygen sensitivity, and paraquat toxicity. All of the BSD and ATX gene products have been demonstrated to function in metal ion homeostasis, and their sod1 suppression is mediated through hyperaccumulation of either copper or manganese ions (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar, 15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Google Scholar, 16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar).2 The metal ions are thought to relieve the requirement for Sod1 by acting as SOD “mimics” to detoxify oxygen radicals. To better understand the cellular function of the Sod1 protein and the consequences of its inactivation, we isolated multi-copy suppressors that would rescue specific sod1Δ-related phenotypes. The work reported here describes the isolation of such a suppressor, the TKL1 gene, encoding the transketolase enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. The identification of TKL1 as a sod1 suppressor provided an opportunity to explore the role of the pentose phosphate pathway in protection against oxidative stress in yeast. This work has improved our understanding of the sod1 methionine auxotrophy and has provided insight into the relationships between the Cu,Zn-SOD, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the critical maintenance of the cellular redox state. The S. cerevisiae yeast strains used in these studies are listed in Table I. Strain KS105 was constructed by introducing the SOD1 gene replacement plasmid pKS3 (18Culotta V.C. Joh H.-D. Lin S.-J. Slekar K.H. Strain J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29991-29997Google Scholar) into strain 1783. Strains KS113 and KS117 were constructed by introducing the ZWF1 replacement plasmid pBM2720 (19Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Google Scholar) into strains 1783 and KS105, respectively. Strain KS114 was obtained by deleting the TAL1 gene of 1783 using the gene replacement plasmid pΔTAL1:LEU2 (20Schaaff I. Hohmann S. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 597-603Google Scholar). Strains KS115 and KS116 were constructed by introducing the TKL1 or TKL2 replacement plasmids pΔTKL1:URA3 (21Schaaff-Gerstenschlager I. Zimmermann F.K. Curr.

Biochem. 1993; 217: 487-492Google Scholar), respectively, into strain 1783. Strains KS109, KS121, and KS122 were obtained by deleting the PMR1 gene of strains KS105, KS113, and KS117, respectively, using the PMR1 replacement plasmid PL119 (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into yeast by electroporation (23Becker D. Guarente L.

Muller Open table in a new tab Stocks of all strains were maintained on YPD medium, and tests for methionine auxotrophy, lysine auxotrophy, and paraquat sensitivity (methyl viologen; Sigma) were carried out using a synthetic dextrose (SD) medium as described previously (25Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 178-179Google Scholar), supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. Anaerobic cultures were maintained by growth in a O2-depleted culture jar (BBL Gas Pak) (12Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Google Scholar). Liquid tests for sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen were carried out as reported previously (12Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Google Scholar), using YLD medium (yeast extract, dextrose-based medium in a potassium phosphate buffer; Ref. 26Galiazzo F. Ciriolo M.R. Carri M.T. Civitareale P. Marcocci L. Marmocchi F. Rotilio G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 545-549Google Scholar). As is the case with plate assays, this liquid test was a measure of total cell growth (quantitated turbidimetrically at an optical density of 600 nm) and not cell doubling times. For sulfur supplementation experiments, yeast strains were grown in methionine-free synthetic dextrose medium that was based upon the sulfur-free medium described by Chang and Kosman (13Chang E. Kosman D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar) and Cherest and Surdin-Kerjan (27Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1992; 130: 51-58Google Scholar). The medium was buffered to pH 6.0 with phosphate and made solid by adding 1% agarose, to reduce potential sulfur contamination (27Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1992; 130: 51-58Google Scholar). Where appropriate, L-methionine, sodium sulfate, sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate (all obtained from Sigma), or sodium sulfide (Aldrich) were added to the medium after autoclaving, at concentrations indicated in the text and Fig. 7 legend. A previously described S. cerevisiae genomic library (28Culotta V.C. Howard W.R. Liu X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25295-25302Google Scholar), in the YEp13 shuttle vector (29Schneider J.C. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 373-388Google Scholar), was used to isolate multi-copy suppressors as described under “Results.” Plasmid pKS10 represents the original 5.3-kilobase YEp13-TKL1 plasmid isolated from this library. Overexpression of TKL2 and ATX1 were achieved using plasmids pTKL2 (22Schaaff-Gerstenschlager I. Mannhaupt G. Vetter I. Zimmermann F.K. Feldmann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 487-492Google Scholar) and p18 (16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar), respectively. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was carried out using the Sequenase method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and Southern blot analysis was conducted according to standard procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Experiments were undertaken to identify yeast genes that, when present in multiple copies per cell, could suppress distinct sod1Δ mutant phenotypes. A yeast genomic library in the multi-copy vector YEp13 was used to transform the sod1Δ yeast strain KS105, and transformants were grown anaerobically prior to replica plating in triplicate onto medium lacking lysine, medium lacking methionine, and medium supplemented with 0.5 mM paraquat. The parental sod1Δ strain was unable to grow in air under any of these conditions, and transformants were selected that exhibited suppression of one or more of these sod1Δ mutant phenotypes. This strategy resulted in the isolation of the SOD1 gene, the ATX1 gene (16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar), and a 5.3-kilobase genomic fragment not corresponding to any known suppressor of sod1Δ (as determined by Southern blot analysis, not shown). The SOD1 and ATX1 genes reversed all three sod1Δ-linked phenotypes, while the new suppressor appeared specific for methionine auxotrophy. The genomic insert corresponding to this sod1Δ suppressor was partially sequenced, and used to search the GenBank™ data base for identity of known yeast genes. This search revealed 100% identity to a region of the genome on chromosome XVI that included the TKL1 gene, and deletion analysis revealed that the TKL1 gene itself was responsible for the suppression of sod1Δ (data not shown). S. cerevisiae TKL1 encodes the primary transketolase of the pentose phosphate pathway, depicted in Fig. 1 (31Fletcher T.S. Kwee I.L. Nakada T. Largman C. Martin B.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1892-1896Google Scholar, 32Berthon H.A. Kuchel P.W. Nixon P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12792-12798Google Scholar, 33Sundstrom M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Hellman U. Ronne H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24346-24352Google Scholar). This pathway has both an oxidative portion that directly produces NADPH and a non-oxidative portion that can ultimately feed back to the oxidative segment via glucose 6-phosphate (32Berthon H.A. Kuchel P.W. Nixon P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12792-12798Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, the aerobic methionine auxotrophy of sod1Δ mutants was fully rescued by overexpression of TKL1, but not by other genes in the non-oxidative half of the pentose phosphate pathway. Overexpression of TKL2 (Fig. 2A), which encodes a secondary transketolase in yeast (22Schaaff-Gerstenschlager I. Mannhaupt G. Vetter I. Zimmermann F.K. Feldmann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 487-492Google Scholar), or TAL1, encoding transaldolase (data not shown), had no effect on the sod1Δ mutant. Consistent with these findings, studies by Berthon et al. (32Berthon H.A. Kuchel P.W. Nixon P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12792-12798Google Scholar) have shown that Tkl1 is rate-limiting for the non-oxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway.Fig. 2Suppression of sod1Δ mutant phenotypes by TKL1. A, the indicated isogenic yeast strains were plated onto leucine-free SD solid medium that either contained methionine and lysine (+met+lys) or was lacking methionine (−met) or lacking lysine (−lys). Plates were grown for 3 days in air. Strains 1783 (wild type) and KS105 (sod1Δ) harbored the YEp13 plasmid. sod1Δ + TKL2 and sod1Δ + TKL1 refer to strain KS105 harboring plasmids pTKL2 and pKS10, respectively. B, strain KS107 (sod1Δ), transformed with YEp13 (vector), p18 (ATX1), or pKS10 (TKL1), was tested for sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen. Total cell growth was monitored in identical cultures grown either anaerobically or well aerated by shaking in air (aerobic). Final culture turbidity is expressed as optical density at 600 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Overexpression of TKL1 also improved the aerobic growth of the sod1Δ mutant in the presence of methionine (Fig. 2A), and this effect of TKL1 was confirmed in a liquid culture test for oxygen sensitivity. Yeast strains harboring a sod1Δ mutation grow poorly in an enriched liquid medium under well aerated conditions (12Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Google Scholar), a phenotype that is reversed by overexpression of ATX1 (Fig. 2B) and the ATX2, pmr1, and bsd2 suppressors of Sod1 deficiency (12Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Google Scholar).2 In this same test for sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen, elevated expression of TKL1 also facilitated efficient growth of the sod1Δ mutant strain under well aerated conditions (Fig. 2B). However, TKL1 was incapable of reversing the lysine auxotrophy of sod1 yeast (Fig. 2A), and also did not appreciably suppress the paraquat sensitivity of these cells (Table II). These results demonstrate the specificity of TKL1 for relieving the methionine auxotrophy and poor aerobic growth of sod1Δ cells. This pattern of suppression is unlike that of the previously identified sod1Δ suppressors ATX1, ATX2, bsd2, or pmr1, which indiscriminately reverse all aerobic defects associated with loss of Sod1 (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar, 15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Google Scholar, 16Lin S. Culotta V.C.

Open table in a new tab The suppression of sod1Δ by ATX1, ATX2, pmr1, and bsd2 has been linked to altered metal ion homeostasis resulting in elevated cellular accumulation of either copper or manganese ions (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar, 15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Google Scholar, 16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar).2 However, these metals do not appear to play a role in TKL1-mediated suppression of sod1Δ, as atomic absorption analysis indicated no change in cellular levels of copper or manganese ions with elevated TKL1 expression (data not shown). Furthermore, TKL1 was still capable of reversing sod1Δ defects when cells were grown in a medium depleted of copper and manganese (data not shown), a treatment known to block the suppression of Sod1 deficiency by the ATX genes and pmr1 (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar, 16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar).2 Hence, TKL1 operates through a mechanism not involving metals to specifically suppress the methionine auxotrophy and poor aerobic growth defects of yeast lacking Sod1. A likely explanation for the TKL1 suppression of Sod1 deficiency is an increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, activating the oxidative portion and leading to enhanced production of the cellular reductant, NADPH. To test this, we asked whether blocking the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway would prevent TKL1-mediated suppression of sod1Δ. Such a blockage was imposed by deleting the ZWF1 gene, encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting step in the oxidative segment of the pathway that produces NADPH (Fig. 1). In a strain containing double mutations in SOD1 and ZWF1, TKL1 overexpression no longer had the ability to reverse the methionine auxotrophy or poor aerobic growth specific to sod1Δ mutations (Fig. 3). This result strongly indicated that TKL1 suppresses Sod1 deficiency through a mechanism dependent upon Zwf1 and the oxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway. Since overexpression of TKL1 provided some amelioration of oxidative stress in an sod1Δ mutant, we wanted to determine whether disruption of the pentose phosphate pathway would result in oxygen sensitivity. To address the effects of enzymes in the non-oxidative portion of the pathway, we deleted the genes encoding Tkl1, Tkl2, and Tal1, alone and in combination with sod1Δ mutations. These gene deletions did not cause a dependence on methionine or lysine for aerobic growth (data not shown), and also did not enhance sensitivity toward paraquat (data not shown) or atmospheric oxygen (Fig. 4B). In contrast to these results obtained with gene deletions of the non-oxidative segment, oxygen resistance was substantially compromised by blocking the oxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway through a ZWF1 deletion. In confirmation of earlier reports (34Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 547-553Google Scholar), zwf1Δ strains are partially auxotrophic for methionine, yet this defect is not as severe as that of sod1Δ strains (Fig. 4A). Like sod1Δ, the methionine independent growth of zwf1Δ strains was improved by culturing under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4A). The zwf1Δ strain also exhibited impaired aerobic growth even in medium supplemented with methionine, which was demonstrated in a liquid test for oxygen sensitivity. In this experiment, both the zwf1Δ strain and the sod1Δ strain exhibited striking sensitivity toward atmospheric levels of oxygen in well aerated cultures (Fig. 4B). In parallel anaerobic cultures, these mutant strains exhibited wild type levels of growth (data not shown). Interestingly, the combination of null mutations in ZWF1 and SOD1 resulted in a profound aerobic growth defect more severe than that of either mutant alone, that could even be observed using solid medium (Fig. 4A). This apparent “synthetic lethal” effect of sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutations was rescued by growing the double mutant strain under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4A). A further comparison of sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutant phenotypes revealed that, while both are methionine auxotrophs, only sod1Δ is auxotrophic for lysine and sensitive to paraquat (Table II). Because sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutants both exhibit a defect in methionine biosynthesis and a sensitivity to oxygen, it was of interest to determine whether known suppressors of sod1Δ also have the ability to suppress zwf1Δ. We have divided these suppressors into two classes: those that work through transition metal homeostasis (i.e. pmr1, bsd2, and the ATX genes), and TKL1, which works through the pentose phosphate pathway. Expressing the TKL1 gene on a multi-copy plasmid did not suppress the methionine auxotrophy of zwf1Δ (data not shown), while TKL1 completely suppressed the methionine auxotrophy of sod1Δ (Fig. 2A). As a representative of the metal transport suppressors, we investigated the effect of pmr1 mutations (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar). A pmr1Δ mutation did not rescue methionine auxotrophy in a zwf1Δ strain, although this mutation was fully capable of reversing the sod1Δ defect (Fig. 5). In the background of the sod1Δ zwf1Δ double mutant, the pmr1Δ mutation rescued methionine auxotrophy and poor aerobic growth to precisely the same level observed with the zwf1Δ mutant alone (Fig. 5). Hence, pmr1 mutations and TKL1 overexpression are highly specific for suppressing Sod1 deficiency and cannot reverse the oxidative stress effects of a zwf1Δ mutation. The finding that elevated expression of the pentose phosphate pathway gene, TKL1, rescued sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy strongly suggested that the methionine requirement of sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutants may be intimately related. NADPH is presumably the common denominator. Mutants of sod1 are known to possess lowered levels of NADPH under aerobic, but not anaerobic conditions (13Chang E. Kosman D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar). In addition, we recently found that NADPH levels are lowered in aerobically grown sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutants to levels that are 59% and 67% that of an isogenic wild type strain, respectively (high performance liquid chromatography analysis of pyridine nucleotide levels; data not shown). We therefore wanted to determine whether the NADPH requiring steps in methionine biosynthesis were similarly affected in sod1Δ and zwf1Δ strains. As shown in Fig. 6, the PAPS reductase and sulfite reductase steps of sulfur assimilation both utilize NADPH, and in the case of PAPS reductase, NADPH is needed to reduce the Trx co-factor (35Porque P.G. Baldesten A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2371-2374Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that a trx1Δtrx2Δ double mutant, which lacks both thioredoxin genes, is also auxotrophic for methionine (36Muller E.G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Google Scholar). To address whether the two reductase steps in sulfur assimilation are similarly affected by loss of Sod1, Zwf1, or Trx, supplementation experiments were performed. Intermediates of the sulfur assimilation pathway were added to sulfur-free growth medium, and were examined for the ability to rescue the methionine auxotrophy of sod1Δ, zwf1Δ, and trx1Δ trx2Δ mutants in parallel. The supplementation of either sulfite (0.05-0.3 mM) or sulfide (0.05-0.15 mM) alone did not significantly improve methionine independent growth of any of these mutant strains (data not shown). However, as reported previously (13Chang E. Kosman D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar, 37Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2021-2028Google Scholar), sulfite and sulfide proved to be toxic at relatively low concentrations in these experiments, which may have masked any capacity these single agents might have for rescuing the methionine defects. In an attempt to detect a possible additive effect of these agents, sulfite and sulfide were supplied in combination to the growth medium at very low concentrations. In this case, methionine auxotrophy was partially reversed in all three mutant strains examined (Fig. 7). We also tested the effect of thiosulfate, which is far less toxic to the yeast strains, and can feed into sulfide (and perhaps sulfite as well) through the action of thiosulfate reductase (38Chauncey T.R. Westley J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 744: 304-311Google Scholar). Thiosulfate has previously been reported to rescue the methionine auxotrophy of yeast strains containing a point mutation in SOD1 (13Chang E. Kosman D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar), and we confirmed this finding with our sod1Δ strain (Fig. 7). Significantly, the addition of thiosulfate also completely relieved the methionine growth requirement of strains lacking Zwf1 and Trx (Fig. 7). The striking resemblance between the zwf1Δ, sod1Δ, and trx1Δ trx2Δ strains in their response to sulfur compound supplementation strongly suggests that the same biosynthetic step is affected in all three mutants. Our findings demonstrate that this common block in sulfur assimilation occurs upstream of sulfide, and that the PAPS reductase and/or the sulfite reductase steps may be affected by the loss of Sod1 and Zwf1 activity. The pentose phosphate pathway is considered to be a major source of cellular reducing power, with the ZWF1 gene product (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) catalyzing the key NADPH-producing step. It is well documented that this pathway and, specifically, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase play a protective role during oxidative stress (39Kletzien R.K. Harris P.K.W. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Google Scholar, 40Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Google Scholar). Here we report experiments designed to further understand the role of another key player in oxidative stress protection, Sod1, and find an interesting overlap between Sod1 and the pentose phosphate pathway. We discovered that elevated expression of the S. cerevisiae transketolase gene of the pentose phosphate pathway had the ability to suppress specific oxidative stress phenotypes caused by Sod1 deficiency. In studying the mechanism of this TKL1-mediated suppression, we uncovered an intriguing connection between SOD1, NADPH, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Our studies show that the ability of TKL1 to suppress Sod1 deficiency is absolutely dependent on Zwf1 and the oxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway that produces NADPH. We therefore propose that expression of TKL1 results in an increased flux through the pathway, generating more NADPH, which relieves specific sod1 mutant phenotypes. This model is based upon the knowledge that TKL1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the non-oxidative reactions of the pathway, and that cells that are in demand for NADPH convert pentose phosphate pathway-generated fructose 6-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate, for recycling through the oxidative reactions (32Berthon H.A. Kuchel P.W. Nixon P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12792-12798Google Scholar). A prediction of our TKL1 suppression model would be that elevated expression of ZWF1 should also create more flux through the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway, and should also suppress Sod1 deficiency. However, we were unable to test this possibility since ZWF1 is known be under tight control in yeast, with no increase in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity detected with increased ZWF1 expression (19Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Google Scholar). We nevertheless were able to evaluate the association between Zwf1 and Sod1 through ZWF1 gene deletion experiments. Our gene deletion studies show that Zwf1 and Sod1 play overlapping, but not redundant, roles in oxidative stress resistance. Cells lacking either one of these factors share in common an auxotrophic requirement for methionine and poor aerobic growth (Table II). The sod1Δ mutants are additionally auxotrophic for lysine and are sensitive to paraquat, but zwf1Δ cells are not. Significantly, the same two phenotypes that are shared by sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutants are those that are specifically suppressed in a sod1Δ strain by overexpression of TKL1 (Table II). These findings strongly indicate that the methionine dependence and poor aerobic growth of sod1Δ mutants result from a compromise in aerobic NADPH levels. In support of this model, we found that aerobically grown sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutants have total NADPH levels that are 59-67% that of an isogenic wild type strain. The reduction in NADPH levels in sod1Δ mutants presumably reflects the increased consumption of this pyridine nucleotide during oxidative stress by molecules such as glutathione. This same demand for NADPH under aerobic conditions helps to explain why the methionine auxotrophy and poor aerobic growth of zwf1Δ strains are reversed by anaerobiosis. We conclude that sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutations affect the same step(s) in methionine biosynthesis. In a previous study by Thomas et al. (34Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 547-553Google Scholar), it was proposed that the methionine auxotrophy of these two strains must be distinct since the zwf1Δ defect was not rescued by sulfide supplementation, a treatment that had been reported by Chang and Kosman (13Chang E. Kosman D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1840-1845Google Scholar) to partially reverse the methionine auxotrophy of a sod1 mutant. However, the former study did not experimentally compare sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutants side by side (34Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 547-553Google Scholar), and in doing this, we noted that sulfide treatment would not correct either the sod1Δ- or zwf1Δ-related defects, apparently due to sulfide toxicity. Sulfide has been reported to be quite toxic to certain yeast strains (37Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2021-2028Google Scholar), which helps to explain the discrepancy in results obtained by different laboratories. Nevertheless, the sod1Δ and zwf1Δ strains responded identically in our studies to supplementation with other sulfur compounds, demonstrating that the block in sulfur assimilation in both zwf1Δ and sod1Δ mutants exists upstream of sulfide. We propose that this common block is mediated through lowered NADPH availability for the Trx-dependent PAPS reductase and/or the sulfite reductase steps of sulfur assimilation. Although total cellular NADPH levels were lowered by no more than 30-40% in sod1Δ and zwf1Δ mutant strains, the local effect on NADPH levels may be more dramatic. In this regard, it is worth noting that Sod1, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the sulfur assimilation pathway all appear cytosolic (8Chang L. Slot J.W. Geuza H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Google Scholar, 41Wood T. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Academic Press, New York1985Google Scholar, 42Masselot M. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 23-30Google Scholar). Aside from methionine auxotrophy, the overall sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen observed with zwf1Δ and sod1Δ strains is not well understood. However, this phenotype should also involve a reduction in NADPH since this sod1Δ defect is alleviated by TKL1 overexpression. During anaerobic growth, NADPH can be utilized entirely for essential cellular functions such as DNA synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and other reductive biosynthetic processes. However, when cells are grown in air, NADPH must also be used to maintain a level of reduced glutathione to combat oxidative damage. It is therefore quite conceivable that zwf1Δ and sod1Δ mutants grow poorly in air because they are limited for NADPH and their redox state is compromised under these conditions, drawing NADPH away from essential reductive processes. In this manner, the additive effect of a double sod1Δ zwf1Δ mutation should severely compromise the cellular redox state and drastically inhibit aerobic growth, and this is precisely what we have observed. Since its discovery nearly 3 decades ago (43McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Google Scholar), SOD has been thought to directly protect biomolecules from oxidative damage by scavenging O⨪2. The paraquat sensitivity of sod1Δ yeast is certainly consistent with this model, and, in bacteria, loss of SOD has been associated with O⨪2-mediated damage to iron sulfur-containing enzymes (44Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Google Scholar, 45Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1478-1483Google Scholar, 46Flint D. Smyk-Randall E. Tuminello J.F. Draczynska-Lusiak B. Brown O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25547-25552Google Scholar). The lysine biosynthetic defect of sod1Δ yeast may also be attributed to direct attack by O⨪2 or another reduced oxygen species, since this defect is not rescued by the pentose phosphate pathway TKL1 gene. Yet all of the oxygen-related phenotypes of sod1Δ mutants, including lysine auxotrophy, are fully rescued by the bsd and ATX metal transport suppressors that cause increased accumulation of copper or manganese ions (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar, 15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Google Scholar, 16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar).2 We have proposed that these suppressors work on the cause of oxidative damage, and through reactions involving copper or manganese, help to neutralize the O⨪2 or other reduced oxygen species that predominate in sod1Δ strains (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar, 15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Google Scholar, 16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Google Scholar).2 Elevated levels of O⨪2 should not prevail in zwf1Δ strains, and these mutants are therefore refractory to suppression by transition metals (Ref. 34Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 547-553Google Scholar and this report). In comparison to the metal transport suppressors, the TKL1 pentose phosphate suppressor of sod1Δ alleviates a specific effect of oxidative damage and helps to correct the imbalance in the redox state of the cell. Overall, our studies indicate that deleting the S. cerevisiae SOD1 gene has broader ramifications than mere loss of O⨪2 scavenging. Together with the pentose phosphate pathway, Cu,Zn-Sod1 helps to maintain the reducing environment of the cell. We thank T. Miosga, F. Zimmermann, and M.

Carotenoids serve as accessory pigments in the capture of photon energy (1Cogdell R.J. Frank H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 63-79Google Scholar) and efficiently quench the deleterious effects of triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen (2Krinsky N.I. Pure Appl. Chem. 1979; 51: 649-660Google Scholar). Carotenoid epoxides, known to occur in plants and alga, display additional roles. First, the cylic deepoxidation of violaxanthin and epoxidation of zeaxanthin represent key mechanisms in the adapting plants and green alga to high light intensity (3Yamamoto H.Y. Pure Appl. Chem. 1979; 51: 639-648Google Scholar, 4Demmig-Adams B. Adams III, W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 599-626Google Scholar). Second, xanthophyll epoxides serve as precursors of the plant hormone abscisic acid (5Rock C.D. Zeevart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7496-7499Google Scholar). Finally when xanthophyll epoxides are converted to the ketoxanthophylls capsanthin and capsorubin, they yield the red color of ripe pepper fruits that tracks the transformation of chloroplasts into chromoplasts (6Camara B. Hugueney P. Bouvier F. Kuntz M. Monéger R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 175-247Google Scholar). Although molecular oxygen is used for the conversion of carotenes into xanthophylls, the component proteins involved in the formation of 5,6-epoxy carotenoids have not yet been identified (3Yamamoto H.Y. Pure Appl. Chem. 1979; 51: 639-648Google Scholar, 7Costes C. Burghoffer C. Joyard J. Block M. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1979; 103: 17-21Google Scholar) as opposed to the deepoxidase, which has been enzymatically characterized (8Hager A. Holocher K. Planta. 1994; 192: 581-589Google Scholar, 9Rockholm D.C.

In this paper, we address the questions concerning the organization of the component proteins responsible for the epoxidation of cyclohexenyl carotenoids, their specificity for different substrates and the effect of different amine derivatives on the potential regulatory control of this enzyme. We also show that the cyclohexenyl epoxidase is subject to developmental and stress regulation at the gene and protein level. Pepper plants (C. annuum L. cv.

For affinity inhibition, 25 μg of purified epoxidase in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) were incubated with 25 μM DPA or DDF for the indicated times as specified in the text. In the latter case the mixture was irradiated with 295-nm or 410-nm light provided by a Spectroline lamp for different times as described previously (13Goeldner M.P. Hirth C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6439-6442Google Scholar). Following DPA and DDF treatment, the mixture was rapidly filtered through an Eppendorf tube containing Sephadex G50 to remove excess reagents. The filtrate was then added to the reaction mixture described below, in order to determine residual epoxidase activity.

Plastids were isolated as described previously (14Camara B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 214: 352-365Google Scholar), except that in some cases a mixture of protease inhibitors containing bestatin (100 μM), leupeptin (100 μM), aprotinin (1 μM), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM) were added to the extraction and purification buffers. β-Cryptoxanthin and antheraxanthin were isolated, respectively, from ripe fruits of Carica papaya and Mangifera indica, while zeaxanthin was isolated from Escherichia coli expressing Erwinia herbicola carotenoid biosynthetic genes (15Hundle B.S. O'Brien D.A. Beyer P. Kleinig H. Hearst J.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 329-334Google Scholar), and α-carotene was isolated from carrot roots. The normal chloroplast carotenoid β-carotene and lutein were isolated from pepper leaves. In each case the total lipid was extracted with acetone, and saponified according to standard procedures (16Davies B.H. Goodwin T.W. Carotenoids. Academic Press, London1976: 38-165Google Scholar). Subsequently, a preliminary fractionation was achieved using a cellulose column (17Monéger R. Physiol. Vég. 1968; 6: 367-402Google Scholar) that was sequentially eluted with hexane, hexane/acetone (90/10, v/v) to elute, respectively, the carotene fraction and xanthophyll fractions excluding neoxanthin. Further purification of the xanthophyll fractions was carried out by preparative HPLC on a micro-BondaPak C18 column using methanol/acetone/water (90:17:3) as the elution solvent (18Camara B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 253-274Google Scholar). The carotene fractions were purified using the same chromatographic adsorbent, except elution was carried out as described previously (19Camara B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 244-253Google Scholar). The identity of the purified carotenoids was determined from published chromatographic and spectral data (16Davies B.H. Goodwin T.W. Carotenoids. Academic Press, London1976: 38-165Google Scholar). Following fractionation, samples of each carotenoid solution were evaporated to dryness and stored under argon at −20°C until used. The standard incubation medium contained in a final volume of 500 μl, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 5 μM FAD, 1 mM NADPH, 25 μM carotenoid substrate, 100 μM mixture of monogalactosyldiglyceride, and digalactosyldiglyceride (1:1) dissolved in 50 μl of acetone/methanol (1:1), 25 μg of spinach ferredoxin or rubredoxin (Sigma), as specified in the text, 25 milliunits of ferredoxin: NADP+ oxidoreductase, 20 units of glucose-6-phosphate deshydrogenase, 2 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 500 μg of bovine serum albumin, and a definite amount enzyme. At the completion the reaction mixture was extracted with an equal volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1) as described previously before analysis by HPLC on a micro-BondaPak C18 column or a NovaPak C18 column using methanol/acetone/water (90:17:3). A cDNA library was constructed using a random mixture of mRNAs from light and dark grown pepper seedlings and pepper fruits at green, intermediate, and red stage of ripeness. Total RNA was isolated from the frozen tissues according to a previously described procedure (20Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the PolyATtract® mRNA system (Promega). Five micrograms of Poly(A)+ RNA were used to generate a λgt11 library using the Copy Kit for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). The ligated cDNA-vector was packed using the Gigapack Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). Subsequently, the screening procedure was carried out using standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 545Google Scholar) using a radiolabeled HindIII insert (1360 base pairs) from N. plumbaginifolia (10Marin E. Nussaume L. Quesada A. Gonneau M. Sotta B. Hugueney P. Frey A. Marion-Poll A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2331-2342Google Scholar). DNA from positive clones was obtained by PCR amplification using sense and reverse λgt11-specific primers, according to the program: 94°C (2 min) and 35 cycles at 94°C (1 min), 55°C (1 min), 72°C (2 min) followed by 72°C (5 min). The inserts were isolated by digestion with NotI before cloning into pBluescript KS+. For Northern blot analysis a pepper HindIII and PstI insert (881 base pairs) was radiolabeled and used as a probe. The epoxidase devoid of transit peptide sequence was expressed in E. coli using QIAexpress pQE vectors (Qiagen). To accomplish this, the sense oligonucleotide CGCGGATCCCGCCACACTAGCTGAAGCTCCAGC and the M13-20 Primer GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT were used to amplify the epoxidase by PCR using the program shown above. Following sequence verification, the PCR product was digested by BamHI and SacI and ligated to the pQE-31 vector. The resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli JM109. Bacterial cells were cultured at 37°C up to A600 of 0.6 before adding 1 mM IPTG. Following 4 h of culture, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 50 μM FAD. The resulting homogenate was adjusted to 6 M guanidium in the same buffer, before loading onto a metal affinity resin (TALON™, Clontech). The column was washed with the same buffer minus FAD, before eluting the epoxidase with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 50 mM imidazole. The epoxidase containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.25% n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and 10% glycerol. Further purification was achieved using a Mono Q column (HR5/20, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) employing a linear gradient of 0 to 0.3 M NaCl in the same buffer containing 2% glycerol. The fractions containing pure protein were pooled, adjusted to 50% glycerol, and stored at −20°C. Antibodies were prepared to the epoxidase expressed in E. coli, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (22Hugueney P. Römer S. Kuntz M. Camara B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 399-407Google Scholar, 23Bouvier F. Hugueney P. d'Harlingue A. Kuntz A. Camara B. Plant J. 1994; 6: 45-54Google Scholar). Protein content was determined as described previously (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 248-254Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated the lipoxygenase activity was assessed using [1-14C]oleic acid (56 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]linoleic acid (55 mCi/mmol) substrates. The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25,000 cpm of oleate or linoleate, and plastid subfractions equivalent to 1 mg of protein. After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 300 μl of acetone, and 100-μl aliquots were applied to silica gel plates developed with hexane:diethyl ether:formic acid (50:50:1). Radioactive spots were detected and quantified using a phosphorimaging system (Fuji). 13-Hydroperoxylinolenic acid was prepared using soybean lipoxygenase and linolenic acid as described previously (25Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 1073-1078Google Scholar) and quantified from its molar absorption 25,000 liters·mol−1 cm−1. The N. plumbaginifolia insert isolated by HindIII insert (1360 base pairs) was radiolabeled and used to screen the pepper cDNA library. Five positive clones were isolated and purified. Their sizes were determined by PCR using the λgt11 primers. The full-length clone (Fig. 1) encodes a protein having an approximate molecular mass of 72 kDa. The amino terminus contains several hydroxylated residues characteristic of other plastid transit peptides (26Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Google Scholar). The transit peptide could be cleaved in the region VKTLAE to yield the mature epoxidase. The amino terminus contains a consensus FAD binding domain (27Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Google Scholar, 28Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Lawton M.P. Philpot R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9681-9689Google Scholar) typically found in yeast (29Jandrositz A. Turnowsky F. Högenauer G. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 155-160Google Scholar) and rat (30Sakakibara J. Watanabe R. Kanai Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17-20Google Scholar) squalene epoxidases (Fig. 2). The sequence does not contains the typical heme binding motif FXXGXXXCXG (31Vetter H.-P. Mangold U. Schröder G. Marner F.-J. Werck-Reichhart D. Schröder J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 100: 998-1007Google Scholar) or the modified heme domain PXVXNKQCAG observed in cytosolic (32Pan Z. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Gardner H.W. Camara B. Cornish K. Backhaus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8487-8494Google Scholar) and plastidial (33Song W.C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Google Scholar) allene oxide synthases. These data suggest that epoxidation of plant carotenoids does not probably involves P450 cytochrome. Our deduced sequence carries three possible PEST domains (Pro253-Thr265, Ser404-Ser416, Asn514-Glu523) usually observed in rapidly degraded proteins (34Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Google Scholar). The hydropathy plot (35Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) of the deduced peptide sequence shows that this epoxidase is moderately hydrophobic. The pepper epoxidase shows 88% identity to the amino acid sequence of N. plumbaginifolia (10Marin E. Nussaume L. Quesada A. Gonneau M. Sotta B. Hugueney P. Frey A. Marion-Poll A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2331-2342Google Scholar).Fig. 2FAD binding domain of pepper epoxidase. A, comparison of the FAD binding site of C. annuum β-cyclohexenyl epoxidase (Cap-CarEpox) with that of squalene epoxidase from S. cerevisiae (Yeast-SqEpox) (29Jandrositz A. Turnowsky F. Högenauer G. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 155-160Google Scholar) and R. norvegicus (Rat-SqEpox) (30Sakakibara J. Watanabe R. Kanai Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17-20Google Scholar). Identical amino acids are boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to characterize the gene product, the BamHI andSacI product from PCR amplification (see “Experimental Procedures”) was cloned into pQE-31 vector, and the resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli. When cell extracts derived from E. coli were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, a prominent band corresponding approximately to the molecular mass of the mature epoxidase (65 kDa) was observed following induction with IPTG (Fig. 3). This polypeptide was purified by affinity and Mono Q chromatography with a yield of 40% and was judged to be 95% pure. The ability of heterologously expressed and purified epoxidase to catalyze the epoxidation of zeaxanthin was tested in the presence of 1 mM NADPH and molecular oxygen. Under these minimal conditions, no enzymatic formation of epoxy derivatives was observed (results not shown). Two possible reasons for this were then proposed and evaluated. One was that a peroxygenase reaction was required. A second was that an additional electron transport system was needed for the reaction to proceed. A diagnostic feature of peroxygenase reaction is their need for a hydroperoxide-dependent co-oxygenation (36Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Google Scholar, 37Hamberg M. Hamberg G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283Google Scholar). The formation of β-carotene 5,6-epoxide may, in fact, rely on such a reaction. Its formation has been observed following chemical autooxidation by perooxyradicals (38Bodea C. Pure Appl. Chem. 1969; 20: 517-530Google Scholar). A similar reaction has been shown during the epoxidation of retinoic acid into 5,6-epoxy retinoic acid by soybean lipoxygenase-2 and −3 (39Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Hatanaka A. Waldmann D. Schreier P. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 140-145Google Scholar). In plastids, a prerequisite for this is an endogenous source of hydroperoxide. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the capacity of purified pepper plastids to produce hydroperoxylinoleic acid as a co-substrate. Data in Fig. 4A show the enzymatic conversion of linoleic acid into peroxylinoleic acid by plastid stroma from purified pepper chloroplast or chromoplasts. Substrate specificity of the reaction suggests that lipoxygenase is involved. The fact that oleic acid is not a substrate argues with other data indicating plant lipoxygenase involvement (40Galliard T. Matthew J.A. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 339-343Google Scholar). This is supported by immunological data where antibodies to a putative plastidial rice lipoxygenase (41Peng Y.-L. Shirano Y. Ohta H. Hibino T. Tanaka K. Shibata D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3755-3761Google Scholar) positively reacted with the plastidial pepper lipoxygenase (Fig. 4B). Based on these evidences, our purified epoxidase was added to a reaction mixture containing exogenous hydroperoxylinoleic (25 μM) as a co-substrate. However, our data indicated that no epoxidation reaction occurred, suggesting that the biosynthesis of xanthophyll epoxides is not a peroxygenase-based mechanism. Faced with these results we reasoned that zeaxanthin epoxidation could involve several other component proteins. It is noteworthy that squalene epoxidase requires a flavoprotein oxidase and a NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (42Ono T. Nakazono K. Kosaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 84-90Google Scholar). We, therefore, attempted to reconstitute the pepper epoxidase by incorporating stromal proteins from pepper chromoplast into the reaction mixture. Under these conditions, a significant epoxidation of zeaxanthin into antheraxanthin and violaxanthin was observed (Fig. 5, A and B). As the boiled chromoplast stroma failed to sustain the epoxidation reaction, it also demonstrated that stromal protein cofactors were required. To further evaluate this, a reaction mixture was furnished with spinach ferredoxin and ferredoxin oxidoreductase and tested for epoxidase activity. Under these conditions, significant epoxidase activity was observed, as shown by the formation of antheraxanthin and violaxanthin (Fig. 5C). We, therefore, concluded that under in vivo conditions, the reducing power of NADPH is transferred to zeaxanthin via reduced ferredoxin. This fact is reinforced by the fact that bacterial rubredoxin can substitute for ferredoxin (Fig. 5D). The requirement of additional electron transporter is further demonstrated by the fact that E. coli synthesizing zeaxanthin could not convert zeaxanthin into antheraxanthin or violaxanthin when transformed with the pepper epoxidase under conditions where both promoters are compatible. In this context, one could note that E. coli ferredoxin cannot substitute for spinach ferredoxin (43Knoelli H.E. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 245-252Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the functioning of the β-cyclohexenyl epoxidase is coupled to the ferredoxin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase and photosystem I in chloroplasts. The same may occur in nongreen plastids, as both ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase activities have been observed in nonphotosynthetic chromoplasts of red tomato fruits (44Green L.S. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. Kamide K. Sanada Y. Wada K. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 96: 1207-1213Google Scholar). A similar fact can be deduced from nonphotosynthetic bean sprouts (45Hirasawa M. Chang K.T. Knaff D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 251-258Google Scholar) and radish roots (46Wada K. Onda M. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 619-625Google Scholar). These data suggest that in nongreen plastids a ferredoxin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase pathway linked to the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle may provide the reducing power. In this context, it is of interest that a nonphotosynthetic ferredoxin gene has recently been characterized from Citrus fruit (47Alonso J.M. Chamarro J. Granell A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1211-1221Google Scholar). This sequence revealed a typical plastid transit peptide and expression of its gene parallels the synthesis of carotenoid in Citrus chromoplasts. The ability of molecules to be oxidized by hydroperoxide or peracid is a diagnostic feature of the involvement of hydroperoxyflavinilated enzymes in the oxidation of nucleophiles (48Ziegler D.M. Metab. Rev. 1988; 19: 1-32Google Scholar). This requirement is fulfilled by the cyclohexenyl ring of carotenoids (38Bodea C. Pure Appl. Chem. 1969; 20: 517-530Google Scholar). Therefore, cyclohexenyl carotenoid epoxidase can be classified as a monooxygenase that catalyzes the introduction of molecular oxygen in the presence of NADPH, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin-like reductase. Since the catalytic mechanism of flavoprotein monooxygenases (49Entsch B. Van Berkel W.J.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 476-483Google Scholar) involves the formation of a flavin hydroperoxide enzyme intermediate, the resulting hydroperoxyflavin is thus cleaved to incorporate one oxygen atom into zeaxanthin, while the other is reduced into water (Fig. 6). The activity of the purified epoxidase was tested against several substrate carotenoids possessing ϵ rings (α-carotene and lutein) and β-rings (β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and antheraxanthin). The obtained products were subjected to HPLC analysis. The results showed that monohydroxy β-carotene, β-crytoxanthin was epoxidized (Fig. 7, A and B) as was antheraxanthin while β-carotene was not epoxidized (results not shown). In this context, it is worth noting that β-carotene-5,6-epoxide has been detected in plants under photooxidative conditions. Its formation, however, seems to be nonenzymatic as the optically inactive isomer is detected (50Young A. Barry P. Britton G. Z. Naturforsch. 1989; 44c: 959-965Google Scholar). In examining the specificity of the purified epoxidase, it was observed that α-carotene and lutein, which have β,ϵ-rings, were not epoxidized (results not shown). Thus, the cloned epoxidase appears to be a β-cyclohexenyl epoxidase catalyzing the reactions depicted in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Enzymatic steps catalyzed by C. annuum β-cyclohexenyl epoxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The epoxidation mechanism displayed in Fig. 6 involves a transient carbocation, which could allow the testing of potential regulators. Secondary and tertiary amine derivatives, which are protonated at physiological pH should compete efficiently with the carbocation generated during catalysis and, thus, inhibit epoxidase activity. These considerations were used in the design of sterol biosynthetic inhibitors (51Narula A.S. Rahier A. Benveniste P. Schuber F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 2408-2409Google Scholar, 52Schmitt P. Gonzales R. Benveniste P. Ceruti M. Cattel L. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 2709-2714Google Scholar) and carotenoid cyclase inhibitors (53Camara B. Dogbo O. d'Harlingue A. Kleinig H. Monéger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 262-266Google Scholar, 54Camara B. Dogbo O. D'Harlingue A. Bardat F. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2751-2752Google Scholar, 55Camara B. Dogbo O. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1986; 80: 172-174Google Scholar). Based on this, we tested the effect of diethylamine derivatives on epoxidase activity. When 50 μM CPTA or MPTA were added into the incubation medium, we noted a 65-70% inhibition of epoxidase activity compared with the control (Fig. 9). This suggests that diethylamine derivatives display a novel effect on carotenoid biosynthesis that is reminiscent of nicotine inhibition. Previous data on photosynthetic bacteria show that the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the C1 of lycopene, which yields rhodopin (56McDermott J.C.B. Ben-Aziz A. Singh R.K. Brittton G. Goodwin T.W. Pure Appl. Chem. 1973; 35: 29-45Google Scholar), and at the C1 of neurosporene, which yields chloroxanthin (57Singh R.K. Ben-Aziz A. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 649-652Google Scholar), are both inhibited by nicotine. These reactions involve a transient carbocation. Thus, one could explain the inhibitory effect as due to the nitrogen atom of CPTA and the pyrolidinyl ring of nicotine (58Testa B. Jenner P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1973; 9: 10-16Google Scholar), which are positively charged at physiological pH. These could compete with the transient carotenoid carbocation for the active nucleophilic amino acid residues of the epoxidase. If this assumption is valid, then irreversible blocking of the potential amino acid nucleophiles should also inhibit epoxidase activity. This was tested by using the electrophilic aziridinium (DPA) and the diazonium (DDF) cations that have been used to affinity label the active sites of antibodies (59Wofsy L. Metzger H. Singer S.J. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 1031-1039Google Scholar), acetylcholinesterase (60Purdie J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 122-133Google Scholar) and acetylcholine receptor (13Goeldner M.P. Hirth C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6439-6442Google Scholar, 61Changeux J.P. Podeleski T.R. Wofsy L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 2063-2070Google Scholar). Preincubation of the purified epoxidase with DPA resulted in a strong inhibition of the enzymic activity (Fig. 9). As excess DPA was removed by gel filtration before determining the enzymic activity, the effect of DPA was due to alkylation of nucleophilic residues of the epoxidase. A similar observation was made with DDF. In the absence of irradiation DDF weakly inhibits the carotenoid epoxidase (Fig. 9). However, after irradiation at 410 or 295 nm, a strong inhibition was observed. These data suggest that reactive nucleophiles are involved in the enzymatic epoxidation of carotenoids. Further work is required to determine whether aromatic (Tyr, Trp, Phe) or the acidic (Glu and Asp) amino acid residues are responsible. It is noteworthy that these residues are highly conserved between the pepper and N. Plumbaginifolia epoxidases. It was shown previously that the light-harvesting pigment-protein complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is a zeaxanthin epoxidase (62Gruszecki W.I. Krupa Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 97-101Google Scholar). The deduced peptide sequence of pepper β-cyclohexenyl carotenoid epoxidase possesses a characteristic FAD binding domain (Fig. 2) that has also been observed in olefinic epoxidases (29Jandrositz A. Turnowsky F. Högenauer G. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 155-160Google Scholar, 30Sakakibara J. Watanabe R. Kanai Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17-20Google Scholar, 63Kosuga K. Hata S. Osumi T. Sakakibara J. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 345-348Google Scholar). Since this pivotal sequence is missing in the peptide sequence of LHCII (64Green B.R. Pichersky E. Kloppstech K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 181-186Google Scholar) and is known to be necessary for catalytic activity, one may conclude that LHCII has no epoxidase activity. To obtain specific information on the compartmentation of β-cyclohexenyl epoxidase in plastids, polyclonal antibodies were raised against the protein expressed in E. coli. Antibodies specificity was verified using a histidine-tag reagent (65Botting C.H. Randall R.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 362-363Google Scholar), which clearly indicated that the immunoreactive bands corresponded to the expressed protein as no potential contaminating proteins (66Hengen P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 285-286Google Scholar) were visualized. Additionally, the antibodies were affinity-purified (67Smith D.E. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 20-28Google Scholar) before probing the plastidial proteins. Our data revealed the presence of two immunoreactive bands corresponding to the predicted molecular mass (65 kDa) of the mature protein deduced from the cDNA and a lower molecular mass (58 kDa) which predominated (Fig. 10A). The epoxidase of pepper seedlings grown under light in the presence of carotenoid inhibitors (Metflurazon, LS 80707, and CPTA) to induce a photooxidative stress displayed a very similar behavior. This partial proteolysis is supported by the presence of several putative PEST sequences (34Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Google Scholar) in β-cyclohexenyl, which are characteristic of rapidly degraded proteins. Finally, it is significant that the expression pattern of the epoxidase gene in pepper seedlings treated with the different photooxidative stress-inducing herbicides, Metflurazon, Diflufenican, and LS80707, is nearly identical to that observed in ripening pepper fruits (Fig. 10, B and C). The latter process is characterized by an active formation and conversion of epoxyxanthophylls into ketocarotenoids (23Bouvier F. Hugueney P. d'Harlingue A. Kuntz A. Camara B. Plant J. 1994; 6: 45-54Google Scholar), concomitantly to pepper chromoplast differentiation. It is interesting to note that abscisic acid, a product of epoxyxanthophylls, has been implicated previously (68Khudairi A.K. Am. Sci. 1972; 60: 696-707Google Scholar) in chromoplast differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2089518432,"We have studied the effects of peptide aldehyde protease inhibitors on the secretion of β-amyloid peptide 1-40 (Aβ(1-40)) and Aβ(1-42) by HEK 293 and COS-1 cells expressing β-amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish double mutation. A multiphasic SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system was used for the discrimination of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42). Calpain inhibitor I, carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal, and calpeptin were found to reduce the amount of Aβ(1-40) released into the medium in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction of Aβ(1-40) after treatment with 50 μM calpain inhibitor I or 5 μM carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal was accompanied by a slight increase of Aβ(1-42) released into the medium. These observations suggest that the cleavages at residues 40 and 42 are accomplished by different enzyme activities. We have studied the effects of peptide aldehyde protease inhibitors on the secretion of β-amyloid peptide 1-40 (Aβ(1-40)) and Aβ(1-42) by HEK 293 and COS-1 cells expressing β-amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish double mutation.

The amyloid peptide (Aβ), 1The abbreviations used are: Aββ-amyloid peptideSUVssmall unilamellar vesiclesLUVslarge unilamellar vesiclesSIVSimian immunodeficiency virusTFE2,2,2-trifluoroethanolPEL-α-phosphatidylethanolaminePSL-α-phosphatidyl-L-serinePCL-α-phosphatidylcholineSMsphingomyelinPyr-PC1-palmitoyl-2-pyrene(14)-phosphatidylcholineE/Mthe pyrene excimer/monomer ratio. a 39-43-residue peptide, is a normal 4-kDa derivative of a large transmembrane glycoprotein, the amyloid β precursor protein. The Aβ peptide is found in an aggregated, poorly soluble form in extracellular amyloid deposition in the brains and leptomeniges of patients with Alzheimer's disease (1Selkoe D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 708-716Google Scholar). In contrast, it occurs in a soluble form in several biological fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, where it is produced by glial cells and neurons and where it circulates at nanomolar concentrations (2Mattson M.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 926-928Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Aβ causes cell death and exerts its cytotoxicity effect remains unclear, and controversies still exist concerning the cytotoxic action of Aβ on neuronal cells. A number of in vitro studies with the synthetic Aβ peptide have shown that this peptide aggregates easily and forms amyloid fibrils similar to that found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (3Burdick D.

Recent observations have demonstrated that the C-terminal domain (amino acids 34-42) of Aβ is critical for amyloid aggregation and fibril formation (6Lansbury P.T. Costa P.R. Griffiths J.M.

Aggregated Aβ has been shown to be cytotoxic for cultured neurones, whereas nonaggregated peptide showed less cytotoxic effects (7Simmons L.K. May P.C. Tomaselli K.J. Rydel R.E. Fuson K.S.

A. 1993; 90: 567-571Google Scholar) have found that amyloid peptides were able to form calcium channels in bilayer membranes and other studies have suggested that the amyloid 1-40 and 1-42 peptides increased the intraneuronal free calcium concentration (12Weiss J.H. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 372-375Google Scholar, 13Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Liederburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 379-389Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports have demonstrated a cytotoxic effect of Aβ, at relatively high doses (10-40 μM) on neuronal cells via an oxidative mechanism, which was not mediated by a receptor pathway (14Schubert D. Behl C. Lesley R. Brack A. Dargusch R. Sagara Y. Kimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1989-1993Google Scholar, 15Hensley K. Carney J.M. Mattson M.P. Aksenova M. Harris M. Wu J.F. Floyd R.A. Butterfield D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3270-3274Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest a direct perturbation of cell membranes by the amyloid peptide. The mode of interaction of the peptide with the membrane has not been elucidated yet, and it is not clear whether aggregated Aβ can directly affect the cell membrane permeability or whether it enhances the membrane susceptibility to further injuries. Membrane destabilization, due to the tilted penetration of fusion peptides into cellular membranes, is induced by a variety of peptides (16Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Google Scholar, 17Martin I. Dubois M.C. Defrise-Quertain F. Saermark T. Burny A. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1139-1148Google Scholar). These hydrophobic peptides penetrate the lipid bilayer at an angle of 45-50°, due to the hydrophobicity gradient along their sequence (18Vonèche V. Portetelle D. Kettman R. Willemms L. Limbach K. Paoletti E. Ruysschaert J.M. Burny A. Brasseur R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3810-3814Google Scholar, 19Zimmerberg J. Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 433-466Google Scholar). Computer modeling of the β-amyloid peptide showed that the C-terminal domain of Aβ (e.g. amino acids 29-40 or 29-42) has properties similar to those of the fusion peptide of viral proteins (20Horth M. Lambrecht B. Khim M.C.L. Bex F. Thiriard C. Ruysschaert J.M. Burny A. Brasseur R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2747-2755Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the fusogenic properties of the C-terminal domain of amyloid peptide and report in this paper, that both the amyloid 29-40 and amyloid 29-42 peptides are able to cause fusion of unilamellar lipid vesicles with concomitant perturbation of membrane permeability as monitored by calcein leakage and that the amyloid 29-42 peptide is the most fusogenic. The α-helical structure and the obliquity of the peptides seem critical for their interaction with a lipid bilayer and for their fusogenic activity. The longer amyloid peptide, Aβ-(22-42) and Aβ-(12-42), had decreased but significative fusogenic activity, also associated with calcein release from the vesicles. This suggests that penetration of residues 29-42 into the membrane is hampered by N-terminal residues. Our results propose an alternative mechanism for the amyloid peptide cytotoxicity through a direct perturbation of the cellular plasma membrane similar to that induced by viral fusion peptides. The penetration of the cell membrane by the peptide at a tilted angle causes membrane perturbation and further cell damages. L-α-Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from egg yolk, L-α-phosphatidyl-L-serine (PS) from bovine brain, L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg yolk, free cholesterol, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Bovine sphingomyelin (SM) was from Matreya Inc. 1-Palmitoyl-2-pyrene-(14)-phosphatidylcholine (Pyr-PC) was a kind gift from P. Somerharju (University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland). All reagents for peptide synthesis and sequencing were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The trifluoroethanol (TFE) and hexafluoro-2-propanol used for sample preparation were of the highest grade from Sigma. 2′,7′-{Bis(carboxymethyl)aminomethyl} fluorescein (calcein) was from Molecular Probes. Peptides were synthesized by the standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase method, on an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer (21Vancompernolle K. Goethals M. Huet C. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Google Scholar). The peptide-resin conjugate was cleaved with trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide was precipitated with tributylmethyl ether and recovered by centrifugation at 2000 × g. The residue was dried for 2 h in a Speedvac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY). The peptides (20-40 mg) were resuspended in acetonitril/water (80/10, v/v) to get rid of all scavengers molecules and the insoluble peptide was recovered by centrifugation. The washing step with water was repeated 10 times. The purity and correct sequences of all peptides were verified by electron spray ionization mass spectrometry using a Fisons/VG Platform (Manchester, United Kingdom) mass. Modelization of all peptides was carried out as described previously (16Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Google Scholar), and the method used is that applied to the study of polypeptide conformation (22Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 1-11Google Scholar). The method used to predict conformational structure of the peptides accounted for the contribution of the lipid-water interface, the concomitant variation of the dielectric constant, and the transfer energy of atoms from a hydrophobic to hydrophilic environment (23Brasseur R. Vanloo B. Deleys R. Lins L. Labeur C. Taveirne J. Ruysschaert J.M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 1-7Google Scholar). The structure, mode of insertion, and orientation of the peptides were studied in a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monolayer. In this model, the interaction energy (sum of contributions from Van der Waals energy interactions, torsional potential energy, electrostatic interactions, and transfer energy between peptide and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in the monolayer) was calculated and minimized until the lowest energy state of the entire aggregate was reached. All calculations were performed on an Olivetti CP486, by using PC-TAMMO+ (Theoretical Analysis of Molecular Membrane Organization) and PC-PROT+ (Protein Plus Analysis) software. Graphs were drawn with the PC-MGM+ (Molecular Graphics Manipulation) program. To overcome problems of peptide solubility at high concentration, fresh peptide stock solutions (25 mg/ml) were prepared in hexafluoro-2-propanol, and peptides were further diluted in TFE. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained at 23°C in a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter calibrated with 0.1% (w/v) D-10-camphorsulfonic acid solution (24Brasseur R. De Meutter J. Vanloo B. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Baert J. Rosseneu M. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1253-1264Google Scholar). Portions of peptide stock solutions were removed and diluted in a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing different percentages of TFE. Nine spectra were recorded 20 min after the peptides were dissolved in the aqueous buffer/TFE solution at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The percentage of secondary structure were estimated by curve fitting on the entire ellipticity curve between 184 and 260 nm according to the variable selection procedure developed by Johnson (25Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared from a mixture of PC/PE/PS/SM/cholesterol (10:5:7.5:7.5:16, w/w), when necessary in the presence of 2.5 mol% of Pyr-PC. The composition of the vesicles was selected to mimick that of rat neuronal membranes (26Poduslo S.E. Norton W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 561-579Google Scholar). All lipids were dissolved in chloroform at 10 mg/ml and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Pyr-PC was dissolved in chloroform/ethanol at a concentration of 2 μM. Dried mixed lipids were hydrated in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) Na-EDTA, and 1 mM NaN3. The lipid suspension was sonicated at 23°C, using a Branson sonifier, under nitrogen at 32 watts for 4 × 15 min. After sonication, the labeled and unlabeled vesicles were applied to a Sepharose CL-4B column. SUVs were separated from larger particles eluting in the void volume of the column. In order to obtain an homogenous preparation, only the top fractions of the SUV elution peak were collected and pooled. Phospholipid concentration was determined by an enzymatic assay (BioMérieux, Charbonnier les Bains, France). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared from phospholipids as follows. Dry lipids were hydrated in buffer and dispersed by vortexing to produce large multilamellar vesicles. The lipid suspension was freeze-thawed five times and then extruded 10 times through two stacked 100-nm pore size polycarbonate filters in a pressure extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Inc., Vancouver, Canada). The LUV and SUV preparations could be stored at 4°C for at least 1 week, without significant size change of the vesicles during storage. Fusion of pyrene-labeled SUVs together with unlabeled vesicles, at a 1/4, w/w, ratio, was measured using a fluorescence probe dilution assay. The pyrene excimer/monomer intensity ratio was measured as a function of time after addition of increasing quantities of the peptides dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in either 50 or 20% (v/v) TFE. Fusion resulted in a decrease of the excimer intensity and a slight increase of the monomer fluorescence. Emission spectra were obtained on an Aminco SPF 500 spectrofluorimeter at 25°C. The pyrene excimer/monomer (E/M) ratio was calculated from the excimer and monomer fluorescence intensity at 475 and 398 nm, respectively, with an excitation wavelength of 346 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidth were set at 2 and 5 nm, respectively. Under these conditions, unlabeled vesicles in the presence of the peptides gave no significant signal due to light scattering. All experiments were performed in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 g/liter Na-EDTA for a final volume of 500 μl. The final TFE concentration in the reaction mixture was less than 5%, and a correction was made for the effect of the solvent on the excimer/monomer ratio. The final peptide concentrations were in the range of 6.9 to 46 μM. The changes in the vesicle size distribution were monitored by visible absorbance measurements, as described previously (27Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15124-15131Google Scholar). Aliquots of peptide stock solution (1 mg/ml in 50% TFE) were added to 15 μg of SUVs as for the fusion monitoring by fluorescence measurement. The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored in a function of time on a Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer. The ability of the labeled and unlabeled SUVs to undergo fusion was assessed by gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column before and after the addition of the peptides. During gel filtration, the fluorescence emission intensity of Pyr-PC was continuously monitored. Vesicle fusion was also investigated by a core-mixing assay developed by Kendall and MacDonald (28Kendall D.A. MacDonald R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13892-13895Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles were prepared as described above except that the phospholipid mixture was prepared by hydrating 2 mg of phospholipids in 1.5 ml of a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM NaN3 and containing calcein at 0.8 mM plus CoCl2 at 1.0 mM or EDTA at 20 mM. Vesicles were then vigorously vortexed for 2 min and sonicated as described previously. Untrapped solutes were removed by two successive elutions on a Sephadex G-25 column with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM NaN3. The lipid concentrations of the liposome suspensions were determined by phosphorus analysis (29Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar). In a standard experiment, calcein, Co2+- and EDTA-containing vesicles were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM NaN3. Peptides from concentrated stock solutions were added at different concentrations and the calcein fluorescence was followed using an Aminco SPF 500 spectrofluorimeter, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 520 nm, respectively, and with excitation and emission slits of 5 nm. The maximum fluorescence yield was determined in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 and EDTA 10 mM. In some experiments, CoCl2 at 0.4 mM chelated with 0.4 mM citrate were present in the reaction mixture to assess the leakage of encapsulated components. All experiments were performed under constant stirring at 25°C in the fluorimeter cuvette. The leakage of liposome contents to the external medium was kinetically monitored by measuring the release of calcein trapped inside the vesicles (30Defrise-Quertain F. Cabiaux V. Vandenbranden M. Wattiez R. Falmagne P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3406-3413Google Scholar). The SUVs were prepared as described previously except that dried lipids were rehydrated in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 g/liter Na-EDTA, 1 mM NaN3, and 40 mM calcein. At this concentration, fluorescence self-quenching occurs. Nontrapped calcein was removed by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25. Vesicles were eluted with a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 g/liter Na-EDTA and 1 mM NaN3. The lipid concentrations of the liposome suspensions were determined by phosphorus analysis (29Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar). Calcein entrapped at a self-quenching concentration in SUVs increases in fluorescence when it leaks from inside the liposomes. Upon addition of the peptides from a 50% (v/v) TFE stock solution, the increase in calcein fluorescence was followed, using an Aminco SPF 500 spectrofluorimeter, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 520 nm, respectively, and with excitation and emission slits of 5 nm. 100% leakage was established by lysis of the vesicles with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 (30Defrise-Quertain F. Cabiaux V. Vandenbranden M. Wattiez R. Falmagne P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3406-3413Google Scholar). The percentage of calcein release is defined as: % F(t) = (It− I0/Itot− I0) × 100, where I0 = initial fluorescence, Itot = total fluorescence observed after addition of Triton X-100, and It = fluorescence at time t. In our experimental conditions, in the absence of peptide, the spontaneous leakage rate was less than 1%/10 min. The volume of the reaction mixture was fixed at 500 μl. All experiments were with constant stirring at 25°C. The sequences and properties of the synthetic peptides representing different domains of the Alzheimer amyloid peptide (Aβ) are summarized in Table I. The central domain of the peptide Aβ is represented by the Aβ-(13-28) peptide, while peptides of the C-terminal domain of the Aβ peptide are designed as Aβ-(29-40) and Aβ-(29-42), respectively. In addition, two mutants of the A β-(29-42) peptide, named Aβ-(29-42, 0°) and Aβ-(29-42, 85°), were synthesized. These peptides have the same amino acid composition as the wild-type peptide, but their sequence was designed in order to change the angle of insertion of the peptides in a lipid bilayer. They are oriented at an angle of, respectively, 0 and 85° at a lipid/water interface, compared with an angle of 50° for the wild-type peptides (Table I). This obliquity is shared by viral fusion peptides, such as the Simian immunodeficiency virus fusogenic peptide (SIV) listed in Table I, whose properties have been extensively described (18Vonèche V. Portetelle D. Kettman R. Willemms L. Limbach K. Paoletti E. Ruysschaert J.M. Burny A. Brasseur R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3810-3814Google Scholar). The amyloid C-terminal peptides are all highly hydrophobic, with an hydrophobicity close to that of a transmembrane peptide on the Eisenberg's scale (16Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Google Scholar). Compared with the C-terminal peptides, the 13-28 central peptide is much less hydrophobic and is not predicted to form a stable helix.Table IProperties of the synthetic β-amyloid peptidesPeptidePeptide sequencePredicted orientationAngle of insertionMean hydrophobicityHydrophobic momentAβ-(13-28)VHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNK0.038Aβ-(29-40)GAIIGLMVGGVVOblique40°0.8740.12Aβ-(29-42)GAIIGLMVGGVVIAOblique50°0.8900.04Aβ-(29-42, 0°)GAIIGLGVGMVVIAParallel0°0.8900.04Aβ-(29-42, 85°)GVIIILMVGGAVGAPerpendicular85°0.8900.05SIVGVFVLGFLGFLAOblique53°0.9300.09 Open table in a new tab In analogy with the calculations performed on the viral fusogenic peptides (20Horth M.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2747-2755Google Scholar), the conformation of the β-amyloid peptides at a lipid/water interface was calculated by energy minimization (16Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Google Scholar). The most probable conformation of the peptides is illustrated in Fig. 1, showing the oblique orientation of the Aβ-(29-40) and Aβ-(29-42) peptides and of the SIV fusion peptide and the different orientation of the mutants. The oblique orientation of the wild-type peptides compared with the lipid bilayer is due to the concentration of the most hydrophobic residues at the N-terminal extremity of the peptide, thereby creating a N-C hydrophobicity gradient along the sequence. As described above, the peptides penetrate the phospholipid bilayer or insert into the lipid phase through their more hydrophobic N-terminal end and the 7-8 N-terminal residues insert into the lipid to destabilize the regular packing of the phospholipid acyl chains (Fig. 1). The secondary structure of the peptides was evaluated from their CD spectra in 20 and 50% TFE. In aqueous solution, Aβ-(29-40), Aβ-(29-42), Aβ-(29-42, 0°) and Aβ-(29-42, 85°) were poorly soluble and consisted essentially of a β-sheet structure, whereas the Aβ-(13-28) peptide exhibited largely random coil structure with a characteristic negative band at 198 nm (data not shown). Synthetic amyloid peptides required different concentrations of TFE to form α-helical structures. When the peptides were dissolved in 20% of TFE, Aβ-(13-28) displayed α-helix-forming propensities, and Aβ-(29-40) presented a mixture of α-helix and β-sheet structures (Fig. 2). On the contrary, 20% TFE was not sufficient to induce α-helix formation of the Aβ-(29-42), since"

M., and Gamble, W. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24511-24518). Most of the effluxed cholesterol accumulates in the medium as apolipoprotein E-discoidal lipid particles. In the current study, we determined whether and to what degree cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-macrophages depended on apolipoprotein E secretion. Unexpectedly, 2-week-old differentiated monocyte-macrophages secreted similar amounts of apolipoprotein E without or with cholesterol enrichment. Apolipoprotein E mRNA levels in these macrophages were not increased by cholesterol enrichment and were comparable with levels in HepG2 cells. Without cholesterol enrichment, monocyte-macrophages secreted lipid-poor apolipoprotein E with a density >1.21 g/ml. By contrast, cholesterol enrichment of monocyte-macrophages induced the association of apoE with phospholipid and cholesterol to form discoidal particles that floated at densities of 1.08-1.10 g/ml. An anti-apolipoprotein E monoclonal antibody added to the culture medium significantly inhibited cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from the monocyte-macrophages. This showed that apolipoprotein E was required for most of the cholesterol efflux, and that apolipoprotein E did not leave macrophages with lipid but rather associated with lipid after it was secreted. Thus, 1) apolipoprotein E was constitutively secreted by differentiated human monocyte-macrophages, 2) apolipoprotein E only formed discoidal particles following macrophage cholesterol enrichment, 3) apolipoprotein E was necessary for cholesterol efflux to occur in the absence of added cholesterol acceptors and, in addition 4) the level of macrophage unesterified cholesterol was not rate-limiting for this cholesterol efflux, and 5) net phospholipid synthesis occurred in macrophages secondary to apoE-mediated loss of macrophage phospholipid. In conclusion, apolipoprotein E functions in an autocrine pathway that mediates cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-derived macrophages. Human monocyte-derived macrophages can efflux accumulated cholesterol without exogenously added cholesterol acceptors (Kruth, H. S., Skarlatos, S. I., Gaynor, P. M., and Gamble, W. (1994) J. Biol.

E shows an anti-atherogenic effect by facilitating clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins from the plasma (1Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Hussain M.M. Greenman B. Fisher M. Vogel T. Gorecki M.

Transgenic expression of apoE restricted to the blood vessel wall (3Shimano H. Ohsuga J. Shimada M. Namba Y. Gotoda T. Harada K. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or to macrophages (including those in the vessel wall) (4Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L. Taylor J.M.

One mechanism by which locally produced apoE could be anti-atherogenic is by promoting reverse cholesterol transport from the vessel wall. This could occur through the association of apoE with plasma-derived high density lipoprotein (HDL) which increases HDL's capacity to carry cholesterol (5Gordon V. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6202-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Koo C. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11934-11943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is possible that apoE could affect reverse cholesterol transport independent of plasma-derived HDL. We have observed that differentiated human monocyte-macrophages efflux accumulated cholesterol even when these macrophages are incubated in basal medium without any added serum components or HDL that could function as cholesterol acceptors (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of this effluxed cholesterol accumulates in the medium within apoE-discoidal lipoprotein particles. However, it has not been determined whether and to what degree cholesterol efflux depends on apoE secretion by human monocyte-macrophages. Would this macrophage self-generated cholesterol efflux continue normally if apoE function was impaired? The cholesterol efflux that occurs from human monocyte-macrophages in the absence of serum or added lipoproteins could be independent of apoE. Some cholesterol effluxed by human monocyte-macrophages is contained within vesicular lipoproteins. These vesicular lipoproteins have a 22,000-Da protein that is not related to apoE (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, under certain conditions, release of multilamellar lipid particles can be a pathway for cholesterol excretion from macrophages (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schmitz G. Robenek H. Beuck M. Krause R. Schurek A. Niemann R. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 46-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Robenek H. Schmitz G. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 57-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the presence of other possible pathways for macrophage cholesterol excretion, it is not clear to what extent apoE secretion is necessary for cholesterol excretion from human monocyte-macrophages. Also, the relationship between apoE secretion and discoidal particle production in human monocyte-macrophages has not been examined. Thus, the purpose of this study was 1) to determine the importance of apoE in mediating cholesterol efflux from these cells, and 2) to determine the relationship between apoE secretion and production of apoE-discoidal particles. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured and incubated with human acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) or microcrystalline cholesterol, and analyzed for lipids as described previously (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubations, a total of 12 ml of culture medium was collected from a six-well cluster dish for each condition and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 25 min. This and subsequent procedures were carried out at 4°C. Centrifugation removed any floating cells and some of the microcrystalline cholesterol that remained after incubations. The supernatant was then passed through low protein-binding polysulfone 0.45-μm (pore size) filters (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) to remove any remaining cells or microcrystalline cholesterol. The filtrate was concentrated to 4 ml in an Amicon (Danvers, MA) stirred cell with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off cellulosic filter. Then, the concentrated filtrates were dialyzed 36 h against two changes of 4 liters of 0.15 M NaCl solution containing 0.02% sodium azide and 0.1% disodium-EDTA (pH 7.4). Recovery of cholesterol and apoE following concentration and dialysis was >80%. Isopycnic density gradient centrifugation of the filtered and concentrated culture medium was carried out as described previously (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of culture media and macrophages were analyzed with 7.5 cm × 10-cm, 10% acrylamide gels run on a Mini-PROTEAN II cell (Bio-Rad). Samples run on this system were delipidated and concentrated with chloroform/methanol according to the procedure of Wessel and Flügge (10Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). Then, samples were dissolved in treatment buffer consisting of 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, 2.5% dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and run according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Blotting onto nylon membranes was carried out with a Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) with 10 mM CAPS buffer (pH 9.5) containing 20% methanol. Blots were probed overnight at 4°C with an affinity-purified mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (0.2 μg/ml) with specificity against apoE (clone 6C5, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada). Purified apoE standard was obtained from PerImmune (Rockville, MD). Blotting and detection were carried out with a chemiluminescence immunoblotting kit (Schleicher & Schuell) using affinity-purified, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, goat anti-mouse IgG and Lumigen PPD (4-methoxy-4-[3-phosphatephenyl]-spiro[1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-adamantane]) as substrate (dilutions and conditions as specified by Schleicher & Schuell). ApoE in culture media and gradient fractions was quantified using a sandwich-type ELISA. Wells of microtiter plates (96-well Immulon, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight at 4°C with 1 μg/ml anti-apoE monoclonal capture antibody in 100 μl of 0.2 M carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer, pH 9.4 (Pierce). The monoclonal capture antibody was the same as that used for immunoblotting. After removal of the coating buffer, wells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and then rinsed four times with a wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20). One hundred μl of samples (diluted 1:20 in blocking buffer) or apoE standards (also in blocking buffer) was added to wells and incubated 1 h at 37°C. Then, wells were rinsed four times with wash buffer, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 100 μl of polyclonal goat anti-human apoE antibody diluted in blocking buffer (3.3 μg of IgG/ml, Biogenesis, Sandown, NH). Next, wells were rinsed another four times with wash buffer and incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 100 μl of affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-goat IgG-peroxidase conjugate (30 units/ml, Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 with blocking buffer. Wells were rinsed six times with wash buffer and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 100 μl of 0.2 g/liter TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) peroxidase substrate system (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). Finally, 100 μl of 2 M sulfonic acid was added to each well, and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). Samples containing 15 μg of total RNA were precipitated with ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 20 μl of buffer containing 50% formamide, 6% formaldehyde, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0). The RNA samples were heated at 65°C for 15 min and immediately cooled on ice. Next, the RNA samples were electrophoresed in a 1.5% formaldehyde agarose gel run at 4 volts/cm for 5 h. The separated RNAs were transferred overnight to a positively charged nylon membrane by capillary elution and cross-linked with UV light (1200 microjoules) to the membrane. A full-length apoE cDNA clone was used as a template to prepare sense and antisense apoE riboprobes labeled by in vitro transcription with digoxigenin-11-UTP using SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases (Boehringer Mannheim). A riboprobe to detect glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was prepared from a 1.0-kilobase pair cDNA fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase attached to a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The RNA blot was prehybridized for 3 h at 68°C in 20 ml of prehybridization solution (formulated as specified in the Genius System User's Guide for filter hybridization, Boehringer Mannheim). The blot was hybridized overnight in the prehybridization solution (68°C) containing probes at 30 ng/ml. Then, chemiluminescent detection of the RNA blot was carried out according to the user's guide provided by Boehringer Mannheim. Previous investigation has shown that cholesterol accumulation by macrophages can induce synthesis and secretion of apoE (12Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Havel R.J. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, human monocyte-macrophages (2-week-old cultures) incubated with AcLDL (100 μg/ml) for 3 days showed no significant difference in their secretion of apoE compared with monocyte-macrophages that were not incubated with AcLDL (Table I). Monocyte-macrophages incubated with microcrystalline cholesterol (130 nmol/ml) secreted only slightly more apoE (a 15% increase) into the culture medium over a 3-day incubation period than did control monocyte-macrophages. ApoE secretion following enrichment of monocyte-macrophages with cholesterol was also examined (as opposed to apoE secretion during cholesterol enrichment). Monocyte-macrophages incubated with AcLDL (25 μg/ml) for 2 days showed equivalent amounts of apoE secretion during a 4-day postincubation period in RPMI 1640 medium (Table II). During this period of postincubation, cholesterol-enriched macrophages excreted over 3-fold more cholesterol than control macrophages excreted.Table IEffect of cholesterol enrichment on apoE secretionIncubation conditionCholesterolApoEUnesterifiedEsterifiedTotalnmol/mg cell proteinμg/mg cell proteinExp. 1− AcLDL54 ± 13 ± 157 ± 27.4 ± 0.8 (NS)+ AcLDL90 ± 773 ± 13163 ± 207.2 ± 0.1Exp. 2− cholesterol54 ± 43 ± 057 ± 45.2 ± 0.2 (p = 0.02)+ cholesterol70 ± 231 ± 5101 ± 36.0 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Table IIApoE and cholesterol secretion following enrichment of monocyte-macrophages with AcLDL cholesterolDuration of effluxApoE in mediumCholesterol in medium−AcLDL+AcLDL−AcLDL+AcLDLdaysμg/mg cell proteinnmol/mg cell protein13.8 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.43.2 ± 0.511.7 ± 0.727.3 ± 0.86.8 ± 0.13.3 ± 1.218.5 ± 1.339.3 ± 0.78.5 ± 0.68.8 ± 1.126.0 ± 1.0412.5 ± 1.112.8 ± 0.511.3 ± 0.938.9 ± 3.6 Open table in a new tab It was previously reported that an increase in apoE secretion induced in mouse macrophages by cholesterol enrichment was mediated in part by an increase in apoE mRNA (13Mazzone T. Gump H. Diller P. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11657-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Poulos C. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether cholesterol enrichment may have substantially increased apoE mRNA without producing any large increase in apoE secretion. Cholesterol enrichment of monocyte-macrophages did not increase apoE mRNA levels compared with those levels in control monocyte-macrophages (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the apparent level of apoE mRNA in monocyte-macrophages was as high as the level detected in HepG2 cells. Thus, apoE mRNA and apoE secretion were almost maximally expressed in differentiated human monocyte-macrophages. The difference between these results and those of previous studies (12Basu S.K.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) in our studies and our use of culture serum selected for low levels of endotoxin (endotoxin inhibits apoE secretion; Ref. 16Werb Z. Chin J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10642-19648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) shows that cholesterol-enriched human monocyte-macrophages secrete cholesterol and phospholipid and lower their cholesterol content without the addition of an exogenous cholesterol acceptor such as HDL. About two-thirds of the effluxed cholesterol and phospholipid accumulated in the medium as part of apoE-containing discoidal particles, while about one-third accumulated in the medium as part of vesicles that lacked apoE. However, in those studies it was not determined whether apoE was necessary for cholesterol efflux to occur. To examine whether apoE secreted by monocyte-macrophages functioned to promote cholesterol efflux from the macrophages, lipid efflux was examined in the presence of an anti-apoE monoclonal antibody. The anti-apoE monoclonal antibody significantly inhibited cholesterol efflux from monocyte-macrophages (Table III). Monocyte-macrophages incubated with a control mouse monoclonal antibody excreted 63 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein into the medium and showed a similar decrease (57 nmol of cholesterol/mg) in their cholesterol content. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages incubated with the anti-apoE monoclonal antibody excreted about one-third the cholesterol that control monocyte-macrophages excreted, and showed less decrease in their cholesterol content.Table IIIEffect of an apoE monoclonal antibody on cholesterol efflux from monocyte-macrophagesIncubation conditionCholesterolPhospholipidCellsMediumCellsMediumnmol/mg cell protein0 days82 ± 2170 ± 12 days AcLDL205 ± 11177 ± 82 days AcLDL/4 days RPMI + MOPC 21 mAb148 ± 763 ± 4171 ± 1123 ± 12 days AcLDL/4 days RPMI + anti-apoE mAb177 ± 1121 ± 3175 ± 47 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Similar to the effect on cholesterol excretion, monocyte-macrophages incubated with the anti-apoE monoclonal antibody excreted about one-third the phospholipid that control monocyte-macrophages excreted. Although control monocyte-macrophages excreted 23 nmol of phospholipid/mg of cell protein, they showed no decrease in their phospholipid content. This could have only occurred through synthesis by the macrophages of the same amount of phospholipid lost from the cells. Incubation of monocyte-macrophages with the control antibody did not affect cholesterol and phospholipid levels in the cells and medium. Next, we determined whether the amount of apoE produced by monocyte-macrophages was rate-limiting for cholesterol efflux from these cells. Monocyte-macrophage cultures were first enriched with cholesterol by a 2-day incubation with AcLDL. Then, cholesterol content during a 3-day period of efflux into basal medium was monitored in the absence and presence of 10 μg/ml recombinant human apoE. This amount of apoE was more than double the concentration of apoE that we had observed in the medium of macrophages following 3 days of efflux. During the 3 days of efflux, macrophages decreased their cholesterol content by 47 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein compared with a decrease of 75 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein, in the presence of added apoE (Table IV). Thus, how much apoE that the macrophages secreted into the medium was rate-limiting with respect to decreasing macrophage cholesterol content. Additional exogenous apoE decreased the cholesterol content of macrophages beyond the decrease in cholesterol content that occurred with the level of apoE secreted by macrophages.Table IVEffect of exogenous apoE on monocyte-macrophage cholesterol content during effluxIncubation conditionCholesterolTotalUnesterifiedEsterifiednmol/mg cell protein0 days102 ± 2101 ± 11 ± 12 days AcLDL217 ± 5117 ± 3100 ± 32 days AcLDL/3 days RPMI170 ± 182 ± 188 ± 12 days AcLDL/3 days RPMI + apoE142 ± 381 ± 161 ± 4 Open table in a new tab It was next determined whether monocyte-macrophage unesterified cholesterol content was rate-limiting for the cholesterol efflux mediated by macrophage-secreted apoE. Monocyte-macrophages were first enriched with cholesteryl ester by incubation with AcLDL. Then, the cholesterol content of macrophages was monitored during efflux into basal medium in the presence and absence of the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor, S58-035. Cellular cholesteryl ester is continually being hydrolyzed and re-esterified (19Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of macrophages during the efflux period with an ACAT inhibitor decreased cellular cholesteryl esters and increased cellular unesterified cholesterol. This was because cholesteryl esters hydrolyzed during this period could not undergo re-esterification and, thus, accumulated in the cells as unesterified cholesterol (Table V, Experiment 1). The decrease in cholesteryl ester content of the monocyte-macrophages compared with controls was balanced by an equivalent increase in unesterified cholesterol content. Although more unesterified cholesterol was available for potential efflux in the monocyte-macrophages treated with ACAT inhibitor, the total cholesterol content of these macrophages did not decrease more than the total cholesterol content of control macrophages incubated without the ACAT inhibitor (Table V, Experiment 1). This showed that the macrophage level of unesterified cholesterol was not rate-limiting for cholesterol efflux from the macrophages.Table VEffect of an ACAT inhibitor on monocyte-macrophage cholesterol content during effluxIncubation conditionCholesterolEsterified cholesterolTotalUnesterifiedEsterifiednmol/mg cell protein%Exp. 10 day83 ± 580 ± 53 ± 14 ± 12 days AcLDL198 ± 399 ± 199 ± 350 ± 12 days AcLDL/2 days RPMI (no addition)167 ± 7 (NS)85 ± 382 ± 649 ± 22 days AcLDL/2 days RPMI + ACAT inhibitor173 ± 12131 ± 542 ± 824 ± 3Exp. 20 day77 ± 277 ± 30 ± 10 ± 12 days AcLDL118 ± 285 ± 333 ± 228 ± 22 days AcLDL/2 days RPMI (no addition)106 ± 5 (NS)76 ± 230 ± 328 ± 22 days AcLDL/2 days RPMI + ACAT inhibitor106 ± 1100 ± 26 ± 26 ± 22 days AcLDL/2 days RPMI + apoE92 ± 3 (p = 0.03)72 ± 320 ± 022 ± 12 days AcLDL/2 days RPMI + ACAT inhibitor + apoE79 ± 374 ± 25 ± 26 ± 2 Open table in a new tab However, a second experiment showed that this was because secretion of apoE by the macrophages treated with ACAT was not sufficient to remove the accumulating unesterified cholesterol (Table V, Experiment 2). Although much less cholesterol accumulated in monocyte-macrophages incubated with AcLDL in experiment 2, nevertheless, ACAT inhibition still failed to enhance cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. However, in the presence of added exogenous apoE, ACAT inhibition promoted a greater decrease in the cholesterol content of the macrophages than occurred without the ACAT inhibitor. We initially thought that cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-macrophages would be regulated by cholesterol inducing increased synthesis of apoE. Increased apoE synthesis could then cause increased production of apoE-phospholipid discs that could transport cholesterol from the macrophages. However, as shown above, apoE was constitutively secreted by 2-week-old human monocyte-macrophages, but monocyte-macrophages produce apoE-containing discoidal particles only following cholesterol enrichment (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was not previously determined (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) how much apoE secreted from monocyte-macrophages was lipid-associated in the absence and presence of cholesterol-enrichment of these cells. Only about 20% of apoE secreted from transfected mouse mammary-derived cells, and about 10% of apoE secreted from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells is lipid-associated (20Herscovitz H. Gantz D. Tercyak A.M. Zannis V.I. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shimano H. Fukazawa C. Shibasaki Y. Mori N. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Yamada N. Yazaki Y. Takaku F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, most apoE secreted from transfected L cells, as well as apoE secreted from cholesterol-enriched mouse peritoneal macrophages, is lipid-associated (22Reardon C.A. Lau Y.-F. Paik Y.-K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9858-9864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dory L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 809-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether cholesterol enrichment of human monocyte-derived macrophages influenced the association of macrophage secreted apoE with lipid. The density was determined for apoE in medium from monocyte-macrophages incubated for 3 days either in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium or this medium supplemented with 130 nmol/ml microcrystalline cholesterol. Density gradient centrifugation showed that apoE remained at d > 1.21 g/ml (i.e. remained lipid-poor) when monocyte-macrophages were not enriched with cholesterol (Fig. 2a). By contrast, about half the apoE from medium of cholesterol-enriched monocyte-macrophages floated to d 1.08-1.10 g/ml (Fig. 2b). We showed previously that apoE in this fraction is associated with discoidal lipid particles (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although monocyte-macrophages constitutively produce apoE, the apoE becomes lipid-associated forming discoidal particles only after monocyte-macrophages become cholesterol-enriched. Western blot analysis of apoE was carried out to assess whether any change in apoE molecular weight could have been associated with induction of discoidal particle formation. Lower and higher molecular weight forms of apoE were observed. Varying molecular weight forms occur due to different degrees of glycosylation of apoE (24Zannis V.I. McPherson J. Goldberger G. Karathanasis S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The higher molecular weight form of apoE accumulated in medium of macrophages incubated without or with cholesterol (Fig. 3, c and d). Cellular apoE was composed of predominantly the lower molecular weight apoE with a small amount of higher molecular weight apoE (Fig. 3, a and b). The patterns of cellular apoE were similar for macrophages incubated without or with cholesterol. Thus, the degree of glycosylation of apoE did not appear to be a factor in cholesterol-induced association of apoE with lipid. Also, Western blot analysis showed equal amounts of immunodetectable apoE in equal portions of media (and cells) from macrophages incubated without or with cholesterol. This finding confirmed the quantitative ELISA determinations of relatively similar levels of apoE in media from macrophages incubated without or with cholesterol presented above. The goal of this investigation was to learn about the function of apoE in mediating monocyte-derived macrophage cholesterol efflux that occurs in the absence of added cholesterol acceptors such as HDL or apolipoproteins. We have found that 1) apoE produced by monocyte-macrophages mediates most of the cholesterol efflux from the macrophages; 2) cholesterol regulated the association of apoE with phospholipid; 3) apoE associated with lipid after apoE was secreted from macrophages (not during secretion); 4) the level of macrophage unesterified cholesterol was not rate-limiting for cholesterol efflux, but the level of secreted apoE was rate-limiting; and 5) net phospholipid synthesis occurred in macrophages secondary to apoE-mediated loss of macrophage phospholipid (net phospholipid synthesis was not due to cholesterol enrichment). Previously, it was shown that apoE secretion from mouse peritoneal macrophages does not decrease the cholesterol content of these cells, although apoE-containing discoidal particles could be produced by these macrophages (25Basu S.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Bilheimer D.W. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9788-9795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Science. 1983; 219: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hara and Yokoyama (27Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that this was because mouse peritoneal macrophages do not secrete sufficient levels of apoE to stimulate significant cholesterol efflux. They showed that cholesterol efflux does occur from mouse peritoneal macrophages when sufficient exogenous apoE is added to the culture media. Expression of the human apoE gene in J774 macrophages (a mouse macrophage cell line that does not express its endogenous apoE gene) stimulated efflux of radiolabeled cholesterol in the presence of cAMP or an ACAT inhibitor (28Mazzone T. Reardon C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 53-1345Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, the level of efflux was not sufficient to decrease the cholesterol content of these cells. In contrast to these earlier studies with other types of macrophages, we found that apoE secreted from human monocyte-macrophages did mediate cholesterol efflux from these cells and also decreased their cholesterol content. This was shown from results in which an anti-apoE antibody decreased (about two-thirds) the efflux of cholesterol from monocyte-macrophages. In our earlier work (7Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that a minor portion of cholesterol released from monocyte-macrophages was present in vesicles that contained a 22,000-Da protein unrelated to apoE. It is possible that residual cholesterol efflux that was not blocked by the anti-apoE antibody occurred in these vesicles. Previous studies have shown that cholesterol accumulation by macrophages can induce the synthesis and secretion of apoE (12Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Havel R.J. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7545-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Mazzone T. Gump H. Diller P. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11657-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Poulos C. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we thought that cholesterol enrichment of the monocyte-macrophages would induce secretion of apoE that would then be available to form apoE-lipid discoidal particles. However, this turned out not to be the case. The monocyte-macrophages in our study constitutively secreted apoE essentially unaffected by cholesterol accumulation in the macrophages. Although apoE was constitutively secreted, it became lipid-rich and floated to density 1.08-1.10 g/ml only when macrophages had accumulated cholesterol. Thus, cholesterol did not stimulate formation of apoE-discoidal particles by stimulating apoE secretion; instead, cholesterol induced the complexing of apoE with phospholipid and cholesterol. This finding is consistent with earlier proposals that cholesterol alters the physical chemical properties of the plasma membrane in a way that favors interaction of amphipathic apolipoproteins with phospholipid (29Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that anti-apoE antibody added to the medium blocked cholesterol and phospholipid efflux is consistent with the idea that apoE did not leave the macrophage with lipid (otherwise, the antibody should not have blocked lipid efflux). The finding suggests that apoE picked up lipid after the apoE was released from the macrophage (30Forte T.M. Goth-Goldstein R. Nordhausen R.W. McCall M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was considered an unlikely possibility for apoE-transfected L cells because, when incubated with the transfected L cells, exogenously added apoE did not become associated with lipid (21Shimano H. Fukazawa C. Shibasaki Y. Mori N. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Yamada N. Yazaki Y. Takaku F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Net phospholipid synthesis occurred during cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-enriched human monocyte-macrophages. This was shown by the fact that the phospholipid content of monocyte-macrophages did not decrease, while phospholipid accumulated in culture medium during efflux. Cholesterol stimulation of net phospholipid synthesis in mouse macrophages has been observed (31Schmitz G. Beuck M. Fischer H. Nowicka G. Robenek H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1741-1752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cholesterol could not have directly stimulated net phospholipid synthesis in the human monocyte-macrophages as appears to be the case in mouse macrophages. This was because the content of macrophage phospholipid did not increase in the presence of the anti-apoE monoclonal antibody, although this antibody inhibited phospholipid excretion. Thus, removal of phospholipid from the macrophage (rather than cholesterol enrichment of the macrophage) must have stimulated net phospholipid synthesis. If cholesterol had directly stimulated phospholipid synthesis, then in the presence of the anti-apoE monoclonal antibody, macrophage phospholipid content should have increased an amount equivalent to the decrease in phospholipid excretion (16 nmol of phospholipid/mg of cell protein, calculated from data in Table III). However, this did not occur. The level of macrophage unesterified cholesterol was not rate-limiting for cholesterol efflux that occurred in basal medium without serum or added lipoproteins. The lack of effect of ACAT described for this in vitro situation may not apply to the in vivo situation within the blood vessel wall. ApoE concentrations could be higher in the tissue spaces of the blood vessel wall compared with the apoE concentrations achieved in cell culture where a monolayer of monocyte-macrophages secretes apoE into a large volume of culture fluid relative to the number of cells. At higher apoE concentrations produced by adding exogenous apoE to the culture medium, the level of macrophage unesterified cholesterol was rate-limiting for cholesterol efflux. With added apoE, inhibition of ACAT did stimulate a greater decrease in the cholesterol content of monocyte-macrophages compared with the decrease that occurred without added apoE. This was similar to what has been reported previously for plasma HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages (33Schmitz G. Niemann R. Brennhausen B. Assmann G. The EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We attempted to decrease the volume of culture medium to determine the effect on apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux. However, decreasing the volume of culture medium resulted in detachment of monocyte-macrophages from the culture dish. The accessibility of all regions of atherosclerotic lesions to sufficient levels of plasma-derived HDL could be a factor that limits reverse cholesterol transport from lesions. Given that apoE secretion by human monocyte-macrophages can mediate cholesterol efflux from these cells in vitro, apoE secretion by these cells in human atherosclerotic lesions has the potential to mediate cholesterol efflux in lesions. The significance of cholesterol efflux from macrophages mediated by production of its own nascent HDL is that this efflux would not depend on the availability of plasma HDL. In conclusion, apoE has anti-atherogenic potential not only by accelerating removal of atherogenic lipoproteins from the blood, but also by removing cholesterol from monocyte-macrophages through an autocrine mechanism of cellular cholesterol efflux.

Two isoforms of caveolin have been identified that differ at their extreme N terminus; α-caveolin contains residues 1-178, and β-caveolin contains residues 32-178. After recombinant expression in Sf21 insect cells, both α- and β-caveolin formed SDS-resistant high molecular mass oligomers of the same size as native caveolin.

This indicates that each caveolin isoform can independently generate these structures and that caveolin residues 1-31 are not required for this process. Using caveolin as a marker protein and a detergent-free procedure to purify caveolae from mammalian cells, we purified these recombinant caveolin-induced vesicles from insect cells. These purified recombinant vesicles: (i) have the same buoyant density as mammalian caveolae; (ii) appear as ∼50-100 nm membranous structures by whole-mount electron microscopy; and (iii) contain ∼95% of the recombinantly expressed caveolin protein by Western blotting. Immuno-labeling of these structures with anti-caveolin IgG confirmed that they contain caveolin. Thus, ectopic overexpression of caveolin in this heterologous system is sufficient to drive the formation of caveolae-like vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W1981876334,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are implicated in the homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Six GRK subtypes have so far been identified, named GRK1 to GRK6. The functional state of the GRKs can be actively regulated in different ways. In particular, it was found that retinal rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), but not the ubiquitous βARK1 (GRK2), can be inhibited by the photoreceptor-specific Ca2+-binding protein recoverin through direct binding. The present study was aimed to investigate regulation of other GRKs by alternative Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin (CaM). We found that Gβγ-activated GRK2 and GRK3 were inhibited by CaM to similar extents (IC50∼ 2 μM), while a 50-fold more potent inhibitory effect was observed on GRK5 (IC50 = 40 nM). Inhibition by CaM was strictly dependent on Ca2+ and was prevented by the CaM inhibitor CaMBd. Since Gβγ, which is a binding target of Ca2+/CaM, is critical for the activation of GRK2 and GRK3, it provides a possible site of interaction between these proteins. However, since GRK5 is Gβγ-independent, an alternative mechanism is conceivable. A direct interaction between GRK5 and Ca2+/CaM was revealed using CaM-conjugated Sepharose 4B. This binding does not influence the catalytic activity as demonstrated using the soluble GRK substrate casein. Instead, Ca2+/CaM significantly reduced GRK5 binding to the membrane. The mechanism of GRK5 inhibition appeared to be through direct binding to Ca2+/CaM, resulting in inhibition of membrane association and hence receptor phosphorylation. The present study provides the first evidence for a regulatory effect of Ca2+/CaM on some GRK subtypes, thus expanding the range of different mechanisms regulating the functional states of these kinases. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are implicated in the homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Six GRK subtypes have so far been identified, named GRK1 to GRK6. The functional state of the GRKs can be actively regulated in different ways. In particular, it was found that retinal rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), but not the ubiquitous βARK1 (GRK2), can be inhibited by the photoreceptor-specific Ca2+-binding protein recoverin through direct binding.

INTRODUCTIONG protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 1The abbreviations used are: GRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseCaMcalmodulinCaMBdcalmodulin-inhibiting peptideGβγβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteinNCSneuronal calcium sensorsROSrod outer segment(s)TSHthyroid-stimulating hormonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. form a family of serine/threonine kinases that are implicated in the homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Six GRK subtypes have so far been identified, named GRK1 to GRK6 according to the order of their discovery (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Of these six subtypes, rhodopsin kinase corresponds to GRK1, βARK1 to GRK2, and βARK2 to GRK3. Based on sequence homology, these six GRK subtypes are classified into three subgroups (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar): GRK1 is alone in the first group, GRK2 and GRK3 form the second group, while GRK4, −5, and −6 constitute the third subgroup. With the exception of GRK1 and GRK4, which are specifically localized in retina and pineal gland (GRK1) and testis (GRK4), the other four subtypes are ubiquitous.In homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors, the binding of an agonist to its receptor induces a complicity of events to result in phosphorylation of the agonist-bound receptor by GRK. The phosphorylated receptor would then display increased affinity for an arrestin protein (2Wilson C.J. Applebury M.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the binding of which to the phosphorylated receptor prevents any further coupling between the receptor and G proteins, and thus the receptor is rendered desensitized (inactivated) (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 2Wilson C.J. Applebury M.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A critical determinant factor for efficient receptor phosphorylation by GRK is the colocalization of the kinase and its receptor substrate on the plasma membrane. The mechanisms involved have been extensively studied. For GRK1, receptor activation causes farnesylation of the C-terminal tail of the kinase, facilitating its localization to the membrane (3Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1978; 21: 4389-4395Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Inglese J. Glickman J.F. Lorenz W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1422-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For GRK2 and GRK3, which are highly homologous, membrane localization is shown to be mediated by binding to the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gβγ) via their pleckstrin homology domains (5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6Koch W.J.

Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while electrostatic bonds between the basic C-terminal domain of the kinase and acidic phospholipids in the membrane are hypothesized to mediate membrane localization of GRK5 (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 9Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The functional state of the GRK/arrestin machinery can be actively regulated via intracellular messenger pathways in different ways. These include changes in kinase activity through covalent modification (10Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and/or modifications in their expression levels (11De Blasi A. Parruti G. Sallese M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Parruti G. Peracchia F. Sallese M. Ambrosini G. Masini M. Rotilio D. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such alterations result in modified potency of receptor desensitization and subsequently changes in receptor-mediated functions, as exemplified by the effects of GRK2 overexpression or inhibition on myocardial function in transgenic mice (13Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). More recently, permanent overexpression of β-arrestin 1 in FRTL5 cells has been shown to inhibit the mitogenic activity of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (14Iacovelli L. Franchetti R. Masini M. De Blasi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1138-1146PubMed Google Scholar).In some settings regulation of GRK can also be mediated by Ca2+-binding proteins. It has been recently demonstrated that in the presence of Ca2+, GRK1 is inhibited by the photoreceptor-specific recoverin through direct binding (15Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recoverin is a member of the family of neuron-specific proteins named neuronal calcium sensors (NCS); several other members of this family are also able to inhibit GRK1 in a calcium-dependent manner (17De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inhibition by recoverin does not appear to be a general phenomenon for the GRK family since it has no inhibitory activity on GRK2 (15Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, regulation of other GRK subgroups by alternative Ca2+-binding proteins cannot be discounted. In particular, the ubiquitous calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) binds Gβγ in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Katada T. Kusakabe K. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11897-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mangels L.A. Neubig R.R. Hamm H.E. Gnegy M.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and can therefore be envisaged to compete with GRK2 and GRK3 for Gβγ, resulting in inhibition of their activity.As an extension to our work on intracellular regulation of GRK (10Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11De Blasi A. Parruti G. Sallese M. J. Clin.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conducted the present study to test this hypothesis. It was observed that while Ca2+/CaM did inhibit GRK2 and GRK3, it demonstrated a dramatically greater potency in inhibiting GRK5 through direct binding to the kinase.RESULTSTo test the possibility that CaM may inhibit GRK2 activity by virtue of its ability to bind Gβγ in a Ca2+-dependent manner, the effect of CaM on GRK2 activity was examined in a Gβγ-dependent ROS phosphorylation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the absence of Ca2+, CaM at 1 and 20 μM had little or no effect on GRK2, but when Ca2+ (1 mM) was present, the same concentrations of CaM resulted in pronounced inhibition of the Gβγ-mediated GRK2 activity (Fig. 1A). The IC50 value for this inhibitory action was approximately 2 μM. This Ca2+-dependent inhibition was proven to be CaM-dependent since it was completely reverted by the CaM-inhibiting peptide (CaMBd) (24Payne M.E. Fong Y.-L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) derived from the CaM-dependent protein kinase II (Fig. 1B).Of the six GRKs, Gβγ has been shown to bind and activate only GRK2 and GRK3 through binding to their respective pleckstrin homology domains (5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to verify that this Ca2+/CaM inhibitory effect was dependent on its Gβγ binding activity, experiments were conducted to compare the effects of Ca2+/CaM on GRK2 and GRK3, which are dependent on Gβγ, with those on GRK1 and GRK5, which are Gβγ-insensitive. In the presence of 400 nM CaM plus Ca2+, both GRK2 and GRK3 were inhibited to similar extents, GRK1 was unaffected, but surprisingly GRK5 was dramatically inhibited (Fig. 2). Ca2+ alone had no effect on any of these four GRKs. Fig. 3A shows the dose-response effects of Ca2+/CaM on these four GRKs. Since a near maximal inhibition of GRK5 was achieved with 400 nM CaM, a detailed dose response of lower doses of CaM was performed (Fig. 3B). The inhibitory activity of CaM on GRK5 was ∼ 50-fold more potent than on GRK2, with an IC50 value of ∼ 40 nM. The effective concentration of CaM on GRK5 lies in the low range of CaM concentrations that have been shown to regulate target proteins (25O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and it is more potent than the inhibitory effect of Ca2+/recoverin on GRK1 (15Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This is suggestive of a highly relevant interaction and had therefore channeled our interest into further experiments on this phenomenon.Fig. 2The inhibitory effect of Ca2+/calmodulin is selective for different GRK subtypes. GRK1 purified from ROS membranes and recombinant purified GRK2, GRK3, and GRK5 were incubated under phosphorylating conditions with urea-treated ROS. The level of phosphorylation found in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (400 nM) is expressed as % of control (i.e. in the absence of Ca/CaM). Gβγ (100 nM) was included in the assays of GRK2 and GRK3.

The inhibition was effectively reverted by increasing the concentration of GRK5 in the phosphorylation reaction by 40-fold (Fig. 5).Fig. 4Characterization of the effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on GRK5.

The autoradiography from one representative experiment is shown in the upper part of the figure. Because of the different amounts of GRK5, the exposure of autoradiography was for 2.5 h (for 5 nM GRK5) or 10 min (for 50 and 200 nM GRK5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One mechanism by which Ca2+/CaM could inhibit GRK5 was by direct binding to GRK5, as in the case of GRK1 inhibition by Ca2+/recoverin (15Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, in vitro binding assays were performed using CaM-conjugated Sepharose 4B gel and unconjugated Sepharose 4B as negative control (Fig. 6). Gβγ was used as a positive control for the binding assay since it has previously been shown to bind CaM-Sepharose 4B in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Katada T. Kusakabe K. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11897-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mangels L.A. Neubig R.R. Hamm H.E. Gnegy M.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both GRK5 and Gβγ bound to CaM-Sepharose 4B in a Ca2+-dependent manner, though trace amounts of both also bound in the absence of Ca2+. Densitometric analysis showed that the -fold excess of CaM-Sepharose-bound protein/control-Sepharose-bound protein was 5.8 and 4.3 for GRK5 and Gβγ, respectively (n = 2). Neither of them bound to the unconjugated Sepharose 4B gel. Similar results were obtained when the molarity ratio between CaM and the ligand was varied by 3-fold (CaM, ligand = 60 or 180:1). These binding assays document a direct, Ca2+-dependent interaction between GRK5 and CaM. Unlike GRK5, GRK2 (30, 100, and 200 nM) did not bind to CaM-conjugated Sepharose 4B gel (data not shown), supporting the specificity of this interaction.Fig. 6Direct binding of GRK5 and Gβγ to calmodulin. Sepharose 4B-conjugated CaM (CaMSg) was incubated (4°C for 1 h) with 100 nM GRK5 (top) or 100 nM Gβγ purified from bovine brain (bottom) in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Sepharose 4B without conjugated CaM (Sg) was used as negative control. Bound GRK5 or Gβγ separated by centrifugation followed by extensive washing were incubated in SDS sample buffer at 95°C for 5 min, run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper. Bound GRK5 or Gβγ were revealed by specific antibodies (arrows). The experiment shown is representative of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar to other kinases, GRK5 contains catalytic and regulatory domains. Binding of Ca2+/CaM to GRK5 may result in inhibition of either of these domains. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the phosphorylation assays were repeated in a membrane-free system using the soluble protein casein instead of ROS as substrate (26Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate clearly the lack of any inhibitory effect on casein phosphorylation by GRK5. This suggested that the effect of Ca2+/CaM would most likely be exerted on non-catalytic domains, which have regulatory roles.Fig. 7Effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on ROS and casein phosphorylation by GRK5. Urea-treated ROS (left) or casein (10 μM, right) was incubated with GRK5 under phosphorylating conditions in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM. The arrows indicate bands of phosphorylated rhodopsin (Opsin) and casein as revealed by autoradiography after polyacrylamide gel electophoresis. The higher molecular weight phosphorylated protein observed on the left panel, but not on the right panel, and also in Fig. 4A likely represents opsin dimer (36Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Somers R. Caron M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1986; 321: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The experiment is representative of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since membrane localization is a prerequisite for efficient receptor phosphorylation by all GRKs, the effect of Ca2+/CaM on the binding of GRK5 to ROS membranes was examined using a centrifugation assay. GRK5 and CaM ± Ca2+ were incubated together prior to the initiation of phosphorylation reaction by the addition of ROS and ATP. At the end of the reaction, ROS membrane fraction was separated from the soluble fraction by centrifugation, the quantities of membrane-bound GRK5 were analyzed by Western blotting, and rhodopsin phosphorylation was revealed by autoradiography. In the absence of Ca2+, the quantity of GRK5 bound to the membrane was unaffected by CaM. When GRK5 was exposed to CaM in the presence of Ca2+, a dramatic reduction in GRK5 translocation onto the membrane was observed (Fig. 8). Densitometric analysis showed a 10-fold lower amount of GRK5 bound to the membrane when in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. This Ca2+-dependent inhibition of GRK5 translocation was paralleled by the effects of CaM on rhodopsin phosphorylation activity by the same samples (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Binding of GRK5 to ROS membranes is inhibited by Ca2+/calmodulin. Urea-treated ROS was incubated (30°C for 30 min) with 400 nM GRK5 under phosphorylating conditions in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and/or CaM (5 μM). At the end of the incubation, the samples were chilled and centrifuged (48,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C) to pellet membranes. The pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and membrane-bound GRK5 was revealed by specific antibodies (top panel). The second aliquot (lower panel) was run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography of the dry gel was done to reveal phosphorylated rhodopsin (arrows). The experiment shown is representative of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates for the first time Ca2+-dependent inhibitory effects of CaM on some members of the GRK family. The Gβγ-activated GRK2 and GRK3 were inhibited to similar extents, while a 50-fold more potent inhibitory effect was observed on GRK5. The mechanism of GRK5 inhibition appeared to be through direct binding to Ca2+/CaM, resulting in inhibition of membrane association and hence receptor phosphorylation.CaM is an acidic protein that is considered the primary “decoder” of Ca2+ information in the cell (25O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 27James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), exerting many of its functions when bound to Ca2+ (4 Ca2+ ions per CaM molecule). Numerous proteins have been identified to be regulated by Ca2+/CaM, e.g. kinases, phosphodiesterases, calcium pumps, and adenylate cyclase. Gβγ is also a binding target of Ca2+/CaM, as demonstrated previously (18Katada T. Kusakabe K. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11897-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mangels L.A. Neubig R.R. Hamm H.E. Gnegy M.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and confirmed in the present study. More recently, it has been established that the binding of GRK2 and GRK3 to Gβγ is critical in mediating the activation of these two GRK subtypes (5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Gβγ provides a possible site of indirect interaction between GRK2 and GRK3 with Ca2+/CaM. Indeed, in the present study, using a receptor phosphorylation assay in which the Gβγ-activated GRK2 and GRK3 activity was measured, we observed inhibition of GRK activity by CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This may be due to blockade of Gβγ by Ca2+/CaM, thus inhibiting GRK activity. However, this does not preclude the possibility of Ca2+/CaM inhibiting the activity of GRK2 and GRK3 through alternative targets important in the functioning of these kinases.The IC50 value of CaM for GRK2 is 2 μM. This is within the reported range of cellular CaM levels of 1-10 μM (28Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 45-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is similar to the IC50 value of Ca2+/recoverin inhibition of GRK1 (15Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a possible physiological implication for the functional interaction between CaM and GRK2, possibly through their common binding target of Gβγ.The more significant finding of the present study was the unexpected observation of a potent inhibitory effect of Ca2+/CaM on GRK5. Similar to GRK2 and GRK3, GRK5 inhibition by CaM was strictly dependent on Ca2+ and was prevented by the CaM inhibitor CaMBd. However, since GRK5 activity is not influenced by Gβγ (21Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), there must be an alternative site of interaction between GRK5 and CaM. This site does not appear to be rhodopsin since Ca2+/CaM was at least 50-fold more potent in inhibiting ROS phosphorylation by GRK5 than by GRK2 and GRK3 and had no effects on GRK1. The affinity of these GRKs for rhodopsin is very similar, and Km values are 4, 6, and 2.2 μM for GRK1, −2, and −5, respectively (21Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).A direct interaction between GRK5 and Ca2+/CaM was revealed using CaM-conjugated Sepharose 4B. The Ca2+/CaM binding site on GRK5 is as yet unidentified, but it is apparent that this binding does not influence the catalytic activity of the kinase as demonstrated by the lack of inhibitory effect on its phosphorylating activity on the soluble GRK substrate casein. Instead, Ca2+/CaM significantly reduced GRK5 binding to the membrane. Kunapuli et al. (9Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that binding of GRK5 to phospholipids is critical in activating the kinase. Thus, inhibition of GRK5 association with the membrane by Ca2+/CaM would hinder with kinase activation, hence the observed inhibitory effect on receptor phosphorylation. Therefore, similar to GRK1, −2, and −3, membrane anchoring of GRK5 is also a critical step in leading to receptor phosphorylation.In a recent report, six members of the NCS protein family have been shown to inhibit GRK1 phosphorylation of rhodopsin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (17De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The authors also suggested a possible interaction between NCS and GRK5. While this possibility remains to be tested, other reports have demonstrated that the brain is not a major site of expression for this GRK subtype (21Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This incompatibility between the sites of expression of GRK5 and NCS would argue against a physiological interaction between them. On the other hand, colocalization of GRK5 and CaM is quite possible due to the ubiquity of the latter protein. Since CaM and NCS are all calcium sensors, the present study suggests that they act as functional analogues in mediating the regulation of different GRK subtypes by Ca2+. Together, they are the first endogenous GRK inhibitors demonstrated so far.A number of G protein-coupled receptors are substrates of GRK2, −3, and −5, and some of these receptors are coupled to fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentrations, e.g. substance P and angiotensin II receptors (20Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Krause J.E. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9161-9164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM can therefore provide a feedback mechanism for modifying homologous desensitization of these receptors. Furthermore, in any one cell, a number of receptor substrates for GRK2, −3, and −5 may be present, and Ca2+/CaM may therefore mediate a novel route of cross-talk in which one Ca2+-regulating receptor agonist can acutely regulate the phosphorylating activity of these GRK subtypes, thus modulating the functional efficiency of a different receptor. There are examples of this nature (see Ref. 28Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 45-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). Some of these reported synergistic interaction between CaM and hormonal activation of adenylyl cyclase. Of particular interest to GRK5 is the potentiation by CaM of TSH-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in the human thyroid gland (32Lakey T. MacNeil S. Humphreys H. Walker S.W. Munro D.S. Tomlinson S. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Desensitization of the TSH receptor has recently been shown to be mediated by GRK5 (33Nagayama Y. Tanaka K. Hara T. Namba H. Yamashita S. Taniyama K. Niwa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10143-10148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that CaM inhibition of GRK5 contributes to its potentiating effect on TSH stimulation (32Lakey T. MacNeil S. Humphreys H. Walker S.W. Munro D.S. Tomlinson S. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in addition to other effects of CaM on the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP axis, such as activation of the cyclase (28Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 45-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another study stressed the importance of temporal overlapping of the Ca2+ pulse with the addition of the facilitatory neurotransmitter serotonin in classical conditioning in Aplysia (34Abrams T.W. Karl K.A. Kandel E.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the adrenocorticotrophic hormone receptor, the CaM-mediated potentiation effect was attributed to an action on receptor-Gs coupling (35Papadopoulos V. Widmaier E.P. Hall P.F. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2465-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which is the classical site of intervention by GRKs. Such synergistic effects of CaM on the functions of receptors may be at least partially mediated by the effect of Ca2+/CaM on GRKs.In conclusion, the present study provides the first evidence for a regulatory effect of Ca2+/CaM on some GRK subtypes, thus expanding the range of different mechanisms by which the functional states of GRK/arrestin proteins can be regulated. The effect of Ca2+-sensor proteins appears to be rather general, and the GRK subtype selectivity documented for recoverin and CaM indicates that different kinases can be specifically regulated in different target tissues. INTRODUCTIONG protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 1The abbreviations used are: GRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseCaMcalmodulinCaMBdcalmodulin-inhibiting peptideGβγβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteinNCSneuronal calcium sensorsROSrod outer segment(s)TSHthyroid-stimulating hormonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. form a family of serine/threonine kinases that are implicated in the homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Six GRK subtypes have so far been identified, named GRK1 to GRK6 according to the order of their discovery (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Of these six subtypes, rhodopsin kinase corresponds to GRK1, βARK1 to GRK2, and βARK2 to GRK3. Based on sequence homology, these six GRK subtypes are classified into three subgroups (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar): GRK1 is alone in the first group, GRK2 and GRK3 form the second group, while GRK4, −5, and −6 constitute the third subgroup. With the exception of GRK1 and GRK4, which are specifically localized in retina and pineal gland (GRK1) and testis (GRK4), the other four subtypes are ubiquitous.In homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors, the binding of an agonist to its receptor induces a complicity of events to result in phosphorylation of the agonist-bound receptor by GRK. The phosphorylated receptor would then display increased affinity for an arrestin protein (2Wilson C.J. Applebury M.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the binding of which to the phosphorylated receptor prevents any further coupling between the receptor and G proteins, and thus the receptor is rendered desensitized (inactivated) (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 2Wilson C.J. Applebury M.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A critical determinant factor for efficient receptor phosphorylation by GRK is the colocalization of the kinase and its receptor substrate on the plasma membrane. The mechanisms involved have been extensively studied. For GRK1, receptor activation causes farnesylation of the C-terminal tail of the kinase, facilitating its localization to the membrane (3Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1978; 21: 4389-4395Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Inglese J. Glickman J.F. Lorenz W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1422-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For GRK2 and GRK3, which are highly homologous, membrane localization is shown to be mediated by binding to the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gβγ) via their pleckstrin homology domains (5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitoylation appears to be the mechanism for GRK4 and GRK6 (7Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6403-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Stoffel R.H. Randall R.R. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while electrostatic bonds between the basic C-terminal domain of the kinase and acidic phospholipids in the membrane are hypothesized to mediate membrane localization of GRK5 (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 9Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The functional state of the GRK/arrestin machinery can be actively regulated via intracellular messenger pathways in different ways. These include changes in kinase activity through covalent modification (10Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and/or modifications in their expression levels (11De Blasi A. Parruti G. Sallese M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Parruti G. Peracchia F. Sallese M. Ambrosini G. Masini M. Rotilio D. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such alterations result in modified potency of receptor desensitization and subsequently changes in receptor-mediated functions, as exemplified by the effects of GRK2 overexpression or inhibition on myocardial function in transgenic mice (13Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). More recently, permanent overexpression of β-arrestin 1 in FRTL5 cells has been shown to inhibit the mitogenic activity of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (14Iacovelli L. Franchetti R. Masini M. De Blasi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1138-1146PubMed Google Scholar).In some settings regulation of GRK can also be mediated by Ca2+-binding proteins. It has been recently demonstrated that in the presence of Ca2+, GRK1 is inhibited by the photoreceptor-specific recoverin through direct binding (15Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recoverin is a member of the family of neuron-specific proteins named neuronal calcium sensors (NCS); several other members of this family are also able to inhibit GRK1 in a calcium-dependent manner (17De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inhibition by recoverin does not appear to be a general phenomenon for the GRK family since it has no inhibitory activity on GRK2 (15Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, regulation of other GRK subgroups by alternative Ca2+-binding proteins cannot be discounted. In particular, the ubiquitous calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) binds Gβγ in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Katada T. Kusakabe K. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11897-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mangels L.A. Neubig R.R. Hamm H.E. Gnegy M.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and can therefore be envisaged to compete with GRK2 and GRK3 for Gβγ, resulting in inhibition of their activity.As an extension to our work on intracellular regulation of GRK (10Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11De Blasi A. Parruti G. Sallese M. J. Clin.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conducted the present study to test this hypothesis. It was observed that while Ca2+/CaM did inhibit GRK2 and GRK3, it demonstrated a dramatically greater potency in inhibiting GRK5 through direct binding to the kinase."

We show here that three of these sites, denoted ipnA2, ipnA3, and ipnA4AB, are efficiently recognized by the protein in an isolated sequence context. Single, double, and triple inactivation of these sites in any possible combination reduced promoter activity under alkaline conditions but had no effect under acidic conditions (under which promoter activity was low), as measured by the expression of wild-type and mutant ipnAp::lacZ fusion genes integrated in single copy into a common chromosomal location. This establishes a physiological role for these PacC binding sites and demonstrates a direct role for PacC in ambient pH regulation of ipnA gene expression. In addition, this confirms our previous proposal that PacC is an activator for alkaline-expressed genes. Notably, our experiments show that ipnA2, the highest affinity site for PacC in the ipnAp, contributes relatively modestly to PacC-mediated activation. By contrast, the lower affinity sites ipnA3 and ipnA4AB contribute more substantially to regulation by ambient pH.

Mutagenesis studies yielded catalytically active PAM proteins that are not properly localized or internalized. Employing the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated two distinct cDNAs whose protein products showed a strong interaction with the CD of PAM. The interaction of these novel PAM COOH-terminal interactor proteins (P-CIPs) did not occur with a misrouted CD mutant as bait in the yeast system. Both proteins, P-CIP2 and P-CIP10, were expressed as fusion proteins that interacted in vitro with solubilized integral membrane PAM. P-CIP2 was homologous to several serine/threonine and dual specificity protein kinases, while P-CIP10 contained spectrin-like repeats. Endogenous P-CIP2 was localized to the Golgi region of AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells, and expression of integral membrane PAM disrupted the distribution of endogenous P-CIP2. Both P-CIP2 and P-CIP10 mRNAs were found to be expressed in rat brain neurons also expressing PAM proteins. P-CIP2 and P-CIP10 may be members of a family of cytosolic proteins involved in the routing of membrane proteins that function in the regulated secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2093719233,"NF-Y is a heterotrimeric transcription factor that specifically recognizes a CCAAT box motif found in a variety of eukaryotic promoter and enhancer elements. The subunit association and DNA binding properties of the NF-Y complex were examined as a function of redox state using recombinant NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits. Reduction of NF-YB by dithiothreitol (DTT) was essential for reconstitution of specific NF-Y CCAAT box DNA binding activity in vitro. Approximately 30% of the Escherichia coli-derived NF-YB subunit existed as intermolecular disulfide-linked dimers. NF-YB mutants in which the highly conserved cysteine residues at positions 85 and 89 had been converted to serines existed only as monomers and did not require DTT for functional NF-Y DNA binding activity. DTT was required, however, for the functional association of NF-YC with wild-type NF-YB but not with the NF-YB cysteine mutants. The cellular redox factors Ref-1 and adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor stimulated the DNA binding activity of recombinant NF-Y in the absence of DTT. Cells treated with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, an irreversible inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase, exhibited reduced endogenous NF-Y DNA binding activity.

Together these results suggest that the cellular redox environment of mammalian cells is an important posttranscriptional regulator of NF-Y subunit association and DNA binding activities. NF-Y is a ubiquitous multimeric eukaryotic transcription factor, also referred to as CP1 (1Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Google Scholar) and CBF (2Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Schaftingen E.V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5940-5947Google Scholar), that recognizes a CCAAT motif often found ∼60-80 base pairs upstream of the RNA polymerase II initiation site in the promoter region and at various locations in distant enhancer elements of many higher eukaryotic genes. Cloning of the murine NF-Y subunits NF-YA and NF-YB revealed a high degree of conservation with the subunit association and DNA binding domains of two yeast CCAAT box transcription factors, HAP2 and HAP3, respectively (3Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Google Scholar). Early analyses of the CP1, HAP, and NF-Y complexes suggested that only these two subunits were required for CCAAT box recognition (1Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Google Scholar, 3Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Google Scholar, 4Olesen J.T. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1714-1729Google Scholar). However, recent cloning of an additional yeast subunit, HAP5 (5McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Google Scholar) and the rat CBF subunit CBF-C (6Sinha S. Maity S.R. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Google Scholar) and reconstitution studies of specific CCAAT box DNA binding activity in these systems now support the conclusion that the DNA binding activity of the HAP and CBF(NF-Y) complexes resides in the specific association of three nonidentical subunits (5McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Google Scholar, 6Sinha S. Maity S.R. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Google Scholar, 7Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Google Scholar). The CCAAT box DNA binding activities of the CP1, HAP, and CBF complexes was shown initially to separate into two distinct fractions following ion exchange chromatography in which the lost DNA binding activity could be fully reconstituted by fraction recombination (1Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Google Scholar, 2Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Schaftingen E.V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

These combined studies suggested that the interaction of the HAP2 and CBF-B(NF-YA) subunits with other components of the complex was primarily ionic in nature, and further suggest that under appropriate conditions the HAP2 and CBF-B subunits can exchange their heterodimeric partners. Subsequent biochemical analysis of the CBF-A(NF-YB) fraction suggested that CBF-A was tightly associated with an additional component, CBF-C, and that this interaction was primarily hydrophobic in nature, since these subunits could only be separated after treatment with denaturants such as urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (7Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Google Scholar). The CBF-B(NF-YA) subunit has also been shown to interact with the CBF-A·CBF-C complex but not with CBF-A(NF-YB) or the CBF-C subunit individually (6Sinha S. Maity S.R. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Google Scholar), suggesting that a unique association surface for CBF-B(NF-YA) is created by the CBF-A·CBF-C heterodimer. Structural and functional analyses have shown that the CBF-B(NF-YA) subunit contains an 83-amino acid long evolutionarily conserved domain, which contains determinants of the subunit association (amino acids 266-286) and DNA binding (amino acids 297-317) activities (9Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Google Scholar, 10Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Google Scholar). Mutation of hydrophobic amino acids within the subunit association domain of CBF-B(NF-YA) results in loss of function (9Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Google Scholar, 10Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Google Scholar). The amino acids N-terminal to the subunit association domain are rich in glutamine residues and function as a trans-activation domain (11Li X.-Y. van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Google Scholar, 12Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Google Scholar). There are at least two major isoforms of NF-YA(CBF-B), which differ primarily at the N terminus due to tissue-specific alternative splicing but which exhibit no apparent functional difference in cell-free in vitro transcription assays (11Li X.-Y. van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Google Scholar). The DNA binding and subunit association domains of CBF-A(NF-YB) have also been mapped recently (13Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 31-40Google Scholar). Amino acid regions 57-87, 92-99, and 63-102 along with amino acids 109-142 of CBF-A(NF-YB) are required for DNA binding, CBF-B(NF-YA) association, and CBF-C association, respectively. Several of the evolutionarily conserved amino acids within the DNA binding and subunit association domains have also been shown to be important for the function of CBF-A(NF-YB) (13Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 31-40Google Scholar), as has a similar analysis of HAP3 demonstrated the importance of these evolutionary conserved amino acids (14Xing Y. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4647-4655Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues, which were previously proposed to be critical for DNA binding (3Hooft van Huijsduijnen R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4647-4655Google Scholar). Cysteine residues of several transcription factors, although not directly involved in DNA binding, modulate DNA binding activity in response to the cellular redox state. In the case of the oxyR protein, oxidation of cysteines induces DNA binding activity (15Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B.N. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Google Scholar), whereas, in the case of transcription factors Fos, Jun, bovine papillomavirus E2, NF-κB, c-Myb, USF, and TTF-1, in vitro DNA binding activity in all these cases is stimulated by reduction of specific cysteine residues (16Abate C.

With a long-term goal of identifying posttranslational modification events that influence the DNA binding and transcriptional activation potential of NF-Y(CBF), the biochemical nature of its subunit interactions and to understand the role that the highly conserved cysteine residues of NF-YB(CBF-A) play in overall NF-Y function, we have initiated studies of the NF-Y complex using recombinant NF-Y subunits. For this purpose, we isolated cDNAs corresponding to both the human and murine NF-YC subunit, and we show in this study that human and murine NF-YC contain an evolutionarily conserved domain of 81 amino acids, which displays 74% homology to yeast HAP5. DNA binding studies using all three recombinant subunits indicated that reduction of recombinant NF-YB by reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolADFadult T-cell leukemia-derived factorBSObuthionine sulfoximineCDNB1-chloro 2,4-dinitrobenzeneEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGSTglutathione S-transferaseNEMN-ethylmaleimidePCRpolymerase chain reactionSREserum response elementSRFserum response factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMHCmajor histocompatibility complexCYP1A1cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase. or mammalian enzymes involved in redox regulation such as Ref-1 and thioredoxin (21Pognonec P.

In addition, we show that NF-YB with mutation of cysteine residues at positions 85 and 89 can bind DNA and does not require DTT. Subunit association studies indicated that prior reduction of wild-type NF-YB is essential for its association with NF-YC. We also demonstrate that cysteine-modifying agents inhibit DNA binding of cellular NF-Y.

The human NF-YC subunit was cloned from a HeLa cell cDNA library (Clontech), and the murine NF-YC subunit was cloned from a normal murine macrophage cDNA library (Clontech) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 5′-GGGGATCCATGTCCACAGAAGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCTCAGTCTCCAGTCACCTGGGG-3′ based on the rat CBF-C cDNA sequence (6Sinha S. Maity S.R. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Google Scholar). PCR products derived from several independent reactions were cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate NF-YC subclones, and for each species clones were sequenced on both strands by Dye-Deoxy Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer) using an automated Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer. cDNAs for NF-YA and NF-YB were obtained from a murine 3T3-L1 fibroblast cDNA library (Clontech) by PCR with primer sequences derived from previously published full-length murine sequence data (3Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Google Scholar). cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia) to generate the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins GST-YA and GST-YB. Cysteine mutations in NF-YB were created by a two-step PCR amplification technique as described by Ho et al. (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) using GST-YB as a template and cloned into pGEX-2T. NF-YC, NF-YB, and cysteine mutants of NF-YB were also cloned into the XhoI-BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen) to generate histidine-tagged NF-Y subunits. A prokaryotic expression vector containing a human acute T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF) cDNA was provided by Dr. K. Schulze-Osthoff (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; Ref. 25Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Google Scholar). GST-YA and GST-YC proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli DH5α lysates essentially as described by Smith and Johnson (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). GST-YB was prepared from inclusion bodies as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and then solubilized and diluted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA, 300 mM KCl, and 8 M urea. Polyethylene glycol 8000 was added in a ratio of 1:15 (w/w) (28Cleland J.L. Builder S.E. Swartz J.R. Winkler M. Chang J.Y. Wang D.I.C. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 1013-1019Google Scholar), and the urea concentration was decreased to 4 M by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 300 mM KCl. The denatured proteins were then refolded by sequential dialysis in 3 M, 2 M, and 1 M urea-containing buffers and a final buffer without urea at 1-h intervals. Renatured GST-YB was purified from using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). YB and YC proteins expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) from pET vectors were purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions. Briefly, isolated inclusion bodies were dissolved in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 300 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, and 6 M guanidine-HCl) and applied to a His-Bind agarose column (Novagen) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed extensively in binding buffer containing 10 mM imidazole. The column-bound NF-Y proteins were eluted using a 100 mM-1 M step gradient of imidazole in binding buffer. The purity of all E. coli-derived proteins was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels and was 90% or greater. Fractions containing high DNA binding activity as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used in subsequent analyses. All recombinant proteins were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −80°C. Recombinant ADF was purified as described previously (25Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Google Scholar). HSP90 was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Sidney, Canada); Ref-1 and cyclophilin were provided by Drs. Tom Curran (St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN) and Barbara Sherry (The Picower Institute, Manhasset, NY), respectively. Cell culture supernatants from the MT4 cell line were concentrated using Centricon-3 ultrafiltration devices (Amicon), and the concentrated medium was extensively dialyzed against buffer D to remove any reducing agents. Purified GST-YB fusion protein as described above was used for rabbit immunizations. Anti-YB antibodies were affinity-purified from rabbit serum using a GST-YB-Sepharose affinity column as described previously (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies were passed through an additional GST-Sepharose column to remove antibodies directed against GST. Western blotting of proteins transferred from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose filters was performed using a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using ECL (Amersham). Whole cell extracts derived from exponentially growing HeLa cells were prepared by subjecting cells suspended in whole cell extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) to three cycles of freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen and ice. EMSAs were performed with either 15 μg of whole cell extract protein or ∼10 ng of each recombinant subunit in DNA binding buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 2 μg poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 100 mM KCl, and 10% glycerol) with or without 0.5 mM DTT. Extracts were first incubated on ice with poly(dI-dC) for 10 min before addition of a 32P-labeled probe and then electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide/0.5 × Tris/borate/EDTA gels as described previously (30Nakshatri H. Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19613-19623Google Scholar). The murine MHC class II Eα Y-box oligomer duplex (5′-GGCATTTTTCTGATTGGTTAAAAGTTG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCAACTTTTAACCAATCAGAAAAAT-3′) was end-labeled using the large subunit of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (30Nakshatri H. Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19613-19623Google Scholar). NF-κB and AP-1 binding site-containing oligomers were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). SRF binding site oligomer and α-SRF antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody upshift experiments and oligomer labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase were performed according to the manufacturer. Approximately 50 ng of recombinant NF-YB and individual cysteine mutants were incubated with ∼50 ng of recombinant GST-YC for 30 min at 37°C in binding buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) under nonreducing and reducing conditions (1.0 mM DTT). Glutathione-agarose (10-μl bead volume) pre-equilibrated in binding buffer was added, and the reaction binding buffer volume was increased to 200 μl. Incubation continued at room temperature for 1 h with gentle mixing. Glutathione-agarose beads were pelleted, washed five times in binding buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4°C, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer containing 50 mM DTT. Samples were separated on a 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting. Previous studies have indicated that the amino acid sequences of NF-YA and NF-YB are conserved in evolution, particularly in their DNA binding and subunit association domains (31Li X.-Y. Mantovani R. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1087-1091Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-YC is also similarly conserved, we cloned the human and mouse NF-YC subunits by PCR and compared their sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences from these cDNAs and their homology to rat CBF-C and yeast HAP5 are shown in Fig. 1. Similar to human NF-YA and NF-YB, which are more than 99% homologous to the corresponding mouse subunits (31Li X.-Y. Mantovani R. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1087-1091Google Scholar), human NF-YC was observed to be 96.5% homologous to mouse NF-YC (Fig. 1A). Amino acids at positions 43-124 of human, mouse, and rat NF-YC displayed 70% sequence homology to amino acids 134-215 of HAP5 in a manner analogous to the NF-YA and NF-YB subunits, which contain domains homologous to yeast HAP2 and HAP3, respectively (Fig. 1B). This region of NF-YC presumably contains the determinants of additional NF-Y subunit association and DNA binding activities. The secondary protein structure analysis of Chou and Fasman (32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Google Scholar) indicated that the HAP5 homology region of NF-YC, like similar domains of NF-YA and NF-YB, can form an α-helical structure (data not shown). The HAP2 homology domain of NF-YA and the HAP5 homology domain of NF-YC may also be organized in a similar manner in that they contain highly homologous N- and C-terminal subdomains separated by a variable linker region (31Li X.-Y. Mantovani R. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1087-1091Google Scholar, 33Xing Y.S. Zhang S. Olesen J.T. Rich A. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3009-3010Google Scholar). For example, amino acids 43-85 and 111-124 of NF-YC are 79 and 72% homologous to amino acids 134-176 and 202-215 of HAP5, respectively, whereas the intervening amino acids 86-110 are only 52% homologous to amino acids 177-201 of HAP5 (Fig. 1B). Amino acids C-terminal to the HAP 5 homology domain contain 30% glutamine residues (Fig. 1A) in which two subdomains (amino acids 150-165 and 199-216) contain more than 50% glutamine residues. Thus, glutamine-rich regions of NF-YC and NF-YA are organized in a similar fashion and may each represent specific trans-activation domains (3Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Google Scholar, 11Li X.-Y. van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Google Scholar). Taken together, sequence data homology comparisons indicate that NF-YA and NF-YC may contain structurally similar DNA binding, subunit association, and trans-activation domains. The cysteine residues of HAP3, although conserved evolutionarily, were previously shown not to be essential for DNA binding activity (14Xing Y. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4647-4655Google Scholar). To investigate whether the cysteine residues of NF-YB are essential for DNA binding and whether these same cysteine residues regulate DNA binding activity in response to redox environment, EMSAs using recombinant subunits were performed (Fig. 2). NF-Y subunits were mixed and preincubated for 15 min at 25 or 37°C. Under nonreducing conditions a low level of NF-Y complex formed with a MHC class II Eα CCAAT box oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3). However, inclusion of DTT in the preincubation step enhanced the DNA binding activity of recombinant NF-Y subunits by ∼15-fold (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). This property of recombinant NF-Y is similar to the property of recombinant Fos and Jun proteins, which also require treatment with a reducing agent to observe efficient DNA binding activity (16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Google Scholar). To identify the specific cysteine residues of NF-YB that were responsible for redox-dependent DNA binding, we tested the DNA binding activity of NF-YB in which cysteine residues had been mutated to serine. The YBC3 mutant, in which cysteine residue at amino acid position 105 has been mutated to serine, specifically bound DNA only in the presence of DTT (Fig. 2, lanes 5-8). YBC12, in which cysteines at position 85 and 89 had been mutated, and YBC123, in which all three cysteines were mutated, were able to form a NF-Y·DNA complex in the absence of DTT (Fig. 2, lanes 9-16). These results suggest that cysteines 85 and 89 of NF-YB must be reduced for NF-Y to efficiently bind CCAAT box DNA. In addition, these results indicate that, similar to yeast HAP3, the cysteine residues of NF-YB are not required for DNA binding activity (14Xing Y. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4647-4655Google Scholar). NF-Y subunits cleaved with thrombin to remove either GST or the polyhistidine residues from the NF-Y subunits behaved similarly to the fusion proteins described above (data not shown). Since the DNA binding activity of wild-type NF-YB was affected by redox perturbations, we examined whether this effect was due to an internal disulfide bridge and/or due to intermolecular disulfide bridges formed under nonreducing conditions. To this end, NF-YB and its cysteine mutants were analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel under nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 3). Approximately 70% of both wild-type YB and YBC3 were observed to migrate as monomers, whereas the remaining 30% migrated as an apparent dimeric species (∼68 kDa) when resolved under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3). DTT treatment converted the dimers to monomers (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4). However, only the monomeric forms of YBC12 and YBC123 were detected in this analysis (Fig. 3, lanes 5-8). These results also suggest that either cysteine 85 or 89 is involved in dimer formation. Although the above analysis cannot prove that intramolecular disulfide bonds in YB exist under nonreducing conditions, we believe that the majority of monomeric YB molecules contain intramolecular disulfide bonds, since the reduction of dimers to monomers alone cannot account for the magnitude of the DTT effect on overall NF-Y DNA binding activity (Fig. 2). Although the DNA binding studies and SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that NF-YB is the target of DTT, the above analysis was not sufficient to determine whether the failure of nonreduced NF-YB to bind DNA was due to its inability to interact with NF-YC or a defect in contacting DNA. To address this issue, we studied the association of NF-YB and NF-YC in the absence of DNA. As shown in Fig. 4, only low levels of the wild-type NF-YB and YBC3 mutant subunits were retained on a glutathione S-transferase-NF-YC (GST-YC) column under nonreducing condition (lanes 1 and 3). However, under reducing conditions, there was a dramatic increase in the amount of both YB and YBC3 retained by the GST-YC column (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4). The YBC12 and YBC123 mutants were retained by the GST-YC column under both nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 4, lanes 5-8). For unknown reasons, DTT treatment enhanced the association of YBC12 with GST-YC, although the DNA binding activity of this mutant was not influenced by DTT (Fig. 2). These results suggest that NF-YB modified with either intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide cross-links fails to interact with NF-YC, and this failure is responsible for the significant reduction in DNA binding activity. To explore whether there is a cellular component that can functionally replace DTT reduction of cysteine residues, we incubated recombinant NF-Y subunits with HeLa cell extract that had been heat-treated to inactivate endogenous NF-Y (34Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7265-7282Google Scholar). No NF-Y binding activity was detected in heat-treated HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4), and the DNA binding activity could be restored by addition of recombinant NF-YC (Fig. 5A, lanes 9 and 10). These results suggest that NF-YC is the heat-sensitive subunit in the NF-Y complex. Addition of GST-YB and recombinant YC to heat-treated extracts gave rise to a NF-Y complex composed of cellular NF-YA, GST-YB, and recombinant NF-YC (Fig. 5A, lanes 13 and 14). This complex was generated in the absence of DTT treatment, suggesting that a cellular factor could convert oxidized GST-YB to its reduced form. Analysis of the redox-regulated transcription factors Fos and Jun has indicated that a cellular factor, Ref-1, can stimulate DNA binding activity of these factors by acting as a reducing agent (22Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Google Scholar, 23Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson"
https://openalex.org/W1974004139,"Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) increases elastin gene transcription in aortic smooth muscle cells and that this up-regulation is accompanied by a loss of protein binding to the proximal promoter. Sp1 has been identified as one of the factors whose binding is lost, and in the present study we show that Sp3 binding is also abrogated by IGF-I, but in a selected manner. In functional analyses using Drosophila SL-2 cells, Sp1 expression can drive transcription from the elastin proximal promoter, while co-expression of Sp3 results in a repression of Sp1 activity. Footprint and gel shift analyses position the IGF-I responsive sequences to a putative retinoblastoma control element (RCE). Mutation of the putative RCE sequence as assessed by transient transfection of smooth muscle cells results in an increase in reporter activity equal in magnitude to that conferred by IGF-I on the wild type promoter. Together these results support the hypothesis that IGF-I-mediated increase in elastin transcription occurs via a mechanism of derepression involving the abrogation of a repressor that appears to be Sp3 binding to the RCE."
https://openalex.org/W2090334533,"Metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD) is a recently discovered 180-kDa membrane-bound carboxypeptidase E-like enzyme (Song, L. and Fricker, L. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25007-25013). In the present study, a soluble CPD-like activity has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. On denaturing polyacrylamide gels, the soluble enzyme from bovine pituitary glands appears as two bands of 170 and 135 kDa which are converted to 155 and 115 kDa by endoglycosidase F. Both of the soluble forms of CPD are recognized by an antisera raised against CPD purified from rat brain membranes. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two soluble forms are identical to each other and to the predicted N terminus of duck gp180. The soluble and membrane forms of CPD have similar pH optima, inhibitor specificities, and kinetic parameters for substrate hydrolysis. CPD-like enzymatic activity is detected in all rat tissues examined, with highest levels in pituitary, brain, and adrenal. Western blot analysis indicates that both soluble and membrane forms of CPD are present in rat brain, heart, liver, and kidney. At least four distinct 100-180-kDa forms of CPD are detected on Western blots, although an antiserum raised against the C-terminal region of rat CPD recognizes only the 180-kDa membrane-bound form. The finding that CPD is widely distributed suggests a broad role for this enzyme in the processing of proteins that transit the secretory pathway."

F0F1-ATP synthases found in energy-transducing membranes couple ATP synthesis and hydrolysis to proton electrochemical gradients (1Hatefi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 759-767Google Scholar). They are composed of an integral membrane protein complex, F0, which mediates proton conduction, and a peripheral membrane protein complex, F1, which bears the catalytic sites. When separated from F0 as a soluble complex, F1 is composed of five different subunits in a stoichiometry of α3β3γδϵ and functions as an ATPase (2Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9937-9940Google Scholar). The α3β3, α3β3γ, and α3β3δ subcomplexes reconstituted from the isolated subunits of TF1 1The abbreviations used are: TF1MF1, CF1 and YF1the F1-ATPases from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3bovine heart mitochondria, spinach thylakoids, and S. cerevisiae, respectivelyLDAOlauryl dimethylamine oxideDCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideCDTAtrans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. are active as ATPases (3Yohda M.

Both the α3β3 and α3β3δ subcomplexes differ from TF1 in that they are less specific for divalent cations and are insensitive to inhibition by azide (4Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21837-21841Google Scholar, 5Miwa K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6484-6487Google Scholar). In contrast, the catalytic characteristics of the α3β3γ subcomplex are very similar to those of TF1 (4Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21837-21841Google Scholar, 7Paik S.R. Yokoyama K. Yoshida M. Ohta T. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 679-684Google Scholar, 8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that expression of a plasmid bearing the genes encoding the α, β, and γ subunits of TF1 in an unc− strain of Escherichia coli leads to overproduction of the assembled α3β3γ complex, which can be purified in high yield (9Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Google Scholar). For these reasons, the wild-type and mutant α3β3γ complexes are valuable tools for examining structure-function relationships in F1-ATPases. MF1, CF1 and YF1 bovine heart mitochondria, spinach thylakoids, and S. cerevisiae, respectively lauryl dimethylamine oxide dicyclohexylcarbodiimide trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. The F1-ATPases contain six nucleotide binding sites. Three of these are potentially catalytic, whereas the others, for want of a defined function, are called noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites (10Cross R.L. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers, B. V., Amsterdam1992: 317-330Google Scholar, 11Allison W.S. Jault J.-M. Zhuo S. Paik S.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 469-477Google Scholar). The 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of MF1 shows that catalytic sites are predominantly in β subunits but also contain side chains arising from α subunits. Conversely, the noncatalytic sites are mostly in α subunits, with side chains from the β subunit contributing to them (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding domains of the α and β subunits have a common topology and contain the consensus sequence GX4GK(T/S), known as the Walker A motif (13Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar) or the P-loop (14Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Google Scholar). The P-loop is found in the nucleotide binding sites of many proteins including Ras p21, elongation factor-Tu, and the RecA protein (15Jurnak F. Science. 1985; 230: 32-36Google Scholar, 16Pai E.F.

Matsuo Y. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 1-5Google Scholar). The critical role of the P-loop in catalytic sites has been revealed by site-directed mutagenesis of the β subunits of the E. coli and YF1-ATPases (19Takeyama M. Ihara K. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. Ida K.

Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Google Scholar). The sequence of the P-loop in the β subunit of TF1 is 158GGAGVGKT165. Kinetic analysis of F1-ATPases is complicated by turnover-dependent entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site, which occurs during ATP hydrolysis when noncatalytic sites are not saturated with ATP. Three kinetic phases are observed when MF1, TF1, and the α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 hydrolyze low concentrations of ATP (8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Google Scholar, 22Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Google Scholar, 23Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Google Scholar). An initial burst rapidly decelerates to a slow, intermediate rate, which, in turn, progressively accelerates to the final steady-state rate. Transition from the burst to the intermediate rate, which has been well characterized in MF1 (24Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 9-14Google Scholar, 25Drobinskaya I.Y. Kozlov I.A. Murataliev M.B. Vulfson E.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 419-424Google Scholar) and CF1 (26Zhou J.-M. Xue Z. Du Z. Melese T. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5129-5135Google Scholar, 27Milgrom Y.M. Ehler L.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11551-11558Google Scholar, 28Murataliev M.B. Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Google Scholar), is caused by turnover-dependent entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site. Slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites relieves inhibition by promoting release of entrapped MgADP from the affected catalytic site. This is responsible for the transition from the intermediate rate to the final steady-state rate (8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Google Scholar, 22Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Google Scholar, 23Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Google Scholar). It has become clear that the apparent Km observed in the millimolar range when F1-ATPases hydrolyze 30-5000 μM ATP in the absence of activating anions or activation of the enzymes by prior loading of noncatalytic sites with PPi or ATP does not represent binding of ATP to a low affinity catalytic site but rather represents a rate acceleration caused by binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites (8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Google Scholar, 22Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Google Scholar). Therefore, the apparent negative cooperativity in this range of ATP concentration, initially reported for rat liver MF1 by Ebel and Lardy (29Ebel R.E. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 191-196Google Scholar) and later for bovine heart MF1 (30Schuster S.M. Ebel R.E. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7848-7853Google Scholar) and yeast F1 (31Gresser M.J. Meyers J.A. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12030-12038Google Scholar), is an in vitro artifact and is of little, if any, physiological significance. There have been several reports that Km values of 1-5 μM and 100-200 μM are observed when MF1 hydrolyzes ATP (32Recktenwald D. Hess B. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 25-28Google Scholar, 33Wong S.-Y. Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5004-5009Google Scholar, 34Kasho V.N. Boyer P.D. J. Bioerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 407-408Google Scholar, 35Roveri O.A. Calcaterra N.B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 123-127Google Scholar). Since substoichiometric ATP binds to a single catalytic site under “unisite” conditions with a Kd of less than 1 nM (36Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Google Scholar), it appears that the Km of 1-5 μM represents “bisite” catalysis and that the Km of 100-200 μM represents “trisite” catalysis. However, Boyer (37Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Google Scholar) has suggested that the Km of 1-5 μM is also an artifact associated with entrapment of inhibitory ADP in a catalytic site and contends that the Km of 100-200 μM represents bisite catalysis and that Vmax rates are attained when two catalytic sites are saturated. Substitution of the adjacent threonine on the C-terminal side of the lysine in the P-loop of the β subunit of YF1 (38Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16552-16556Google Scholar) or E. coli F1 (20Omote H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20571-20576Google Scholar) leads to enzyme with augmented ATPase activity. This substitution increases the specific activity of YF1 3-fold, eliminates stimulation by oxyanions, and reduces sensitivity to inhibition induced by azide 25-fold (38Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16552-16556Google Scholar, 39Mueller D.M. Indyk V. McGill L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 991-999Google Scholar). Although these characteristics suggest that the mutant YF1 might not entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover, the kinetic analysis used by Mueller et al. (39Mueller D.M. Indyk V. McGill L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 991-999Google Scholar) was not sufficiently discriminating to establish this with certainty. Rather than looking for turnover-dependent entrapment of inhibitory MgADP, they determined apparent Ki values for ADP using a phosphate release assay. The Ki values reported by Mueller et al. (39Mueller D.M. Indyk V. McGill L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 991-999Google Scholar) are based on the effect of increasing, fixed ADP concentrations on the high Km portions of biphasic Lineweaver-Burk plots. However, for reasons stated above, the apparent Km in this concentration range does not represent ATP binding to catalytic sites but rather represents, at least for the wild-type enzyme, ATP binding to noncatalytic sites that promotes dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site (22Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Google Scholar). Therefore, the Ki values obtained represent competition of ADP with ATP for noncatalytic sites. This investigation was initiated to determine 1) whether the α3(βT165S)3γ mutant subcomplex of TF1 does or does not entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover using appropriate kinetic analysis and 2) if it does not, whether the mutant subcomplex exhibits a Km of 1-5 μM when it hydrolyzes low concentrations of ATP. The results obtained clearly show that the mutant complex does not entrap appreciable MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover and that it exhibits a Km of 1-5 μM when it hydrolyzes low concentrations of ATP. Biochemicals used in the assays and buffer components were purchased from Sigma. DuPont NEN supplied the [3H]ADP. DCCD and Rhodamine 6G were purchased from Aldrich. LDAO was purchased from Calbiochem. Purification of the wild-type α3β3γ and mutant α3(βT165S)3γ complexes was carried out according to Matsui and Yoshida (9Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Google Scholar). The complexes were stored at 4°C as precipitates in 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. After submitting the α3β3γ and α3(βT165S)3γ complexes to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the only protein bands that were revealed on the stained gels corresponded to the α, β, and γ subunits in a 3:3:1 ratio. Unless indicated otherwise, stock solutions of the complexes were prepared by removing ammonium sulfate precipitates from mother liquor by centrifugation and dissolving the pellets in either 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mM EDTA or 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 10 μM CDTA. The dissolved complexes were then passed through 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G50, which were equilibrated with the same buffer (40Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant complexes were stable at least 1 week in these buffers at 4°C. However, they were usually used for experiments on the day of preparation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described by Kunkel et al. (41Kunkel T.A. Benebek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used to introduce the βT165S mutation was: 5′-GCT CTT GGA TCA GTA CTG ATT TTC CTA CG-3′. The oligonucleotide also contained a new site for ScaI, which allowed facile screening for the mutation. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (42Sanger F. Coulson A. Barrell B. Smith A. Roe B. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Google Scholar) using the Sequenase 2.0 kit supplied by Amersham. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). ATPase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using an ATP regeneration system at 30°C and pH 8.0, as specified previously (44Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 319-325Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, the Mg2+ concentration in the assay medium was 1 mM greater than the ATP concentration. Binding of [3H]ADP to the wild-type α3β3γ and mutant α3(βT165S)3γ complexes was performed as described previously (22Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Google Scholar) with the use of 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G50 (40Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar) under conditions specified in the legend of Fig. 4. Radioactivity was detected with a Packard 1600 TR counter using Ecoscint from National Diagnostics. Fig. 1 compares hydrolysis of 50 μM ATP by the wild-type and mutant complexes in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system before and after incubation of each with a slight excess of ADP in the presence of Mg2+ in order to load a catalytic site with MgADP (45Yoshida M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5714-5721Google Scholar). Trace a of Fig. 1 illustrates that three kinetic phases are exhibited during hydrolysis of 50 μM ATP by 10 μg of the wild-type complex. The final rate of ATP hydrolysis in trace a is 5.4 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min. In contrast, trace c shows that 50 μM ATP is hydrolyzed by 2 μg of the mutant complex with a slightly accelerating rate before a final steady-state rate of 30 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min is attained. After incubation with a 1.4 M excess of ADP plus Mg2+, the wild-type complex hydrolyzes 50 μM ATP with an extended lag, which is illustrated by trace b. After prior incubation with ADP plus Mg2+, the mutant complex hydrolyzes 50 μM ATP with a clearly perceptible lag (trace d), albeit one that is much less pronounced than that observed for the wild-type complex under the same conditions (trace b). Fig. 2 compares hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP by 5.5 μg of the wild-type α3β3γ complex or 1.5 μg of the mutant complex before and after incubation of each with a 1.4 M excess of ADP in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+. The effects of azide on hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP by the wild-type and mutant complexes are also compared. Traces a and c of Fig. 2A compare hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP by the wild-type complex before and after incubation with ADP plus Mg2+. As observed for intact TF1 (23Paik S.R. Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Google Scholar, 45Yoshida M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5714-5721Google Scholar), trace a illustrates that the wild-type α3β3γ complex hydrolyzes 2 mM ATP with a pronounced lag. The final rate of ATP hydrolysis in trace a is 18 μmol/mg/min. The lag becomes more pronounced after incubating the wild-type complex with a 1.4 M excess of ADP plus Mg2+ as illustrated by trace c. However, the final rate of ATP hydrolysis in trace c is also 18 μmol/mg/min. Trace b of Fig. 2A illustrates inhibition that develops during turnover when the wild-type complex hydrolyzes 2 mM ATP when 1.0 mM NaN3 is present in the assay medium. Maximal inhibition developed within 3 min after initiating the assay. The final specific activity exhibited in the trace is about 0.45 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min. After incubating the wild-type complex with a 1.4 M excess of ADP plus Mg2+ and 1.0 mM NaN3 prior to assay, the rate of ATP hydrolysis is slowed to 0.15 mol/mg/min, which is illustrated by trace d of Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B shows that the ATPase activity of the mutant α3(βT165S)3γ complex responds differently than that of the wild-type complex to prior incubation with ADP plus Mg2+ and also shows that the mutant complex is much less sensitive to turnover-dependent inhibition by azide. Comparison of traces a and c of Fig. 2B shows that prior incubation of the mutant complex with ADP plus Mg2+ has very little effect on the kinetics of hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP. Nearly identical lags are exhibited before a final rate of 85 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min is attained with or without prior incubation of the mutant complex with ADP plus Mg2+. Trace b shows that only slight turnover-dependent inhibition develops in the early stage of hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP by the mutant complex in the presence of 1.0 mM NaN3. However, it is clear that inhibition slowly develops in the latter part of the trace. Comparison of traces d of Fig. 2, A and B, shows that the mutant complex is inhibited to a much lesser extent than the wild-type complex when it is incubated with a 1.4 M excess of ADP plus Mg2+ in the presence of 1.0 mM NaN3 prior to assay. The slowly accelerating rate in the time interval illustrated in trace d of Fig. 2B corresponds to about 6 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min. This is 40-fold greater than that catalyzed by the wild-type complex under the same conditions (trace d of Fig. 2A). It has been shown in previous studies that the ATPase activities of TF1 and the wild-type α3β3γ complex are stimulated about 4-fold by LDAO (7Paik S.R. Yokoyama K. Yoshida M. Ohta T. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 679-684Google Scholar, 8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Google Scholar). Therefore, the observation that hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP catalyzed by the mutant α3(βT165S)3γ complex is inhibited by about 25% in the presence of 0.06% LDAO was unexpected. This observation prompted a comparison of the dependence of the ATPase activities of the wild-type and mutant complexes on increasing concentrations of LDAO. Fig. 3A shows that the steady-state rate of hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP catalyzed by the wild-type complex (open circles) is progressively augmented by increasing concentrations of the detergent until maximal stimulation of about 4-fold is observed at 0.15% LDAO, in agreement with previously reported results (8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Google Scholar). In contrast, LDAO inhibits rather than stimulates the steady-state rate of hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP by the mutant complex (solid circles). Maximal inhibition of about 25% is observed at approximately 0.05% LDAO. The differential effects of rhodamine 6G on the mutant and wild-type complexes were also examined. It was previously shown that the ATPase activities of TF1 and the α3β3γ and α3β3γδ complexes are first stimulated and then inhibited by increasing concentrations of rhodamine 6G. Maximal stimulation is observed at about 10 μM rhodamine 6G (7Paik S.R. Yokoyama K. Yoshida M. Ohta T. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 679-684Google Scholar). Fig. 3B compares the effects of increasing concentrations of rhodamine 6G on hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP by the wild-type complex (open circles) and the mutant complex (solid circles). Whereas the wild-type complex is stimulated by low concentrations and inhibited by high concentrations of rhodamine 6G, the mutant complex is inhibited at all concentrations of the dye examined. The I50 values estimated for inhibition of the mutant and wild-type complexes by rhodamine 6G are ∼10 and ∼100 μM, respectively. Incubation of the wild-type or mutant complexes with a 1.4 M excess of [3H]ADP in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ is accompanied by the binding of 0.85-0.90 mol of ADP/mol of complex, which is not removed by a single pass through a centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50, as illustrated in Fig. 4. When the same experiment was carried out in the absence of Mg2+ in the incubation mixture, only 0.2 mol of [3H]ADP remained bound after passing the complexes through a centrifuge column of Sephadex G50. When the complex of Mg[3H]ADP with the wild-type α3β3γ subcomplex was diluted 20-fold into a reaction mixture containing 40 μM ATP in the presence of 1.0 mM Mg2+, the preloaded [3H]ADP dissociated with a half-time of about 2 min (open circles). In contrast, dilution of the preloaded α3(βT165S)3γ complex into the reaction mixture led to dissociation of the majority of the [3H]ADP within 30 s (open triangles). When the preloaded wild-type complex was diluted into a reaction mixture containing 0.045% LDAO, dissociation of [3H]ADP was greatly accelerated to a rate roughly the same as that observed for the mutant complex (solid circles). Dilution of the preloaded mutant complex into a reaction mixture containing 0.045% LDAO had virtually no effect on the rate of dissociation of [3H]ADP (solid triangles). As previously reported for the wild-type complex (8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Google Scholar), dilution of the mutant complex preloaded with Mg[3H]ADP in buffer containing 0.045% LDAO in the absence of ATP did not promote dissociation of [3H]ADP (data not shown). It has been clearly shown that turnover-dependent inhibition of CF1 and MF1 caused by entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during ATP hydrolysis increases as the concentration of free Mg2+ in the assay medium is raised (46Guerrero K.J. Xue Z. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16280-16287Google Scholar, 47Murataliev M.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12885-12892Google Scholar). Since the results presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 suggest that the mutant complex does not entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover, the effects of increasing the concentration of free Mg2+ on the rates of hydrolysis of 50 μM and 2 mM ATP by the wild-type and mutant complexes were examined. The results of this comparison are summarized in Table I. The rates were measured between 1.0 and 2.0 min after initiation of the assays. This interval represents the rate of the intermediate phase when the wild-type complex hydrolyzes 50 μM ATP. Increasing the concentration of Mg2+ decreases the rate of hydrolysis of 50 μM or 2.0 mM ATP by the wild-type complex. In contrast, increased Mg2+ concentration has no effect on the hydrolytic activity of the mutant complex at either concentration of ATP in the assay medium.Table IEffects of increasing Mg2+ concentration on hydrolysis of ATP by the wild-type and mutants complexes[MgCl2]Hydrolsis of 50 μM ATPHydrolysis of 2 mM ATPWild-typeMutantWild-typeMutantmMμmol/mg/minμmol/mg/min14.52723.327188632.82813854985578510582 Open table in a new tab Inactivation of TF1 with DCCD derivatizes Gluβ190 (48Yoshida M. Poser J.W. Allison W.S. Esch F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 148-153Google Scholar) which is equivalent to Gluβ188 of MF1. In the deduced crystal structure of MF1, the carboxylic acid side chain of Gluβ188 is positioned appropriately to act as the general base that activates the attacking water molecule during ATP hydrolysis (12Abrahams J.P.

Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14407-14412Google Scholar), whereas the addition of Mg2+ to form the 1:1:1 TF1·ADP·Mg complex or the addition of Mg2+ directly to TF1 decreases the rate of inactivation by DCCD. These opposing effects suggest that reactivity of DCCD with the carboxylate side chain Gluβ190 is sensitive to conformational changes induced by binding of ligands to a catalytic site. Therefore, it was of interest to compare the inactivation of the wild-type and mutant complexes by DCCD in the presence of ADP, ADP plus Mg2+, or Mg2+ alone. Table II compares the pseudo-first-order rate constants obtained for inactivation of the wild-type and mutant complexes with DCCD in the presence or absence of ADP and/or Mg2+. The rate of inactivation of the wild-type complex is accelerated 2.4-fold in the presence of ADP. In the presence of ADP plus Mg2+ or of Mg2+ alone, the rate of inactivation of the wild-type complex is decelerated by about 65%. In the absence of effectors, the rate of inactivation of the mutant complex by DCCD is only 50% of that observed for the wild-type complex under identical conditions. The rate of inactivation of the mutant complex is not affected by ADP alone. Furthermore, the rate of inactivation of the mutant complex is decelerated by only 15% of that observed for the wild-type complex in the presence of ADP plus Mg2+ or Mg2+ alone.Table IIThe effects of ligands on the rate of inactivation of the wild-type and mutant complexes by DCCDComplexAdditionskinactkinact percentage of α3β3γ with no additionsmin−1Wild-typeNone1.6 × 10−2100Wild-typeADP3.9 × 10−2244Wild-typeADP +Mg2+5.6 × 10−335Wild-typeMg2+6.0 × 10−338ComplexAdditionskinactkinact percentage of α3(βT165S)3γ with no additionsMutantNone7.7 × 10−3100MutantADP7.8 × 10−3100MutantADP + Mg2+6.3 × 10−382MutantMg2+6.7 × 10−387 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5A compares Lineweaver-Burk plots obtained from rates of hydrolysis (recorded between 15 and 45 s after initiating assays) of 20-2000 μM ATP catalyzed by the wild-type (solid circles) and mutant (solid squares) complexes. The double reciprocal plot for the wild-type complex is biphasic, displaying apparent negative cooperativity in this range of ATP concentration. Extrapolation of the linear portion of the plot obtained for the wild-type complex in the high range of ATP concentration reveals an apparent Km of 470 μM with an associated kcat of 77 s−1. An apparent Km of 30 μM with an associated kcat of 26 s−1 is estimated from extrapolation of the phase obtained at low concentrations of ATP. In contrast, the Lineweaver-Burk plot for the mutant complex in this range of ATP concentration is linear and extrapolates to a Km of 133 μM and a kcat of 360 s−1. Fig. 5B shows that a Lineweaver-Burk plot of rates of hydrolysis (recorded between 15 and 45 s after initiating assays) of 4.0-2000 μM ATP catalyzed by the mutant complex displays negative cooperativity with the transition between high and low affinity sites occurring between 8 and 10 μM ATP. The major conclusion emerging from this study is that the mutant α3(βT165S)3γ complex, unlike the wild-type α3β3γ complex, does not entrap appreciable inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site when it hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of a regenerating system. Differences in the hydrolytic properties of the mutant and wild-type complexes that support this contention are the following. 1) The wild-type complex hydrolyzes 50 μM ATP in three phases; an initial burst rapidly decelerates to a slower, intermediate phase, which, in turn, accelerates to the final steady-state rate. In contrast, the mutant complex hydrolyzes 50 μM ATP with a slightly accelerating rate. The final steady-state rate of the mutant complex is 5-fold greater than that observed for the wild-type complex. 2) The rate of hydrolysis of 50 μM or 2 mM ATP by the mutant complex is not affected by increasing the concentration of Mg2+ in the assay medium. In contrast, the rate of hydrolysis of 50 μM or 2 mM ATP catalyzed by wild-type complex is markedly suppressed by increasing the concentration of Mg2+ in the assay medium. 3) The mutant complex is much less sensitive than the wild-type complex to turnover-dependent inhibition when it hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of azide. 4) A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the initial rates of hydrolysis of 20-4000 μM ATP catalyzed by the mutant complex is linear rather than biphasic as observed for the wild-type enzyme. It has been shown with MF1 that biphasic Lineweaver-Burk plots for hydrolysis of ATP in this concentration range are caused by slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites, which promotes dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site (22Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Google Scholar). To explain transient entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a single catalytic site during ATP hydrolysis by MF1, it has been hypothesized that an active (24Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 9-14Google Scholar) or a readily activable (50Milgrom Y.M. Murataliev M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 50-58Google Scholar) F1·ADP·Mg complex is in equilibrium with an inactive F1*·ADP·Mg complex. It has been proposed that turnover-dependent inhibition by azide is caused by stabilization of the F1*·ADP·Mg complex (51Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Google Scholar, 52Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Google Scholar). The postulated equilibria are illustrated in Scheme I. The results presented here are entirely consistent with the proposed equilibria. The kinetic characterization described suggests that, in the case of the α3(βT165S)3γ complex, the equilibrium between the F1·ADP·Mg and F1*·ADP·Mg complexes is predominantly in favor of the F1·ADP·Mg complex. This argument is consistent with the observation that preloading a catalytic site of the mutant complex with MgADP only slightly affects the initial rate of hydrolysis of 50 μM ATP and has essentially no effect on the hydrolysis of 2 mM ATP. It is also consistent with the observation that the mutant complex is much less sensitive to turnover-dependent inhibition when assayed in the presence of azide but becomes substantially inhibited when incubated with MgADP in the presence of azide prior to assay. Presumably, this occurs with slow formation of the more stable F1*·ADP·Mg·N3− complex at a catalytic site. Milgrom and Murataliev (50Milgrom Y.M. Murataliev M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 50-58Google Scholar) and Bulygin and Vinogradov (53Bulygin V.V. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 149-156Google Scholar) have reported that the MF1·ADP·Mg complex slowly isomerizes to the MF1*·ADP·Mg complex. Although the molecular basis for the isomerization remains obscure, results presented here suggest that changes in the conformation of the affected catalytic site might be involved. Unlike the wild-type complex and TF1, the rate of inactivation of the α3(βT165S)3γ complex by DCCD is not accelerated by ADP, and compared with the wild-type complex and TF1, it is only slightly decelerated by Mg2+ in the presence or absence of ADP. These observations suggest that the active site of the mutant complex does not undergo the same ligand-induced conformational changes that occur in the wild-type complex. In the crystal structure of MF1, the equivalent of Thrβ165 of TF1 is liganded to the Mg2+ ions complexed with ADP or AMP-PNP at the catalytic sites designated βDP and βTP, respectively (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). A hypothetical explanation for the turnover-dependent entrapment of MgADP in a catalytic site of wild-type F1-ATPases is the following. In the absence of saturation of noncatalytic sites with ATP, MgPi dissociates first at low frequency during ATP hydrolysis leaving ADP bound to a catalytic site. Binding of Mg2+ from the medium to the catalytic site containing bound ADP forms the F1·ADP·Mg2+ complex that slowly isomerizes to the inactive F1*·ADP·Mg complex. Although the mutant complex does not entrap substantial inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover, a slightly accelerating rate is exhibited when it hydrolyzes 50 μM ATP, and a distinct lag is observed when it hydrolyzes 2 mM ATP. To explain this apparent dilemma, we suggest that slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites during turnover causes a slight activation, which is independent of promotion of dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site. If this is indeed the case, the accelerations attributed to the binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites of the wild-type complex would reflect dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site plus the acceleration observed for the mutant complex. The linear Lineweaver-Burk plot exhibited for the initial rate of hydrolysis of 20-2000 μM ATP by the mutant complex is consistent with the finding that it does not entrap appreciable inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover. It was shown earlier that the apparent negative cooperativity displayed on Lineweaver-Burk plots for hydrolysis of ATP in this concentration range by MF1 is caused by slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites, which promotes dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from the affected catalytic site (22Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Google Scholar). The negative cooperativity exhibited on the Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed from the initial rates of hydrolysis of 4-2000 μM ATP catalyzed by the mutant complex is consistent with previously reported results (54Allison W.S. Jault J.-M. Grodski N.B. Dou C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 752-756Google Scholar). It was shown that an Eadie-Hofstee plot constructed from the initial rates of hydrolysis of 0.1-2000 μM ATP is biphasic, revealing Km values of 1.4 μM and 110 μM with associated kcat values of 14 and 340 s−1, respectively. The Km values derived from the Lineweaver-Burk plot shown in Fig. 5B are about 5 μM and 110 μM with respective kcat values of about 38 and 400 s−1. The Km of 1-5 μM observed for the mutant complex is clearly not an artifact associated with entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site as proposed by Boyer (37Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Google Scholar). Therefore, we interpret the Km of 1-5 μM with an associated kcat of about 20 s−1 to represent catalysis when only two catalytic sites are saturated with ATP and the Km of about 120 μM with an associated kcat of about 350 s−1 to represent catalysis when three catalytic sites are saturated with substrate. Using a different approach, Weber et al. (55Weber J. Wilke-Mounts W. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Google Scholar) also conclude that the βY331W mutant of the E. coli F1-ATPase attains maximal velocity when three catalytic sites are saturated with ATP. It should be pointed out that in their correlation of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with ATPase activity as ATP concentration was increased, Weber et al. (55Weber J. Wilke-Mounts W. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Google Scholar) failed to detect significant “bisite catalysis.” However, more recently, using the same method to correlate catalytic site occupancy with TNP-ATP hydrolysis, Weber and Senior (56Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Google Scholar) reported that the Vmax for TNP-ATP hydrolysis under bisite conditions is about 40% of the Vmax observed under trisite conditions."

In the present work we report that the UBC1 enzyme assembles onto itself a multi-ubiquitin chain in vitro whose linkage configuration is dependent on the unconserved carboxyl-terminal extension or tail that is appended to its catalytic domain. Using chemical cleavage and site-specific mutagenesis, we have mapped the location of the chain to lysine 93 which lies near the active site within the catalytic domain. The ubiquitin molecule that anchors the chain is transferred to this lysine from the active site of the same UBC1 molecule. When the tail of UBC1 is deleted, the catalytic domain synthesizes a chain that consists of ubiquitin molecules uniformly linked to one another via lysine 48. In the presence of the tail, however, a chain is assembled that is composed of linkages that are stable to alkali but which do not utilize lysines. Furthermore, when the amino terminus of ubiquitin is blocked by an appended peptide tag, chain assembly reverts from this alternative configuration to the canonical lysine 48 variety.

https://openalex.org/W2055645204,"The fluorescence of 2-aminopurine deoxynucleotide positioned in a 3′-terminal mismatch was used to evaluate the pre-steady state kinetics of the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity of bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase on defined DNA substrates. DNA substrates with one, two, or three preformed terminal mispairs simulated increasing degrees of strand separation at a primer terminus. The effects of base pair stability and local DNA sequence on excision rates were investigated by using DNA substrates that were either relatively G + C- or A + T-rich. The importance of strand separation as a prerequisite to the hydrolysis of a terminal nucleotide was demonstrated by using a unique mutant DNA polymerase that could degrade single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA, unless two or more 3′-terminal nucleotides were unpaired. Our results led us to conclude that the reduced exonuclease activity of this mutant DNA polymerase on duplex DNA substrates is due to a defect in melting the primer terminus in preparation for the excision reaction. The mutated amino acid (serine substitution for glycine at codon 255) resides in a critical loop structure determined from a crystallographic study of an amino-terminal fragment of T4 DNA polymerase.

These results suggest an active role for amino acid residues in the exonuclease domain of the T4 DNA polymerase in the strand separation step. Exonucleolytic proofreading by DNA polymerases is an important component of high fidelity DNA replication. Nucleotide insertion errors occur at a frequency of 10−3 to 10−5, but the DNA polymerase-associated 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity further reduces replication errors by 100-fold or more (reviewed in Ref. 1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Google Scholar). Different steps of the proofreading reaction have been revealed by mutational analysis of the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. Mutant T4 DNA polymerases deficient in 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity exhibit a strong mutator phenotype that can be used to select for mutant DNA polymerases (2Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 711-724Google Scholar, 3Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E. Goodrich L.D. Konigsberg W.H. Spicer E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The loss of the 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity by mutation can be achieved by preventing distinct steps in the proofreading process. The hydrolysis reaction may be prevented if residues required for catalysis are substituted with other amino acids. For example, the substitution of Ala residues for Asp residues that bind essential Mg2+ ions in the exonuclease active center reduces the exonuclease activity to barely detectable levels (5Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Google Scholar, 6Frey M.W. Nossal N.G. Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2579-2583Google Scholar, 7Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27100-27108Google Scholar). Another reaction step in proofreading that may be affected by mutation is the translocation of the primer end of the DNA between the spatially distinct polymerase and exonuclease active centers. Identification of several “active-site switching mutants” has been described recently (8Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Google Scholar, 9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Google Scholar). DNA polymerase proofreading is a dynamic process; if “switching” to the exonuclease active site is reduced by mutation, there is less opportunity for proofreading and a mutator phenotype is produced (9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Google Scholar). Another proofreading reaction step that may be probed by mutational analysis of T4 DNA polymerase is strand separation. The 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (10Huang W.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3139-3146Google Scholar) and other proofreading DNA polymerases is a single-stranded DNA exonuclease activity. Structural studies of the Klenow fragment (KF) 1The abbreviations used are: KFKlenow fragment2AP2-aminopurined2APMPdeoxy-2-aminopurine nucleoside monophosphateDTTdithiothreitol. of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I show that single-stranded DNA is bound in the exonuclease active center (11Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar), and time-resolved fluorescence experiments confirm that single-stranded DNA is bound under physiological conditions and in an extended conformation (12Hochstrasser R.A. Carver T.E. Sowers L.C. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11971-11979Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments demonstrate that at least four 3′-terminal nucleotides must be separated from the template strand in order for KF to excise the terminal nucleotide and that a two nucleotide strand separation is required for T4 DNA polymerase (13Cowart M.C. Gibson K.J. Allen D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1975-1983Google Scholar). The mechanism, however, for converting the natural substrate for proofreading, a duplex DNA with a terminal mismatch, into a DNA with a strand separation of two or more nucleotides has not been elucidated. Klenow fragment 2-aminopurine deoxy-2-aminopurine nucleoside monophosphate dithiothreitol. We report here the biochemical characterization of a mutant T4 DNA polymerase with an apparent defect in strand separation. This mutant, the G255S-DNA polymerase (Gly to Ser substitution at codon 255), was isolated by two different genetic selection strategies for mutant DNA polymerases with reduced exonucleolytic proofreading. In one method, the mutant was identified on the basis of a strong mutator phenotype (2Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 711-724Google Scholar). In the second method, mutations that encode G255A (Ala substitution for Gly-255) and G255S amino acid substitutions were identified repeatedly as suppressors of the excessive proofreading produced by other DNA polymerase mutations (9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Google Scholar). Residue Gly-255 and the surrounding region has been identified as a “hot spot” by our genetic selection methods for mutations that decrease proofreading (9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Google Scholar). Although it has only been assumed that Gly-255 resides in the exonuclease domain based on protein sequence comparisons to KF (2Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 711-724Google Scholar, 3Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E. Goodrich L.D. Konigsberg W.H. Spicer E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Google Scholar), recent structural studies of an amino-terminal fragment of the T4 DNA polymerase verify that residue Gly-255 is located in the exonuclease domain (14Wang J. Yu P. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8110-8119Google Scholar). Because of the numerous independent genetic isolations of the G255S-DNA polymerase, this mutant enzyme was purified and the exonuclease activity measured. Surprisingly, the wild type level of 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity was detected with single-stranded DNA substrates which indicates that the ability to hydrolyze a phosphodiester bond is not affected in the mutant enzyme; however, significantly reduced activity was observed with double-stranded DNAs (9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Google Scholar). These results suggest that some aspect in the process of converting duplex DNA with a mispaired primer terminus, the natural substrate for proofreading, into the more strand-separated DNA required for 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity is defective in the mutant. Thus, determination of the biochemical basis of this defect in proofreading by the G255S-DNA polymerase may reveal insights into the mechanism used by DNA polymerases to achieve strand separation. We have previously used the fluorescent analogue of adenine, 2-aminopurine (2AP), positioned in a terminal base pair, to study the pre-steady state kinetics of the 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (15Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar). In order to investigate the strand separation step, we designed a series of DNA substrates with an increasing number of mispairs at the primer terminus in order to simulate varying degrees of strand separation. By employing rapid mixing, stopped-flow techniques with sensitive fluorescence detection, we were able to investigate the pre-steady state kinetics of the 3′→ 5′-exonuclease reaction of T4 wild type- and G255S-DNA polymerases within the millisecond time scale. Similar levels of exonuclease activity were detected for the two enzymes with single-stranded DNA substrates, but excision rates were significantly reduced for the mutant on duplex DNA substrates with preformed strand separations of less than two nucleotides. Another difference between the mutant and wild type enzymes was that while A-T base pairs upstream of the 2AP mismatch, compared with upstream G-C base pairs, stimulated excision rates by the wild type T4 DNA polymerase, the A + T or G + C richness of the flanking DNA did not affect excision rates by the G255S-DNA polymerase. A + T-rich sequences are expected to facilitate local melting (16Bessman M.J. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 115-123Google Scholar, 17Carver Jr., T.E. Hochstrasser R.A. Millar D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10670-10674Google Scholar); yet, the G255S-DNA polymerase, unlike the wild type enzyme, could not take advantage of A + T richness to separate the primer strand from the template strand. These results are most consistent with a recent crystallographic study of the exonuclease domain showing the location of Gly-255 in a critical loop structure (14Wang J. Yu P. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8110-8119Google Scholar) and support a proofreading mechanism in which amino acid residues in the exonuclease domain of the T4 DNA polymerase assist the strand separation process. Wild type T4 DNA polymerase and the G255S-DNA polymerase were produced from the T4 DNA polymerase expression vector (9Stocki S.A. Nonay R.L. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 15-28Google Scholar, 18Lin T.-C. Rush J.R. Spicer E.K. Konigsberg W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7000-7004Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (19Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. Stocki S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 60-66Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were prepared using standard β-cyano-ethylphosphoramidite reagents from Applied Biosystems. 2AP was incorporated at the 3′-end using a 2AP-derivatized controlled pore-glass solid support (20Connolly B.A. Eckstein F. Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 162-168Google Scholar, 21Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Mhaskar D. Sowers L.C. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5869-5884Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then dialyzed against distilled water with 0.1 mM EDTA. The primer-templates were annealed in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl as described (15Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar). The concentration of the template strand was 20% higher than the concentration of the 2AP primer strand to ensure that all of the primer was annealed (15Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar). If any unannealed primer was present in the reactions, then a burst of hydrolysis due to rapid degradation of single-stranded DNA would be detected; this was not observed. The primer-templates used are described in Table I. Two sets of DNA duplexes (17/30-mers) were prepared; one set was relatively more G + C-rich upstream of the terminal 2AP base pair and one set was more A + T-rich. For the G + C-rich set of primer-templates, 2AP was paired opposite either template T, A, C, or G (XZ1-XZ4). For the A + T-rich set of primer-templates, 2AP was paired opposite template T (XZ8) or C (XZ9). For both the G + C-rich and A + T-rich primer-templates, an A-T base pair was immediately adjacent to the 2AP base pair. The next three upstream base pairs were then either consecutive G-C base pairs (XZ12 primer set) or A-T base pairs (XZ13 primer set). Another variation was to introduce one or two mispairs upstream of the 2AP-C base pair. To produce two 3′-terminal mispairs, the terminal 2AP-C mispair was adjacent to an upstream T-C mispair (template XZ6 for the G + C-rich primer set and template XZ10 for the A + T-rich primer set). To produce three terminal mispairs, the terminal 2AP-C mispair was adjacent to the T-C mispair, and this mispair was adjacent to an upstream G-G mispair in the G + C-rich primer set (template XZ7) and to an A-G mispair in the A + T-rich primer set (template XZ11).Table IDNA sequences of primer-templatesPrimer 1, XZ12 (G + C-rich)5′ G C A C G T C A T T A A C G G T PTemplatesXZ13′ C G T G C A G T A A T T G C C A T G G A T C G A T G G T T TXZ23′AXZ33′CXZ43′GXZ63′CCXZ73′GCCPrimer 2, XZ13 (A + T-rich)5′ G C A C G T C A T C G G T A A T PTemplatesXZ83′ C G T G C A G T A G C C A T T A T G G A T C G A T G G T T TXZ93′CXZ103′CCXZ113′CCG Open table in a new tab Absorbance measurements to determine protein and DNA concentrations were carried out with a DU650 Beckman spectrophotometer equipped with a thermally jacketed 1-cm cuvette holder. Enzyme concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm using the experimentally determined extinction coefficient of 1.492 × 105M−1 cm−1 (3Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E. Goodrich L.D. Konigsberg W.H. Spicer E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2417-2421Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements at 260 nm. Extinction coefficients were calculated based on the nucleotide composition of the oligonucleotides using the EXTINCT.FOR program developed by J. M. Beechem, Vanderbilt University (based on Ref. 22Fassman G. Handbook of Biochemistry, Nucleic Acids. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1975: 589Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence spectra were collected by exciting the samples at 310 nm and scanning from 330 to 460 nm using a monochromator. The excitation monochromator was set at a slit width of 3 mm and the emission monochromator was set at 5 mm. The photomultiplier voltage was set at 999 V. Background emissions from buffer were subtracted from all scans. Stopped-flow emission scans and kinetic measurements were performed using the SX.17 MV spectrofluorimeter from Applied Biophysics. Pre-steady state kinetic experiments were performed in the stopped-flow using a 335-nm cut-off filter and 310 nm excitation light from a xenon arc source passing through a 2-nm band pass. The photomultiplier voltage was set at 700 V, and scattered light was subtracted from the reaction signal by applying an offset voltage. All kinetic measurements were carried out at 20.0 ± 0.5°C by allowing water from a thermostated bath to flow around the optical cell and the reservoir syringes. Excision reactions were initiated in the stopped-flow apparatus by mixing equal volumes of T4 DNA polymerase and Mg2+ with the DNA primer-templates. One syringe contained 1.4 μM T4 DNA polymerase, 2 mM DTT, 16 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl. The second syringe contained 400 nM DNA (DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of 3′-2AP ends), in 0.5 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl. Equal volumes (approximately 50 μl) of each solution were mixed within the instrument dead time of 1.5 ms by pneumatic rams triggered by 140 p.s.i. of N2 gas. Final concentrations of reaction components were 700 nM T4 polymerase, 200 nM DNA, 1 mM DTT, 8 mM Mg2+, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl. Excision reactions measured in the presence of dNTPs (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were done by adding dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, each at 200 μM, to the syringe with enzyme. After mixing with the DNA solution, the final dNTP concentrations were 100 μM. Pre-steady state excision rates were measured from the increase in fluorescence intensity with time due to the release of d2APMP positioned at the 3′-terminus of the preformed DNA substrates. 2AP in DNA is quenched, but d2APMP in solution is highly fluorescent. Curves were fit either to single (monophasic) or double (biphasic) exponential equations. Between six and eight determinations were performed for each reaction and mean values were calculated. One objective of our studies was to investigate the effect of base pair stability and local DNA sequence on the T4 DNA polymerase 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity. 2AP was paired opposite the four template bases, T, A, C, or G, with either upstream A-T or G-C base pairs. We observed, as also reported by Bloom et al. (15Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar), that hydrolysis rates were dependent on the nature of the 3′-terminal base pair. The slowest rate was observed for the 2AP-T base pair, the most “correct” base pair (Fig. 1, panel A). A faster rate was observed for the 2AP-A base pair, an even faster rate for the 2AP-C base pair, and the fastest rate was observed for the 2AP-G base pair, the most “incorrect” base pair. The same order for removal of d2APMP from 2AP paired opposite the four template bases was observed in another sequence context (15Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar). The efficiency of excision correlates with the stability of the 2AP-X base pairs as predicted from Tm measurements, which increase in the order of 2AP-G < 2AP-C < 2AP-A < 2AP-T (21Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Mhaskar D. Sowers L.C. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5869-5884Google Scholar). The kinetic traces for the hydrolysis reactions with the 2AP-T and 2AP-A DNA substrates appeared to be biphasic. The best curve fits for the experimental traces were achieved by using a double exponential equation. The curve fit for the G + C-rich, 2AP-T DNA substrate is shown in Fig. 1, panel B. Monophasic kinetics was observed for reactions with the 2AP-C and 2AP-G DNA substrates. The curve fit for the G + C-rich, 2AP-C DNA substrate, described by a single exponential equation, is shown in Fig. 1, panel C. The 2AP-T and 2AP-C DNA substrates were selected for further study because of the respective biphasic and monophasic kinetics observed for the hydrolysis reactions for the two substrates, and because of the relevance of proofreading 2AP-T and 2AP-C primer termini to understanding how 2AP promotes base substitution mutagenesis. The pre-steady state excision rates for the G + C-rich 2AP-T and 2AP-C DNA substrates, calculated from the kinetic traces shown in Fig. 1, are given in Table II. The 2AP-T DNA was degraded more slowly than the 2AP-C DNA due to the major contribution of the slower phase, described by rate constant k2, to the overall reaction rate. The faster phase for degradation of the 2AP-T DNA, described by rate constant k1, was similar in magnitude to the hydrolysis rate measured for removal of d2APMP from the G + C-rich 2AP-C DNA substrate (compare 17 to 20 s−1).Table II.Pre-steady state excision rates by wild type T4 DNA polymerase on double-stranded and single-stranded DNA substratesNo. of mispairsDescription of 3′-mispairsaThe complete sequences of the DNA substrates are given in Table I.

The single mispair DNA has a terminal 2AP-C, and the two mispair DNA has the terminal 2AP-C mispair and an adjacent T-C mispair. Three terminal mispairs were produced by the addition of a G-G mispair adjacent to the T-C mispair in the G + C-rich DNA set and an A-G mispair in the A + T-rich DNA set.G + C-rich DNA substratesA + T-rich DNA substratesk1bThe rate constants for the two phases are given by k1 and k2, respectively.a1cThe amplitudes of the two phases of the biphasic time courses are given by a1 and a2, respectively.k2a2k1a1k2a2s−1s−1s−1s−102AP-T17.2 ± 2.8(0.2)3.9 ± 0.2(0.8)36.7 ± 4.8(0.4)11.1 ± 1.0(0.6)12AP-C19.9 ± 0.342.0 ± 2.12T-C 2AP-C87.8 ± 1.4156.5 ± 7.13A/G-G T-C 2AP-C157.2 ± 3.8202.2 ± 12.4nSingle-stranded DNA175.7 ± 5.7228.4 ± 1.3a The complete sequences of the DNA substrates are given in Table I.

The single mispair DNA has a terminal 2AP-C, and the two mispair DNA has the terminal 2AP-C mispair and an adjacent T-C mispair. Three terminal mispairs were produced by the addition of a G-G mispair adjacent to the T-C mispair in the G + C-rich DNA set and an A-G mispair in the A + T-rich DNA set.b The rate constants for the two phases are given by k1 and k2, respectively.c The amplitudes of the two phases of the biphasic time courses are given by a1 and a2, respectively. Open table in a new tab Excision rates were also determined for the 2AP-T and 2AP-C base pairs in an A + T-rich local environment. These DNA substrates have four consecutive A-T base pairs upstream of the reporter 2AP base pair (Table I). Biphasic kinetics was again observed for the 2AP-T DNA, but each phase was approximately 2-fold faster than observed for the G + C-rich DNAs (Table II). A single phase was observed for the A + T-rich 2AP-C DNA substrate, and excision was also 2-fold faster than detected for the G + C-rich 2AP-C DNA. As observed with the G + C-rich 2AP-T DNA substrates, the rate for removal of d2APMP from the 2AP-C DNA substrate (about 42 s−1) was similar to the faster hydrolysis rate, described by k1 (about 37 s−1), for hydrolysis of the A + T-rich AP-T DNA substrate. Thus, the rate for the faster of the two hydrolysis reactions observed for the 2AP-T DNA substrates resembles the single reaction rate detected for the 2AP-C DNA substrates. Biphasic kinetics has been observed previously for the proofreading reaction by T4 DNA polymerase. In a rapid quench assay, a burst of hydrolysis was observed for the excision of a terminal mismatched nucleotide (23Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Google Scholar). The slow and fast phases were interpreted to indicate partitioning of the DNA between two states: one that is initially inactive for hydrolytic cleavage and a second that is pre-activated for hydrolytic cleavage. These states may correspond to DNA bound initially in either the polymerase (inactive) or exonuclease (activated) active centers (15Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Google Scholar). Thus, the faster phase, k1, in reactions with the 2AP-T DNA, may describe removal of d2APMP from DNA bound in an activated or partially activated state for the hydrolysis reaction, whereas the slower phase, described by rate constant k2, may describe the hydrolysis rate for DNA first bound in the polymerase active center and then transferred to the exonuclease active center. In experiments described below, we provide evidence that the 2AP-T DNA is indeed partitioned between two states. Additional steps in strand separation were probed by measuring excision rates for DNAs with one and two additional preformed mispairs adjacent to the terminal 2AP-C mispair. Fluorescence of 2AP in DNA, although quenched, can be used to verify the extent of strand separation at the primer terminus since 2AP fluorescence is quenched more in double- than in single-stranded DNA. Fluorescence intensity was lowest for the 2AP-T primer-template and increased as the number of mispairs at the primer terminus increased (Fig. 2). Fluorescence intensity was highest for the single-stranded 2AP primer. Single-phase kinetics was observed for primer-templates with one or more adjacent mispairs. The time course for the primer-template, which has a terminal 2AP-C mispair and an adjacent T-C mispair, is shown in Fig. 3. Excision rates increased with the degree of preformed strand separation; substrates with three mispairs produced the highest rates and approached the rates measured for the single-stranded DNAs (Table II). A + T-richness of the upstream base pairs stimulated the removal of the terminal d2APMP from the mispaired DNAs as observed with the 2AP-T and 2AP-C DNAs. Because the excision rates for DNA substrates with two and three preformed mispairs were faster than the excision rates detected for removal of d2APMP from the 2AP-T and 2AP-C DNA substrates, we propose the existence of a pre-exonuclease complex that requires further processing to form the complex that is fully activated for the hydrolysis reaction. Association rates for forming the pre-exonuclease state and for binding DNA in the polymerase active center are assumed to be much more rapid than the reaction steps described by k1 and k2. The data obtained with the 2AP-T and preformed strand-separated DNA substrates are consistent with the reaction steps summarized in Scheme I below. The kinetic parameters shown are for the G + C-rich set of DNA substrates. View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Scheme IView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fully activated (enzymeexo·2AP-T DNA)* complex can be formed from two starting points in our reaction conditions. In one starting point, the 2AP-T DNA is bound initially in the polymerase active center (enzymepol·2AP-T DNA), and in the second pathway, the 2AP-T DNA is bound in a pre-exonuclease state (enzymepre-exo·2AP-T DNA). The pre-exonuclease state requires further processing for conversion to the activated state (enzymeexo·2AP-T DNA)*. DNA bound initially in the polymerase active center may be transferred in an intramolecular reaction to form the pre-exonuclease state which is then further processed to form the activated complex. Formation of the pre-exonuclease state and the activated complex are rate-limiting steps, and the rates of formation are dependent on the local sequence. Since excision rates for DNA substrates with three preformed mispairs were nearly equal to rates measured for the single-stranded DNA substrates, these DNAs did not require significantly further preparation for the excision reaction and were bound directly from solution to form the activated complex. We infer from these results that at least three nucleotides at the primer terminus must be separated from the template strand in order to form the activated complex since at least three preformed mispairs were required in order for the excision rates for duplex DNAs to match the excision rates detected for the hydrolysis of single-stranded DNAs. The rates reported here for removal of d2APMP from single-stranded DNA (175-230 s−1) are in the same range but faster than the hydrolysis rate reported for degradation of single-stranded by the rapid quench assay (100 s−1) (23Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Google Scholar). The hydrolysis rate for single-stranded DNA may be limited by the rate of association of the enzyme with the DNA substrate. A second objective of our studies was to investigate the strand separation step of the excision reaction by determining the biochemical basis of the exonuclease deficiency of the G255S-DNA polymerase.

Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase with protein kinase A resulted in the stimulation (190%) of activity. The mechanism of this stimulation included an increase in the Vmax of the reaction with respect to UTP and ATP, a decrease in the Km for ATP, and a decrease in the cooperative kinetic behavior of the enzyme. Phosphorylated CTP synthetase was less sensitive to product inhibition by CTP. Protein kinase C also phosphorylates and activates CTP synthetase.

CTP synthetase (EC 6.3.4.2, UTP: ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)) is a glutamine aminotransferase that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of the amide nitrogen from glutamine to the C-4 position of UTP to form CTP (1Lieberman I.

Freeman and Company, New York1995Google Scholar). Thus, the level of CTP synthetase activity would be expected to play a major role in cell growth and physiology. In fact, data indicate that the expression of CTP synthetase and the relative synthesis of CTP play a role in the regulation of the pathways by which phospholipids are synthesized in S. cerevisiae (9McDonough V.M.

Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Google Scholar, 13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrated that the activation of the RAS/cAMP pathway can mediate the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase in vivo. Moreover, pure CTP synthetase was a substrate for protein kinase A, and the phospohorylation of CTP synthetase resulted in the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity. The mechanism of stimulation involved an increase in the Vmax of the reaction and an increase of the enzyme affinity for ATP. All chemicals were reagent grade.

CTP synthetase was purified from strain OK8 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3 ura7Δ::TRP1 ura8) bearing the multicopy plasmid pFL44S-URA7 (4Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M.-T. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Google Scholar, 5Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Google Scholar). Plasmid pFL44S-URA7 directs a 10-fold overexpression of CTP synthetase (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). Cells were grown in complete synthetic medium (14Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Google Scholar) without uracil. Strain OK8 bearing the single copy plasmid pFL38-URA7 (4Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M.-T. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Google Scholar) was used to examine the effect of the RAS/cAMP pathway on the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase. Cells were grown in YEPA medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% acetate). Cell numbers were determined by microscopic examination with a hemacytometer or by absorbance at 660 nm. All cells were grown at 30°C to the exponential phase of growth. Exponential phase cells grown in YEPA medium were labeled in low phosphate (15Warner J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 423-428Google Scholar) YEPA medium with 32Pi (0.3 mCi/ml) and [U-14C]L-amino acids (5 μCi/ml) for 3 h. Glucose was added to a final concentration of 5% to activate the RAS/cAMP pathway (16Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209Google Scholar). At the indicated time intervals, labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were disrupted with glass beads in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM NaF, 5 mMβ-glycerophosphate, and 1 mM sodium vanadate) (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-470Google Scholar). CTP synthetase was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-CTP synthetase IgG antibodies (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar) as described previously (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-470Google Scholar). CTP synthetase was dissociated from the enzyme-antibody complex (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-470Google Scholar), and the amount of label incorporated into the enzyme was determined by scintillation counting. URA7-encoded CTP synthetase was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation of the cytosol followed by chromatography with Sephacryl 300 HR, Q-Sepharose, Affi-Gel Blue, and Superose 6 (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). The specific activity of the pure enzyme was 2.5 μmol/min/mg. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) was performed with 10% slab gels. Immunoblot analysis (19Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Google Scholar) was performed with anti-CTP synthetase IgG antibodies (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Phosphorylation reactions were measured for 10 min at 30°C in a total volume of 40 μl. CTP synthetase (0.8 μg) was incubated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/nmol), 10 mM MgCl2, and the indicated concentrations of protein kinase A. At the end of the phosphorylation reactions, samples were treated with 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblot analysis, and autoradiography. The incorporation of phosphate into CTP synthetase was determined by scintillation counting of phosphorylated enzyme excised from immunoblots. Alternatively, the protein kinase A phosphorylation reactions were performed with unlabeled ATP. Following incubation with protein kinase A, the reaction mixtures were diluted 5-fold, and CTP synthetase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described under “Enzyme Assays and Protein Determination.” CTP synthetase was phosphorylated with protein kinase C as described previously (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). CTP synthetase was phosphorylated with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel slices containing 32P-labeled CTP synthetase were treated with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and 0.1% SDS at 37°C for 30 h to elute the enzyme. Bovine serum albumin (50 μg) was added to the samples as the carrier protein, and trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 20%. After incubation for 30 min at 4°C, protein precipitates were collected by centrifugation. Proteins were washed 3 times with cold acetone and dried in vacuo. Samples were then subjected to acid hydrolysis with 6 N HCl at 100°C for 4 h. The hydrolysates were dried in vacuo and applied to 0.1-mm cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates with 2.5 μg of phosphoserine, 2.5 μg of phosphothreonine, and 5 μg of phosphotyrosine as carrier phosphoamino acids in water. Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (20Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the plates were dried, sprayed with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone to visualize carrier phosphoamino acids, and subjected to phosphoimaging analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices containing 32P-labeled CTP synthetase were subjected to proteolysis using TPCK-trypsin (0.15 mg/ml) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 16 h at 37°C (21Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7282-7288Google Scholar). The mixture was subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed and retained. Fresh TPCK-trypsin was added to the gel slices for an additional 11 h of proteolysis. The digest was subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was again removed and retained. The gel slices were then incubated in water for 1 h at 37°C. The mixture was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and added to the previously retained supernatants. The combined supernatants were dried in vacuo. Samples were resuspended in 1 ml of water and dried again. This process was repeated four times. The samples were resuspended in 10 μl of 1% ammonium carbonate, clarified by centrifugation, and spotted on cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates (22Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Google Scholar). Separation of phosphopeptides was accomplished by electrophoresis in 1% ammonium bicarbonate at 1000 V for 35 min, followed by ascending chromatography (n-butyl alcohol/glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water, 10:3:12:15) for 7 h (22Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Google Scholar). Dried plates were then subjected to phosphoimaging analysis. Alkaline phosphatase attached to beaded agarose was used to dephosphorylate CTP synthetase. A 0.4-ml column of alkaline phosphatase-agarose (1,000 μmol/min/ml of resin) was equilibrated with 5 ml of chromatography buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ZnCl2, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin. Ovalbumin was included in the chromatography buffer to block nonspecific protein binding sites on the column. The column was then washed with 5 ml of chromatography buffer without ovalbumin. CTP synthetase was applied to the column and incubated for 10 min. The column was then washed with chromatography buffer to elute CTP synthetase. CTP synthetase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of UTP to CTP (molar extinction coefficients of 182 and 1520 M−1 cm−1, respectively) by following the increase in absorbance at 291 nm on a recording spectrophotometer (2Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM UTP, 2 mM ATP, 2 mML-glutamine, 0.1 mM GTP, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and an appropriate dilution of enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Protein kinase A activity was measured by following the phosphorylation of casein with [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi/nmol) for 10 min at 30°C. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 50 μM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 60 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml casein. Reactions were terminated by loading samples onto phosphocellulose filter paper. The filters were washed with 75 mM phosphoric acid and subjected to scintillation counting. All enzyme assays were performed in triplicate with an average standard deviation of ±3%. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min unless otherwise indicated. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using the EZ-FIT enzyme kinetic model fitting program (24Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Google Scholar). EZ-FIT uses the Nelder-Mead simplex and Marquardt/Nash nonlinear regression algorithms sequentially and tests for the best fit of the data among different kinetic models. In S. cerevisiae, RAS proteins stimulate adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP formation (12Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Google Scholar, 13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar). In turn, cAMP activates protein kinase A activity by causing the dissociation of the regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunit of the enzyme (12Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Google Scholar, 13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar). To examine whether the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase was mediated by protein kinase A in vivo, the extent of enzyme phosphorylation was measured in cells that were activated in the RAS/cAMP pathway. The RAS/cAMP pathway is known to be activated by the addition of glucose to nonfermenting cells (13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar, 16Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209Google Scholar). Glucose triggers a rapid increase in cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity (13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar). OK8 cells bearing the single copy plasmid pFL38-URA7 were grown in YEPA medium to attenuate the RAS/cAMP pathway (16Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated for 3 h with 32Pi to detect phosphorylated CTP synthetase and [U-14C]L-amino acids to normalize for the amount of CTP synthetase isolated. The RAS/cAMP pathway was then activated by the addition of 5% glucose to the growth medium (16Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209Google Scholar). CTP synthetase was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the amount of each label incorporated into the enzyme was determined. The data shown in Fig. 1 are plotted as the ratio of the counts/minute of 32P incorporated into CTP synthetase to the counts/minute of 14C incorporated into CTP synthetase. If protein kinase A mediated phosphorylation of CTP synthetase in vivo, then the ratio of the labels found in CTP synthetase would be expected to change in response to the addition of glucose to the growth medium. Indeed, the addition of glucose to the growth medium resulted in a time-dependent increase in the ratio of 32P/14C (Fig. 1). The maximum increase (11-fold) in the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase occurred 5 min after the addition of glucose to the medium. The response of CTP synthetase phosphorylation to the activation of the RAS/cAMP pathway was similar to that previously shown for several enzymes known to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A in S. cerevisiae (13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar, 16Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209Google Scholar). We examined the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A in vitro using the bovine heart catalytic subunit. The bovine heart protein kinase A catalytic subunit is structurally and functionally identical to the S. cerevisiae protein kinase A catalytic subunit (25Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Google Scholar). The protein kinase A preparation used in our studies was judged to be essentially pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein kinase A preparation phosphorylated casein with the activity stated by the manufacturer under the assay conditions used here. To examine whether CTP synthetase was a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase A, we determined if protein kinase A catalyzed the incorporation of the γ-phosphate of 32P-labeled ATP into purified CTP synthetase. After the phosphorylation reaction, samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Autoradiography of the nitrocellulose paper showed that CTP synthetase was a substrate for protein kinase A. The position of 32P-labeled CTP synthetase on the nitrocellulose paper was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Protein kinase A activity was dependent on the concentration of protein kinase A (Fig. 2A) and the time of the reaction (Fig. 2B) using CTP synthetase as substrate. The dependence of protein kinase A activity on the concentration of CTP synthetase was examined. Protein kinase A activity did not follow typical saturation kinetics. Instead, the data followed a sigmoidal kinetic pattern (Fig. 3). The analysis of the data according to the Hill equation yielded a Hill number of 1.8. This cooperativity was consistent with the observation that native CTP synthetase exists as a dimer (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). The Km value for CTP synthetase was 11 μg/ml (73 nM for the dimeric enzyme). Based on its relative Km value, CTP synthetase was an excellent substrate for the protein kinase A reaction (26Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Google Scholar).Fig. 3Dependence of protein kinase A activity on CTP synthetase concentration. Panel A, protein kinase A (0.25 nmol/min/ml) and [γ-32P]ATP were incubated with the indicated concentrations of CTP synthetase for 10 min. Following the incubations, samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblot analysis, and autoradiography. A portion of an autoradiograph showing the position of CTP synthetase is shown. Lane 1, 14C-labeled protein molecular mass standards (from top to bottom) phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (69 kDa). Lanes 2-10, concentrations of CTP synthetase indicated in panel B. Panel B, the incorporation of phosphate into CTP synthetase was determined by scintillation counting of phosphorylated enzyme excised from the immunoblot. The curve drawn was the result of the analysis of the data according to the Hill equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A, the phosphorylation reaction was carried out to completion. At the point of maximum phosphorylation, protein kinase A catalyzed the incorporation of 0.57 mol of phosphate/mol of dimeric CTP synthetase. The purified CTP synthetase was already phosphorylated to some extent (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the stoichiometry of the reaction using dephosphorylated CTP synthetase. Accordingly, CTP synthetase was treated with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate the enzyme. Protein kinase A catalyzed the incorporation of 1.3 mol of phosphate/mol of the dephosphorylated dimeric CTP synthetase. These results suggested that there is one phosphorylation site per CTP synthetase subunit. Protein kinase A (27Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Google Scholar, 28Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Google Scholar, 29Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Google Scholar) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. To examine which amino acid residues of CTP synthetase were a target for phosphorylation, CTP synthetase was phosphorylated with protein kinase A, and the 32P-labeled enzyme was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. In these experiments, protein kinase A phosphorylated CTP synthetase on a serine residue (Fig. 4A). This result was consistent with the observation that CTP synthetase is primarily phosphorylated at a serine residue in vivo (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). A computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the URA7 gene indicated that Ser424 is a predicted protein kinase A phosphorylation site (30Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled CTP synthetase was also subjected to digestion with TPCK-trypsin, followed by thin-layer electrophoresis and chromatographic analysis. The protease digestion yielded one major phosphopeptide and some additional minor phosphopeptides (Fig. 4B). We questioned whether the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A altered CTP synthetase activity. To do this, CTP synthetase was phosphorylated by protein kinase A, and CTP synthetase activity was subsequently measured. In these experiments, CTP synthetase activity was measured with subsaturating concentrations of ATP and UTP (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). In this manner, we could simultaneously monitor for stimulatory or inhibitory effects of phosphorylation on CTP synthetase activity. Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of CTP synthetase activity (Fig. 5). Maximum stimulation (190%) of CTP synthetase activity was obtained when the enzyme was phosphorylated with 1 nmol/min/ml protein kinase A (Fig. 5). The extent of protein kinase A stimulation of CTP synthetase activity may underestimate the effect of phosphorylation since the purified enzyme is already partially phosphorylated (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses were performed to further characterize the effects of protein kinase A phosphorylation of CTP synthetase on its activity in vitro. As indicated above, the CTP synthetase that we purified was already partially phosphorylated (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). Consequently, our kinetic studies on the native enzyme reflected the property of this phosphorylated state of the enzyme. We were unable to perform kinetic studies on the dephosphorylated form of CTP synthetase since alkaline phosphatase treatment of the purified enzyme resulted in the loss of its activity (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). CTP synthetase displays positive cooperative kinetics with respect to UTP and ATP (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). The cooperative kinetic behavior of the enzyme toward one substrate increases when the other substrate is present in the enzyme assay at a subsaturating concentration (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). We examined whether phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A altered these kinetic properties. The kinetic experiments were performed with saturating concentrations of glutamine, GTP, and magnesium ions. The effect of phosphorylation on the dependence of CTP synthetase activity on UTP was examined using subsaturating and saturating concentrations of ATP (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase resulted in an increase in the apparent Vmax of the reaction with respect to UTP when the activity was measured with subsaturating or saturating concentrations of ATP (Table I). The effect of phosphorylation on the apparent Vmax was more evident when the activity was measured with the subsaturating ATP concentration (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase did not affect the apparent Km values or the Hill numbers for UTP when the activity was measured with subsaturating or saturating concentrations of ATP (Fig. 6 and Table I).Table I.Kinetic constants for the native and protein kinase A-phosphorylated CTP synthetaseSubstrate, activator, or inhibitorNative CTP synthetasePhosphorylated CTP synthetaseVmax(app)Km(app)HillKa(app)IC50Vmax(app)Km(app)HillKa(app)IC50unit/mgmMnμMmMunit/mgmMnμMmMUTPaKinetic constants determined with 0.5 mM ATP.0.760.081.51.190.081.7UTPbKinetic constants determined with 2 mM ATP.2.300.051.02.890.041.0UTPcKinetic constants determined with 1 mM ATP in the presence of 0.3 mM CTP.1.080.162.21.480.121.6ATPdKinetic constants determined with 0.1 mM UTP.2.111.442.72.610.981.8ATPeKinetic constants determined with 2 mM UTP.2.500.851.93.020.601.0GlutaminefKinetic constants determined with 0 mM GTP.1.100.500.81.160.501.0GlutaminegKinetic constants determined with 0.1 mM GTP.2.500.340.93.010.281.0GTP15.312.0CTPhKinetic constant determined with 0.5 mM ATP.0.120.21CTPiKinetic constant determined with 1 mM ATP.0.220.31a Kinetic constants determined with 0.5 mM ATP.b Kinetic constants determined with 2 mM ATP.c Kinetic constants determined with 1 mM ATP in the presence of 0.3 mM CTP.d Kinetic constants determined with 0.1 mM UTP.e Kinetic constants determined with 2 mM UTP.f Kinetic constants determined with 0 mM GTP.g Kinetic constants determined with 0.1 mM GTP.h Kinetic constant determined with 0.5 mM ATP.i Kinetic constant determined with 1 mM ATP. Open table in a new tab The effect of phosphorylation on the dependence of CTP synthetase activity on ATP using subsaturating and saturating concentrations of UTP was then examined. Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase resulted in a decrease in the apparent Km values for ATP and a modest increase in the apparent Vmax values for the reaction (Fig. 7 and Table I). In addition, the phosphorylation of the enzyme resulted in a decrease of the positive cooperative kinetic behavior of the enzyme toward ATP when compared with the native enzyme (Fig. 7 and Table I). The effects of phosphorylation on the kinetic properties of the enzyme were more evident when CTP synthetase activity was measured with the subsaturating UTP concentration (Fig. 7). GTP stimulates native CTP synthetase activity by increasing the Vmax of the reaction and decreasing the Km value for glutamine (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). The enzyme also exhibits negative cooperative kinetics toward glutamine as reflected in Hill numbers of less than 1 (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). We examined if phosphorylation by protein kinase A influenced these kinetic properties. Kinetic experiments were performed with saturating concentrations of UTP, ATP, and magnesium ions. Phosphorylation of the enzyme did not have a significant effect on the apparent Vmax and Km values of the enzyme with respect to glutamine when measured in the absence or presence of GTP (Table I). However, the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase abolished the negative cooperative behavior of the enzyme with respect to glutamine (Table I). The effect of phosphorylation on the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity by GTP was examined using saturating concentrations of all substrates. Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase resulted in a small decrease in the apparent activation constant (Ka) for GTP (Table I). An important biochemical property of the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is the inhibition of its activity by CTP (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). The inhibition of CTP synthetase activity by CTP regulates the cellular concentration of CTP in growing cells (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar, 9McDonough V.M. Buxeda R.J. Bruno M.E.C. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18774-18780Google Scholar). We questioned whether phosphorylation affected this property. The phosphorylated and native forms of CTP synthetase were inhibited by CTP in a dose-dependent manner when activity was measured with 0.5 mM ATP (Fig. 8A) and 1 mM ATP (Fig. 8B). However, the protein kinase A phosphorylated enzyme was less sensitive to CTP inhibition when compared with the native enzyme (Fig. 8 and Table I). The decrease in the sensitivity of the enzyme to CTP inhibition was more evident when CTP synthetase activity was measured with the subsaturating ATP concentration of 0.5 mM (Fig. 8A). CTP inhibits CTP synthetase activity by increasing the positive cooperativity of the enzyme toward UTP and increasing the apparent Km value for UTP (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar). We questioned what effect phosphorylation of CTP synthetase had on this kinetic property. In these experiments, the concentration of ATP was held constant at 1 mM, and the other substrates in the reaction were saturating. The apparent Vmax value of the phosphorylated enzyme measured in the presence of CTP was greater than that of the native enzyme measured in the presence of CTP (Fig. 9 and Table I). Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase with protein kinase A did not have a significant effect on the cooperative kinetic behavior of the enzyme toward UTP or the apparent Km value for UTP (Fig. 9 and Table I). CTP synthetase is also phosphorylated and activated by protein kinase C (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar, 11Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar). In contrast to protein kinase A, data indicate that protein kinase C phosphorylates CTP synthetase on multiple sites (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). A comparison of the phosphopeptide maps of CTP synthetase phosphorylated with protein kinase A (Fig. 4B) and protein kinase C (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar) indicated that the target sites for these kinases differed. With this in mind, we examined CTP synthetase activity after the enzyme had been used as a substrate by both protein kinases A and C. In these experiments, CTP synthetase was incubated with protein kinases A and C together under the phosphorylation conditions that maximally stimulated CTP synthetase activity. Following incubation, CTP synthetase activity was measured using subsaturating concentrations of ATP and UTP. As described above for the phosphorylation by protein kinase A and previously for the phosphorylation by protein kinase C (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar, 11Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase resulted in a 190 and 280% stimulation of activity, respectively (Fig. 10A). When CTP synthetase was phosphorylated with protein kinases A and C together, CTP synthetase activity was stimulated 360% (Fig. 10A). Similar results were obtained when CTP synthetase was first incubated with one of the protein kinases followed by the incubation of the enzyme with the other protein kinase. The combined effect of protein kinases A and C on CTP synthetase activity was only slightly greater than that caused by either one of the protein kinases alone. This result may be expected if the mechanism by which each kinase stimulated CTP synthetase was the same. Indeed, protein kinases A and C (11Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar) stimulated CTP synthetase activity by similar mechanisms. We also examined the effects of protein kinases A and C on CTP synthetase that was dephosphorylated by treated with alkaline phosphatase. As described previously (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar), the dephosphorylation of CTP synthetase resulted in an 80% decrease in CTP synthetase activity (Fig. 10B). Although the alkaline phosphatase-treated CTP synthetase could be rephosphorylated with protein kinases A and C (10Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar), only 25 and 40% of the native enzyme activity, respectively, was recovered after rephosphorylation (Fig. 10B). In addition, phosphorylation of the enzyme by protein kinases A and C together did not restore the native CTP synthetase activity (Fig. 10B). The same result was observed when the dephosphorylated enzyme was incubated sequentially with the protein kinases. Full activation of CTP synthetase activity by protein kinases A and C may require additional protein kinase phosphorylations (29Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Google Scholar, 31Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Google Scholar). In this light, there are potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (32Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409Google Scholar) within the amino acid sequence of CTP synthetase. The level of CTP synthetase activity plays an important role in the growth and metabolism of S. cerevisiae (5Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen.

Enzyme Regul. 1979; 17: 1-21Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase was phosphorylated and stimulated by protein kinase A. The results of labeling experiments using cells that were activated in the RAS/cAMP pathway indicated that protein kinase A mediated the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase in vivo. The mechanism of the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity involved an increase in the Vmax of the reaction with respect to UTP and ATP and an increase in the affinity for ATP by the enzyme. Phosphorylation of the CTP synthetase also reduced the positive cooperative kinetics of the enzyme with respect to ATP and its negative cooperative kinetics with respect to glutamine. In addition, phosphorylation caused the synthetase to be less sensitive to inhibition by CTP. The effects of phosphorylation on the kinetic properties of the enzyme were most dramatic when the ATP concentration was subsaturating. It has been suggested that the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity by phosphorylation may be a mechanism by which the cell regulates CTP synthesis when the cellular levels of ATP are limiting (11Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, protein kinase A is the enzyme through which the RAS/cAMP pathway mediates its signal for cell growth (12Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Google Scholar, 13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar). Stimulation of RAS activity and the subsequent elevation of protein kinase A activity are associated with rapid cell growth and enhanced metabolic activity of the cell (12Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Google Scholar, 13Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar). The regulation of CTP synthetase activity by protein kinase A may represent a mechanism by which this signal transduction pathway mediates CTP synthesis and cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W1996716229,"The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes an 1863-amino acid protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. The biochemical function of BRCA1 is unknown, and there are conflicting results describing its subcellular location. We have identified a 220-kDa protein, which is reactive with three antibodies raised against the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of BRCA1. Immunoflourescence staining with an antibody to the carboxyl terminus of BRCA1 localized the protein to the nucleus of breast, ovarian, and cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines. A similar result was observed by biochemical subcellular fractionation that indicated that the 220-kDa protein was localized primarily to the nucleus of cell lines established from breast carcinomas. In addition to the 220-kDa protein, one antibody, C-20, also recognized a 180-kDa protein in MDA-MB-468 total cell lysates that was not detected by the other two antibodies. Several observations suggest the 180-kDa protein is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor: (i) C-20 reacted avidly with a 180-kDa protein immunoprecipitated by an antibody to the EGF receptor; (ii) an EGF receptor antibody detected a 180-kDa protein immunoprecipitated by C-20; (iii) the affinity purified EGF receptor was both immunoprecipitated and detected on immunoblots by the C-20 antibody but not another BRCA1 antibody; (iv) similar phosphopeptide maps were generated from the EGF receptor and the 180-kDa protein immunoprecipitated by C-20, and this peptide map was distinct from the 220-kDa phosphoprotein; and (v) the C-20 immunizing peptide bears sequence identity to the EGF receptor. These results indicate that BRCA1 is a 220-kDa nuclear protein and that the 180-kDa protein reported previously may be unrelated to BRCA1."

The authentic Compound I spectra are indicative of an 2A1u-like ground state for both the native and the mesoheme-reconstituted proteins. Finally, the possible biological implications of such information are briefly discussed. The catalytic cycles of a large number of oxidative heme enzymes involve intermediates which contain high-valent (ferryl) hemes (1Dunford H.B. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1982; 4: 41-68Google Scholar, 2Frew J.E. Jones P. Advances in Inorganic and Bioinorganic Mechanism. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1984: 175-212Google Scholar). Hydroperoxidases, whose essential function is to eliminate or utilize hydrogen peroxide, react with this oxidant to generate a primary intermediate (so-called Compound I) which is two oxidizing equivalents higher than the resting state (ferric) enzyme. In many cases, such as mammalian catalases and plant peroxidases, both oxidizing equivalents reside on the heme moiety, which is then properly formulated as a ferryl porphyrin π-cation radical; i.e. OFe(IV)(P+·). The primary intermediate of peroxidases undergoes a one-electron reduction by substrate to generate the so-called Compound II, a ferryl porphyrin; i.e. OFe(IV)P. While it is generally accepted that the primary intermediate in the cases of typical plant peroxidases (e.g. horseradish peroxidase) and mammalian catalases are indeed ferryl π-cation radicals, there is continuing uncertainty regarding the electronic and molecular structure of such species. Thus, the two highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of metalloporphyrins, designated a1u and a2u, are nearly degenerate, their relative energies being dictated by many factors, including: the nature and position of porphyrin peripheral substituents, the identity and disposition of the axial ligands to the iron, as well as more subtle factors such as environment and temperature (3Hanson L.K. Chang C.K. Davis M.S. Fajer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 663-670Google Scholar, 4Fujita I. Hanson L.K. Walker F.A. Fajer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3296-3300Google Scholar, 5Du P. Loew G.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 69-80Google Scholar). Given this susceptibility to structural and environmental control of relative HOMO energies, it becomes difficult to predict the exact formulation (as either 2A1u or 2A2u) of the primary intermediate for a given enzyme, and many spectroscopic methods have been applied to various enzymatic species in attempts to reveal this information. Perhaps the most thoroughly studied example is that of the readily available horseradish peroxidase (HRP). 1The abbreviations used are: HRPhorseradish peroxidaseENDORelectron nuclear double resonance. While optical absorption spectroscopy provides support for the existence of a ferryl porphyrin π-cation radical in the case of the Compound I intermediate (HRP-I) (6Dolphin D. Felton R.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 26-32Google Scholar), this technique does not permit a clear distinction between the 2A1u and 2A2u formulations (7Morishima I. Shiro Y. Nakajima K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3576-3584Google Scholar, 8Rutter R. Valentine M. Hendrich M.P. Hager L.P. Debrunner P.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4769-4774Google Scholar, 9Oertling W.A. Salehi A. Chang C.K.

The results of various magnetic resonance measurements are also conflicting. Thus, elegant ENDOR studies by Hoffman and co-workers (13Roberts J.E. Hoffman B.M. Rutter R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2118-2121Google Scholar), as well as magnetic circular dichroism studies by Stillman and co-workers (14Browett W.R. Gasyna Z. Stillman M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 110: 3633-3640Google Scholar), led to the conclusion that HRP-I is best formulated as an 2A2u cation radical. Early NMR studies (15La Mar G.N. de Ropp J.S. Smith K.M. Langry K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 237-243Google Scholar) of HRP-I were also interpreted in terms of an 2A2u formulation, but more recent studies by this method favor an 2A1u formulation (16Morishima I. Takamuki Y. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7666-7672Google Scholar, 17La Mar G.N. Thanabal V. Johnson R.D. Smith K.M. Parish D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5428-5434Google Scholar). horseradish peroxidase electron nuclear double resonance. The issue of the precise electronic structure of these primary, ferryl π-cation, intermediates (i.e. 2A1u versus 2A2u formulation) obviously may carry important biological implications. Thus, the observed differences in the optical spectra of the Compound I derivatives of catalases and peroxidases was initially suggested to be ascribable to a difference in the ground state formulations (i.e. 2A1u for catalase and 1A2u for HRP-I) and, by implication, for the difference in their reactivities (1Dunford H.B. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1982; 4: 41-68Google Scholar, 2Frew J.E. Jones P. Advances in Inorganic and Bioinorganic Mechanism. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1984: 175-212Google Scholar, 3Hanson L.K.

Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 69-80Google Scholar). Also, it has been pointed out that, in the case of HRP, an 2A2u ferryl π-cation intermediate would place the orbital hole in closer proximity to the substrate binding site than would an 2A1u ferryl π-cation (17La Mar G.N. Thanabal V. Johnson R.D. Smith K.M. Parish D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5428-5434Google Scholar). Clearly, it is possible that variations in the reactivities of this ubiquitous intermediate, among different classes of oxidative heme enzymes, may arise as a consequence of specific active site architectures which stabilize one or the other of the two formulations. Thus, it is important to document the electronic ground state configuration for each system. In principle, resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy is well-suited to investigate this issue. Not only is it potentially able to provide direct documentation for the ferryl fragment, via observation of the ν(Fe=O) stretching mode as in the case of the Compound II analogues (18Sitter A.J. Reczek C.M. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7515-7522Google Scholar, 19Hashimoto S. Tatsuno Y. Kitagawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2417Google Scholar), but the precise position of certain high frequency macrocycle stretching modes may be effective in characterizing the nature of the electronic structure of the cation radical as either 2A1u or 2A2u (9Oertling W.A. Salehi A. Chang C.K. Babcock G.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 1311-1319Google Scholar, 10Czernuszewicz R.S. Macor K.A. Li X.-Y. Kincaid J.R. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

Rev. 1994; 135/136: 685Google Scholar). Thus, in systematic RR studies of well-behaved model compounds (10Czernuszewicz R.S. Macor K.A. Li X.-Y. Kincaid J.R. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3860-3869Google Scholar, 11Sandusky P.O. Salehi A. Chang C.K. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 6437-6439Google Scholar), it was shown that for 2A1u-like metalloporphyrin π cation radicals (MP+·) certain key modes (so-called “marker modes”) shift to higher frequencies, while these same modes shift to lower frequency for 2A2u-like radicals. Given this potentially informative probe, many attempts have been made to acquire the RR spectrum of HRP-I. Collectively, these studies have generated much controversy and confusion, the essential problem being the well-documented (14Browett W.R. Gasyna Z. Stillman M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 110: 3633-3640Google Scholar, 21Stillman J.S. Stillman M.J. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 32-35Google Scholar, 22Stillman J.S. Stillman M.J. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3183-3188Google Scholar) photolability of HRP-I; i.e. the RR (laser) excitation source can, itself, efficiently generate photoproducts (23Van Wart H.E. Zimmer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3379-3381Google Scholar). Thus, the first reported RR spectrum of HRP-I (24Teraoka J. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7354-7356Google Scholar) was later (23Van Wart H.E. Zimmer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3379-3381Google Scholar) shown to be ascribable to a photogenerated mixture of other species. Later studies, using conventional flow methods (25Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2177-2179Google Scholar) or short laser pulses (26Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6406-6407Google Scholar, 27Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3331-3338Google Scholar), yielded spectra which were insignificantly different from that of HRP-II and were interpreted as being either that of HRP-I (25Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2177-2179Google Scholar) or that of an HRP-II-like photoproduct (27Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3331-3338Google Scholar). We (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar) and others (29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar) attempted to overcome this photolability problem by using a novel microdroplet sampling device, first employed in our laboratory (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar, 30Simpson S.F. Kincaid J.R. Holler F.J. Anal. Chem. 1983; 55: 1420-1422Google Scholar, 31Simpson S.F. Kincaid J.R. Holler F.J. Anal. Chem. 1986; 58: 3163-3166Google Scholar), which effectively reduces sample residence time in the beam (to less than 5 μs). The results of these latter two studies were in essential agreement, giving a new spectrum at low laser powers which, at higher powers, reverted to the spectrum of a (presumably photoreduced) product which resembled that of authentic HRP-II. Furthermore, the position of the key marker modes observed in these studies were indicative of an 2A2u formulation for HRP-I. Independently, and apparently simultaneously, Palaniappan and Terner (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar) employed a different strategy to acquire the RR spectrum of HRP-I, which involved using ∼350 nm excitation; the reasoning being that HRP-I (λmax = 402 nm) would be selectively enhanced relative to an HRP-II-like photoproduct (λmax = 419 nm). In this way, these workers were able to acquire a unique spectrum (i.e. different from that of HRP-II), although no power studies were reported to demonstrate that the reported spectrum reverted to an HRP-II-like spectrum at high excitation powers. Most importantly, the RR spectrum reported by Palaniappan and Terner (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar) exhibited marker mode frequencies which are most consistent with an 2A1u formulation for HRP-I; i.e. a conclusion in direct conflict with the previously reported RR spectra (23Van Wart H.E. Zimmer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3379-3381Google Scholar, 24Teraoka J. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7354-7356Google Scholar, 25Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem.

Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2118-2121Google Scholar), but consistent with the newer NMR reports (16Morishima I. Takamuki Y. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7666-7672Google Scholar, 17La Mar G.N. Thanabal V. Johnson R.D. Smith K.M. Parish D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5428-5434Google Scholar). While ambiguity persists regarding the electronic configuration of HRP-I, it is generally agreed that 2H NMR evidence (17La Mar G.N. Thanabal V. Johnson R.D. Smith K.M. Parish D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5428-5434Google Scholar) conclusively demonstrates that the corresponding derivative of mesoheme-reconstituted HRP (i.e. mesoheme-HRP-I) is properly formulated as an 2A1u-like radical. Thus, in an attempt to clarify these issues, the present work is undertaken to acquire the RR spectrum of mesoheme-HRP-I. In the process, the RR spectra of resting state mesoheme-HRP and mesoheme-HRP-II as well as their deuterium-labeled analogues have also been acquired. Spectra were acquired with the microdroplet sampling approach (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar, 29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar, 30Simpson S.F. Kincaid J.R. Holler F.J. Anal. Chem. 1983; 55: 1420-1422Google Scholar, 31Simpson S.F. Kincaid J.R. Holler F.J. Anal. Chem. 1986; 58: 3163-3166Google Scholar), using both 406.7 and 356.4 nm excitation. In addition, the RR spectrum of native HRP-I has been acquired using the same procedures (i.e. the microdroplet device and both 406.7 and 356.4 nm excitation). The entire series of experiments are thoroughly discussed with reference to previous work, and the results for mesoheme-HRP-I are interpreted as being supportive of an 2A1u formulation, as expected (16Morishima I. Takamuki Y. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7666-7672Google Scholar, 17La Mar G.N. Thanabal V. Johnson R.D. Smith K.M. Parish D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5428-5434Google Scholar). While considerable spectral congestion in the high frequency region prevents an unambiguous assignment of certain key marker modes, the general appearance of the spectrum for native HRP-I is quite similar to that originally reported by Palaniappan and Terner (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase (Type II, Sigma) was purified by the method of Shannon et al. (33Shannon L.M. Kay E. Lew J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2166-2172Google Scholar). The fractions containing pure isoenzymes B and C, eluted from the CM52 (Whatman) column, were collected and pooled. The pooled HRP-B and -C fractions were further purified (33Shannon L.M. Kay E. Lew J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2166-2172Google Scholar) on a DE52 column and transferred to the desired buffer using a Bio-Gel DG P-6 (Bio-Rad) column. Only the fractions with RZ (i.e. A403/A280) greater than 3.5 were used. The apo-HRP was prepared by the 2-butanone method (34Teale F.W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 543Google Scholar) with slight modifications according to Yonetani and Asakura (35Yonetani T. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4715-4721Google Scholar). The reconstitution procedure with mesoheme (iron(III)-mesoporphyrin(IX) chloride) (Midcentury, Posen, IL) was adopted from that of Yonetani and Asakura (35Yonetani T. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4715-4721Google Scholar). The meso-HRP solution, having an RZ (i.e. A394/A280) ≥ 3.5, was used for spectroscopic measurement immediately after preparation. The Compound I species are prepared by using compressed nitrogen to force the enzyme and buffered hydrogen peroxide solutions (Aldrich) (enzyme:H2O2 = 1:2.75), held in separate reservoirs, into a mixing chamber and subsequently through the microdroplet generator (30Simpson S.F. Kincaid J.R. Holler F.J. Anal. Chem. 1983; 55: 1420-1422Google Scholar, 31Simpson S.F. Kincaid J.R. Holler F.J. Anal. Chem. 1986; 58: 3163-3166Google Scholar). A low temperature stirred cell (36zarnecki, K., (1995) Ph.D. dissertation, Marquette University 1995 C.Google Scholar) was employed for the measurement of Compound II species, while a conventional spinning cell was used for the resting state samples. Methyl group deuteration to give [2H12]mesohemin was carried out by the procedure described by Goff and co-workers (37Godziela G.M. Cramer S.K. Goff H.M. Inorg. Chem. 1986; 25: 4286-4288Google Scholar). A sample of H218O2 was prepared by a previously described procedure (38Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7189-7194Google Scholar, 39Asada K. Badger M.R. Plant Cell Physiol. 1984; 25: 1169-1179Google Scholar). The RR spectra were acquired with a Spex 1269 spectrometer equipped with a Princeton Instruments ICCD-576 UV-enhanced detector, and the 406.7 nm and 356.4 nm excitation lines were from a Coherent Innova model 100-K3 Kr+ ion laser. The absorption spectra of Compound I and Compound II, shown in Fig. 1 for mesoheme-HRP, were monitored both before and after the RR spectra were acquired to ensure sample purity (in the case of native HRP via reference to reported spectra (35Yonetani T. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4715-4721Google Scholar)). The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A spectrophotometer. The RR spectra of resting state mesoheme-HRP and its 2H12-deuterated analogue, acquired with both 406.7 and 356.4 nm excitation, are given in Fig. 2. The high frequency spectra of the Compound II derivative and its deuterated analogue, acquired with 406.7 nm excitation, are given in Fig. 3. The low frequency spectra of mesoheme-HRP-II and its derivative prepared with H218O2 hydrogen peroxide are given in Fig. 4. The assignment of the feature located at 785 cm−1 in the spectrum of mesoheme-HRP-II to the ν(Fe=O) stretching mode is confirmed by its shift to 754 cm−1 upon using H218O2 in place of H216O2 (the difference spectrum is given in trace C of Fig. 4). Assignment of the higher frequency marker modes are made with reference to well-documented previous assignments for metalloporphyrins (40Li X-L. Czernuszewicz R.S. Kincaid J.R. Oliver Su Y.

Open table in a new tab The frequencies observed for the mesoheme-HRP-II derivative, relative to the resting state species, are entirely consistent with expectations and the behavior observed for other ferryl heme-containing enzymes (20Kitagawa T. Mizutani Y. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1994; 135/136: 685Google Scholar). Thus, ν2, ν3, ν4, ν10, and ν11 shift to higher frequencies by 9-20 cm−1, compared to their positions for the ferric derivative. Compound I—In Fig. 5 are shown the RR spectra of mesoheme-HRP-I at pH 7.5, acquired with 406.7 nm excitation, using both low and high excitation powers. The high-power spectrum (trace B) is virtually identical with the corresponding spectrum of mesoheme-HRP-II acquired with 406.7 nm excitation (trace C) and is indicative of an efficient photoreduction process as has been previously observed (26Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6406-6407Google Scholar, 27Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3331-3338Google Scholar, 28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar) in the case of HRP-I (see below). At this wavelength, even the low power excitation (trace A) apparently produces substantial amounts of reduced photoproduct, as is evidenced by the similarity of all the spectra shown in Fig. 5. In contrast, as is shown in Fig. 6, the spectra acquired with 356.4 nm excitation clearly demonstrate a dependence on the power of the excitation beam. Thus, the spectrum acquired with 1 milliwatt of power (trace A) is distinctly different from the corresponding spectrum of mesoheme-HRP-II shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, as the power of the excitation beam is increased to 5 and 25 milliwatts (Fig. 6, traces B and C), new features (e.g. 1379 cm−1) begin to appear whose intensities increase with increased excitation power. This behavior is most reasonably interpreted as follows. The authentic mesoheme-HRP-I spectrum is obtained with low power (1 milliwatt) excitation at 356.4 nm, but is contaminated at higher powers by contributions (e.g. 1379 cm−1) from a photogenerated reduction product whose spectrum resembles that of mesoheme-HRP-II. Finally, as is shown in Fig. 7, the difference spectrum generated by the subtraction of the spectra acquired at 1 milliwatt with H216O2 and H218O2 reveals the ν(Fe=O) stretching mode at 793 cm−1 (H216O2). The observed isotopic shift (34 cm−1) is in close agreement with the theoretical value (33 cm−1) and that observed for other ferryl hemes (20Kitagawa T. Mizutani Y. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1994; 135/136: 685Google Scholar). The existing controversy regarding the authentic RR spectrum of the Compound I derivative of native HRP (23Van Wart H.E. Zimmer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3379-3381Google Scholar, 24Teraoka J. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7354-7356Google Scholar, 25Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar), taken together with the present results for mesoheme-HRP-I, prompted us to reinvestigate this issue. Shown in Fig. 8 are the RR spectra of HRP-I, acquired with 356.4 nm excitation at various power levels. As was the case for mesoheme-HRP-I, the spectrum acquired with 1 milliwatt of power (trace A) becomes contaminated by additional features (i.e. 1379 and 1509 cm−1 bands) as the power is increased to 10 and 25 milliwatts (traces B and C). It is noted that the frequencies observed in trace A (i.e. apparently the authentic spectrum of HRP-I) are in close agreement with those originally reported by Palaniappan and Terner (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar). In the present work, this spectrum is shown to become contaminated at higher excitation powers, producing a set of features whose frequencies are similar to those of HRP-II; a fact which is consistent with production of an “HRP-II-like” photoproduct, as expected (21Stillman J.S. Stillman M.J. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 32-35Google Scholar, 22Stillman J.S. Stillman M.J. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3183-3188Google Scholar, 23Van Wart H.E.

Shown in Fig. 9 are the low frequency spectra of HRP-I acquired with sufficiently low power to prevent appearance of the 1379 cm−1“photoproduct” marker. Trace B was acquired for a sample prepared with H218O2, and trace C shows the difference spectrum which reveals a positive component at ∼790 cm−1 (H216O2) and a negative component at 755 cm−1. These frequencies agree very well with those observed for mesoheme-reconstituted HRP-I. In the present work, an advantageous sampling technique (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar, 29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar, 30Simpson S.F. Kincaid J.R. Holler F.J. Anal.

Chem. 1986; 58: 3163-3166Google Scholar), which permits very short sample residence times in the laser beam, was employed with two different excitation lines (i.e. near 400 and 350 nm). In contrast to earlier reports by us (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar) and others (29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar), a unique spectrum for HRP-I could not be obtained using 406.7 nm excitation. Instead, the spectrum observed at this excitation wavelength resembled that of authentic HRP-II and is most reasonably attributed to the spectrum of a photogenerated (reduced) product (24Teraoka J. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7354-7356Google Scholar, 25Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2177-2179Google Scholar, 26Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar) which contains a (nonradical) ferryl heme, i.e. the equivalent to that of the heme moiety of HRP-II. On the other hand, as is shown in Fig. 8, the spectrum of HRP-I acquired with 356.4 nm excitation is distinctly different from that of authentic HRP-II acquired with the same excitation line (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar). In fact, the spectrum given in trace A of Fig. 8 is quite similar to that originally reported by Palaniappan and Terner (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar) using ∼350 nm excitation. The essential deficiency of the original report (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar), which in fact made it susceptible to later criticism (20Kitagawa T. Mizutani Y. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1994; 135/136: 685Google Scholar, 29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar), was that the expected power dependence of the HRP-I spectrum was not demonstrated, i.e. the unique HRP-I spectrum was not shown to revert to that of an HRP-II-like photoproduct upon increasing the power of the excitation beam. The present work clearly demonstrates this expected power dependence. Thus, as is shown in Fig. 8, the spectrum acquired with 1 milliwatt exhibits characteristic features at 1358 (ν4) and 1503 (ν3). Upon increasing the power of the excitation beam to 10 milliwatts, new features begin to appear at 1379 (ν4) and ∼1510 (ν3). Furthermore, the relative intensities of these new features increase further upon increasing the laser power to 25 milliwatts. The positions of these new features are virtually identical to those observed for authentic HRP-II (18Sitter A.J. Reczek C.M. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7515-7522Google Scholar, 19Hashimoto S. Tatsuno Y. Kitagawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2417Google Scholar, 20Kitagawa T. Mizutani Y. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1994; 135/136: 685Google Scholar) and for HRP-I acquired with 406.7 nm excitation (24Teraoka J. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7354-7356Google Scholar, 25Ogura T. Kitagawa T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar); i.e. the photoproduct of HRP-I. Given the authenticity of the HRP-I spectrum acquired with 356.4 nm excitation reported here and (originally) by Palaniappan and Terner (32Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Google Scholar), it seems appropriate to address the contrary results previously reported by us (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar) and others (29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar). While several of the earlier studies (24Teraoka J. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7354-7356Google Scholar, 25Ogura T. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2177-2179Google Scholar, 26Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6406-6407Google Scholar, 27Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3331-3338Google Scholar) obtained spectra similar to HRP-II spectra, which are correctly attributable to an HRP-I photoproduct (27Oertling W.A. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3331-3338Google Scholar), two studies (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar, 29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar) using 406.7 nm excitation reported unique spectra for HRP-I. In both cases, as was pointed out in the most recent report (29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar), this “unique” HRP-I RR spectrum resembled that of resting state (i.e. ferric) HRP, and convincing arguments were made there to suggest that this similarity is not altogether unexpected. However, in view of the results obtained using 356.4 nm excitation, in retrospect, it now seems likely that the similar spectra (obtained with 406.7 nm excitation) reported by the two independent laboratories (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar, 29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar) were actually contaminated by the spectrum of the resting state (HRP) enzyme. Thus, given the weak enhancement of the actual HRP-I sample, relative to that of a resting state (HRP) contaminant, at low power (i.e. in the absence of an HRP-II-like photoproduct), the observed spectrum would likely be dominated by (even small amounts) of resting state HRP. Upon increasing the laser power, the HRP-I component is effectively photoreduced to produce an HRP-II-like photoproduct. As the power of the excitation beam is increased, the relative concentration of the photoproduct increases and then begins to dominate the spectrum. Thus, the most reasonable explanation for the documented (28Paeng K.-J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7913-7915Google Scholar, 29Chuang W.-J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13293-13301Google Scholar) power dependence of the previously reported (406.7 nm excited) spectra is that the observed spectral power dependence arose as a result of contamination of the sample with small amounts of resting state HRP whose spectrum was masked at higher excitation powers by an HRP-II-like photoproduct. In the present work, the power dependence of the mesoheme-HRP-I RR spectrum is directly analogous to that observed for native HRP-I. Thus, as is shown in Fig. 5, using 406.7 nm excitation, no unique spectrum is observed for the Compound I derivative; i.e. the “mesoheme-HRP-I” spectra (Fig. 5, traces A and B) are virtually identical with that of mesoheme-HRP-II (Fig. 5, trace C). However, a unique spectrum is again obtained using 356.4 nm excitation, as is shown in Fig. 6, trace A. As expected, as the power of the excitation beam is increased to 5 and 25 milliwatts, new features (e.g. 1379 cm−1) grow in whose relative intensities increase with increasing laser power and whose frequencies match those observed in the RR spectrum of authentic mesoheme-HRP-II (Fig. 5, trace C). In comparison with the RR spectra of native (i.e. protoheme-containing) HRP, the spectra of the mesoheme-HRP derivative are considerably less complex. The presence of the vinyl groups in protoheme gives rise to several internal vinyl modes and also lowers the effective symmetry of the heme macrocycle so that several Eu modes are activated (42Spiro, T. G., (ed) (1988) Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy: Resonance Ramn Spectra of Heme and Metalloproteins, Wiley, New York.Google Scholar). Thus, the spectra of the mesoheme-HRP derivatives exhibit only a few, relatively isolated, modes above 1300 cm−1. This relative simplicity in the spectra facilitates correlation of the various marker modes throughout the series (meso-HRP-RS, meso-HRP-II, and meso-HRP-I). Thus, while both ν11 and ν2 occur between 1580 and 1600 in the spectrum of meso-HRP-II (Fig. 3 and Table I), no bands appear between 1550 and 1600 cm−1 in the spectrum of meso-HRP-I (Fig. 6A and Table I). In this case then, it becomes clear that ν2 (and apparently ν11) is shifted to higher frequency (by at least 9 cm−1) upon cation radical formation (i.e. ν2 shifts from ∼1602 to ∼1611 cm−1). Such shifts are consistent with an 2A1u formulation for meso-HRP-I, a conclusion which is consistent with the recent 2H NMR results (16Morishima I. Takamuki Y. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7666-7672Google Scholar, 17La Mar G.N. Thanabal V. Johnson R.D. Smith K.M. Parish D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5428-5434Google Scholar). Finally, it is interesting to consider the behavior of ν(Fe=O) upon cation radical formation. The ν(Fe=O) of meso-HRP-II is observed at 786 cm−1 (shifting to 754 cm−1 upon 18O substitution) as shown in Fig. 4. These spectra were acquired at pH 10.8, and it is well established that this mode is sensitive to pH, shifting by about 10 cm−1 to lower frequency at neutral pH (18Sitter A.J. Reczek C.M. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7515-7522Google Scholar, 19Hashimoto S. Tatsuno Y. Kitagawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2417Google Scholar, 20Kitagawa T. Mizutani Y. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1994; 135/136: 685Google Scholar). Thus, the expected ν(Fe=O) frequency for meso-HRP-II at pH 7.5 is ∼776 cm−1. The corresponding frequency for meso-HRP-I (at pH 7.5) is 793 cm−1 (shifting to 759−1 for native HRP-I) as shown in Fig. 9. This shift to higher frequency upon cation radical formation is consistent with model compound studies wherein the ν(V=O) of vanadyl porphyrin π-cation radicals (which yield an 2A1u ground state) was shown to occur at a higher frequency than the corresponding (neutral) vanadyl porphyrin (43Macor K.A. Czernuszewicz R.S. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 29: 1996-2000Google Scholar). The use of near UV (∼350 nm) excitation facilitates acquisition of the RR spectra of Compound I derivatives of horseradish peroxidase and its analogues via enhancement of modes associated with the ferryl π-cation active site, whereas excitation lines near 400 nm apparently lead to selective enhancement of a Compound II-like photoproduct. The authentic RR spectra of the Compound I species of both the native and mesoheme-reconstituted proteins are indicative of an 2A1u-like ground state. Structural characterization of such species may be important from a biological perspective in that variations in the reactivities of such intermediates may depend on the electronic ground state configurations (2A1u versus 2A2u) (1Dunford H.B. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1982; 4: 41-68Google Scholar, 2Frew J.E. Jones P. Advances in Inorganic and Bioinorganic Mechanism. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1984: 175-212Google Scholar, 3Hanson L.K.

Carefully conducted RR studies, employing judiciously chosen excitation wavelengths over a range of incident powers, are clearly useful in providing such information."
https://openalex.org/W2052792820,"Cross-desensitization among receptors for peptide chemoattractants have been shown to involve two independent processes, receptor phosphorylation and inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) activation. Receptors for lipid chemoattractants, i.e. platelet activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene B4, did not inhibit the responses of peptide chemoattractant receptors, suggesting distinct signaling pathways. To examine cross-desensitization between receptors for lipid and peptide chemoattractants, cDNA encoding the PAF receptor (PAFR) was co-expressed into RBL-2H3 cells with cDNAs encoding receptors for either formylated peptides (FR), a product of the fifth component of complement (C5aR) or interleukin-8 A (IL-8RA). PAFR was homologously phosphorylated and desensitized by PAF, and cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized by fMet-Leu-Phe, C5a, and IL-8. In contrast, the receptors for peptide chemoattractants were neither cross-phosphorylated nor cross-desensitized by PAF. Staurosporine blocked cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of the PAFR by peptide chemoattractants. Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of PAFR (mPAFR) abolished its homologous and cross-phosphorylation. mPAFR was also resistant to cross-desensitization by peptide chemoattractants at the level of PLC activation. Interestingly, mPAFR mediated a sustained Ca2+ mobilization in response to PAF and was more active in inducing GTPase activity, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, secretion, and phospholipase D activation than the wild type PAFR. In contrast to PAFR, stimulation of the mPAFR cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized responses to IL-8RA. As expected, FR, which is resistant to cross-phosphorylation by C5aR and IL-8RA, was not phosphorylated by mPAFR. However, unlike C5aR and IL-8RA, mPAFR did not inhibit the ability of FR to activate PLC. Blocking Ca2+ influx inhibited mPAFR-mediated sustained Ca2+ response, phospholipase D activation and secretion, but not phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of IL-8RA. The data herein suggest that cross-desensitization of PAFR by peptide chemoattractants is solely due to receptor phosphorylation.

Phagocytic leukocyte accumulation and activation are regulated in part by chemoattractants released by bacteria or produced by the host. Chemoattractants include products of bacterial protein synthesis (n-formylated peptides, i.e. fMLP), 1The abbreviations used are: fMLPformylmethionylleucylphenylalanineET-FRepitope-tagged fMLP receptorC5apeptide from the fifth component of complementET-C5aRepitope-tagged C5a receptorIL-8interleukin-8ET-IL-8Repitope-tagged IL-8 receptorGTPγSguanosine 5′-3′-O-(thio)triphosphateG proteinGTP-regulatory proteinPAFplatelet activating factorPAFRPAF receptorPLCphospholipase CPKCprotein kinase c: FR, formylated peptideRBLrat basophilic leukemiaPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. a cleavage product of the fifth component of complement (C5a), interleukin-8 (IL-8); and the lipid chemoattractants, platelet activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene B4 (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar). Chemoattractants activate leukocytes via cell surface receptors which are coupled to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G protein) to activate phospholipase C (PLC) (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar, 2Gerard G. Gerard N.P. Curr. Opin.

Like other members of this family, chemoattractant receptors become desensitized upon agonist exposure, resulting in a loss of cellular responsiveness (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar, 4Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Receptor desensitization has long been categorized as homologous or heterologous, the former being restricted to the agonist-occupied form of the receptor, mediated by phosphorylation by a receptor-specific kinase (GRK) (4Hausdorff W.P.

Heterologous desensitization occurs independently of receptor occupancy by ligand and involves phosphorylation of the receptor by second messenger activated kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC) (5Ligget S.B.

Houslay M.D. Regulation of Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 71-98Google Scholar). Chemoattractant-mediated leukocyte functions have been shown to be also regulated by a third type of desensitization designated as “class desensitization” (7Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E.

Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar). This type of desensitization was demonstrated among receptors for peptide chemoattractants (FR, C5aR, and IL-8RA) (9Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which utilize the same G protein (Giα2) to activate a common pool of phospholipase C (PLCβ2) (10Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 11Thelen M. Wirthmueller U. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This form of cross-desensitization is less specific than homologous (involves unoccupied receptor) but more specific than heterologous desensitization in that only a class of chemoattractant receptors appeared to be involved (8Tomhave E.

Studies in neutrophils also demonstrated that whereas the responses to the lipid chemoattractants PAF and leukotriene B4 were cross-desensitized by all the peptide chemoattractants, the lipid chemoattractants did not cross-desensitize responses to any of the peptide chemoattractants (8Tomhave E. Richardson M.R. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar).

To better define the role of desensitization in the regulation of the inflammatory response, this laboratory has developed a model system using a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) into which multiple chemoattractant receptors can be expressed and stimulated to elicit cellular responses similar to those observed in neutrophils (9Richardson R.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using this system, receptors for peptide chemoattractants were co-expressed and it was recently demonstrated that in addition to receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling of receptors from G protein activation, inhibition of downstream effector activity, presumably phospholipase C, plays an important role in the class desensitization of peptide chemoattractants (9Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present work, the nature of cross-regulation among peptide and lipid chemoattractant receptors was investigated. To this end, receptors for PAFR were co-expressed in RBL-2H3 cells with those for FR, C5aR, or IL-8RA to study cross-desensitization among receptor classes. A PAFR mutated to express a truncated and phosphorylation deficient carboxyl terminus was also co-expressed with the peptide chemoattractant receptors in these cells. The data presented in this work show that cross-desensitization of PAFR by the peptide chemoattractants is a consequence of PAFR cross-phosphorylation and does not involve inhibitory effects on the activation of PLC. [32P]Orthophosphate (8,500-9,120 Ci/mmol), myo-[2-3H]inositol (24.4 Ci/mmol), [3H]myristic acid (11.2 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol), and [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. 125I-IL-8 was from Amersham. IL-8 (monocyte derived) was purchased from Genzyme. Geneticin (G418) and all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal 12CA5 antibody, protein G-agarose, and proteases inhibitors were from Boehringer Manheim. fMLP, Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes. PAF was from Calbiochem. C5a, GDP, GTP, GTPγS, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were from commercial sources. Nucleotides encoding a 9-amino acid epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted between the NH2-terminal initiator methionine and the second amino acid of each cDNA by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E DuBose R.A. Haribabu B.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was also used to construct a carboxyl-terminal truncated epitope-tagged PAFR mutant. The 5′-oligonucleotide corresponding to the epitope-tagged PAFR was used with a 3′-oligonucleotide complementary to amino acids 302-312 in PAFR. The 3′-oligonucleotide was altered to convert amino acids Thr305 and Ser310 to alanine and glycine, respectively, and a stop codon following amino acid 312. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and the entire receptor was sequenced to confirm the intended mutations and lack of secondary mutations. RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107/250 μl) were transfected by electroporation with either pRK5 or pcDNA3 vector containing the receptor cDNAs (20 μg). Geneticin-resistant cells were selected by subculturing the transfected cells in growth medium supplemented with geneticin (1 mg/ml). Cell surface expression of the receptors were monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (11Thelen M. Wirthmueller U. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Clones were expanded from a single cell and those clones responding to both ligands were used. Phosphorylation of ET receptors was performed as described previously (10Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Briefly, RBL-2H3 cells (3 × 106) expressing a combination of receptors were subcultured overnight in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. The following day, the cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the same medium supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/dish) for 90 min in order to metabolically label the intracellular ATP pool. The labeled cells were then stimulated with or without agonists (IL-8, 100 nM; C5a, 100 nM; or fMLP, 1 μM) for 5-7 min at 37°C. The phosphorylated receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysate with the 12CA5 antibody, analyzed by SDS electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cells were treated with appropriate concentrations of stimulants and membranes were prepared as already described (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding and GTPase activity using 10-20 μg of membrane preparations were carried out as described previously (14Richardson M.R. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 106) were washed with HEPES-buffered saline and loaded with 1 μM Indo I-AM in the presence of 1 μM pluronic acid for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer. Intracellular calcium increase in the presence of different ligands at the indicated doses (lowest EC100 for Ca2+ mobilization: fMLP, 100 nM; C5a, 10 nM; IL-8, 10 nM; and PAF, 10 nM) were measured as described (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 96-well culture plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in inositol-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. The cells were then washed with HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 mM LiCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the same buffer with and without stimulants. Reactions were stopped by adding 200 μl of chloroform, methanol, 4 N HCl (100:200:2). The generation of [3H]inositol phosphates was determined as reported (13Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Richardson M.R. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B.

Cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then treated with and without agonist and β-hexosaminidase release was assessed as previously reported (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured in 24-well plates (2.5 × 105 per well) overnight and labeled with [3H]myristic acid (2 μCi/well) in HEPES-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 90 min. Cells were then washed and stimulated with an EC100 dose of either PAF (100 nM) or IL-8 (100 nM) for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 750 μl of chloroform, methanol, 4 N HCl (100:200:5) to form a monophasic mixture. This was separated into two phases by further addition of chloroform (250 μl) and 0.1 N HCl (250 μl). The upper aqueous phase was discarded and 10 μl of the lower organic phase was removed and counted to determine total 3H incorporation. An aliquot (200 μl) was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and resuspended in 25 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1). Phospholipids were separated by TLC using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (65:15:2) as the mobile phase. Unlabeled phosphatidylethanol (500 pmol) was used as a standard. Phosphatidylethanol was visualized with iodine vapor, and the corresponding spot was excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine the formation of phosphatidylethanol (8Tomhave E. Richardson M.R. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells expressing epitope-tagged FR and PAFR (FR-PAFR), C5aR and PAFR (C5aR-PAFR), and IL-8RA and PAFR (IL8R-PAFR) were labeled with 32P, treated with different ligands (100 nM PAF, 1 μM fMLP, 100 nM C5a, or 100 nM IL-8) and cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 antibody, which specifically bind to the epitope tag. The identity of the phosphorylated bands for the respective receptors (FR ∼ 65 kDa, C5aR ∼ 45 kDa, IL-8RA ∼ 70 kDa, and PAFR ∼ 42 kDa) have been previously demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of iodinated and phosphorylated receptors in the presence and absence of the epitope tag peptide (12Ali H.

As shown in Fig. 1A, PAFR (∼42 kDa) was phosphorylated by PAF (lanes 2, 5, and 8) and cross-phosphorylated by fMLP (lane 3), C5a (lane 6 and see next paragraph), and IL-8 (lane 9). FR (∼65 kDa) (lane 3), C5aR (∼45 kDa) (lane 6), and IL-8RA (∼70 kDa) (lane 9) were homologously phosphorylated by their respective ligands, but were resistant to cross-phosphorylation by PAF stimulation. Since PAFR (∼42 kDa) and C5aR (∼45 kDa) migrate as broad overlapping bands in SDS gels, double transfected RBL-2H3 cell lines with one native and the other epitope-tagged receptors were prepared. This allowed clear resolution of the nature of cross-phosphorylation of these two receptors, as only the ET receptors are immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 antibody. In RBL-2H3 cells expressing wild type C5aR and ET-PAFR (*C5aR-PAFR) or wild type PAFR and ET-C5aR (*PAFR-C5aR), activation of the C5aR resulted in cross-phosphorylation of the PAFR but not vice versa (Fig. 1B, lanes 11 and 14 versus lanes 12 and 15). The involvement of PKC on fMLP and IL-8-mediated cross-phosphorylation of PAFR was studied. 32P-Labeled RBL-2H3 cells expressing FR-PAFR and IL8R-PAFR were preincubated with or without the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (100 nM) for 3 min and then stimulated with PAF (100 nM), fMLP (1 μM), IL-8 (100 nM), or PMA (100 nM). Whereas PAF-induced phosphorylation of ET-PAFR was not affected by staurosporine (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 9, 3, and 10), PAFR cross-phosphorylation by either fMLP or IL-8 were markedly inhibited (lanes 4, 5, 11, and 12). PMA-induced phosphorylation of PAFR was also blocked by staurosporine (lanes 6, 7, 13, and 14). To determine the effect of cross-phosphorylation on PAFR function, agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was measured in membranes prepared from double transfected RBL-2H3 cells expressing PAFR and C5aR, and pretreated with either PAF (100 nM) or C5a (100 nM). As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment of cells with either PAF or C5a resulted in homologous desensitization (∼70%) of agonist-induced [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes. Membranes from cells pretreated with C5a showed a ∼50% decrease in PAF-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding. Only a ∼13% desensitization was observed for C5a-stimulation in cells pretreated with PAF. Ca2+ mobilization was measured to further determine the relationship between receptor cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization. Ca2+ mobilization in response to an EC100 dose of fMLP (100 nM), C5a (10 nM), IL-8 (10 nM), or PAF (10 nM) was homologously desensitized by a first dose of the same ligand (data not shown, see Refs. 12Ali H.

PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization was cross-desensitized by pretreatment of the cells with a first dose of fMLP, C5a, or IL-8 (Table I). In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with an EC100 first dose of PAF had no effect on Ca2+ mobilization induced by any of the peptide chemoattractants (Table I).Table I.Cross-desensitization of PAFR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization by fMLP, C5a, and IL-8CellsAgonists% Cross-desensitizationFR-PAFRfMLP → PAF47 ± 12.3ap < 0.05.PAF → fMLP−6 ± 7C5aR-PAFRC5a → PAF80 ± 7.9bp < 0.01.PAF → C5a3 ± 2.7IL8R-PAFRIL-8 → PAF31 ± 14ap < 0.05.PAF → IL-81 ± 3.7a p < 0.05.b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab In order to assess the role of phosphorylation in the cross-desensitization of PAFR by the peptide chemoattractant receptors, a phosphorylation deficient PAFR mutant (mPAFR) was constructed (Table II). The mPAFR was cotransfected into RBL-2H3 cells with pcDNA3 plasmid containing either FR or IL-8RA. Stable transfectants were generated and single cell cloning was utilized to isolate double transfectants. Competition binding using [3H]WEB 2086 and Scatchard analysis of wild type versus the mutant indicated that deletion of the carboxyl tail had no significant effect on the affinity of the receptor (Kd∼10 and ∼19 nM for wild type and mutant PAFR, respectively). Clones expressing similar receptor numbers (2.8-3.3 × 103 receptors/cell) were utilized to determine the functional properties of the mutant PAFR versus the wild type receptor.Table IIAmino acid sequences of the carboxyl-terminal tails of the wild type PAF receptor (PAFR) and the mutant PAF receptor (mPAFR) construct298 342↓ ↓C-tail PAFR KKFRKHLTEKFYSMRSSRKCSRATTDTVTEVVVPFNQIPGNSLKNmPAFR KKFRKHLAEKFYGMR Open table in a new tab Time course of both PAFR- and mPAFR-mediated [35S] GTPγS binding in membranes were similar, with half-maximal binding at ∼4 min (data not shown). Maximum binding after 20 min of reactions were 0.13.± 0.02 and 0.12 ± 0.016 pmol of [35S]GTPγS bound/mg of protein for mPAFR and PAFR, respectively. However, GTPase activity in membranes (Fig. 4A), phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig. 4B), and β-hexosaminidase release (Fig. 4C) in intact cells revealed that mPAFR was more active than the wild type PAFR in mediating cellular responses. Peaks of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to PAF (10 nM) were similar for both, wild type (598 nM) and mutant PAFR (624 nM) (Fig. 4D). However, a more sustained response was obtained with mPAFR as compared to the wild type receptor (Fig. 4D). The ability of mPAFR and wild type PAFR to stimulate PLD activation was also determined and compared to that of IL-8RA in RBL-2H3 cells co-expressing IL-8RA and either PAFR (IL8R-PAFR) or mPAFR (IL8R-mPAFR). As shown in Fig. 5, IL-8-induced PLD activation was similar in both cell lines, 0.61 ± 0.014- and 0.53 ± 0.04-fold over basal, for IL8R-PAFR and IL8R-mPAFR cells, respectively (Fig. 5). In contrast, PAF-induced PLD activity was ∼5-fold greater in cells expressing IL8R-mPAFR (1.43 ± 0.07) than IL8R-PAFR (0.26 ± 0.02). 32P-Labeled RBL-2H3 cells co-expressing the epitope-tagged mPAFR and either FR (FR-mPAFR), or IL-8RA (IL8R-mPAFR) were treated with different ligands (PAF, 100 nM; fMLP, 1 μM; or IL-8, 100 nM) and immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 6, mPAFR (∼42 kDa) was resistant to phosphorylation by PAF (lanes 2 and 5) and cross-phosphorylation by either fMLP (lane 3) or IL-8 (lane 6). FR (∼65 kDa) (lane 3) and IL-8RA (∼70 kDa) (lane 6) were homologously phosphorylated by fMLP and IL-8, respectively. While FR was resistant to cross-phosphorylation, stimulation of the mutant PAFR resulted in IL-8RA cross-phosphorylation (lane 5). The extent of mPAFR-mediated cross-phosphorylation of IL-8RA was similar to the extent of phosphorylation of IL-8RA by PMA (Fig. 2, lane 13). In addition, IL-8RA cross-phosphorylation by mPAFR was inhibited by staurosporine (100 nM) (data not shown). The ability of IL-8RA to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in membranes from cells expressing IL8-RA and mPAFR was determined. As shown in Fig. 7, pretreatment of the cells with IL-8 caused ∼67% homologous desensitization of IL-8-induced response compared to control (untreated cells). There was no effect on mPAFR. Membranes from cells pretreated with PAF (100 nM) was resistant to homologous desensitization but showed a ∼50% decrease of the response to IL-8RA. Simultaneous pretreatment of the cells with staurosporine (100 nM) blocked significantly both the homologous (∼40%) and cross- (66%) desensitization of IL-8RA-induced [35S]GTPγS binding.

We previously found that influenza virus inhibited PKR function by recruiting or activating a cellular inhibitor termed P58IPK. The present study was undertaken to complement our earlier analyses, which demonstrated that P58IPK efficiently inhibited PKR autophosphorylation and activity in vitro. We now report that P58IPK down-regulates PKR and, in turn, stimulates protein synthetic rates inside the cell. Using transfection analysis, we show that P58IPK stimulates translation of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase reporter gene mRNA. Furthermore, we found that at least two regions of the P58IPK molecule were required for PKR inhibitory activity in COS-1 cells: (i) the DnaJ similarity region at the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 391-504); and (ii) the tetratricopeptide repeat 6 (TPR6) domain (amino acids 222-255) located in the middle of the P58IPK protein and within the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2α homology region. P58IPK variants lacking either one of these regions were unable to stimulate secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase protein synthetic rates. Consistent with this data is the observation that the ΔTPR6 mutant (the P58IPK variant lacking the TPR6 motif) failed to block PKR activity in vitro. Based on these data and our earlier in vitro functional and PKR-P58IPK binding analyses, a revised model of PKR regulation by P58IPK is presented.

On activation by double stranded RNA, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation and catalyzes the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α), resulting in inactivation of the latter (3Clemens M.J.

This situation is not favorable to viruses, which must make their proteins to replicate. Much of the focus on PKR has related to the role of the kinase in mediating the inhibitory interferon response to viral infection (5Katze M.G. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N.

Finally, the importance of PKR in regulating cell growth and gene expression is underscored by evidence suggesting PKR to be a tumor suppressor gene (17Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G.

For example, adenovirus encodes a polymerase III gene product, VAI RNA, which binds to and inactivates PKR (26Katze M.G. DeCorato D. Safer B. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Ghadge G. Swaminathan S. Katze M.G. Thimmappaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7140-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, vaccinia virus encodes the K3L protein, which also binds to PKR and inhibits its activity (28Carroll K. Elroy-Stein O. Moss R. Jagus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12837-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Davies M.V. Chang H. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Influenza virus has evolved an unusual mechanism to down-regulate PKR and thus ensure that viral protein synthesis is not compromised during infection. Influenza virus recruits or activates a cellular protein termed P58IPK, based on its Mr of 58,000 (30Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14238-14243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). P58IPK is in a complex with its own inhibitor, I-P58IPK, and is thus normally inactive in uninfected cells. On influenza virus infection, P58IPK is dissociated from I-P58IPK and available to complex with PKR, thereby preventing phosphorylation of eIF-2α (30Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1702-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of P58IPK cloned from bovine, human, and mouse cells showed P58IPK to be a novel, highly conserved 504-amino acid protein (33Korth M.J. Lyons C.N. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Lee T.-G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spanning the P58IPK molecule are nine tandemly arranged motifs referred to as tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). TPRs are 34-amino acid motifs that have been demonstrated to form amphipathic α helices that can direct protein-protein interactions (35Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The middle region of P58IPK contains limited homology to the amino-terminal region of eIF-2 α, the natural substrate of PKR. Finally, the carboxyl terminus of P58IPK shows extensive homology to the conserved J domain of the bacterial DnaJ protein (36Silver P.A. Way J.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Like PKR, P58IPK likely regulates cellular gene expression in the absence of virus infection. It was demonstrated that overexpression of P58IPK in NIH 3T3 cells led to the malignant transformation of these cells, suggesting P58IPK to be involved in cellular growth control (37Barber G.N. Thompson S. Lee T.G. Strom T.J.R. Darveau A. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4278-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Using in vitro assays with purified components, we previously showed that native or recombinant P58IPK inhibited both the autophosphorylation of PKR and the phosphorylation of eIF-2α by an already activated kinase (31Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Lee T.-G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have not, however, directly demonstrated that P58IPK functions in vivo, inside the cell, to block PKR activity and stimulate protein synthetic rates. We therefore developed an in vivo cotransfection assay using cDNAs encoding P58IPK and an alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. This allowed us both to analyze P58IPK inhibitory activity and to precisely map P58IPK functional domains. We can now report that PKR inhibition and the resultant translational stimulatory activity appear to require two distinct regions of the P58IPK molecule: the TPR6 domain located in the central region (amino acids 222-255) and the DnaJ similarity region at the COOH terminus (amino acids 391-504). Based on these data, a model of PKR regulation by P58IPK will be presented.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we developed a cotransfection assay to analyze P58IPK function inside the cell. As was the case in similar assays with viral-encoded PKR inhibitors, such as the reovirus σ3 protein (44Giantini M. Shatkin A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lloyd R.M. Shatkin A.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6878-6884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Seliger L.S. Giantini M. Shatkin A.J. Virology. 1992; 187: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the adenovirus VAI RNA (42Svensson C. Akusjarvi G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 43Kaufman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 49Svensson C. Akusjarvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), P58IPK down-regulated endogenous PKR activity, leading to the stimulation of reporter gene mRNA translation. Although cotransfection with wild type P58IPK and variants caused minor decreases in SEAP mRNA levels (possibly due to competition for transcription factors; Ref. 44Giantini M. Shatkin A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the predominant effect of P58IPK action was at the level of mRNA translation. This was perhaps most dramatically demonstrated by the cotransfections with WT P58IPK and SEAP, in which the levels of SEAP mRNA were reduced approximately 2-fold, whereas the levels of SEAP mRNA translation were concurrently stimulated up to 3-6-fold (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, we found that both the central region, containing the TPR6 motif, and the COOH terminus, encompassing the DnaJ similarity region, were required for P58IPK activity in vivo (summarized in Fig. 1). In accordance with this functional data, we found that P58IPK lacking the TPR6 motif failed to interact with PKR using the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze in vivo binding (50Gale Jr., M. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4172-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, the ΔTPR6 variant failed to inhibit PKR phosphorylation activity in vitro (Fig. 6). In contrast, the COOH region of P58IPK is not required for P58IPK-PKR interactions (32Polyak S.J. Tang N. Wambach M. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1702-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 50Gale Jr., M. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4172-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), nor is the DnaJ region required for P58IPK function in vitro (34Lee T.-G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region shows homology as high as 55% identity and 80% similarity to select DnaJ proteins that play an essential role in the chaperone function of the hsp70-like DnaK protein of E. coli (36Silver P.A. Way J.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 48Ohki M. Tamura F. Nishimura S. Uchida H. J. Biol.

Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).Based on our in vitro and in vivo functional and binding data, we present what has become an increasingly complex model of PKR regulation by P58IPK (Fig. 7). As we have previously shown, P58IPK likely exists in an inactive complex with its own inhibitor, I-P58IPK, in uninfected cells. After influenza virus infection, P58IPK dissociates from I-P58IPK, allowing P58IPK to interact with PKR. Although we found that P58IPK can interact with PKR in the absence of other protein or RNA factors in vitro (32Polyak S.J. Tang N. Wambach M. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1702-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Lee T.-G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the present study suggests that additional factors must interact with P58IPK and/or PKR to allow for P58IPK-PKR interactions inside the cell. We hypothesize that such a factor (Fig. 7, X) binds to the P58IPK DnaJ region, a region already known to promote protein-protein interactions (36Silver P.A. Way J.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Two alternative pathways can further explain how factor X facilitates interactions between P58IPK and PKR. In one scenario, we propose that X binds to P58IPK and targets P58IPK to the correct cellular compartment and then to the protein kinase. This model would likely require that X interact with both P58IPK and PKR. Such a model could explain why P58IPK variants, lacking the DnaJ region, can still interact with and inhibit PKR in vitro. Alternatively, factor X, which might itself be a molecular chaperone (52Craig E.A. Gambill B.D. Nelson R.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 402-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-30Google Scholar), may bind to the DnaJ region of P58IPK and alter the conformation or folding of P58IPK, such that it can now interact with PKR and inhibit the protein kinase. Our earlier studies mapped the P58IPK-interactive site of PKR to amino acids 244-296, spanning the regulatory and catalytic borders of PKR but including the ATP binding region of the protein kinase catalytic domain (50Gale Jr., M. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4172-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In any case, the end result of either of these two model pathways would be the P58IPK induced inhibition of PKR activity and resultant stimulation of mRNA translation. The interplay between P58IPK, PKR, and protein X is reminiscent of other systems in which a TPR protein either interacts with other TPR proteins or else another regulatory protein, such as α2, to control its activity (54Lamb J.R. Michaud W.A. Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 55Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is even precedence in the literature for the interaction of another TPR protein, Hip, with the molecular chaperone Hsc70 (56Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar).Before closing, it is worth commenting on the requirement of the TPR6 motif for both P58IPK binding and function. Curiously, the central TPR motifs, often including TPR6, were found to be critical for the function of other TPR proteins, including Nuc2, CDC-23, CDC-27, and BimA (57Hirano T. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 60: 319-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 58Sikorski R.S. Michaud W.A. Wootton J.C. Boguski M.S. Connelly C. Hieter P.

Furthermore, single amino acid substitutions in TPR domains 5-7 have been shown to abolish the biological function of the yeast CDC23 gene (58Sikorski R.S. Michaud W.A. Wootton J.C. Boguski M.S. Connelly C. Hieter P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 59Sikorski R.S. Michaud W.A. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data suggest a critical function for this region of these TPR proteins despite their diverse regulatory roles. The P58IPK TPR6 domain contains sequences with limited similarity to a region of eIF-2α, the natural PKR substrate. This homologous region, however, is not extensive, with a maximum 31% identity with five gaps. Nonetheless, this region of P58IPK does contain the PKR consensus eIF-2α phosphorylation motif ELS (P58IPK amino acids 239-241 and eIF-2α amino acids 49-51). Since the eIF-2α serine 51 is phosphorylated by PKR (61Colthurst D.R. Campbell D.G. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), these data suggested that P58IPK may function as a PKR substrate (62Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. House C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 287-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This would require the presence of serine 241 to functionally mimic the eIF-2α phosphorylation site. However, we found that a serine to alanine mutation at amino acids 241 (see Fig. 1) did not inactivate P58IPK function either when P58IPK was assayed in vitro (34Lee T.-G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in vivo (data not shown), suggesting that P58IPK probably does not function as a PKR pseudosubstrate. In accordance with these results, we found that P58IPK likely binds at or near the ATP binding domain on PKR, a region clearly distinct from the substrate binding site. In contrast, the vaccinia virus-encoded PKR inhibitor K3L likely does function as a PKR substrate (28Carroll K. Elroy-Stein O. Moss R. Jagus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12837-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Davies M.V. Chang H. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Beattie E. Tartaglia J. Paoletti E. Virology. 1991; 183: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This argument is supported by our recent evidence that, unlike P58IPK, K3L binds to a region of PKR spanning amino acids 367-551, which localizes to the large lobe of the PKR protein kinase, thought to be largely responsible for substrate recognition and binding (50Gale Jr., M.

Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). On activation by double stranded RNA, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation and catalyzes the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α), resulting in inactivation of the latter (3Clemens M.J. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar, 4Galabru J. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-15544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These events lead to dramatic decreases in protein synthetic rates inside the cell. This situation is not favorable to viruses, which must make their proteins to replicate. Much of the focus on PKR has related to the role of the kinase in mediating the inhibitory interferon response to viral infection (5Katze M.G. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N.

However, there is accumulating evidence implicating PKR, which is constitutively expressed in eukaryotic cells in the absence of interferon (9Meurs E. Watanabe Y. Kadereit S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G.

Finally, the importance of PKR in regulating cell growth and gene expression is underscored by evidence suggesting PKR to be a tumor suppressor gene (17Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G.

For example, adenovirus encodes a polymerase III gene product, VAI RNA, which binds to and inactivates PKR (26Katze M.G. DeCorato D. Safer B. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Ghadge G. Swaminathan S. Katze M.G. Thimmappaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7140-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, vaccinia virus encodes the K3L protein, which also binds to PKR and inhibits its activity (28Carroll K. Elroy-Stein O. Moss R. Jagus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12837-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Davies M.V. Chang H. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Influenza virus has evolved an unusual mechanism to down-regulate PKR and thus ensure that viral protein synthesis is not compromised during infection. Influenza virus recruits or activates a cellular protein termed P58IPK, based on its Mr of 58,000 (30Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14238-14243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). P58IPK is in a complex with its own inhibitor, I-P58IPK, and is thus normally inactive in uninfected cells. On influenza virus infection, P58IPK is dissociated from I-P58IPK and available to complex with PKR, thereby preventing phosphorylation of eIF-2α (30Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14238-14243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1702-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of P58IPK cloned from bovine, human, and mouse cells showed P58IPK to be a novel, highly conserved 504-amino acid protein (33Korth M.J. Lyons C.N. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Lee T.-G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spanning the P58IPK molecule are nine tandemly arranged motifs referred to as tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). TPRs are 34-amino acid motifs that have been demonstrated to form amphipathic α helices that can direct protein-protein interactions (35Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The middle region of P58IPK contains limited homology to the amino-terminal region of eIF-2 α, the natural substrate of PKR. Finally, the carboxyl terminus of P58IPK shows extensive homology to the conserved J domain of the bacterial DnaJ protein (36Silver P.A. Way J.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Like PKR, P58IPK likely regulates cellular gene expression in the absence of virus infection. It was demonstrated that overexpression of P58IPK in NIH 3T3 cells led to the malignant transformation of these cells, suggesting P58IPK to be involved in cellular growth control (37Barber G.N. Thompson S. Lee T.G. Strom T.J.R. Darveau A. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4278-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Using in vitro assays with purified components, we previously showed that native or recombinant P58IPK inhibited both the autophosphorylation of PKR and the phosphorylation of eIF-2α by an already activated kinase (31Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Lee T.-G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have not, however, directly demonstrated that P58IPK functions in vivo, inside the cell, to block PKR activity and stimulate protein synthetic rates. We therefore developed an in vivo cotransfection assay using cDNAs encoding P58IPK and an alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. This allowed us both to analyze P58IPK inhibitory activity and to precisely map P58IPK functional domains. We can now report that PKR inhibition and the resultant translational stimulatory activity appear to require two distinct regions of the P58IPK molecule: the TPR6 domain located in the central region (amino acids 222-255) and the DnaJ similarity region at the COOH terminus (amino acids 391-504). Based on these data, a model of PKR regulation by P58IPK will be presented."

A mutant, FUD 39, lacking the Cl−-concentrating 23-kDa psbP protein of photosystem II was found to have a decreased capability to perform photoactivation. The yield of the process never reached wild type level, and contrary to the wild type, it was highly dependent on the intensity of the activating light, with a very narrow optimum around 1 μE m−2 s−1. The different behavior in the mutant can be explained by a requirement for a longer dark period, between the two photoacts, during the photoactivation. This is proposed to reflect the decreased Cl− affinity in the mutant. Photoactivation in the mutant was also found to be very sensitive to competing photoinhibitory processes. The inhibition was located to the donor side of photosystem II and affected the photoactivation capability before electron transfer from Tyrz was inhibited. We propose an extended model for photoactivation in which an intermediate that is sensitive to photoinhibition is formed if Cl− is not functionally bound to the manganese cluster.

Recently, we identified the cis-element required for initiation of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) RNA dimerization in vitro. The dimerization initiation site (DIS) is a hairpin structure containing a self-complementary sequence in the loop. We proposed that dimerization is initiated by a loop-loop kissing interaction involving the self-complementary sequence present in each monomer. We tested the ability of sense and antisense oligonucleotides targeted against the DIS to interfere with a preformed viral RNA dimer. Self-dimerization and inhibition properties of the tested oligonucleotides are dictated by the nature of the loop. An RNA loop is absolutely required in the case of sense oligonucleotides, whereas the nature and the sequence of the stem is not important. They form reversible loop-loop interactions and act as competitive inhibitors. Antisense oligonucleotides are less efficient in self-dimerization and are more potent inhibitors than sense oligonucleotides. They are less sensitive to the nature of the loop than the antisense oligonucleotides.

Targets on RNA have to be chosen based on the different criteria: functional relevance, sequence conservation, and accessibility to the oligonucleotide within the RNA structure. The latter point is a major problem since the target might be sequestered by the intrinsic structure of the viral RNA and/or by possible interactions with viral or cellular proteins. However, information about the availability of the target is most often missing. A new target site that obeys these three conditions is the recently characterized site that initiates the dimerization of HIV-I genomic RNA. human immunodeficiency virus, type I dimerization initiation site temperature gradient gel electrophoresis full DNA full RNA mixed DNA-stem/RNA-loop sense antisense reinforced sense reinforced antisense. The fact that there is a strong selective pressure to maintain the dimeric nature of genomic RNA suggests that dimerization represents a good target for sense or antisense oligonucleotides. The diploid nature of the RNA genome was suggested to enhance genetic recombination, probably by favoring interstrand transfer during reverse transcription (16Hu W.S. Temin H.M.

An advantageous consequence is to increase the rate of retroviral evolution and to bypass occasional breaks in one of the genomic RNA (19Coffin J.M. J. Gen.

Darlix J.-L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Google Scholar). We have previously identified a cis-element responsible for the initiation of the dimerization of HIV-I RNA (Mal strain) in vitro that we named DIS (dimerization initiation site) (25Marquet R. Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 23: 145-151Google Scholar, 26Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol.

The DIS is a hairpin structure containing a self-complementary 6-nucleotide sequence in the loop (see Fig. 1A) located between the primer binding site and the 5′-splice donor site. Our results suggested that dimerization is initiated via a loop-loop interaction based on Watson-Crick base pairing between the self-complementary sequences present on each monomer (see Fig. 1A). The proposed mechanism presents striking analogies with natural antisense RNA-regulated systems (for reviews, see Refs. 28Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Google Scholar, 29Simons R.W. Crooke S.T. Lebleu B. Research and Application. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 97-124Google Scholar, 30Takayama K.M. Inouye M. Crit. Rev.

However, in contrast with sense-antisense RNA interactions, the formation of a reversible loop-loop kissing complex is not followed by the propagation of intermolecular base pairing (32Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Google Scholar). The RNA dimer is further stabilized by additional interactions involving conserved sequences downstream of the splice donor site (26Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Google Scholar). While the role of the DIS is going to be clearly elucidated in RNA dimerization in vitro, there is growing evidence for a functional implication of this region in the context of viral infection. A recent report indicates that sequences proposed to be involved in forming a kissing loop complex facilitate HIV-I genomic RNA dimerization in vivo (33Haddrick M. Lear A.L. Cann A.J. Heaphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 58-68Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DIS hairpin was shown to be part of the packaging signal (34McBride S.M. Panganiban A.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2963-2973Google Scholar), thus confirming a preceding observation that a deletion in this region resulted in a 6-fold reduction of encapsidation (35Kim H.J. Lee K. O'Rear J.J. Virology. 1994; 198: 336-340Google Scholar). These observations agree with our own recent results that indicate that deletion of the DIS hairpin induces a moderate defect in encapsidation (36Paillart J.C. Berthoux L. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Virol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, this deletion also reduces the infectivity by 3 orders of magnitude. More unexpectedly, this is correlated with a strong inhibition of the proviral DNA synthesis. Thus, these findings indicate that the DIS probably represents a good target for antiviral therapy since it appears to be involved in both early and late events of virus infection. Noteworthy are the facts that the DIS is highly conserved among HIV-I isolates and only two self-complementary sequences are observed, GUGCAC and GCGCGC (37Myers G. Korber B. Wain-Hobson S. Smith R.F. Pavlakis G.N. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico1995: IA2-IA15Google Scholar). The dimerization mechanism that we proposed was also verified for the Lai strain, which displays the latter sequence (38Laughrea M. Jetté L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13464-13474Google Scholar, 39Muriaux D. Girard P.-M. Bonnet-Mathonière B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Google Scholar). Last but not least, one main advantage of using the DIS as a target is linked to its intrinsic function and its mode of action in initiating dimerization. Since the DIS primarily acts as a recognition site between two genomic RNA molecules, it has to be highly accessible in the viral RNA. In this study, we tested a set of different sense and antisense oligonucleotides, full RNA, full DNA, or mixed RNA/DNA, targeted against the DIS for the ability to interfere with dimerization of a viral RNA fragment in vitro. Comparison of their inhibitory effects and analyses of their intrinsic dimerization properties, the dynamics, and the stability of the interactions revealed important differences in the mechanism of interaction of sense and antisense molecules with the target RNA. The data support the potential application of both sense and antisense agents as therapeutic tools directed against HIV. Full RNA and mixed RNA/DNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and purified by Genset (Paris, France). DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems synthesizer. Oligonucleotides were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). RNA 1-615 from HIV-I Mal was prepared by T7 RNA polymerase transcription as described previously (25Marquet R. Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 23: 145-151Google Scholar). Internal labeling of RNA was achieved by adding [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) during transcription. In a typical experiment, labeled viral RNA was heated at 95°C for 2 min in water, cooled on ice, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in the dimerization buffer (50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2) (40Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.-L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2349-2357Google Scholar). The final RNA concentration was between 300 and 400 nM. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide were added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min. Alternatively, the competitor oligonucleotide was added prior to the heat denaturation step. Samples were analyzed on 1.1% agarose gel in TBM5 buffer (45 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, 5 mM MgOAc2). Electrophoresis was performed in the same buffer. Gels were fixed with 10% trichloro acetic acid and dried. The radioactivity was quantified on a BAS 2000 bioimager (Fuji Medical Systems USA). The fraction of RNA dimer (fD) was defined as the weight:weight ratio of the dimer to the total RNA species. For chase experiments, the same protocol was used except that the viral RNA was unlabeled, and the inhibitor oligonucleotide (added at a 1:1 molar ratio) was labeled. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (the same one for homologous displacement and a different one for heterologous displacement) were added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min. The final amount of bound, labeled oligonucleotide was measured as described above. For estimation of the dimerization efficiency of oligonucleotides, increasing concentrations of labeled oligonucleotides were subjected to the same dimerization protocol as above. The monomeric and dimeric species were fractionated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide, 0.27% bisacrylamide gel in TBM5 buffer. Quantification was assisted either by the Fuji or whole band analyzer (Bio Images) software. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined as described previously (32Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Google Scholar). The thermal stability of the complexes was estimated by the temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) technique devised by Riesner et al. (41Riesner D. Henco K. Steger G. Chrambach A. Dunn M.J. Radola B.J. Advances in Electrophoresis. Vol. 4. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1991: 169-250Google Scholar). The complex between unlabeled RNA 1-615 and the labeled oligonucleotide was formed according to the dimerization procedure described above. The sample (20 μl) was diluted to 100 μl with TBM5 buffer containing 45% glycerol and loaded on a 3.3% polyacrylamide, 0.08% bisacrylamide gel in TBM5 buffer, covalently bound to a gel-support film (Qiagen Inc., Germany). The gel was first run in a vertical position for 30 min at 4°C, thus allowing fractionation of bound and unbound species. After removing the upper glass plate, the gel was placed in a horizontal TGGE apparatus (Qiagen Inc.). The temperature gradient was established between 10-20 and 50-70°C. The equilibrium was reached after 10-15 min, and electrophoresis was allowed for 1-1.5 h at 300 V. Recently, we showed that dimerization of HIV-I RNA is essentially governed by a dynamic loop-loop interaction (32Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Google Scholar). Thus, it should be possible to interfere with RNA dimerization by using short oligonucleotides that compete with viral RNA for dimerization. Sense (S) and antisense (AS) oligonucleotides targeted against the 35-nucleotide stem-loop (nucleotides 260-295) or the 9-nucleotide loop of the DIS (nucleotides 272-280) were tested for their ability to inhibit dimerization (Fig. 1B). They are either full RNA (r), full DNA (d), or mixed DNA-stem/RNA-loop (dr). Besides these perfect sense or antisense oligonucleotides, “reinforced” stem-loops containing either a sense (rRS27) or an antisense loop (rRAS21) flanked by sequences designed to form a helix with a high stability were also tested. In contrast to the sense and antisense stem-loops, which can potentially form loop-loop and extended interactions, these constructs can form only loop-loop interactions. In a standard assay, 32P-labeled RNA 1-615 was allowed to dimerize, and the resulting dimer (70-80%) was incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled sense or antisense oligonucleotides for 15 min. The mixture was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the amount of RNA 1-615 dimer was quantified. Typical examples of gels are shown in Fig. 2A, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2, B and C, and Table I. The same results were obtained when incubation with the competitor oligonucleotides was for 30 min.Table I.Self-dimerization efficiency and inhibition of viral RNA dimerization of the different oligomersSequenceKdInhibition efficiencynMrS3516+++dS35>6000−drS350.5+++rRS273.5+++aDenotes a high efficiency at low competitor:viral RNA molar ratio (see text).rS9>6000+rSm9>4000−rAS35590++++dAS35>6000+drAS35ND++rRAS2154++rAS9>6000+++++dAS9>6000+a Denotes a high efficiency at low competitor:viral RNA molar ratio (see text). Open table in a new tab It was verified by using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides that oligonucleotides do inhibit dimerization by interacting with the monomer but not with the dimer (less than 0.1% in the case of rAS35) (Fig. 3). Remarkably, the results were not significantly changed whether the oligonucleotides were added before the formation of the dimer (prior to the denaturation step) or after dimerization has been allowed to occur (Fig. 3, results shown for rS35 and rAS35). These findings indicate that oligonucleotides can interfere with preformed RNA dimer, thus confirming our previous observation that dimerization is essentially governed by a reversible loop-loop interaction (32Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Google Scholar). The first unexpected result is that sense RNA hairpin (rS35) interferes efficiently with dimerization of RNA 1-615, whereas the full DNA oligonucleotide (dS35) does not show any inhibitory effect (Fig. 2B). However, the inhibitory effect is completely restored when the loop is made of RNA (drS35). Therefore, the chemical nature of the loop (RNA versus DNA), but not of the stem, is essential, and an RNA loop represents an absolute requisite to sense oligonucleotide interaction. On the other hand, the full DNA antisense hairpin (dAS35) is able to induce some inhibition but is much less efficient than the corresponding RNA antisense hairpin (rAS35) (Fig. 2C). The inhibitory effect is increased when the loop is RNA (drAS35), thus suggesting that as in the case of sense oligonucleotides, the nature of the loop is important although not absolutely required. Strikingly, dAS9 is less efficient, by far, in dimerization inhibition than rAS9 although both can potentially form nine base pairs with viral RNA. This behavior might reflect both a higher stability of the RNA-RNA hybrid compared with the RNA-DNA hybrid or/and specific requirements for the recognition of the intrinsic structure of the viral DIS loop. The second observation is that antisense oligonucleotides are more efficient than their sense homologues (Fig. 2C). An almost complete inhibition (10% residual dimerization) is reached at a 5:1 molar ratio with rS35, whereas it is reached at a 2:1 molar ratio when rAS35 is used. The effect is even more pronounced with the antisense 9-mer loop (rAS9), the most efficient inhibitor that provides a maximal inhibition at a 1:1 ratio. An opposite observation is made in the case of sense oligonucleotides; rS35 is much more efficient than rS9 although both oligonucleotides are assumed to form six base pairs with the viral DIS loop. These observations indicate that the interaction is strongly dependent on the loop context in the case of sense RNA, but not in the case of antisense oligonucleotides. Note that the inhibitory effect of rS9 is strongly reduced by a single mutation in the autocomplementary sequence (rSm9) that induces a C-A mismatch and decreases the stability of the interaction. The results obtained with sense- and antisense-reinforced hairpins (rRS27 and rRAS21) also provide interesting results on the relative contribution of the stem and loop elements. As expected from the loop-loop recognition mechanism, rRS27 is more efficient than rS9 and provides an inhibition similar to that of rS35. Indeed, the respective effects of rRS27 and rS35 are indistinguishable up to a 2-fold molar excess. However, no additional inhibition is observed over this value (Fig. 2B). The reason for this behavior is not well understood and might be related to the increased stability of rR27 as compared with rS35. On the other hand, rRAS21, which only keeps the antisense loop allowing nine potential base pairs, has a drastically reduced efficiency as compared to rAS9. Therefore, in contrast with the sense oligonucleotides, the interaction is not favored by the loop context in the case of antisense oligonucleotides. In addition, the fact that rRAS21 is less efficient than rAS35 suggests the involvement of the stem in the inhibition induced by the antisense hairpin. A possible cause of the different inhibitory effects of sense and antisense oligonucleotides is their capacity to dimerize on themselves. Indeed, both sense and antisense oligonucleotides can form a hairpin containing the GUGCAC autocomplementary sequence in the loop (Fig. 1). However, the 5′- and 3′-flanking nucleotides are different: AG and G, and U and CU for sense and antisense oligonucleotides, respectively. If the intrinsic structure of the loop provides determinant elements for the interaction, differences in homodimerization should be observed. Such differences might affect the inhibitory effect of the competitor oligonucleotides, since inhibition results from a competition between homo- and hetero-association. Therefore, an efficient self-association of the oligonucleotide is expected to reduce the amount of oligonucleotide available for interaction with viral RNA. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the different oligonucleotides was determined (Table I) and several observations can be made. (i) The full DNA hairpins (either sense or antisense) do not dimerize. (ii) The sense hairpin (rS35) has a Kd very similar to that of RNA 1-615 (21 nM), as expected from the reversible loop-loop mechanism of dimerization. This provides further evidence that the main dimerization element is contained in the 35-mer hairpin. The homodimerization of drS35 and rRS27 is even more efficient, possibly due to an increased stability of the stem. (iii) rAS35 dimerizes with a reduced efficiency as compared with rS35 and its hairpin analogues (drS35 and rRS27), consistent with the proposed inverse relationship between self-association and inhibitory effect. (iv) None of the 9-mer oligonucleotides (either sense or antisense) is able to form a stable duplex (involving six base pairs). However, only one provides a high inhibitory effect (rAS9), indicating that the inhibitory effect is governed not only by the preceding rule. (v) The reinforced antisense hairpin (rRAS21) displays contradictory properties. Its Kd is decreased by 10-fold as compared with rAS35, and its inhibitory effect is decreased, consistent with the rule stated previously. However, it dimerizes less efficiently than all sense hairpins (in particular rRS27) while its inhibitory effect is decreased as compared with these sense oligonucleotides. Therefore, the present observations only provide a partial explanation for the high efficiency of antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit viral RNA dimerization as compared with sense oligonucleotides, suggesting that sense and antisense oligonucleotides might inhibit dimerization by different mechanisms. To further analyze the different mechanisms by which sense and antisense oligonucleotides interfere with dimerization of viral RNA, we investigated the dynamics and the stability of heterodimers formed between RNA 1-615 and either rS35 or rAS35. First, we followed the displacement of bound, labeled oligonucleotides by different sense and antisense unlabeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 4). The sense 35-mer is equally displaced by its cold homologue and drS35, as expected from a simple competition mechanism. However, rS35 is more efficiently displaced by antisense oligonucleotides (rAS35, drAS35, and rAS9) (Fig. 4A). To the contrary, rAS35 cannot be displaced by its sense counterpart, and only a small fraction (0.1%) can be displaced by self-competition (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the fact that rAS9 can be displaced by rAS35 and by itself (Fig. 4B) suggests that rAS9 and rAS35 inhibit dimerization of viral RNA by distinct mechanisms. Our results indicate that the viral RNA dimer, the sense hairpin dimer, and the viral RNA-sense oligonucleotide heterodimer are in dynamic equilibrium through the DIS loop-loop interaction, consistent with a competitive inhibition mechanism. To the opposite, inhibition by the antisense hairpin is not simply competitive. One possible explanation is that rAS35 is able to form an extended duplex covering 35 base pairs, whereas the sense analogue only forms the reversible 6-base pair loop-loop interaction. Such an extended duplex is expected to be very stable and difficult to displace. It was interesting to study the binding of drAS35, which showed an intermediate inhibitory effect (Table I). It turns out that about 40% of the bound drAS35 can be displaced by itself or by rAS35 (Fig. 4B). Thus, a likely explanation is that drAS35 forms the two types of heterodimers (extended and loop-loop complex). This view is supported by the observation that rS35, which can only displace the dynamic loop-loop complex, is able to displace the same exchangeable fraction of the bound drAS35 (Fig. 4B). In addition, drAS35 is as efficient as rAS35 in displacing rS35 (Fig. 4A). Intermolecular loop-loop and extended interactions should be easily discriminated by their thermal stability. Therefore, we used TGGE to compare the stability of the heterodimers between RNA 1-615 and labeled sense and antisense RNA oligonucleotides. The gels are shown in Fig. 5. Bound rS35 starts to dissociate from RNA 1-615 around 25°C and is completely dissociated around 35°C (Fig. 4A). The melting pattern is similar to that observed for RNA 1-615 homodimer (result not shown). Note that the melting values obtained by this method are lower than values obtained by the standard melting procedure, which consists of gradually increasing the temperature of the RNA solution and analyzing aliquots on cold agarose gel (25Marquet R. Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 23: 145-151Google Scholar). This is not really surprising due to the very different experimental conditions. To the contrary, no melting is observed with rAS35 up to 50°C (Fig. 5B), thus confirming the hypothesis that rAS35 is able to form extended interactions. Interestingly, the dissociation profile of rAS9 is the same as that of rS35 (result not shown), indicating that the high stability of the rAS35-viral RNA heterodimer does result from the formation of an extended duplex and not only from base pairing between the complementary loops. The complete annealing of rAS35 to viral RNA was further confirmed by RNase footprinting. 2E. Skripkin, unpublished results. Our results demonstrate that sense and antisense oligonucleotides inhibit in vitro dimerization of viral RNA by different mechanisms and allow definition of several efficient inhibitors. (i) The sense hairpin acts as a reversible competitive inhibitor involving the same loop-loop interaction that controls the dimerization initiation of the viral RNA (32Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Google Scholar). The interaction is essentially governed by the intrinsic structure of the loop and its chemical nature (RNA versus DNA), whereas the sequence of the stem or its chemical nature is not important. (ii) The mechanism by which the antisense stem-loop inhibits dimerization is different and accounts for its increased efficiency. The antisense stem-loop is able to form a complete annealed duplex. Once formed, this complex is extremely stable and almost irreversible. It therefore acts as a suicide inhibitor. The mechanism probably first involves a recognition step mediated by a loop-loop kissing interaction followed by propagation of the intermolecular base pairing, as already described for natural antisense RNAs (28Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Google Scholar, 29Simons R.W. Crooke S.T. Lebleu B. Research and Application. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 97-124Google Scholar, 30Takayama K.M. Inouye M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 155-184Google Scholar, 31Wagner E.G.H. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Google Scholar). This loop-loop interaction is also sensitive to the chemical nature of the antisense loop although to a lower degree than the sense loop. Evidence for this sense-antisense loop-loop interaction is provided by rRAS21, which can form the loop-loop complex but not the extended interactions. (iii) The short antisense RNA complementary to the loop (rAS9) is the most efficient inhibitor. It interacts directly with the loop structure in a reversible manner, independent from the standard loop-loop interaction. It is also sensitive to the nature of the sugar-phosphate backbone. In addition, this study stresses interesting particularities that differentiate the different types of complexes: sense-sense, antisense-antisense, and sense-antisense hairpins. It turns out that homodimerization does not simply depend on the autocomplementary sequence in the 9-nucleotide loop. The presence of the three purines at positions 1, 2, and 9 in the sense hairpin facilitates “kissing,” either by providing a specific loop conformation and/or by stabilizing the loop-loop complex. Such a favorable context is not provided when positions 1, 8, and 9 are occupied by pyrimidine residues (antisense hairpins). This is illustrated by the case of rRAS21. This oligonucleotide, which displays the antisense loop, is less efficient in both homodimerization (antisense-antisense) and heterodimerization (sense-antisense) than its analogues with a sense loop. Therefore, the nucleotides flanking the self-complementary sequence are essential determinants in the loop-loop interaction. This result is consistent with a recent study conducted on model RNA hairpins, which showed that the stability of loop-loop complexes is not only governed by complementarity between the loops but is modulated by the sequence and structure of the loops (42Eguchi Y. Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 831-842Google Scholar, 43Gregorian Jr., R.S. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 968-984Google Scholar). Our results also show that further propagation of intermolecular pairing requires a complete complementarity between the loops, a condition which is provided by the use of antisense hairpins. The mechanism of annealing of the antisense hairpin slightly differs from the hybridization mechanism of naturally occurring antisense RNAs. In the latter case, a first step is the formation of a transient and reversible interaction between complementary loops (kissing) and propagation of annealing by pairing of the free 5′-end of the antisense RNA to a single-stranded region of the sense RNA. This holds true for pairing of RNA I to RNA II (44Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Google Scholar), RNAIN to RNAOUT (45Kittle J.D. Simons R.W. Lee J. Kleckner N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 561-572Google Scholar), and CopA to CopT (46Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3767-3775Google Scholar). In contrast, the transient interaction and the extension of the extended duplex will initiate at the same site (the hairpin loop) in the case of the interaction between the viral DIS and the antisense hairpin. The mechanism by which both strands wind around each other from the central region remains unknown. A similar mechanism was proposed for an antisense RNA targeted against the first coding exons of the viral genes tat and rev (47Homann M. Rittner K. Sczakiel G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 7-15Google Scholar) in which a large 10-nucleotide loop was shown to play a crucial role in the hybridization process. The present study shows that it is possible to inhibit dimerization of viral RNA in vitro by sense and antisense oligonucleotides targeted against the DIS, thus offering possible tools to block dimerization of genomic RNA in vivo. One advantage of this system over the standard antisense hybridization mechanism is the fact that the sense and antisense oligonucleotides share a similar mechanism of loop-loop recognition with the viral DIS. This property is expected to increase the efficiency of these molecules as compared with antisense oligonucleotides targeted against other viral RNA sites. Furthermore, the DIS is most likely accessible in the viral RNA, as expected from its proper recognition function. Antisense oligonucleotides appear as the most promising tools. The 9-mer, although being the most efficient inhibitor in vitro, is probably too short to provide specific inhibition in vivo. The 35-mer hairpin probably fulfills the specificity requirement and is promising due to its annealing properties. Furthermore, the mixed hairpin (drAS35) displays the additional advantage of providing DNA/RNA hybrid sites for RNase H cleavage. However, one limit of the antisense approach is imposed by the stoichiometric nature of the inhibition, with the exception of the mixed antisense hairpin that is potentially recycled after RNase H cleavage of the viral RNA. On the other hand, the dynamic and reversible nature of the sense inhibition may be utilized to design sense agents with a catalytic activity. A last consideration to be taken into account is a possible role of the nucleocapsid protein in the dimerization process. While free viral RNA is unable to spontaneously form an extended duplex resulting from the annealing of the stems of the DIS (32Paillart J.-C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Google Scholar), the nucleocapsid protein might be able to promote the formation of such an extended duplex, as suggested by Laughrea and Jetté (48Laughrea M. Jetté L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1589-1598Google Scholar). If true, this should not limit the activity of these sense and antisense agents, but more likely facilitates their action. Indeed, nucleocapsid protein was shown to facilitate ribozyme catalysis by enhancing both ribozyme binding to a rather long substrate and product release (49Bertrand E.L. Rossi J.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2904-2912Google Scholar). Therefore, sense and antisense oligonucleotides targeted against the viral DIS and their possible modified or conjugated derivatives may prove to be useful tools in developing antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W1968333833,"Interferon-α (IFN-α)-mediated intracellular signaling is initiated by ligand-induced receptor dimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tyk2 and Jak1 tyrosine kinases, and subsequent phosphorylation of the Stat1 and Stat2 proteins. The IFN-α receptor consists of at least two distinct subunits. One subunit, IFNAR1, has low affinity binding for interferon yet is required for signal transduction. We introduced mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of human IFNAR1 in order to identify residues involved in the mediation of biological responses. We took advantage of the species specificity of the interferon receptors by analyzing human IFN-α-induced major histocompatibility complex class I antigen expression in mouse L929 cells stably transfected with mutant human receptors. The membrane proximal 60-amino acids were insufficient to signal a biological response even though within these residues Tyk2 and Stat2 binding sites have been identified. IFN-α-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was not critical for signaling because mutation of Tyr residues to Phe did not prevent the biological response to IFN-α. The deletion of a 16-amino acid region highly homologous between species created a receptor which signals an enhanced response. Tyrosine dephosphorylation is a component of this enhanced response as mutation of the Tyr residues within this region to Phe resulted in a receptor with increased sensitivity to IFN. The known signaling molecules that interact with IFNAR1 are positive regulators of IFN-α function. The presence of this domain in the COOH-terminal region suggests that the receptor may interact with signaling molecules that negatively regulate interferon responses."

To determine the role of various PKC isozymes in the regulation of PLD-mediated phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) hydrolysis, MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells overexpressing the α- and θ-isoforms, and R6 rat fibroblasts overexpressing the α-, βI-, and ϵ-isoforms were used. In the vector control MCF-7 cells, which contain low levels of PKC-α, PMA (100 nM) had only small effects on the hydrolysis of PtdEtn (1.1-1.35-fold) and PtdCho (1.15-1.6-fold). Stable expression of PKC-α in MCF-7 cells, which was accompanied by increased levels of the βI- and θ-isoforms as well, greatly enhanced both PMA-induced PLD-mediated formation of phosphatidylethanol (∼5-fold) and the hydrolysis of PtdEtn (2.5-2.9-fold) and PtdCho (5.5-7.2-fold). The effects of PMA on the hydrolysis of PtdEtn (and PtdCho) in MCF-7/PKC-α cells were significantly inhibited by 0.5-3 μM concentrations of Gö 6976, a selective inhibitor of the conventional PKC subfamily. Stable expression of PKC-α in R6 fibroblasts enhanced, at a shorter (10 min) incubation time, the effects of PMA on the hydrolysis of both PtdEtn and, to a lesser extent, PtdCho. In contrast, stable expression of PKC-βI in R6 fibroblasts, which originally did not contain this enzyme, enhanced the effects of PMA only on PtdCho, but not PtdEtn, hydrolysis. Overexpression of either PKC-θ in MCF-7 cells or PKC-ϵ in R6 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts had no detectable effects on PMA-induced hydrolysis of PtdEtn. Collectively, the results suggest that PKC-α has a major role in the mediation of phorbol ester action on PtdEtn hydrolysis, while PtdCho hydrolysis may be regulated by both the α and βI isoforms.

This sequence also acts as a stop-transfer signal and anchors the protein to the membrane so that the catalytic domain of the protein is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The sequence immediately following the N-terminal domain, which links it to the cytoplasmic domain, may play an important role in the generation of a functional P450 by initiating the folding of the protein during synthesis at the interface of the membrane and cytoplasm. In addition, P450 must interact with its redox partner, P450 reductase, which is also an integral membrane protein, and with hydrophobic substrates possibly entering the protein from the membrane (7Graham-Lorence S. Amarneh B. White R.E. Peterson J.A. Simpson E.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1065-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A linker region may be required to allow the catalytic domain to achieve its proper orientation in the membrane for these interactions.

These data indicated that the mutant proteins did not fold to form a functional P450 and supported the conclusion that this region was important for the folding of the protein or the incorporation of the heme moiety. To examine the role of the Pro-rich region further, each of the Pro residues in this region was replaced with either Ala, Gly, Val, or an acidic residue, and the activities of the mutants were determined.

The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the KpnI-ApaI segment. COS-1 cells were cultured and transfected with plasmid DNA as described (15Straub P. Lloyd M. Johnson E.F. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21997-22003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laurate hydroxylase activity was assayed in whole cell lysates of transfected COS-1 cells, and lauric acid metabolites were separated by high performance liquid chromatography as described (15Straub P. Lloyd M. Johnson E.F. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21997-22003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the reaction was incubated for 30 min. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were incubated for 4 h with 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label in Met- and Cys-free minimal essential medium. Cells were lysed, and radioactive proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (15Straub P. Lloyd M. Johnson E.F. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21997-22003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Pro-rich region of P450 2C2 contains five Pro residues in the sequence from amino acids 30-37 (Fig. 1). In order to examine the functional importance of the Pro residues in this region, each Pro was replaced with Ala, Gly, Val, and either Asp or Glu depending on the third base of the codon in the cDNA sequence. The four amino acid residues were chosen for the following reasons. Ala has a small side chain and is uncharged, properties that make it a “neutral” substitution in mutagenesis; Gly, like Pro, is often present in turns rather than α-helical structures but results in less stable structures; Val is a small hydrophobic amino acid with a tertiary β-carbon, which decreases the flexibility of the peptide backbone; and Asp and Glu are charged amino acids that dramatically change the hydrophobicity of the side chain. Each of the mutants was transfected into COS-1 cells, and lauric acid hydroxylase activity in cell lysates was determined. Any of the mutations could alter activity of the P450 expressed in COS-1 cells by affecting the rate of synthesis or degradation of the protein. To examine the levels of the proteins expressed in the COS-1 cells, transfected cells were labeled for 4 h with Tran35S-label, and P450 2C2 and the mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In mock transfected cells, only a weak band comigrating with P450 was detected, and a second protein migrating more rapidly was present, which served as a useful internal control for labeling and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2). Since the half-life of the P450 expressed in COS-1 cells is less than 1 h (15Straub P. Lloyd M. Johnson E.F. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21997-22003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), labeling the cells for 4 h provides a reasonable measure of the steady-state levels of the protein. Differences of only 2-fold or less in the amount of radioactive protein immunoprecipitated for any of the mutants and wild-type P450 2C2 were detected in 2 or 3 independent experiments. Therefore, the changes in activity of the mutant P450s cannot be explained by different levels of protein expressed in COS-1 cells. While these experiments detect P450 apoprotein, it is possible that the folding, heme incorporation, or stability of functional forms of the protein might be affected by the mutations. Attempts to express the P30A mutant, which has decreased activity in COS-1 cells, in E. coli in order to distinguish among these possibilities have been unsuccessful using conditions that allow expression of wild-type P450 2C2 and other P450 2C2 mutants that appear to have reduced stability. 2B. Doray, C. Chen, and B. Kemper, unpublished data. Within the highly conserved PPGP sequence, the effects of the mutations at Pro30 and Pro33 on lauric acid hydroxylase activity were similar and were remarkably different from effects of mutations at Pro31 (Fig. 3). At Pro30, no activity was detected with Gly, Val, or Asp substitutions, and less than 10% activity compared with wild type was detected with these substitutions at Pro33. Ala substitutions at these two positions were tolerated slightly better with 25-30% activity of wild type. These results indicate that the structural requirements for Pro at these positions are very stringent since the Gly substitution, which should be tolerated if only a turn structure is required, reduced activity. In striking contrast, all of the substitutions at Pro31 were well tolerated including the acidic residue, Asp, with a relatively large charged side chain, suggesting that the side chains at this position are on the surface and pointing toward the aqueous environment. In contrast, the side chains of positions 30 and 33 may be involved in packing of the PPGP peptide against another peptide structure. Substitutions at Pro35 and Pro37 exhibited a third pattern, with Ala, Gly, or Val mutations being well tolerated and Asp or Glu mutations reducing activity to 15% or undetectable for Pro35 and Pro37, respectively. The reduced activity with charged substitutions, but not with uncharged substitutions, suggests that these Pro residues are in a relatively hydrophobic environment, very likely buried inside the molecule. Alternatively, the size of Glu may sterically alter the structure, but this would also suggest that the side chain is packed against other parts of the protein structure. The effects of substitutions at Pro30, Pro31, and Pro33 suggest that a PXXP motif is important in the structure-function relationship of P450 2C2. If the PXXP motif itself is important for activity, then re-creating a PXXP motif in the proteins with mutations at Pro30 or Pro33 might restore activity. To accomplish this, a double mutant, P30A/T34P was constructed in which Pro at positions 31 and 34 provide a PXXP motif (Fig. 1). The activity of this double mutant, however, was similar to the P30A mutation alone so that activity was not restored by the second mutation (Fig. 4). This result might be explained either by the fact that the position of the PXXP was moved one residue relative to its flanking regions or by some restrictions on the amino acids between or immediately flanking the two Pro residues. In order to determine whether the position of the PXXP motif was critical, Ala was inserted on either the N- or C-terminal sides of the PXXP motif (Fig. 1). Insertion of an Ala between residues 29 and 30 on the N-terminal side of the PXXP only slightly reduced activity to about 75% of wild type (Fig. 4). On the other hand, insertions of Ala between residues 33 and 34 or 37 and 38 reduced activity to less than 25% of the activity of wild type, similar to the Ala substitutions at Pro30 and Pro33. These results suggest that the position of the PXXP motif relative to flanking sequence on the C-terminal side is important for the formation of functional P450 2C2, while the position relative to N-terminal sequences is not. The sequence PPGP is present in P450s of widely divergent organisms, ranging from plants to mammals as shown in the alignment of selected sequences in Table I. PPGP is completely conserved in family 2 P450s, and PPGP, or a variant PXXP, is present in most other mammalian P450s (Table II). Another variant, I/LPGP, is also commonly present, particularly in P450s 1A2, 3A, and 19. To examine whether Ile or Leu can substitute for the first Pro in the PPGP motif, mutants P30I and P30L were constructed. Replacing Pro30 with either Ile or Leu resulted in less than 10% activity of wild type (Fig. 4). Similarly an Leu mutation at this position in human P450 21A2 resulted in activity about 30% of normal for progesterone hydroxylation and represents a potential nonclassical steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency allele (10Tusie-Luna M.-T. Speiser P.W. Dumic M. New M.I. White P.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the first Pro in the PXXP motif of P450s cannot be replaced by amino acids present at this position in other P450s without substantial loss of activity and provide further evidence that Pro30 is important for formation of a fully functional P450 2C2. If the PXXP motif packs against other peptide segments of the P450, then the requirement for Pro at position 30 may be altered by different sequences in the interacting regions of those P450s with Ile or Leu at the first Pro position.Table IPPGP motif in P450s of various speciesSpeciesP450SequenceRabbit2C2QSHGGGKLPPGPTPFPILGNHuman1A1QVPKGLKNPPGPWGWPLIGHMonkey2C20QSSGRRKLPPGPTPLPIIGNGuinea pig1A1QVPKGLKSPPGPWGWPLIGHRat2E1QIYNSWNLPPGPFPLPILGNMouse2F2SSRGKGQLPPGPKPLPILGNHamster2A8QRRLLRKMPPGPTPLPFIGNDog2B11HPKAYGHLPPGPRPLPILGNBovine2D14RSRWAPRYPPGPTPLPVLGNChicken2H1STSQRGKEPPGPTPIPIIGNTrout2K1SSEEQGKEPPGPRPLPLLGNCaenorhabditis elegansCEL10E1LYWKRRNLPPGPIPLPFMGNEggplant77A1PKSKTPNLPPGPPGWPIVGNArabidopsisT14112LKPSKWKLPPGPKKLPIIGN Open table in a new tab Table IIFrequency of occurrence of the Pro-rich sequence in mammalian P450s from different familiesSequenceFamilyTotal2OtherPPGP751489PXXP03131I/LPGP02626XPXP055XXXX077Total7583158 Open table in a new tab Mutations of the Pro residues in the Pro-rich region of P450 2C2 indicate that these residues can be divided into two structural regions, the highly conserved PPGP sequence and the more C-terminal Pro35 and Pro37. The latter Pro tolerated uncharged amino acid substitutions, but not charged substitutions, which is consistent with their location in a hydrophobic environment within the folded protein. In contrast, the PPGP sequence appears to be exposed on the surface of the protein or as a linker between the membrane anchor and catalytic domain since the second Pro could be replaced by both hydrophobic and charged amino acids without loss of activity. The presence of Pro and Gly residues in this sequence suggests a loop or turn structure for this region, which might be required for the proper orientation of the catalytic cytoplasmic domain relative to the membrane anchor. However, while PG is a common sequence at positions 2 and 3 of a type II β-turn, Pro at position 4, as in PPGP, is very rare (16Wilmot C.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inactivity of mutants with Gly substitutions at positions 30 and 33 indicates that the function of the Pro is not simply to allow a bend and that either increased stability produced by a Pro or a structure different from a turn is required. The decreased activity of all the mutants with substititions at the Pro30 and Pro33 positions suggests that a PXXP motif is critical for formation of a functional P450 2C2. The presence of PPGP in P450s of widely divergent organisms and the conservation of a PXXP motif in many others (Table I, Table II) provide further evidence that this motif plays an important role in many P450s. A common functional role associated with a PXXP motif has been protein-protein interactions. A PX2PXGX3PP motif was found in the N-terminal domain of the vesicle-associated membrane protein/synaptobrevin, which is involved in vesicle docking and/or membrane fusion processes through protein-protein interaction (17Cornille F. Deloye F. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B.P. Poulain B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16826-16832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A novel protein binding module, the WW domain, which has a role in mediating protein-protein interactions via Pro-rich sequences containing PXXP motifs, has been characterized (18Sudol M. Chen H. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Interactions of Src homology 3 (SH3) domains with Pro-rich sequences play important roles in many intracellular signaling pathways (19Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J. Thiel G. Balimore D. Science. 1992; 257: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 20Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). A Pro-rich sequence was found in the prolactin receptor that mediated association of this protein to Jak2 kinase (21Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of a PPXP sequence in an interleukin-5 receptor showed that signal transduction mediated by this receptor required the first and last Pro, but not the second (22Kouro T. Kikuchi Y. Kanazawa H. Hirokawa K. Harada N. Shiiba M. Wakao H. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), exactly the requirements of the P450 2C2 PPGP sequence for activity. Interactions of a synthetic Pro-rich polypeptide, containing a PPXP sequence, with SH3 ligands were critically dependent on the two end position Pro. In addition, flanking sequences outside of the Pro-rich core increased binding affinity and specificity (23Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickels R. Schreiber S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The distance of the PXXP motif from these flanking amino acids was fixed so that PXXP motifs incorrectly spaced did not mediate high affinity binding. Similarly, in the present study, insertion of Ala to the C-terminal side of the PPGP sequence resulted in reduced activity suggesting that the position of the PXXP motif relative to a flanking sequence on the C-terminal side was important for its function. The requirements for a PXXP motif are consistent with a helical structure for this sequence with three amino acids/helical turn as is present in right-handed 310 or left-handed PPII helices (24Adzhubei A.A. Sternberg J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The 310 helix is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between residues 1 and 4, which is prevented if these two residues are Pro as in PPGP (25Donohue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1953; 39: 470-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the structures of Pro-rich polypetides, with PPXP sequences, complexed with SH3 domains have been shown to be PPII helices (26Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and a PPII helical structure is present in the HIV viral protein Nef before interaction with a SH3 domain (27Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.-S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Winfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, if the PXXP requirement reflects a helical structure for PPGP in P450 2C2, it is likely a left-handed PPII helix as illustrated in Fig. 5. Most of the PPII helices are a maximum of four residues, and this structure is compatible with immediate transitions to α-helical or β-sheet structures at either end (24Adzhubei A.A. Sternberg J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). If PPGP assumes this structure, the side chains of Pro30 and Pro33 would point in the same direction and that of Pro31 would point 120° in the opposite direction (Fig. 5). The effects of the mutations indicate that the Pro31 helix face would be exposed to the aqueous environment while the Pro30 and Pro33 face would interact with or pack against other peptide structures (Fig. 5). The functional significance of a PXXP requirement is not clear but could involve intra or interprotein interactions that are important for folding of newly synthesized P450, for heme incorporation, or for stability or catalytic activity of the folded protein. Mutations at the first or last Pro positions in the PPGP motif of P450 2C11 either alone or in combination with mutations at other Pro positions in the Pro-rich region resulted in mutant proteins that were expressed in yeast but were inactive (13Yamazaki S. Sato K. Suhara K. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). None of the proteins exhibited the characteristic reduced CO difference spectrum at 420 or 450 nm of the P450 hemoprotein, indicating that heme was not incorporated into the protein, and it was concluded that these Pro residues were important in folding of the molecule. Further support for malfolding was the observation that the inactive proteins segregated to a separate ER compartment compared to wild-type P450 when expressed in COS-7 cells (28Ishihara N. Yamashina S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our inability to express the P30A mutation in E. coli is also consistent with a defect in folding of the mutant protein. Since PXXP motifs are known to participate in high affinity protein-protein interactions, the PXXP motif may form a stable interaction with another segment in the nascent P450 polypeptide chain, or another protein, which is required for the folding of the rest of the protein as it is synthesized. In P450s without the PXXP motif, secondary mutations in the target sequence may result in a stable interaction, or other stabilizing interactions may substitute for the PXXP interaction. Although the evidence favors a role for the PPGP region in folding or assembly of P450, the critical evidence that the mutated proteins are not expressed in a hemoprotein form in yeast is not conclusive since folding and assembly in the environment of the yeast cell may be different from that in the mammalian cell. Alternatively, the PXXP requirement could reflect the necessity of this sequence to pack against the P450 molecule, and mutations might affect the stability or local conformation of the folded protein. For example, according to the alignment by Hasemann et al. (8Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 2: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (624) Google Scholar), the PXXP motif is located adjacent to the A′α-helix that contains amino acids that are part of a postulated site for the initial interaction of the protein with its substrate (29Tsujita M. Ichikawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol.

Alteration of the PXXP motif could indirectly alter the position of the A′α-helix and affect substrate interaction. Additional experiments will be needed to distinguish definitively among the possible effects of these mutations."

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1450-1454Google Scholar), it stood to reason that a pituitary-specific Pit-1/Pit-1β heterodimer might serve as such a repressor. The 26-aa β-domain has been conserved across the vertebrate lineage (5Theill L.E. Hattori K. Domenico D. Castrillo J.-L. Karin M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2261-2269Google Scholar, 11Konzak K.E. Moore D.D.

DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 651-660Google Scholar) (Table I., Table II.). The N-terminal 12 amino acids of the β-domain have been especially well conserved among mammals, avians (92%), and teleost fish (67%), whereas the C-terminal 14 amino acids, also found in Pit-1T, a thyrotroph-specific splice variant of Pit-1 (23Haugen B.R. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20818-20824Google Scholar), have been poorly conserved. This conservation of structure raises the possibility of conservation of function, such that the amino acid sequence of the β-domain, and not the resultant altered spacing of the TAD generated by the inserted β-domain, confers upon the Pit-1β isoform its unique properties. Thus, the β-domain would not simply disrupt a pre-existing structure but rather would encode an intrinsic functional motif.Table I.β-Domains from distinct speciesPositionaRefers to aa position within the β-domain.RatHumanTurkeySalmon1Val*bAsterisk denotes aa identity with rat.**2Pro***3Ser***4Ile*ValGly5Leu***6Ser***7Leu***8Ile**Leu9Gln***10Thr**Ser11Pro**Ser12Lys***13Cys**Arg14Leu*SerSer15HisCys**16Thr*LeuMet17TyrHisHisHis18Phe**Leu19Ser*Ala*20MetVal*Thr21Thr*MetSer22Thr***23MetLeuSerLeu24Gly***25Asn***26Thr*ValGlya Refers to aa position within the β-domain.b Asterisk denotes aa identity with rat.

Open table in a new tab To investigate this question, we constructed five mutant Pit-1 expression vectors that contain distinct 26 amino acid substitutions for the β-domain at position 48 of the TAD. We found that each of these substitution mutations, which preserve the location and 26-aa spacing of the wild-type β-domain, abrogated all of the unique properties of the Pit-1β isoform. Specifically, the Pit-1β-mediated repression of basal and Ras-stimulated rPRL promoter activity, Pit-1β's inability to interact functionally with Ets-1, and the Pit-1β-mediated enhancement of the PKA effect are all lost with each of the β-domain mutations. We also tested the hypothesis that Pit-1 and Pit-1β can combine to repress basal rPRL promoter activity and, surprisingly, found that their transactivation properties were synergistic. These studies allow us to conclude that the wild-type amino acid sequence of the β-domain is required for manifestation of the unique properties of Pit-1β, through a β-domain-specific functional interaction with a cell type-specific target distinct from Pit-1.

The medium was changed 16-18 h before each transfection. Cells used for transfections were harvested at approximately 60-80% confluency using 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA. The rat prolactin and growth hormone (25Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286Google Scholar) promoter luciferase expression vectors, pA3PRLluc and pA3GHluc, contain the firefly luciferase coding region under the control of a 498-base pair fragment (−425 to +73) of the rPRL promoter and a 593-base pair fragment (−528 to +65) of the rat GH promoter, respectively. These fragments were subcloned downstream of three polyadenylation termination sites in pA3luc (26Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280Google Scholar).

Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Google Scholar) under the control of the SV40 early promoter. Plasmids pRSV-Pit-1 and pRSV-Pit-1β were generously provided by Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego) and contain the coding regions for Pit-1 and Pit-1β (6Theill L.E. Castrillo J.L. Wu D. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 342: 945-948Google Scholar, 29Rajnarayan S. Chiono M. Alexander L.M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 9: 502-512Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs were prepared by CsCl centrifugation or by Qiagen (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) columns and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm or fluorimetry and comparison with DNA standards on agarose gels (29Rajnarayan S. Chiono M. Alexander L.M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 9: 502-512Google Scholar). The vectors pRSV-HA Pit-1 and pRSV-HA Pit-1β, which encode HA-tagged versions of Pit-1 and Pit-1β, and the vectors pRSV-HA Pit-1-BPV, pRSV-HA Pit-1-AU5, pRSV-HA Pit-1-FLAG, pRSV-HA Pit-1-INV, and pRSV-HA Pit-1-MYC, which encode HA-tagged Pit-1βs with different substitution mutations of the 26-amino acid β-domain, were constructed as follows. All constructs required polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis of the Pit-1 TAD, and in order to minimize the target sequence to be submitted to polymerase chain reaction amplification, a HindIII-PpuMI fragment encompassing nucleotides 1-456 of Pit-1 or 1-534 of Pit-1β was subcloned into a derivatized pGem-7Z (Promega) plasmid DNA whose SacI site had been converted to a PpuMI site (pGem7P). The resulting Pit-1 plasmids were used as substrates for polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (30Jarvis T. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3135-3145Google Scholar), in which the 26-aa β-domain was substituted with six different sequences (see Table III), and an epitope tag derived from influenza HA was added at the amino terminus of all of the Pit-1 constructs. All constructs were amplified with common 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides, while the Pit-1β substitution mutations were generated by nested polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (31Deminie C.A. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6499-6506Google Scholar) using specific mutagenic oligonucleotides that encoded the nucleotide substitutions in the β-domain.

Open table in a new tab The presence of each introduced mutation was tested by digestion with restriction enzymes. Substitution mutations of the β-domains and integrity of the TAD regions were verified by Sanger sequencing using reagents and protocols obtained from a commercial kit (Sequenase; U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and commercially available T7 and SP6 promoter-specific primers (Promega, Madison, WI). Sequencing was done both in the laboratory and through the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Cancer Center Core Facility. HA-tagged Pit-1 TAD sequences were excised from pGem-7P by digestion with HindIII and PpuMI and ligated to the unique HindIII and PpuMI sites of pRSV-Pit-1 to produce pRSV-HA Pit-1, pRSV-HA Pit-1β, pRSV-HA Pit-1-BPV, pRSV-HA Pit-1-AU5, pRSV-HA Pit-1-FLAG, pRSV-HA Pit-1-INV, and pRSV-HA Pit-1-MYC. DNA was introduced into HeLa or GH4 cells by electroporation as follows. Approximately 2-3 × 106 enzymatically dispersed cells were mixed with plasmid DNA in a sterile gene-pulse chamber and exposed to a controlled electrical field of 500 microfarads at 220 V, as described previously (32Keech C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 832-839Google Scholar). Cells from individual transfections were then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C. The nonspecific effects of the RSV promoter upon transcription factor availability was controlled for by including amounts of pRSV β-globin plasmid DNA in all assays to render the total pRSV DNA concentration constant. Transient transfections were performed in triplicate, in at least two separate experiments. After incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mM EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1 mM dithiothreitol. Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing and by vortexing for 1 min between thaws. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C, and the supernatant was used for subsequent assays. Luciferase activity in the supernatant was assayed as described previously (25Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286Google Scholar). Samples were measured in duplicate using a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Total luciferase units were normalized to total protein present in extract supernatants. Protein assays were performed according to the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using commercially available reagents (Bio-Rad). Transient transfections were performed in duplicate. After a 24-h incubation, HeLa cells transfected with plasmid DNAs were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mM EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in triethanolamine-SDS solubilization buffer (55 mM triethanolamine, 111 mM NaCl, 2.2 mM EDTA, and 0.44% SDS) (34Ottaviano Y. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 624-632Google Scholar) and a mix of protein inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, chymostatin, aprotinin, antipain, and bestatin, each at 6 ng/ml) at 4°C. Lysed extracts were passed through a 25-gauge needle seven times. The protein content of each extract was assayed according to the method of Lowry (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar), using commercially available reagents (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts (100 μg) of protein from each extract were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The HA-tagged Pit-1 proteins were visualized with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody (BAbCO, Richmond, CA), secondary sheep anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Life Sciences), and ECL media (Amersham Life Sciences). Dilutions of 1:1,000 of the primary anti-HA monoclonal antibody and of 1:10,000 of the secondary rabbit anti-mouse antibody preparation were used. In order to determine whether the wild-type amino acid sequence of the β-domain is required for its unique properties, we constructed five mutant Pit-1βs that contain different 26-aa substitutions for the β-domain at position 48 of the TAD. Thus, each mutant β-domain is of the same size and in the same position as the wild-type β-domain. Table III details the amino acid sequences of the mutant β-domains and the origins of the mutant sequences. Specifically, we chose residues derived from proteins with no known ability to modulate transcription and a short epitope tag as replacements for the wild-type β-domain. These mutant constructs, together with wild-type Pit-1 and the Pit-1β isoform, were each tagged with the HA epitope on the amino terminus, such that all expressed proteins would contain the same epitope in the same relative position in order to allow for their detection regardless of alterations of protein structure by the β-domain substitutions. It has been previously shown that wild-type pRSV Pit-1 and pRSV Pit-1β express protein to different levels in transient transfection experiments and that the transcription potency of these two isoforms must be normalized to their levels of expression (11Konzak K.E. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 241-247Google Scholar). The mutant Pit-1 proteins presented here might be expressed to levels different from either the wild-type Pit-1 or Pit-1β. In order to exclude the effect of differences in protein expression level on transcription potency, we carried out a series of transfection experiments to find levels of input DNA that would yield similar levels of protein expression from the wild-type and mutant Pit-1 vectors. In a preliminary experiment, 10 μg of each of the pRSV-HA Pit-1 constructs were introduced into HeLa nonpituitary cells by electroporation. Extracts from transfected cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was used to determine the level of Pit-1 protein expression (data not shown). HA Pit-1β was expressed at lower levels than was HA Pit-1, HA Pit-1-FLAG was expressed at a level similar to HA Pit-1, and the other HA Pit-1 constructs were expressed at higher levels than was HA Pit-1. In order to find DNA doses that roughly equalized the levels of Pit-1 expression for each of the constructs, varying amounts of each of the pRSV-HA Pit-1 constructs were introduced into HeLa nonpituitary cells by electroporation in a series of experiments. Having determined the optimal amounts of plasmid DNA for each construct, as described above, we show in Fig. 2 that similar levels of Pit-1 protein expression can be achieved with these plasmid DNA doses. The plasmid amounts transfected were as follows: 10 μg of HA Pit-1, 30 μg of HA Pit-1β, 5 μg of HA Pit-1-BPV, 2 μg of HA Pit-1-AU5, 10 μg of HA Pit-1-FLAG, 5 μg of HA Pit-1-INV, and 5 μg of HA Pit-1-MYC. Equal amounts (100 μg) of total protein from cell lysates of duplicate transfections were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, except that lanes 17 and 18 were loaded with the same extract as in lane 16, but with 50 and 200 μg of total protein (Fig. 2). This was done in order to show that we can detect a 2-fold decrease or increase in Pit-1 protein expression relative to that in lane 16. In the vector-only lanes (lanes 1 and 2), the anti-HA antibody does not detect any protein migrating in the Pit-1 range of 30-33 kDa but does detect a nonspecific band of ∼50 kDa whose intensity appears to correlate with the amount of total protein loaded. Examination of the relative amounts of HA Pit-1 versus the other Pit-1 constructs reveals that HA Pit-1 (lanes 3 and 4) and HA Pit-1β (lanes 5 and 6) were expressed at roughly equal levels and that the levels of all Pit-1 constructs were, with the exception of HA Pit-1-AU5 (lanes 9 and 10) and HA Pit-1-MYC (lanes 15 and 16), within 2-fold the level of HA Pit-1. HA Pit-1-AU5 was expressed at barely detectable levels at this amount of input DNA; however, this mutant Pit-1 protein was detectable at higher levels of input DNA, indicating that the protein can be expressed (data not shown). In contrast, HA Pit-1-MYC was expressed at a level more than 2-fold greater than was HA Pit-1 in one of the duplicates. The relative DNA doses required to generate similar Pit-1 and Pit-1β protein levels are consistent with previous findings and again show that Pit-1β displays some level of intrinsic instability (11Konzak K.E. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 241-247Google Scholar). Additionally, our data indicate that alteration of the β-domain reverses this instability, since less input DNA is required for the mutants, thus mapping the source of the Pit-1β isoform instability to the sequence of the β-domain. The DNA doses noted above were used for all further experiments. Experiments carried out in HeLa and GH4 cells in parallel showed that the relative pattern of expression of wild-type and mutant Pit-1 proteins was the same in both cell lines and that there were no cell-specific influences on Pit-1β protein production (data not shown). Differences in apparent mobility among the Pit-1 constructs were detected. Since sequencing had shown that all constructs contain the same number of nucleotides, and therefore encode the same number of amino acids, two explanations remained: post-translational modification of the substituted sequences or sequence-specific effects on gel mobility of the mutant β-domains. The latter effect has been observed in other systems (16Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 863-876Google Scholar). This substitution mutagenesis experiment could have induced alterations in the three-dimensional structure of each mutant Pit-1β such that it could no longer activate transcription under any circumstances. Such a result would preclude the examination of the effects of changing the amino acid sequence of the β-domain on the specific aspects of transcriptional activation modulated by the β-domain. To address this problem, we utilized previous findings that in the nonpituitary HeLa, Ltk−, and Rat-6 cell lines, the transcription potency of the Pit-1β isoform, when normalized to its lower protein level, is similar to that of Pit-1 on the rPRL promoter (5Theill L.E. Hattori K. Domenico D. Castrillo J.-L. Karin M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2261-2269Google Scholar, 11Konzak K.E. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 241-247Google Scholar). We used the HeLa nonpituitary cell line and our previously optimized Pit-1 protein-expression system to test the transcription potency of each mutant construct. The HA-tagged wild-type and mutant Pit-1s were introduced into HeLa nonpituitary cells with a rPRL promoter-driven luciferase reporter, and their ability to transactivate target promoter activity was measured. Fig. 3 depicts the results of a representative experiment. HA Pit-1β actually displayed a stronger effect on transcription of the target promoter compared with Pit-1 (29- versus 15-fold, respectively); this difference may be due to the slightly higher levels of Pit-1β expression with these amounts of input DNA (Fig. 2). All of the mutant Pit-1βs were able to transactivate the rPRL promoter in the 15-30-fold range, except for HA Pit-1-AU5. Again, the transcription effect generally correlated with the level of Pit-1β protein expressed, as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, the potency of Pit-1, Pit-1β, Pit-1-BPV, Pit-1-AU5, and Pit-1-FLAG would appear to be very similar when normalized to level of Pit-1β protein expressed, whereas that of Pit-1-INV and Pit-1-MYC would be somewhat lower. Thus, the mutant β-domains have no deleterious effect on target promoter transactivation in vivo, and their transcription potencies in this reconstitution assay generally correlate with their protein expression levels. While in HeLa nonpituitary cells both Pit-1β and Pit-1 are positively acting transcription factors, in GH4 and α-thyroid-stimulating hormone pituitary cells, Pit-1β, but not Pit-1, represses basal expression from the rPRL promoter (5Theill L.E.

https://openalex.org/W2013006795,"In the adult cerebellum, sulfoglucuronyl glycolipids (SGGLs) are specifically localized in Purkinje cells and their dendrites in the molecular layer. Other major cell types such as granule neurons and glial cells lack SGGLs. To explain the cell specific localization and the known biphasic expression of SGGLs, enzymic activities of four glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of SGGLs were studied in murine cerebellar mutants, in distinct cellular layers of rat cerebellum, and in isolated granule neurons during development. The enzymes studied were lactosylceramide: N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (GlcNAc-Tr), lactotriaosylceramide:galactosyltransferase, neolactotetraosylceramide:glucuronyltransferase, and glucuronylglycolipid:sulfotransferase. In the cerebellum of Purkinje cell-deficient mutants, such as (pcd/pcd) and lurcher (Lc/+) where Purkinje cells are lost, GlcNAc-Tr was absent, but the other three glycosyltransferase were not severely affected. This indicated that the latter three enzymes were localized in other cell types, such as in mature granule neurons and glial cells, in addition to that in Purkinje cells, and the lack of SGGLs in these mutants was due to absence of GlcNAc-Tr. Analyses of the enzymes in the specific micro-dissected cellular layers also showed that Purkinje cell layer and molecular layer (where Purkinje cell dendrites are localized) contained all four enzymes. However, granule neurons and glial cells in the white matter lacked GlcNAc-Tr, but expressed the other three enzymes. It was concluded that the absence of SGGLs in adult granule neurons and glial cells was due to specific deficiency of the GlcNAc-Tr. Although adult granule neurons lacked GlcNAc-Tr and therefore SGGLs, isolated granule neurons from the neonatal cerebellum contained all four enzymes necessary for the synthesis of SGGLs. With development, the activity of GlcNAc-Tr in the isolated granule neurons declined but the other enzymes were not as affected, indicating that immature granule neurons were capable of synthesizing SGGLs and with maturation the synthesis was down-regulated. This also explains the biphasic expression of SGGLs in the developing cerebellum.

With development, the activity of GlcNAc-Tr in the isolated granule neurons declined but the other enzymes were not as affected, indicating that immature granule neurons were capable of synthesizing SGGLs and with maturation the synthesis was down-regulated. This also explains the biphasic expression of SGGLs in the developing cerebellum.

The expression of SGGLs in several brain regions during development is temporally regulated. In the rat cerebral cortex, SGGLs are expressed maximally at embryonic days 18-20 and they almost disappear by postnatal day (PD) 15 (19Schwarting G.A. Jungalwala F.B. Chou D.K.H. Boyer A.M. Yamamoto M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Chou D.K.H. Prasadarao N. Koul O. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the rat cerebellum, the level of SGGL expression is biphasic, with an initial peak at PD 1-3, followed by a second maximum at PD 20 and continued expression in the adult (21Prasadarao N. Koul O. Tobet S.A. Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the peripheral nerves, such as in the rat sciatic nerves, the levels of SGGLs increase rapidly from PD 1 to 30 and after 60 days, they slightly decline (4Chou D.K.H. Schwarting G.A. Evans J.E. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The pathway for the biosynthesis of SGGL-1 is shown in Fig. 1. To understand the mechanism of differential regulation of expression of SGGLs and its physiological significance, particularly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, the biosynthetic enzymes involved in the synthesis of SGGLs during development were studied (22Chou D.K.H. Flores S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17941-17947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol.

Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that the activities of the enzymes, lactotriaosylceramide:galactosyltransferase (LcOse3Cer:Gal-Tr), neolactotetraosyl-ceramide:glucuronyltransferase (nLcOse4Cer:GlcA-Tr), and glucuronyl glycolipid:sulfotransferase (GGL-1:SO4-Tr) did not correlate with the expression of SGGL-1 during development. Considerable activities of these three enzymes persisted in the adult rat cerebral cortex, despite almost complete loss of SGGLs in this tissue. This suggested that these enzymes were not regulating the expression of SGGLs in the cerebral cortex. However, developmental expression of lactosylceramide:N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc-Tr), both in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum correlated well with the tissue levels of SGGLs (25Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cerebral cortex, the specific activity of GlcNAc-Tr declined sharply and was down-regulated from a maximum at embryonic day 15 to undetectable levels by PD 10. In the cerebellum, the activity of GlcNAc-Tr correlated with biphasic expression of SGGLs (25Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the levels of the product of the GlcNAc-Tr reaction, viz. LcOse3Cer, also correlated with the enzyme activity (25Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cerebral cortex, the level of LcOse3Cer declined with development and it was undetectable by PD 5, whereas in the cerebellum it increased with development (25Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that GlcNAc-Tr was the key regulatory enzyme controlling the differential and stage-specific expression of SGGLs in the developing nervous system (25Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the embryonic expression and subsequent down-regulation of SGGLs in the cerebral cortex have been shown to be associated with the migration and maturation of the neuronal cells, the physiological significance and the biphasic expression of SGGLs in the cerebellum remain enigmatic. Our immunocytochemical and biochemical studies have shown that in the adult rodent cerebellum SGGLs were associated only with Purkinje cells and their dendrites in the molecular layer (21Prasadarao N. Koul O. Tobet S.A. Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Prasadarao N.V. Tobet S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Histochem.

Neurol. 1993; 332: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 2Each developing cerebellar folium consists of five distinct successive layers of cell structures: 1) the outer most external granule cell layer, where immature granule cell neurons proliferate; 2) the molecular layer, where mainly the dendritic arbors of Purkinje neurons are localized with axons of the mature granule neurons making synapses; 3) the Purkinje cell layer, where Purkinje cell perikarya are localized; 4) the internal granule cell layer, where the immature cells of the external granule cell layer arrive and settle to become mature granule neurons, and 5) the white matter, which consists mainly of oligodendroglial cells and myelinated axons. Whereas, the granule neurons of the internal granule cell layer and the glial cells of the white matter did not express SGGLs. However, it is not known which type of cells in the neonatal rat cerebellum express SGGLs that are subsequently down-regulated with development. Studies on cerebellar murine mutants have been very valuable, since in many mutants loss of specific cell types as well as defects in histogenesis and cytoarchitectural abnormalities are well defined. Previously we have shown that SGGLs were undetectable in the cerebella of murine mutants, such as Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd/pcd), lurcher (Lc/+), and staggerer (sg/sg), where Purkinje cell loss is the primary defect (27Nair S.M. Prasadarao N.V. Tobet S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 332: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J.

In nervous mutant (nr/nr) where Purkinje cell loss is not as severe or in leaner (tgla/tgla) where selective degeneration of Purkinje cells occurs, the loss of SGGLs was also limited (27Nair S.M. Prasadarao N.V. Tobet S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 332: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J.

The loss of SGGLs and other glycolipids derived from LcOse3Cer such as, lactoneotetraosylceramide, lactoneohexaosylceramide, Lex antigens, and ganglioside nLD1, in these mutants was specific, since other lipids were not affected significantly. The expression of SGGLs was essentially normal in other cerebellar mutants, such as weaver, reeler, and quaking, where cells other than Purkinje cells are primarily affected (27Nair S.M. Prasadarao N.V. Tobet S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 332: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J.

In this study we have examined the activities of the four biosynthetic enzymes, involved in the synthesis of SGGLs, in the cerebellum of Purkinje cell abnormality mutants to evaluate which enzymes are affected due to specific loss of Purkinje cells. The activities of the enzymes were also determined in the micro-dissected layers of cryocut sections of the normal adult cerebellum to localize the site of synthesis of SGGLs in specific cellular layers of cerebellum. In addition, the activities of the enzymes were determined in isolated granule neurons at different ages to evaluate if granule neurons were capable of synthesizing SGGLs. Parts of this work were previously presented in abstract form (30Chou D.K.H. Nair S.M. Tobet S.A. Schwartz E. Jungalwala F.B. Trans. Am. Soc. Neurochem. 1994; 25: 127Google Scholar, 31Chou D.K.H.

Mutant mice were reared in our animal colony (27Nair S.M. Prasadarao N.V. Tobet S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 332: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Chou D.K.H.

Non-radioactive sugar nucleotides, lactosylceramide, and other chemicals of the highest grade possible were purchased from Sigma. LcOse3Cer, nLcOse4Cer, GGL-1, and other glycolipids were prepared as described previously (22Chou D.K.H. Flores S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17941-17947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 330-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chou D.K.H.

Mutant or normal litter-mate mouse (adult) cerebella were homogenized in 10 volumes of 0.32 M sucrose in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with a Polytron tissue homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) at 0-4°C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Adult rats (∼60 days old) were anesthetized with ether and killed by decapitation. Cerebella were removed immediately, placed on a microtome object disk, and frozen on dry ice for 15 min. Cerebellar sections (parasagittal, 15 μm) were cut in a cryostat at −10°C, transferred to plastic Petri dishes, and lyophilized for 5-8 h. Freeze-dried sections were dissected under a stereo-microscope using micro tools according to the procedure of Lowry (32Lowry O.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1953; 1: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Care was taken to ensure that the Purkinje cell layer was dissected into the molecular layer, whereas granular layer and white matter were collected together. Areas containing deep cerebellar nuclei were avoided. The cut layers were stored in a desiccator at 0-4°C until used for enzyme assays. The layers were homogenized in a small Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer as described previously (22Chou D.K.H. Flores S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17941-17947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of lactosylceramide:GlcNAc-Tr was measured in the homogenates of the mouse cerebellum or in rat cerebellar layers with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc as the donor and externally added lactosylceramide as the acceptor as described previously (25Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme without the externally added acceptor lactosylceramide was also determined to see the intrinsic activity. The product of the reaction was identified after purification, by HPTLC, autoradiography, and by immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody TE-5 (a gift from Dr. Eric Holmes) as described previously (33Holmes E.H. Greene T.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The optimal conditions for the assay and product identification for the other three enzymes in the biosynthesis of SGGL-1, viz. LcOse3Cer:Gal-Tr, nLcOse4Cer:GlcA-Tr, and GlcAnLcOse4Cer:SO4-Tr, have been previously established and were used accordingly (22Chou D.K.H. Flores S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17941-17947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 330-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The granule neurons were isolated from the Sprague-Dawley rats of three different age groups between: (I) 2 and 4 days, PD 3 group, (ii) 7 and 9 days, PD 8 group, and (iii) 13 and 15 days, PD 14 group, by a slight modification of the procedure of Hatten (34Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) developed for mice. Briefly, the meninges were carefully stripped off and the whole tissue was washed in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free Tyrode's solution (CMF-phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were dissociated in to single cells as described previously (34Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). After passing the cell suspension through a polyester 33-μm mesh size screen, the suspension was applied to a three-step gradient of Percoll comprising of 60, 35, and 20% (3.0 ml of each) in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free Tyrode's solution. The gradients were centrifuged in a IEC centra-8R centrifuge at 3300 rpm for 10 min. The three resulting bands at the interface of the gradients were removed, diluted to 10 ml with Ca2+ and Mg2+-free Tyrode's solution, and pelleted at 1000 rpm for 7 min. The granule cells were collected from the interface of 35/60% Percoll gradient, whereas astroglial cells were enriched at the interface of 20/35% Percoll. The collected cells were further washed with Dulbecco's modified phosphate buffer and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified phosphate buffer. A portion of the cells were counted with a hematocytometer. The rest were either stored at −20°C for biochemical analyses or resuspended in complete medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 2.5% horse serum, 25 mM KCl, 2.0 mM glutamine, 0.6% glucose, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin and plated on polylysine (50 μg/ml)-coated coverslips at a density of 2 × 105 cells per 15-mm diameter coverslip. The purity of the granule cell preparations was monitored by immunocytochemical staining of the cells with appropriate marker antibodies and by Western blot analyses. The presence of Purkinje cells was monitored by reaction with antibodies to calbindin-28. Antibodies (polyclonal) to SGGL-binding p30 protein was used to monitor the number of granule cells. Total number of cells and appropriate antibody-labeled fluorescent cells were counted in several randomly selected fields using the computer-assisted IBAS image analysis system (Kontron, Germany). To monitor the contamination by astroglial cells, proteins in the homogenates of granule cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein. The intensity of the bands on Western blots was determined by computer-assisted VISAGE image analysis system (BioImage-Millipore, MI). UDP-[14C]GlcNAc and lactosylceramide were incubated with homogenates of cerebella from two Lc/+ mutant and three normal littermate control mice and the radioactive products formed after the enzymatic reaction were isolated and separated by HPTLC (Fig. 2A). An autoradiogram of the HPTLC plate shows that with the three samples of normal cerebellum, the major radioactive product (Fig. 2A, panel A, lanes 3-5) co-migrated with standard LcOse3Cer (LC3 in Fig. 2A, panel C, lane 8). The radioactive product also reacted with TE-5 antibody (not shown) which is specific for terminal GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4- structure (32Lowry O.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1953; 1: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, Lc/+ mutant cerebellar homogenates failed to synthesize any radioactive product from lactosylceramide (Fig. 2A, panel A, lanes 1 and 2). The same HPTLC plate as visualized after orcinol spray is shown in Fig. 2A, panel B. The doublet bands migrating with standard lactosylceramide correspond to added acceptor lactosylceramide prepared from bovine red blood cells. Without exogenously added acceptor lactosylceramide, normal littermate cerebellar homogenates also synthesized a trace amount of LcOse3Cer (autoradiogram in Fig. 2B, panel A, lanes 1 and 2). However, the mutant cerebellum failed to synthesize any LcOse3Cer under the same conditions (Fig. 2B, panel A, lane 3). The identity of the other radioactive products in Fig. 2B, panel A, is not known. It should be noted that the exposure time of the HPTLC plate to x-ray film for enzyme assays without exogenously added substrates (Fig. 2B) was 10 times longer than that with the added substrates (Fig. 2A), therefore the unidentified radioactive products seen in Fig. 2B are not seen in Fig. 2A. The same HPTLC plate after autoradiography was treated with orcinol spray and is shown in Fig. 2B, panel B. Only a trace, if any, endogenous lactosylceramide in the homogenates appears be present. The radioactive products formed by the reaction of LcOse3Cer:Gal-Tr and nLcOse4Cer:GlcA-Tr with normal and Lc/+ mutant mouse cerebellar homogenates are shown in Fig. 3A. When exogenously added substrate LcOse3Cer (Lc3) was used as an acceptor (Fig. 3A, panel B, lanes 4-6) and UDP-[14C]Gal as a donor, both the normal and the mutant homogenates synthesized radioactive nLcOse4Cer (nLc4, autoradiogram in Fig. 3A, panel A, lanes 4-6) as the major product which migrated with standard nLcOse4Cer (Fig. 3A, panel B, lanes 1-3, lower most band, which is the exogenously added substrate for the GlcA-Tr reaction). Without added LcOse3Cer, normal cerebellar homogenates also synthesized trace amounts of nLcOse4Cer doublet from endogenous LcOse3Cer and UDP-[14C]Gal (autoradiogram in Fig. 3B, panel A, lanes 4 and 6). However, the Lc/+ mutant cerebellar homogenate synthesized barely a trace amount of nLcOse4Cer, due to lack of endogenous LcOse3Cer (Fig. 3B, panel A, lane 5). Both normal and mutant cerebellar homogenates synthesized radioactive GlcA-nLcOse4Cer (GGL-1), when incubated with exogenously added nLcOse4Cer and UDP-[14C]GlcA (autoradiogram in Fig. 3A, panel A, lanes 1-3). Without exogenously added nLcOse4Cer, although the normal littermate cerebellar homogenate synthesized trace levels of GlcA-nLcOse4Cer (autoradiogram in Fig. 3B, panel A, lanes 1 and 3), the mutant cerebellar homogenate failed to synthesize any product (Fig. 3B, panel A, lane 2). The latter result is interpreted as due to lack of availability of endogenous substrates nLcOse4Cer or its precursor LcOse3Cer in the mutant. Normal and Lc/+ mutant cerebellar homogenate catalyzed the formation of radioactive SGGLs from exogenously added GGL-1 and PAP [35S]O4 (autoradiogram in Fig. 4A, panel A, lanes 4-8). Without exogenously added GGL-1 both the normal and mutant cerebellar homogenates failed to synthesize SGGL-1 (Fig. 4A, panel A, lanes 1-3). The specific activities of the four enzymes, involved in the biosynthesis of SGGL-1 from lactosylceramide, in the Purkinje cell abnormality mutants, pcd/pcd, Lc/+, and tgla/tgla and their normal littermates' cerebella are given in Table I. The specific activities of Gal-Tr and SO4-Tr were nearly normal or slightly elevated in all the three Purkinje cell abnormality mutants and GlcA-Tr was about 50% normal. However, GlcNAc-Tr was not detectable in pcd/pcd and Lc/+ cerebellum. In tgla/tgla, where Purkinje cells are not completely lost, the specific activity of GlcNAc-Tr was about 25% of normal. Previously, we have shown that in the adult rat the expression of SGGLs was restricted to molecular layer where Purkinje cell dendritic arborization occurs and to deep cerebellar nuclei where Purkinje cell axons terminate (21Prasadarao N.

These observations indicate that in X. laevis oocytes overexpressing IRS-1, the association of PI 3-kinase rather than Grb2 (growth factor-bound protein 2) with IRS-1 plays a major role in insulin-induced oocyte maturation.

INTRODUCTIONAfter stimulation with insulin, insulin receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is activated and phosphorylates several signaling molecules including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1SH2 proteinsSrc homology 2 domain-containing proteinsIGF-1insulin-like growth factor 1PI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseAsh/Grb2abundant Src homology/growth factor receptor bound protein 2p85 of PI 3-kinasethe 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinaseSosson of sevenlessShcSrc homology 2/α-collagen-relatedMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseMBPmyelin basic proteinα-PYantibodies specific for phosphotyrosinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdown. The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins become associated with several Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins (SH2 proteins) and thereby transduce downstream signals (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

IRS-1 is a substrate for insulin and IGF-1 receptors and is known to associate with several SH2 proteins, including PI 3-kinase and Ash/Grb2, through distinct phosphorylation sites (2Skolnik E.Y.

Evidence has been shown to demonstrate the importance of IRS-1 on the pleotropic effects of insulin, such as mitogenesis of 32D cells and maturation of Xenopus laevis oocyte (6Myers Jr., M.G.

IRS-1-deficient mice exhibit growth retardation and insulin resistance (8Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka S.

IRS-1 has multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, some of which could be redundantly associated with the same SH2 proteins, and it is not clear which phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 mediate relevant downstream signaling and biological effects. Furthermore, ubiquitous expression of IRS-1 makes it difficult to examine the functions of overexpressed IRS-1 and its mutated forms. In the present study, we created site-directed mutants of IRS-1 in which Tyr-895 or a group of four tyrosine residues (Tyr-460, Tyr-608, Tyr-939, and Tyr-987) was replaced with phenylalanine (IRS-1-895F and IRS-1-4F, respectively) and overexpressed them in unprimed the X. laevis oocyte. This system is suitable to study functions of IRS-1 and its mutants, since X. laevis oocytes possess receptors for IGF-1 and signaling molecules such as Ash/Grb2, p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, Sos, and Shc-like proteins (10Janicot M. Flores-Riveros J.R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9382-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Grigorescu F. Andrieu J.M. Rouard M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 3AGoogle Scholar), while the level of endogenous IRS-1 expression is very low (7Chuang L-M Myers Jr., M.G. Seidner G.A. Birnbaum M.J. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5172-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpressed IRS-1 is presumed to amplify signals evoked by IGF-1 or by high concentrations of insulin to downstream effectors. We found that IRS-1 overexpression in oocyte actually augmented PI 3-kinase activation in response to insulin, whereas IRS-1-4F expression did not. Overexpressing IRS-1-4F did not augment the activities of downstream signals including MAP kinase, p70 S6 kinase, and maturation of oocytes. These observation suggests that PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 is necessary for these signaling events. We also noted that oocytes overexpressing IRS-895F, a putative Ash/Grb2 binding site mutant, efficiently transmit signals leading to oocyte maturation, suggesting that the association of overexpressed IRS-1 with Ash/Grb2 may play a minor roles in these signals.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we attempted to evaluate the relative importance of IRS-1 phosphorylation sites that could bind PI 3-kinase or Ash/Grb2 for downstream signals by comparing the signaling activities of wild-type IRS-1, mutated IRS-1 unable to activate PI 3-kinase, and that unable to bind to Ash/Grb2. This strategy enabled us to specify signals derived from IRS-1 and to assess the roles of each phosphorylation site of IRS-1 on downstream signaling.In the X. laevis oocyte, insulin-induced maturation was achieved either by pretreatment with gonadotropin (priming) or by overexpressing IRS-1 to unprimed oocytes (7Chuang L-M Myers Jr., M.G.

The present study was undertaken to define mechanisms of overexpressed IRS-1 that could induce maturation in unprimed X. laevis oocytes. Previous studies have shown the importance of p21ras-MAP kinase cascade in insulin-induced oocyte maturation (21Maller J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Activation of p21ras is necessary (22Korn L.J. Siebel C.W. McCormic F. Roth R.A.

Recent experiments exhibited that MAP kinase activation is also necessary (25Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Fukuda M. Gotoh Y.

Ash/Grb2 is one of the SH2 proteins associated with IRS-1 or Shc that mediates p21ras activation through Sos in mammalian cells (2Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A.G. Vicentini L.M. Zhov M. Daly R.J.

Previous studies showed that microinjection of the SH2 domain of Ash/Grb2 inhibited insulin-induced X. laevis oocyte maturation (36Chuang L-M Hausdorff S.F. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Birnbaum M.J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27645-27649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that overexpressed IRS-1-895F, a mutant that could not bind Ash/Grb2 (4Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. Chi D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), was able to transmit signals to MAP kinase activation and oocyte maturation as well as overexpressed IRS-1. It could be that in oocytes overexpressing IRS-1-895F insulin-induced signals might well be compensated by interaction between Ash/Grb2 and phosphoproteins other than IRS-1, such as Shc (31Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although at present reports on X. laevis Shc-like protein are limited (11Grigorescu F. Andrieu J.M. Rouard M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 3AGoogle Scholar) and cDNA encoding this protein has not been reported, the role of Shc in insulin-induced maturation of X. laevis oocytes should be investigated in future experiments. In 32D cells, overexpressed IRS-1-895F was reported to affect insulin-induced mitogenesis and MAP kinase activation (4Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. Chi D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between our observations and the results in 32D cells could be that the sets of phosphoproteins that bound to Ash/Grb2 might be different in these cells.Insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase also contributes to MAP kinase activation in various degrees in both p21ras-dependent and -independent pathways (31Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem.

J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Recently, the importance of PI 3-kinase in p21ras-dependent oocyte maturation has also been proposed. Constitutive active mutant of p85-p110 fusion subunit of PI 3-kinase was able to induce oocyte maturation, and the oocyte maturation was inhibited by dominant negative p21ras (34Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fautl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), indicating that activation of PI 3-kinase seems to be sufficient for oocyte maturation and that PI 3-kinase may act upstream of p21ras. Activation of PI 3-kinase was also necessary for insulin-induced germinal vesicle breakdown, since pretreatment with wortmannin (35Liu X.J. Sorisky A. Zhu L. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or microinjected fusion protein for SH2 domains of p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase (36Chuang L-M Hausdorff S.F. Myers Jr., M.G.

Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6653-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) abolished this process. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. Wortmannin could also inhibit the other isoforms that did not bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyr-X-X-Met motifs. Microinjection of SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase might inhibit interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with molecules other than IRS-1, namely insulin receptor, p21ras, pp60, or other unidentified molecules (11Grigorescu F.

Therefore, it was difficult to conclude that PI 3-kinase activity associated with overexpressed IRS-1 was crucial in insulin-induced oocyte maturation. To circumvent these issues and to examine more directly the contribution of PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1, we overexpressed wild-type IRS-1 and IRS-1 mutated at possible binding sites for PI 3-kinase (IRS-1-4F) in the X. laevis oocyte. We found that IRS-1-4F failed to stimulate PI 3-kinase, MAP kinase, and oocyte maturation in response to insulin. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this paper. First, as predicted by cell-free experiments (39Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pons S. Asano T. Glasheen E. Miralpeix M. Zhang Y. Fisher T.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4453-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we proved that Tyr-X-X-Met motifs of some of Tyr-460, −608, −939, and −987 of IRS-1 might be necessary for association and full activation of PI 3-kinase in intact cell systems. Similar observations that insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase was impaired in 293 cells overexpressed with IRS-1 mutated at Tyr-608 were recently reported by Rocci et al. (41Rocci S. Tartare-Deckert S. Mothe I. van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under our present experimental conditions, in which a high concentration of insulin is required to induce effects, IRS-1-4F failed to activate PI 3-kinase in response to insulin. However, a significant amount of PI 3-kinase activity in response to insulin was observed when IRS-1-4F was overexpressed to primary hepatocytes. 2K. Ueki, H. Tamemoto, and T. Kadowaki, unpublished observations. Thus in insulin-sensitive tissues, Tyr-X-X-Met motifs other than Tyr-460, −608, −939, and −987 of IRS-1 might bind and activate PI 3-kinase in response to insulin. As the present study does not address whether Tyr-X-X-Met motifs of Tyr-460, −608, −939, and −987 of IRS-1 are sufficient for activating PI 3-kinase, PI 3-kinase activity of added-back IRS-1 mutant possessing only Tyr-X-X-Met motifs should next be examined. Second, the interaction between some of Tyr-X-X-Met motifs of Tyr-460, −608, −939, and −987 of IRS-1 and the SH2 proteins bound to these sites was required for insulin-induced activation of MAP kinase and oocyte maturation. Molecules that bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 reported to date include p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (4Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. Chi D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y.

Thus the present observation suggested that activation of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase was the upstream mechanism for activation of p21ras-MAP kinase cascade and induction of oocyte maturation. In the present system, however, the possible interaction of any one of the four Tyr-X-X-Met motifs with some unidentified SH2 domain-containing molecules cannot be completely ruled out. To examine the possibility that phosphorylation of any one of the Tyr-X-X-Met motifs could be required for oocyte maturation, we carried out experiments for insulin-induced maturation of oocytes overexpressing IRS-1-460F, IRS-1-608F, or IRS-939F-987F. The result indicated that not any one of the four Tyr-X-X-Met motifs played a predominant role in oocyte maturation. Finally, Yamauchi and Pessin reported that overexpressed IRS-1 resulted in a concomitant reduction of Ash/Grb2 associated with Shc and inhibited insulin signaling (45Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations hence raised the possibility that overexpression of mutant IRS-1 could somehow affect the insulin signaling of endogenous IRS-1-independent pathway. However, differences in IRS-1-induced and mutated IRS-1-induced signaling are most likely caused by the mutation itself, since overexpression of wild-type IRS-1 might also affect this putative IRS-1-independent pathway in a similar fashion.p70 S6 kinase is known to be involved in G1 progression (46Lane H.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p70 S6 kinase seems to lie downstream of one or some of the PI 3-kinase family molecules, because it is activated by autoactive fusion subunit of p85-p110 PI 3-kinase (50Weng Q.P.

Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). To examine more directly the contribution of Tyr-X-X-Met motifs of IRS-1 on insulin-induced p70 S6 kinase activation, we analyzed p70 S6 kinase activity in oocytes overexpressing normal and mutant IRS-1s. We observed that insulin-induced p70 S6 kinase activity was increased by overexpression of IRS-1 but not by that of IRS-1-4F (Fig. 4). These results indicated that interaction between some of the Tyr-460, −608, −939, and −987 of IRS-1 and the SH2 proteins bound to these sites, most likely PI 3-kinase, was necessary for insulin-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase in this system. Recently overexpression of truncated mutant of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was reported to antagonize platelet-derived growth factor-mediated activation of p70 S6 kinase (53Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). The result is consistent with our present observations. p70 S6 kinase is apparently not involved in oocyte maturation, because rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase, failed to antagonize oocyte maturation in response to insulin (data not shown).In conclusion, MAP kinase activation, p70 S6 kinase activation, and oocyte maturation in response to insulin appears to link with PI 3-kinase, which was associated with IRS-1. INTRODUCTIONAfter stimulation with insulin, insulin receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is activated and phosphorylates several signaling molecules including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1SH2 proteinsSrc homology 2 domain-containing proteinsIGF-1insulin-like growth factor 1PI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseAsh/Grb2abundant Src homology/growth factor receptor bound protein 2p85 of PI 3-kinasethe 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinaseSosson of sevenlessShcSrc homology 2/α-collagen-relatedMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseMBPmyelin basic proteinα-PYantibodies specific for phosphotyrosinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdown. The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins become associated with several Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins (SH2 proteins) and thereby transduce downstream signals (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

IRS-1 is a substrate for insulin and IGF-1 receptors and is known to associate with several SH2 proteins, including PI 3-kinase and Ash/Grb2, through distinct phosphorylation sites (2Skolnik E.Y.

Evidence has been shown to demonstrate the importance of IRS-1 on the pleotropic effects of insulin, such as mitogenesis of 32D cells and maturation of Xenopus laevis oocyte (6Myers Jr., M.G.

IRS-1-deficient mice exhibit growth retardation and insulin resistance (8Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka S.

Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). IRS-1 has multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, some of which could be redundantly associated with the same SH2 proteins, and it is not clear which phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 mediate relevant downstream signaling and biological effects. Furthermore, ubiquitous expression of IRS-1 makes it difficult to examine the functions of overexpressed IRS-1 and its mutated forms. In the present study, we created site-directed mutants of IRS-1 in which Tyr-895 or a group of four tyrosine residues (Tyr-460, Tyr-608, Tyr-939, and Tyr-987) was replaced with phenylalanine (IRS-1-895F and IRS-1-4F, respectively) and overexpressed them in unprimed the X. laevis oocyte. This system is suitable to study functions of IRS-1 and its mutants, since X. laevis oocytes possess receptors for IGF-1 and signaling molecules such as Ash/Grb2, p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, Sos, and Shc-like proteins (10Janicot M. Flores-Riveros J.R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9382-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Grigorescu F. Andrieu J.M. Rouard M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 3AGoogle Scholar), while the level of endogenous IRS-1 expression is very low (7Chuang L-M Myers Jr., M.G. Seidner G.A. Birnbaum M.J. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5172-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpressed IRS-1 is presumed to amplify signals evoked by IGF-1 or by high concentrations of insulin to downstream effectors. We found that IRS-1 overexpression in oocyte actually augmented PI 3-kinase activation in response to insulin, whereas IRS-1-4F expression did not. Overexpressing IRS-1-4F did not augment the activities of downstream signals including MAP kinase, p70 S6 kinase, and maturation of oocytes. These observation suggests that PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 is necessary for these signaling events. We also noted that oocytes overexpressing IRS-895F, a putative Ash/Grb2 binding site mutant, efficiently transmit signals leading to oocyte maturation, suggesting that the association of overexpressed IRS-1 with Ash/Grb2 may play a minor roles in these signals."

The active site histidine is transiently phosphorylated in the phosphotransferase reaction while phosphorylation of serine 46 diminishes the activity of HPr. Here, we use protein engineering and equilibrium protein folding experiments to determine if the two phosphorylation events are energetically coupled. Our approach is to use structural mimics of the two phosphorylated forms of HPr, where histidine 15 is replaced by a negatively charged glutamate and serine 46 is changed to an aspartate, both alone and in combination. The thermodynamic analysis of the differences in conformational stability between the single and double mutants shows that the two phosphorylation sites are not energetically coupled in the HPr protein. We also show that single mutants of the active site histidine residue can have dramatic effects on the conformational stability of HPr.

Combined with structural information, the method employed here will be of general use in unraveling the biological effects of phosphorylation on protein activity. The regulation of a cellular process through reversible protein phosphorylation is ubiquitous in biology. First observed in glycogen phosphorylase (1Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 20: 150-157Google Scholar), protein phosphorylation has now been described in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Protein phosphorylation controls many metabolic pathways and events in biological chemistry including gene transcription, muscle contraction, cell division and growth, and even learning and memory. Despite the diverse number of systems that show reversible protein phosphorylation, surprisingly little information is available regarding the structural and energetic consequences of this important reaction (2Johnson L.N. Barford D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 199-232Google Scholar). Two examples where crystal structures are known for proteins in their phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms are glycogen phosphorylase (3Barford D. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Google Scholar) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (4Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3599-3602Google Scholar). In these two cases, the mechanism by which protein activity is altered by protein phosphorylation is different. In GP, 1The abbreviations used are: GPglycogen phosphorylasebsHPrhistidine-containing protein from Bacillus subtilisPTSphosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar transport systemSer(P)-46the phosphoserine form of HPrHis(P)-15the phosphohistidine form of HPrEIenzyme I of the PTS. phosphorylation promotes the formation of ordered structure near the site of the target serine residue causing long range conformational changes that affect the function of the enzyme. In isocitrate dehydrogenase, on the other hand, the serine residue that is the target of phosphorylation is at the N-cap position of an α-helix, phosphorylation only produces small local changes in the structure of the protein, and the activity of the enzyme is reduced through an electrostatic steric mechanism where the phosphate group prevents the binding of the anionic substrate. glycogen phosphorylase histidine-containing protein from Bacillus subtilis phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar transport system the phosphoserine form of HPr the phosphohistidine form of HPr enzyme I of the PTS. For several other cases, the structural changes in a protein upon phosphorylation can be inferred from other biochemical studies even though we do not have direct crystallographic structures for both forms of the protein. One of these cases is the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. In this case, it appears that phosphorylation causes large scale conformational changes across domain interfaces, thus relaying the phosphorylation event through conformational changes that allow proper substrate binding (5Knighton D.R.

As scarce as the detailed structural descriptions of the effects of phosphorylation are, there is even less known about the energetic effects of phosphorylation. Specifically, does phosphorylation of a protein alter the conformational stability of a protein, and does this have functional consequences for the protein? Recently, the structural and energetic effects of serine phosphorylation of the bacterial protein HPr have been reported (8Pullen K. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Huffine M.E. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2478-2486Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the regulatory serine residue produces only local changes in structure while increasing the conformational stability of the protein by ≈0.7 kcal mol−1. Here we extend these studies to determine if phosphorylation of HPr at the regulatory site (Ser-46) is energetically coupled to the phosphorylation event at the active site (His-15). The HPr protein plays a central role in the sugar transport system in bacteria (see Fig. 1). In Gram-positive bacteria, the key regulatory protein is histidine-containing protein (HPr), a small phosphoryl transfer protein that can be phosphorylated either on the “catalytic” histidine (His-15) by the scheme shown in Fig. 1 or on a regulatory serine (Ser-46) by an ATP-dependent protein kinase (9Reizer J. Novotny M.J. Hengstenberg W. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 333-340Google Scholar). HPr(Ser(P) has a reduced ability (≈100-fold) (see Ref. 11Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Google Scholar) to accept a phosphate from EI-P (10Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Wu L.-F. Deutscher J. Reddy P. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9158-9169Google Scholar), and the replacement of Ser-46 with Asp (S46D) mimics the functional activity (11Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Google Scholar) and the structural and energetic consequences of serine phosphorylation (8Pullen K. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Huffine M.E. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2478-2486Google Scholar). Histidine phosphorylation, although not as common as serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation, has now been shown in prokaryotes (12Wolodko W.T. Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10883-10890Google Scholar, 13Kenney L.J. Bauer M.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8866-8870Google Scholar, 14Monéra S. Chiadmi M. LeBras G. Lascu L. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11062-11070Google Scholar) and eukaryotes (15Motojima K. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 75-79Google Scholar, 16Kim Y. Huang J. Cohen P. Matthews H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18513-18518Google Scholar), both as protein activity regulators (13Kenney L.J. Bauer M.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8866-8870Google Scholar, 15Motojima K. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 75-79Google Scholar) and as intermediates in enzymatic catalysis (12Wolodko W.T. Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10883-10890Google Scholar, 14Monéra S. Chiadmi M. LeBras G. Lascu L. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11062-11070Google Scholar). Histidine phosphorylation is also a key feature of the PTS in bacteria (Fig. 1). All the phosphoprotein forms of the PTS proteins are on histidine residues. For HPr, phosphorylation occurs on the Nδ1 atom of His-15, the N-cap residue of the first α-helix (see Fig. 2). A recent NMR characterization of the phosphohistidine form of HPr (17Rajagopal P. Waygood E.B. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15271-15282Google Scholar) shows that the structural consequences of phosphorylation are localized to the end of this helix. Therefore, the two protein phosphorylation events on HPr, on the regulatory Ser-46, and the catalytic His-15 sites show common features. Each site of phosphorylation is located at the N-cap of an α-helix, and each phosphorylation event only produces small changes in the local structure of the protein in the vicinity of the phosphorylated residue. Here we use protein engineering to investigate the energetic coupling between regulatory and active site phosphorylation residues in HPr. Since the Ser(P)-46 form of the protein has the same structural, functional, and energetic properties as the S46D mutant (8Pullen K. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Huffine M.E. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2478-2486Google Scholar, 11Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Google Scholar), we have used a similar approach to mimic the short lived His(P)-15 form of the protein by the mutation H15E. We investigate the consequences of these mutations, both alone and in combination, on the conformational stability of the HPr protein. We also report the effects of several mutations of the active site His-15 residue on the conformational stability. In a general sense, we address the question of how the information is transferred from a regulatory protein phosphorylation site to the “active site,” in this case some 15-20 Å away, in the absence of large or small scale conformational changes in the structure of the protein. Bacillus subtilis HPr was prepared as described previously (11Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Google Scholar, 18Wittekind M. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1363-1376Google Scholar). The bsHPr variants, H15A, H15E, S46D, and the double mutant H15E/S46D were generous gifts of Jonathan Reizer and Milton Saier, Jr. All proteins were stored as lyophilized powders at −20°C and dissolved in the appropriate buffer just prior to use. All buffers and urea were of the highest grade available. The conformational stability of each protein was determined through the analysis of urea denaturation curves as described previously (19Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 35-43Google Scholar, 20Nicholson E.M. Scholtz J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11369-11378Google Scholar). The equilibrium unfolding reaction was monitored by CD at 222 nm using an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter with a temperature control and stirring unit. Urea denaturation experiments were performed at 25°C in buffered solutions containing either 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 3.5), 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8), 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), or 10 mM sodium borate (pH 9.0). The urea solutions were freshly prepared daily, and the concentration of the urea stock solution was determined by refractometry (21Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar). Analysis of the urea denaturation curves follows the procedures outlined by Pace (21Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar) and Santoro and Bolen (22Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar). This analysis assumes a two-state equilibrium folding reaction and employs the linear extrapolation method described by ΔGobs=ΔG°−m⋅[ urea ],(Eq. 1) where ΔG° is the conformational free energy in the absence of urea, and m is the gradient of change of the conformational free energy with molar urea concentration. A single urea denaturation curve can be fit, using nonlinear least squares procedures by mobso=N0+aN[ urea ]+D0+aD[ urea ]expmRT[ urea ]−Cmid1+expmRT[ urea ]−Cmid(Eq. 2) to afford m and Cmid, the concentration of urea at the midpoint of the transition. The other parameters in Equation 2 describe the linear pre- and posttransition base lines for the urea denaturation curves. A complete description of this procedure has been described (19Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 35-43Google Scholar). To facilitate comparisons between urea denaturation curves for different protein variants, the observed CD spectroscopy signal was converted to fraction of native protein (fN) using fN=mobso−D0+aD[ urea ]N0+aN[ urea ]−D0+aD[ urea ],(Eq. 3) where the linear pre- and posttransition base lines define the CD spectroscopy signals for the native and unfolded forms of the protein. The difference in conformational stability between variant proteins under identical solution conditions can be described by ΔΔG=〈m〉⋅ΔCmid,(Eq. 4) where 〈m〉 is the average m-value at the given pH and ΔCmid is the difference in midpoints of the two urea denaturation curves being compared. The HPr proteins undergo a reversible unfolding-refolding transition, and the equilibrium behavior adheres to a simple two-state reaction between the folded and unfolded protein (19Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 35-43Google Scholar, 20Nicholson E.M. Scholtz J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11369-11378Google Scholar). Furthermore, the conformational stability of the wild-type protein has been determined over a wide range of temperature and urea concentrations (19Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 35-43Google Scholar), and it appears that the simple linear extrapolation method for the analysis of solvent denaturation curves can be used to adequately describe the effects of urea on the stability of the HPr proteins (20Nicholson E.M. Scholtz J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11369-11378Google Scholar). Here we use urea denaturation experiments to determine the differences in conformational stability between the wild-type protein and a number of variants. This allows us to determine how structural mimics of protein phosphorylation alter the energetics of the HPr structure. By investigating a number of pH values, we can also determine the importance of the protonation state of the active site His-15 residue on the stability of HPr and its variants. Urea denaturation curves for each of the five HPr proteins, wild type, H15A, H15E, S46D, and H15E/S46D, were performed at four different pH values. Representative curves are shown in Fig. 3 for one set of data at pH 7. In these curves, the raw CD spectroscopy signal has been converted to the fraction of native protein as a function of the molar concentration of urea using Equation 3. This facilitates a comparison of the data from different protein variants. It is clear that the five proteins show different behavior toward urea denaturation, with H15E as the least stable and S46D and H15A as the most stable proteins at pH 7.0. This experiment was repeated at least two times for each protein at each of the four pH values. The results of the analysis of these data, using Equations 1 and 2, are given in Table I. For each pH, the m-value, the dependence of the free energy of folding with molar urea concentration, appears to be independent of the mutation; however, the m-values do show a dependence on pH. For this reason, we have elected to average the m-values for each variant at a given pH and use this average m-value, 〈m〉, to calculate the conformational stability of each mutant and to compare changes in conformational stability between mutants using Equation 4. The change in m-value with pH has been observed for several other proteins and possible origins have been discussed (23Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Thomson J.A.

The S46D mutation mimics the Ser(P)-46 form of the protein (8Pullen K. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Huffine M.E. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2478-2486Google Scholar), and H15E mimics the His(P)-15 form. In order to assess the potential energetic coupling between these two sites of protein phosphorylation, we have determined the differences in conformational stability between the wild-type protein and the single mutants S46D and H15E along with the double mutant S46D/H15E. For the three pH values where we have reliable estimates of the energetics of the structure (pH 4.8, 7.0, and 9.0), it is possible to construct double mutant cycles to assess the coupling between the two sites of interest. Fig. 4 shows the double mutant cycles at each pH value. In all cases, the energetic consequences of the two single mutations are additive, as required for this thermodynamic analysis. The key result is that we find essentially no interaction energy between these two sites of mutation (ΔGint≈ 0) at any pH value, indicating that these two residues are not energetically coupled. That is, the energetic consequence of a substitution at residue 15 does not depend on the identity of residue 46. This result is true at all pH values investigated, including the range where the protonation state of His-15 changes from neutral (pH 7 and 9) to charged (pH 4.8). From the data provided in Table I, some key trends are observed for substitutions at His-15. These data are shown in Fig. 5. For the wild-type protein, the maximum stability occurs near pH 7, and the conformational stability decreases as the pH is increased or decreased. At the lowest pH at which we can measure the conformational stability, the wild-type protein is greatly destabilized with an estimated stability of only 1.7 kcal mol−1. The conformational stability of the protein is also affected by substitutions at His-15, especially substitutions that change the charged state of the residue. At all values of pH, H15A is the most stable His-15 variant, whereas the order of the other variants depends on the charged state of the side chain. Overall, the general trend for the conformational stability of the proteins with position 15 substitutions is Ala > His0 > Glu− > His+. A molecular description of the effects of protein phosphorylation, both in terms of structural changes and energetic changes, will assist us in understanding the regulation of a number of biochemical processes. For the few cases where detailed structure information is known, or can be inferred, there appear to be several mechanisms by which protein phosphorylation can mediate a change in the activity of a protein. In a recent review, Johnson and Barford (2Johnson L.N. Barford D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 199-232Google Scholar) have discussed five possible results of protein phosphorylation, providing examples of each based on high resolution structures. 1) Phosphorylation may act in an allosteric fashion where local conformational changes near the site of phosphorylation cause conformational changes that are transmitted through subunit interfaces to the active site. 2) Phosphorylation may reduce the affinity of a protein for anionic ligands through an electrostatic blocking process without the need for conformational changes in the protein. 3) Phosphorylation may order loops or residues in alternative conformations that are now competent for ligand binding. 4) Phosphorylation may alter protein-protein interactions through changes in the surface properties of the protein. 5) Phosphorylation may do nothing to the protein. These “silent phosphorylation” events generally do not alter the activity of the protein, and the biological function for this type of protein phosphorylation remains unknown. These observations have clearly provided a wealth of information on the mechanisms of regulation by protein phosphorylation; however, they are limited to providing only a structural view of protein phosphorylation. It is possible that phosphorylation may alter the conformational stability, either globally or locally, of the protein and that this may in turn regulate protein activity. Protein phosphorylation, cast in this light, can be thought of as a single site mutational event; for example, a serine residue being replaced by a phosphoserine residue. Mutational effects on protein activity and stability are well known, and mutations can alter global conformational stability as well as local flexibility either with or without structural changes (24Alber T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 765-798Google Scholar). In some cases, the analysis of single mutants, or a series of mutants at a particular position, can provide valuable information on the role that the residue contributes to the conformational stability of a protein. Mutational effects can also be used to explore the energetics of the interaction between two residues, even if the residues are not involved in a direct contact. A powerful way to assess this interaction energy is through double mutant cycles (25Horovitz A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 613-617Google Scholar, 26Horovitz A. Serrano L. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 1031-1044Google Scholar, 27Serrano L. Horovitz A. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9343-9352Google Scholar). If the two residues of interest are energetically coupled, the change in conformational stability brought about through mutation at one site will depend on the identity of the residue at the second site. Here we use this approach to determine if the two sites of phosphorylation of bsHPr are energetically coupled despite being separated some 15-20Å in the three-dimensional structure. Our results indicate that at pH 7 and 9, there is no energetic coupling between sites 46 and 15 in bsHPr (ΔGint≈ 0). The pKa of His-15 is ≈ 5.4 (17Rajagopal P. Waygood E.B. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15271-15282Google Scholar) so at pH 4.8, His-15 is predominately in the protonated form. At this pH, we still find that the interaction energy is essentially zero. Further evidence for the independence of these two sites comes from determinations of the pKa for His-15 in wild type and the S46D variant (17Rajagopal P. Waygood E.B. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15271-15282Google Scholar). The pKa for His-15 is independent of the identity of residue 46, consistent with our finding that these two sites are not energetically coupled. Therefore, we conclude that the phosphorylation of HPr on Ser-46 does not alter the electrostatic environment around His-15. The single mutations at His-15 provide further insight into the environment around the active site of HPr. His-15 is located at the N terminus of the first helix in HPr (Fig. 2) and serves as the helix N-cap. There is a preference for certain amino acids to be at N-cap position of a helix in proteins (28Presta L.G. Rose G.D. Science. 1988; 240: 1632-1641Google Scholar, 29Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Google Scholar) and peptides (30Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1325-1336Google Scholar). These preferences are different than those found in interior positions of a helix since the ends of a helix have two unique features, unsatisfied backbone hydrogen bond donors (N terminus) or acceptors (C terminus) and a natural helix macrodipole resulting in a net positive charge at the N terminus and a net negative charge at the C terminus (31Hol W.G.J. van Duijnen P.T. Berendsen H.J.C. Nature. 1978; 273: 443-446Google Scholar). These two factors lead to discrete preferences for residues with side chains that have charged groups and hydrogen bond acceptors. In a recent study on the effects of N-cap mutations at Ser-46 in Escherichia coli HPr (32Thapar R. Nicholson E.M. Waygood E.B. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11268-11277Google Scholar) and a more limited study in bsHPr (8Pullen K. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Huffine M.E. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2478-2486Google Scholar), we observed a good correlation between the changes in conformational stability between mutations, Δ(ΔG), observed in the proteins with those obtained in model alanine-based helical peptides (30Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1325-1336Google Scholar). For the mutations we have at His-15, the case is not as simple. Instead of the order of stability found in model peptide helices His0 > Glu− > Ala > His+, we find Ala > His0 > Glu− > His+, that is, the alanine substitution is more stable than expected based on simple N-capping preferences. This is evidence that the active site of HPr, like many other active sites, has unique structural and energetic features and is not simply the N terminus of solvent-exposed helix. One important question regarding the current strategy is the extent to which we can mimic the phosphorylated form of a protein with an amino acid residue with an acidic side chain. For the Ser(P)-46 form of bsHPr, the answer appears definitive; S46D mimics Ser(P)-46 in structure, activity, and conformational stability (8Pullen K. Rajagopal P. Branchini B.R. Huffine M.E. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Scholtz J.M. Klevit R.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2478-2486Google Scholar, 11Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Google Scholar). For His(P)-15, however, the evidence is not as clear. We do not have unequivocal structural and energetic data that suggest that H15E is a good mimic of His(P)-15 for the bsHPr protein. One limitation with the phosphohistidine form of the protein is the instability of the phosphorus-nitrogen bond (17Rajagopal P. Waygood E.B. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15271-15282Google Scholar). This short lived, phosphorylated form of HPr is not amenable to thermodynamic characterization. If we assume that H15E captures at least some of the properties of His(P)-15, there are some interesting comparisons that can be made between the mimics of the phosphorylated forms of bsHPr. For the regulatory serine phosphorylation site, the Ser(P)-46 (and S46D) form of the protein is more stable than the wild-type protein. However, in as much as H15E mimics His(P)-15, we find a reversal in the conformational stability; H15E (and hence His(P)-15) is less stable than the wild-type protein. That is, phosphorylation at the regulatory site stabilizes the protein while phosphorylation at the catalytic site destabilizes the protein. The biological ramifications of this result are intriguing, but only speculative without further study. Our results suggest that there is not direct energetic coupling between the regulatory and active sites in bsHPr. Together with the recent structural descriptions of the Ser(P)-46 form of the protein, we can now eliminate several of the possible mechanisms by which protein phosphorylation regulates the activity of bsHPr. The most likely explanation, taking into consideration all we know about the structure and stability of the various forms of HPr, is that serine phosphorylation prevents binding of EI to the Ser(P)-46 form of HPr due to steric and/or electrostatic effects. Introduction of a negative charge at position 46, either through serine phosphorylation or by the mutation of serine to aspartate, must alter the interaction surface, preventing EI from binding and transferring a phosphate group to His-15. Further studies are underway to provide a detailed description of the EI-HPr complex. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the protein engineering approach and the use of double mutant cycles can provide valuable information about the energetic coupling of two sites in a protein, including the specific case of protein phosphorylation. Together with detailed structural information, this approach should be general and should help to shed some light on the mechanism of regulation by protein phosphorylation.

Subsequent studies by Simonet et al. (18Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Shachter et al. (19Shachter N.S. Zhu Y. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Smith J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1699-1707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that this hepatic control region (HCR) is located 19 kb downstream from the transcription start site from the apoE gene and 9 kb downstream from the transcription start site of the apoC-I gene. The HCR contains all sequences necessary to direct expression of both the apoE and apoC-I genes in hepatocytes (18Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): constructs that lacked the HCR were not expressed in the livers of transgenic mice, even at low levels. The presence of a previously characterized enhancer element, which lacks tissue specificity, in the promoter of the apoE gene (20Chang D.J. Paik Y.-K. Leren T.P. Walker D.W. Howlett G.J. Taylor J.M.

These results suggested that interaction of a unique hepatocyte-specific combination of distal elements in the HCR with a nonspecific activator sequence in the promoter directed the expression of the apoE/C-I/C-II locus in the liver. Recently, a second HCR sequence (denoted HCR-2), which shares 85% sequence identity with the initially identified HCR (henceforth referred to as HCR-1), was localized ∼5.5 kb downstream of the apoC-I′ pseudogene and ∼10 kb downstream of HCR-1 (22Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A construct in which the HCR-2 was ligated to the human apoE gene directed high levels in the liver of the transgenic mouse; however, the function of HCR-2 in the apoE gene locus remains to be determined (22Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the regulatory sequences of the HCR-1 region demonstrated that full liver-specific activity is contained within a 319-nucleotide domain, as assayed in transgenic mice (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, HCR-1 has a nuclear scaffold attachment capability that may contribute to an apparent position independence in directing liver-specific transgene expression. In vitro footprinting detected three liver-specific protein footprints in the purified HCR-1 DNA fragment (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this assay, isolated DNA fragments were mixed with mouse liver nuclear extracts to identify protein-binding sites. Unexpectedly, a critical 5′ region required for the activity of the HCR in transgenic mice showed no protein-binding sites, suggesting that this approach may not reveal all of the functional elements in HCR-1. This limitation may be due to the loss or inactivation of nuclear factors during nuclear extract preparation and to the absence of native chromatin structure. In the current study, we employed in vivo footprinting in intact nuclei from human apoE transgenic mice to analyze nuclear protein binding to HCR-1. We used mice expressing the HEG.LE1 construct (18Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the complete apoE gene, together with 5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and 1.7 kb of 3′-flanking sequence, is ligated to a 3.8-kb downstream fragment containing the HCR-1 domain. The results indicate a complex linear-specific nuclear protein-binding pattern that clarifies the regulatory elements of HCR-1. Intact nuclei were isolated from 3-6-month-old, hemizygous transgenic ICR mice bearing 70 copies of the HEG.LE1 construct (18Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

Then, the DNA was extracted and analyzed by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) as described below. Nuclei were isolated, as described by Dang et al. (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S.

The nuclei were diluted to 10 A260/ml with the same buffer, and 0.5-ml aliquots were incubated on ice for 10 min with or without different amounts of DNase I (2-40 units).

Biol. 1993; 234: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated as described above from different tissues of transgenic mice bearing the HEG.LE1 transgene construct (18Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer A without EDTA (15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 80 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 5% glycerol and 3 mM CaCl2. The nuclei were diluted to 10 A260/ml with the same buffer, and 0.5-ml aliquots were incubated at 37°C for 5 min with or without different amounts of MNase I (1-40 units). The reactions were quenched by addition of 25 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, 25 μl of 5 M NaCl, 5 μl of 10% SDS, 12.5 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8), and 10 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K, and then incubated at 50°C for 1 h. Aliquots were extracted with phenol, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol, then resuspended in 0.1 × TE buffer. DNA was digested with EcoRI to reduce the viscosity prior to analysis. Purified DNA was digested in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM CaCl2 using 1.6 × 10−3 to 1.9 × 10−2 units of MNase/μg of DNA. The digestion was carried out for 5 min at 20°C, then terminated by the addition of EDTA to 10 mM (24Ganter B. Tan S. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purified genomic DNA from transgenic mouse liver was incubated with 0.5% dimethyl sulfate at 20°C for 2 min, quenched by a stop buffer containing 1.5 M sodium acetate (pH 7) and 1 M 2-mercaptoethanol and precipitated with ethanol. The methylated DNA was hydrolyzed using the guanidine-specific reaction of Maxam and Gilbert (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar).

In the present study, illustrated in Fig. 1 (B and C), sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers were used first to generate double-stranded copies of the region of interest (using 1.5-5 μg of genomic DNA from DNase I-digested nuclei or MNase-digested nuclei) in the HCR or to the sequences adjacent to the start site of transgene transcription. The primer locations on the HCR or near the first exon are shown in Fig. 1C. A common linker was ligated to the blunt end of the double-stranded fragments. To increase specificity, a second primer that is internal to the first primer and a primer hybridized to the linker primer were used for subsequent PCR amplification. For maximum resolution, DNA amplification was carried out by either of two reaction systems: (a) Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for first strand synthesis and Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) for PCR (26Arcinas M. Sizer K.C. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21919-21924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or (b) Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for both reactions (27Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Amplified fragments were detected by a radioactively labeled third sequence-specific primer that is internal to the second primer. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the footprint pattern was revealed by gel electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing sequencing gel (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography. Oligonucleotides for in vivo footprinting analysis were synthesized via a nucleic acid synthesis system (Millipore, Bedford, MA), or ordered from Oligo Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). Primers for the common linker were as follows: 1, GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC; and 2, GAATTCAGATC. Specific primers complementary to HCR-1 or the human apoE gene with their last nucleotide positions indicated (Fig. 1C) were those listed below. The assays were carried out essentially as described (20Chang D.J. Paik Y.-K. Leren T.P. Walker D.W. Howlett G.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9496-9504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, 1.2 μg of mouse liver or kidney nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) at 20°C for 5 min in 20 μl of nuclear dialysis buffer. Where appropriate, specific oligonucleotide competitors were added to each sample and incubated at 20°C for 10 min. Then, 2.5 ng of end-labeled oligonucleotide was added to the mixture and incubated at 20°C for 15 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA) buffer, and then the gel was dried and examined by autoradiography. For antibody supershift assays, 2 μl of an antibody to a specific transcription factor was added to the reaction mixture either before or after the addition of poly(dI·dC) and oligonucleotide probes. Then, the reaction was incubated for an additional 20 min. Nuclear extracts from mouse liver and kidney were isolated by the method of Gorski et al. (31Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described (20Chang D.J. Paik Y.-K. Leren T.P. Walker D.W. Howlett G.J. Taylor J.M. J.

Complementary oligonucleotide pairs for gel retardation experiments were obtained from the same sources and annealed in a buffer containing 250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The annealed products were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then labeled by T4 DNA kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Du Pont).

In vivo footprinting of HCR-1 reveals a dense concentration of protein-binding sites in the minimal domain required for full liver-specific expression, shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. In this assay, DNase I penetrates the membranes of intact nuclei and cleaves accessible DNA mainly in those chromatin regions that are decondensed and transcriptionally active. Bound nuclear factors protect the underlying nucleotides from being digested; these sites are identified by subsequent LMPCR, and the exact location of protected sites is determined by analyzing the sequence of guanine nucleotides in amplified control DNA (Fig. 2, lane G). In HCR-1, a low level of DNase I revealed a distinct digestion pattern of protein footprints (Fig. 2, A-D), and most of these footprint sites were still partially protected under a higher level of DNase I digestion (i.e. Fig. 2, A and B, compare lane 4 with lane 5). These footprints were observed when either the 5′ strand (Fig. 2, A and B) or the 3′ strand (Fig. 2, C and D) were examined. The lack of footprints found on HCR-1 in kidney nuclear chromatin indicated that nuclear protein binding was liver-specific.Fig. 3Nucleotide sequence of HCR-1 domain. Panel A, nucleotide sequence of HCR-1 required for full liver expression activity (5-325) and adjacent region (upstream to −60). Panel B, nucleotide sequence of the footprint region of the nearby Alu sequence in the HCR domain. In vivo footprint sequences are boxed, and the arrows indicate TGTTTGC-like motifs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similarly, a cluster of five footprints was detected in the Alu family sequence adjacent to HCR-1 (Fig. 2, E and F), although these footprints tended to be less distinct than those located within the liver-specific HCR-1 domain. Since functional tests in transgenic mice demonstrated that the Alu sequence region was not required for full HCR-1 activity (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the potential role (if any) of this repeated sequence in HCR-1 function remains unclear. Previous in vitro analysis had revealed a limited number of protein-binding sites in the HCR domain when nuclear extracts were incubated with isolated DNA (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this approach, some footprints could have been missed or artifactual footprints might have been observed for various reasons. For example, the appropriate structure for specific protein binding may not be presented by purified, short, linear DNA fragments in vitro. In addition, some transcription factors may have been inactivated or lost during the preparation of nuclear extracts. Nevertheless, all six of the protein-binding sites detected previously by the in vitro assay in a 774-bp HCR-containing fragment were observed by in vivo footprinting, as summarized in Fig. 3. Three of these footprints (Footprints 4-6; Fig. 2, Fig. 3) were in the minimum domain required for high level liver-expressing activity (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), two of which (Footprints 5 and 6) also had been found by an independent laboratory (19Shachter N.S. Zhu Y. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Smith J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1699-1707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, three footprints (Footprints 8, 9, and 12; Fig. 2, Fig. 3) downstream from the minimum HCR domain were detected by both in vitro and in vivo methods. Most of the protein-binding sites identified in intact nuclei are slightly larger than when detected using purified DNA and nuclear extracts (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most notably, Footprint 4 is 20 bp longer in the in vivo experiments. This extended protein-binding sequence includes two tandemly repeated TGTTTGC motifs in addition to the two tandem copies of this motif located within the in vitro footprint region. Only Footprint 5 had essentially the same length when determined by both in vitro and in vivo methods. Previous studies showed that nucleotides 6-72 were involved in liver expression activity, with nucleotides 72-122 being absolutely required for any HCR activity (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, no footprints were detected in this region by in vitro analysis with liver nuclear extracts (19Shachter N.S. Zhu Y. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Smith J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1699-1707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the in vivo method revealed three protein-binding sites (Footprints 1b, 2, and 3; Fig. 2, panels A-D) in this essential regulatory sequence. Footprints 2 and 3, covering nucleotides 61-128 in the required liver expression domain, each contained a sequence that was closely related to the TGTTTGC motif of Footprint 4, differing by only 1 nucleotide at both sites (Fig. 3). The 5′ end of Footprint 1b was marked by a relatively weak sensitivity to DNase I, and it was located at the 5′ boundary of HCR-1. Another footprint (denoted 1a) was found immediately upstream of this boundary and was nearly contiguous with Footprint 1b. Since it had been shown previously that the region of the apolipoprotein E gene locus containing Footprint 1a was not required or involved in liver-specific expression (18Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the protein-binding character of this sequence was not investigated further. An additional new footprint was found near the 3′ portion of the required liver expression domain of HCR-1 (Footprint 7, Fig. 2, panels B and E). No clear footprints were reproducibly detected in the adjacent 75-nucleotide segment downstream of Footprint 7, suggesting that Footprint 7 may constitute the 3′ boundary of the liver expression domain of HCR-1, consistent with functional tests of HCR activity in transgenic mice in which only the region between nucleotides 6 and 325 was required for full liver-specific activity (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The in vivo method also detected two new protein-binding sites, Footprints 10 and 11, in the Alu family member that is adjacent to HCR-1. These in vivo footprints overlapped in the A-rich 3′ tail of this repeated sequence element. The finding of liver-specific nuclear protein-binding sites in the 3′ end of a highly repeated sequence near HCR-1 suggested that this region of the transgenic mouse genome was in a more open chromatin environment in the liver than in the kidney. Nuclear protein binding to the newly detected in vivo footprint sequences was examined by gel retardation assays us"
https://openalex.org/W2078708065,"Heymann nephritis is an experimental rat model for human membranous glomerulonephritis. Two target antigens have been identified in the proximal tubule brush border of rat kidneys. One of them is megalin, a 600-kDa membrane protein that belongs to the family of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related proteins. The other one is receptor-associated protein (RAP), a polypeptide of 40 kDa that associates with members of the LDLR family. Here we show that antibodies produced against recombinant human RAP strongly cross-react with the chicken oocyte receptor for very low density lipoprotein and vitellogenin (LR8), and with two other members of the LDLR family, LDLR-related protein and megalin. The interaction of this antibody with LR8 showed binding characteristics exactly as those demonstrated for the physiological ligands of this receptor, in that binding of the antibody: (i) is Ca2+-dependent; (ii) is abolished by unfolding of the cysteine-rich binding domain by reduction; and (iii) interferes with the binding of very low density lipoprotein and vitellogenin. Immunopurification of the LR8-specific subpopulation of the polyclonal antiserum yielded an IgG fraction strongly reacting with LR8 as well as with RAP. Using recombinant fragments of RAP and peptide mapping, the cross-reacting epitope(s) could be narrowed down to three short sequences (5-7 residues) in the COOH-terminal part of the protein. After immunization with RAP, anti-LR8 antibodies and anti-RAP antibodies arise simultaneously, indicating that the receptor-specific activity is not due to anti-idiotypic antibodies. These findings suggest the existence of a common epitope(s) on RAP and members of the LDL receptor family. Based on these results, we present an extended molecular model for the development of passive Heymann nephritis.

At the same time, a putative target antigen in Heymann nephritis (HN), an experimental rat model of human membranous nephropathy, was identified and cloned (3Pietromonaco S. Kerjaschki D. Binder S. Ullrich R. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1811-1815Google Scholar). On molecular characterization of RAP, it became evident that the protein identified as the target antigen in HN was identical to RAP and not, as previously assumed, a fragment of glycoprotein 330/megalin (4Strickland D.K.

RAP subsequently was shown to bind not only to LRP but also to other members of the LDLR family, including megalin (5Orlando R.A. Kerjaschki D. Kurihara H. Biemesderfer D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl.

The latter experiments especially have established the role of LRP as a chylomicron remnant receptor in the liver. Despite the successful use of RAP to study the physiological function(s) of members of the LDLR family and of LRP in particular, clues about the function of RAP in vivo emerged only recently. The tetrapeptide sequence HNEL at the carboxyl terminus of RAP was shown to be necessary for the retention of RAP in the endoplasmic reticulum; thus, RAP associates in vivo with LRP early in the secretory pathway and dissociates from the receptor before reaching the cell surface (16Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Google Scholar). These results suggested a specialized role of RAP as a chaperon for LRP, possibly regulating the interaction of the receptor with ligands along the secretory pathway. This was confirmed by elegant studies by Herz and colleagues in RAP knockout mice (17Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Google Scholar) and in cultured cells in experiments relating the biosynthesis and functional expression of LRP and megalin with that of RAP (18Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Google Scholar). These experiments show that at least one of the physiological functions of RAP can be defined as that of a specialized escort protein, which protects certain receptors from ligand-induced aggregation along their intracellular itinerary. receptor-associated protein low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR-related protein very low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR relative with eight ligand binding repeats Heymann nephritis glutathione S-transferase horseradish peroxidase. We have previously shown that LR8 can serve as a model system to study ligand binding and structural aspects of LDLR family members (8Hiesberger T. Hermann M. Jacobsen L. Novak S. Hodits R.A. Bujo H.

Here we have used LR8 to demonstrate that all receptors that strongly bind RAP share a common immunological epitope with the escort protein. Based on this observation, we propose a model for the development of passive Heymann nephritis induced by anti-RAP antibodies, in which megalin present in the brush borders of the proximal kidney tubule in rats constitutes an additional target antigen. VLDL was prepared from plasma of estrogen-treated roosters by sequential ultracentrifugation according to the method of George et al. (21George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Google Scholar). VLDL was labeled with 125I to a specific activity of 250-400 cpm/ng using the iodine monochloride method as described previously (22Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 788-792Google Scholar). Vitellogenin was purified from plasma of estrogen-treated roosters by ion exchange chromatography (DEAE-cellulose) as described (23Stifani S. George R. Schneider W.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 467-475Google Scholar). Recombinant RAP was produced as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein using a pGEX 2T-derived (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) expression plasmid in DH5α bacteria (13Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Google Scholar). Purified RAP·GST was cleaved by incubating 10 mg of the fusion protein in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5, for 12 h at 37°C with 10 units of thrombin in a final volume of 5 ml. For immunization, the cleaved RAP was purified by preparative, nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluted from the gel by electroelution using the Elutrap system (Schleicher & Schuell). Bovine lactoferrin was obtained from Serva (Vienna, Austria). Purified human RAP was a gift from D. Strickland (Biochemistry Laboratory, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). Oocyte membranes were prepared from previtellogenic follicles (4-6 mm diameter) excised from mature laying hens and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (21George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Google Scholar). Membrane extracts from rat (male Lewis) kidney microvilli were prepared as described (24Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5557-5561Google Scholar). LdlA-7 cells carrying an expression plasmid (phVLR2) for the human VLDL receptor (25Sakai J. Hoshino A. Takahashi S. Miura Y. Ishii H. Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2173-2182Google Scholar) and control cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mML-glutamine, 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.7 mg/ml G418 for 48 h. For Western blotting experiments, cell monolayers were processed as described (26Hayashi K. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3131-3139Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against LR8 were described previously (27Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant human RAP·GST and RAP were obtained by immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with the purified proteins as described (28Nimpf J. George R. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 657-667Google Scholar). IgG fractions were purified from sera on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B matrix (Pharmacia) according to the method of Beisiegel et al. (29Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Google Scholar). RAP·GST was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions (5 mg of RAP·GST/ml column material). Ten mg of protein A-purified anti-RAP·GST IgG in 5 ml of buffer A (90 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) was applied onto the column, and the flow-through was recycled two times. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer A, and bound antibodies were eluted in two batches using 1 ml of 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5, in each step. Eluted IgG was pooled and dialyzed against buffer A for 12 h. To immunopurify anti-RAP·GST antibodies on LR8, a partially purified receptor preparation (30Barber D.L. Sanders E.J. Aebersold R. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18761-18770Google Scholar) was electrophoretically separated on 4,5-18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The region of the membrane containing LR8 was cut out, and the membrane was blocked for 2 h in ligand blot buffer (90 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 2 mM CaCl2, and 5% nonfat dry milk, pH 7.2). The membrane was incubated with protein-A purified anti-RAP·GST IgG (10 mg) in a volume of 5 ml of the same buffer for 1 h and then washed three times for 10 min and two times for 30 min with ligand blot buffer. Elution of bound antibodies was performed by incubating the membranes two times for 1 min each in 1 ml of 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5. Samples obtained from both elution steps were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A for 12 h. One-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions was performed according to the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 4.5-18% gradient slab gels at 180 V for 60 min using the Minigel system from Bio-Rad. Relative molecular masses of proteins were estimated with the broad range molecular mass standard (6-200 kDa) from Bio-Rad. Electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Corp.) was performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 0.15 M glycine buffer, pH 8.4, for 90 min at 200 mA. After transfer, proteins were visualized by staining with Ponceau S (0.2 g/liter and 3 g/liter trichloroacetic acid) and rinsing with H2O. Nitrocellulose membranes used for Western blot analysis were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound polyclonal antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated protein A and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Renaissance™ system, DuPont). Membranes were exposed on Reflectron™ film (DuPont) for the times indicated. Ligand blotting with radiolabeled VLDL was performed as described (21George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Google Scholar). LR8 was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip using an amine-coupling kit (Pharmacia; Ref. 32Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar) as follows. Purified receptor (15 μl of 10 μg/ml) diluted in immobilization buffer (10 mM NaAc, pH 4.0) was used and yielded 1500 response units. Recombinant RAP·GST (5 μl of 25 μg/ml) in immobilization buffer yielded 1200 response units. All determinations were performed at 25°C in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 0.05% BIAcore surfactant P20, pH 7.4, with a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min and an injected sample volume of 35 μl for the antibodies. IgG immunopurified on LR8 was injected at concentrations of 2 × 10−9-6.7 × 10−10M, and total IgG was used at concentrations between 3 × 10−7 and 1 × 10−7M. Two consecutive 4-μl injections of 10 mM HCl were used for regeneration. The calculation of the off and on rates was performed with the BIAevaluation program, version 2.0 (Pharmacia). Lewis rats were injected in the tail vein with 10 mg of anti-RAP IgG in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Animals were sacrificed on day 3, and kidneys were flushed blood-free with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by perfusion fixation with paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate solution, as described (33McLean I.W. Nakane P.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed on 1-μm frozen sections of paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate-fixed kidneys cut on a Reichert Ultracut ultramicrotome equipped with an F4 cryostage, as described (34Kerjaschki D. Sawada H. Farquhar M.G. Kidney Int. 1986; 30: 229-245Google Scholar). Immune deposits were detected by direct immunofluorescence with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY). Sections were examined and photographed on a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axiophot 20 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. The use of experimental animals was authorized by the Austrian Ministry of Science. SPOTs membranes (Imperial Chemical Industries, Cambridge, United Kingdom) were obtained with 96 preformed spots in which a single amino acid was conjugated to the cellulose matrix as an anchoring site for peptides. NH2-terminally acetylated peptides (157 11-mer peptides with a 2-amino acid offset covering the entire sequence of RAP) were synthesize as described (35Kerjaschki D. Ullrich R. Exner M. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2007-2015Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with anti-RAP IgG (0.1 mg/ml) overnight and stained with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to β-galactosidase (1:200, Genosys) and the staining reagents provided with the kit (Genosys). Panels of polyclonal antibodies against recombinant and purified human RAP obtained from different sources and laboratories have been used in our laboratory to study the expression of RAP in chicken tissues. Surprisingly, in addition to recognizing chicken RAP, most of these antibodies persistently reacted with a 95-kDa protein present in chicken oocyte membrane extracts but absent from all other chicken tissues tested. The expression pattern and the relative molecular mass of this cross-reacting protein identify it as the chicken oocyte receptor for vitellogenin and VLDL (LR8) (7Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Google Scholar, 27Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Google Scholar). To study this phenomenon in detail, we prepared antibodies in rabbits against purified recombinant human RAP·GST as well as the cleaved RAP portion thereof. A Western blot with a representative antibody preparation against the fusion protein is shown in Fig. 1. This antibody reacted with purified human RAP (lane 1), with both portions of the cleaved GST fusion protein (lane 2), and with the uncleaved fusion protein (lane 3). As demonstrated in Fig. 2, this antibody also strongly reacts with chicken LR8. In Western blots using crude oocyte membrane extracts, both the 95-kDa protein and RAP are dominantly labeled (Fig. 2A, lane 1). After long exposure of the blot, another high molecular mass band became visible (see Fig. 2B). Control blots with crude extracts using an anti-LR8 antibody that cross-reacts with oocyte-specific LRP (8Hiesberger T. Hermann M. Jacobsen L. Novak S. Hodits R.A. Bujo H. Meilinger M. Hüttinger M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18219-18226Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and with purified LR8 using the anti-RAP antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 3) clearly show that the 95-kDa protein is chicken LR8. The cross-reactivity with LR8 is not species-restricted, since the human VLDLR (25Sakai J. Hoshino A. Takahashi S. Miura Y. Ishii H. Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2173-2182Google Scholar), which is the mammalian homologue of chicken LR8, also reacts with the antibody. This is shown in Fig. 2A, lane 7, in which an extract of LdlA-7 cells stably transformed with an expression plasmid for the human VLDLR was blotted with the anti-RAP antibody. In Fig. 2A, lane 4, the same band is visualized with an anti-human VLDLR antibody. As a control for both antibodies, mock-transfected cells were used (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). The nature of the additional distinct band above the human VLDLR seen in control and transfected LdlA-7 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7) with the anti-RAP antibody is not clear yet. Since these cells lack LDL receptor expression, the cross-reacting protein might be a hitherto unknown member of the LDL receptor family.Fig. 2Western blot analysis of various cell extracts and partially purified members of the LDL receptor family. A, Western blots of membrane Triton X-100 extracts prepared from chicken follicles (lanes 1 and 2, 5 μg/lane), 50 ng of purified LR8 (lane 3), and membrane extracts prepared from LdlA-7 cells transfected with a human VLDLR expression plasmid (lanes 4 and 7) or transfected with an empty control plasmid (lanes 5 and 6). Lanes 1, 3, 6, and 7 were incubated with the anti-RAP antibody (protein A purified, 10 μg/ml), lane 2 with anti LR8-antibody (2 μg/ml), and lanes 4 and 5 with anti-human VLDLR-antibody (10 μg/ml). B, Western blots of LDL receptor relatives from chicken follicles partially purified on RAP-Sepharose (lane 1) or purified chicken LRP (lane 2). Both lanes were incubated with anti-RAP IgG (protein A purified, 10 μg/ml). C, Western blots of a crude rat kidney microvilli Triton X-100 extract (lane 1, 5 μg) and purified megalin (lane 2, 50 ng). Both lanes were incubated with anti-RAP IgG (protein A purified, 10 μg/ml). Bound IgG was visualized with protein A-HRP (1 μg/ml) and a chemiluminescence system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We wanted to know whether the cross-reactivity of the anti-RAP antibody is restricted to VLDL receptors or applies to further members of this receptor family. Thus, we tested a fraction of the chicken oocyte membrane extract that had been enriched by RAP-Sepharose chromatography for LDL receptor relatives. In such a fraction, a high molecular mass band with the same electrophoretic mobility as the band seen in Fig. 2A, lane 1, after long exposure became clearly visible (Fig. 2B, lane 1). This band is somatic LRP, previously shown to be present in whole follicles (36Nimpf J. Stifani S. Bilous P.T. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 212-219Google Scholar), as demonstrated by comparison with purified chicken LRP-515 (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Rat megalin, an additional member of the LDLR family, also is recognized by the anti-RAP antibody, as demonstrated in Fig. 2C, using crude extracts from rat kidney microvilli (lane 1) as well as the purified protein (lane 2). Surprisingly, the LDLR itself does not react with the anti-RAP antibody. This was analyzed with human embryo fibroblasts grown either in the presence of fetal calf serum to suppress the LDL receptor or with the addition of lipoprotein-deficient serum to maximally induce the expression of the receptor (26Hayashi K. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3131-3139Google Scholar), as well as with membrane extracts from bovine adrenal cortex (37; data not shown). The observation that not only LR8 but also megalin, which is involved in the development of passive and active HN, cross-reacts with an antibody against RAP, which is associated with megalin and also a target antigen for the development of passive HN, is intriguing. Since chicken LR8 is highly abundant, easily obtained, and well characterized, we used this protein as a model system to further study the interaction of anti-RAP-antibodies with members of the LDLR family. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the electrophoretic mobility of LR8 decreases on reduction (lanes 1 and 2). This is due to unfolding of the ligand binding domain held in a rigid conformation by intramolecular disulfide bonds. The interaction of the anti-RAP antibody with LR8 is completely abolished on reduction of the receptor (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), whereas the recognition of RAP is independent of disulfide-mediated folding of the protein. This result suggests that the cross-reacting epitope on the receptor is not a linear epitope but, rather, a structural one. Results presented in Fig. 4 further support this notion. In sharp contrast to the interaction with RAP, binding of the antibody to the receptor is competed for by an excess of physiological ligands for the receptor, such as vitellogenin (Fig. 4, lane 2), VLDL (Fig. 4, lane 3), and lactoferrin (Fig. 4, lane 4). In addition, antibody binding to the receptor and, to a weaker extent, to RAP, is Ca2+-dependent, since the addition of 20 mM EDTA completely inhibits the reaction with the receptor and significantly reduces that with RAP (Fig. 4, lane 5). These results strongly suggest that the antibody reacts like a ligand for the receptor. To demonstrate that this observation is not produced by an experimental artifact, we performed the reverse inhibition experiment using radiolabeled VLDL with and without the addition of an excess of the antibody. As seen in Fig. 4 (lanes 6 and 7), a 1000-fold molar excess of anti-RAP antibody completely inhibits the binding of VLDL to its receptor. Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest that the anti-RAP-antibody reacts with the ligand binding domain of the receptor and that the binding characteristics of the antibody are similar to those of the physiological ligands for the receptor.Fig. 4Competitive Western and Ligand blot analysis for chicken LR8. Crude membrane extracts (Triton X-100, 5 μg/lane) of chicken follicles were subjected to electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions on a 4.5-18% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots with anti-RAP·antibody (protein A purified, 10 μg/ml) were performed with the following additions: lane 1, none; lane 2, vitellogenin (0.3 mg/ml); lane 3, VLDL (1.5 mg/ml); lane 4, lactoferrin (0.2 mg/ml); and lane 5, EDTA (20 mM). Ligand blots with 125I-labeled VLDL (5 μg/ml, 300 cpm/ng) were performed without (lane 6) and with (lane 7) the addition of 2.5 mg/ml anti-RAP IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been described that, sporadically, mice immunized with ligands or their respective receptors spontaneously develop anti-idiotypic antibodies to the receptors or the ligands, respectively (38Gaulton G.N. Greene M.I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 253-280Google Scholar). To test whether the effect described here can be explained by idiotypic mimicry of the receptor, we designed the following experiments. First, we immunized four rabbits with RAP·GST and monitored the appearance of antibodies against RAP and LR8. In a standardized Western blot system, the first positive reactions against RAP and LR8 coincided (2 weeks after the first injection of the antigen) in all four rabbits. Second, the protein A-purified IgG fraction cross-reacting with LR8 was immunopurified on RAP, the original antigen, as well as on pure receptor. As demonstrated in Fig. 5A, IgG purified on RAP reacts with both antigens, indistinguishable from the reaction of the complete fraction. In addition, IgG immunopurified on LR8 still recognizes RAP, as shown in Fig. 5B. This result, together with the time course of the appearance of the reactivity toward RAP and the receptor following the immunization, excludes the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies. As demonstrated above, it is possible to immunopurify small amounts of an IgG fraction on purified LR8 spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The amount of IgG in the eluted fraction was sufficient to determine its binding affinity to LR8 and to compare it with the affinity of the total (protein A-purified) IgG fraction toward the original antigen (RAP). Analysis was performed by plasmon surface resonance on the BIAcore system, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunopurified fraction bound to purified LR8 with an extremely high affinity constant (Kaff = 2.5 × 1010M). In comparison, total IgG bound to RAP with a Kaff of 1.3 × 108. This value is well within the range of affinities of polyclonal antibodies toward their antigens. As a control we used the total IgG fraction in vivo to evaluate the actual immune deposits induced by our antibody. Three days after intravenous injection of anti-RAP IgG into rats, numerous distinct granular immune deposits typical for Heymann nephritis were detected in the peripheral capillary walls of the glomeruli (Fig. 6). In addition, some mesangial binding was observed. Unfortunately this experiment cannot be performed with an IgG fraction immunopurified on pure LR8. This is because at least 5 mg of the purified IgG would be required but it is only possible to obtain μg amounts of this fraction. Finally, we initiated attempts to localize the epitope on RAP responsible for eliciting antibodies that cross-react with members of the LDLR family. In a first step, we analyzed the immunoreactivity of a fusion protein containing 27% of the amino-terminal region (residues 1-86) and com"
