https://openalex.org/W4288425348,"In halide perovskite solar cells the formation of secondary-phase excess lead iodide (PbI 2 ) has some positive effects on power conversion efficiency (PCE) but can be detrimental to device stability and lead to large hysteresis effects in voltage sweeps. We converted PbI 2 into an inactive (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl compound by RbCl doping, which effectively stabilizes the perovskite phase. We obtained a certified PCE of 25.6% for FAPbI 3 (FA, formamidinium) perovskite solar cells on the basis of this strategy. Devices retained 96% of their original PCE values after 1000 hours of shelf storage and 80% after 500 hours of thermal stability testing at 85°C."

We report a bioadhesive ultrasound (BAUS) device that consists of a thin and rigid ultrasound probe robustly adhered to the skin via a couplant made of a soft, tough, antidehydrating, and bioadhesive hydrogel-elastomer hybrid. The BAUS device provides 48 hours of continuous imaging of diverse internal organs, including blood vessels, muscle, heart, gastrointestinal tract, diaphragm, and lung. The BAUS device could enable diagnostic and monitoring tools for various diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4288425304,"Record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been obtained with the organic hole transporter 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Conventional doping of spiro-OMeTAD with hygroscopic lithium salts and volatile 4- tert -butylpyridine is a time-consuming process and also leads to poor device stability. We developed a new doping strategy for spiro-OMeTAD that avoids post-oxidation by using stable organic radicals as the dopant and ionic salts as the doping modulator (referred to as ion-modulated radical doping). We achieved PCEs of &gt;25% and much-improved device stability under harsh conditions. The radicals provide hole polarons that instantly increase the conductivity and work function (WF), and ionic salts further modulate the WF by affecting the energetics of the hole polarons. This organic semiconductor doping strategy, which decouples conductivity and WF tunability, could inspire further optimization in other optoelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W4288425163,"The cilium is an antenna-like organelle that performs numerous cellular functions, including motility, sensing, and signaling. The base of the cilium contains a selective barrier that regulates the entry of large intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains, which carry cargo proteins required for ciliary assembly and maintenance. However, the native architecture of the ciliary base and the process of IFT train assembly remain unresolved. In this work, we used in situ cryo–electron tomography to reveal native structures of the transition zone region and assembling IFT trains at the ciliary base in Chlamydomonas . We combined this direct cellular visualization with ultrastructure expansion microscopy to describe the front-to-back stepwise assembly of IFT trains: IFT-B forms the backbone, onto which bind IFT-A, dynein-1b, and finally kinesin-2 before entry into the cilium."
https://openalex.org/W4288423443,"Nanoscale ionic programmable resistors for analog deep learning are 1000 times smaller than biological cells, but it is not yet clear how much faster they can be relative to neurons and synapses. Scaling analyses of ionic transport and charge-transfer reaction rates point to operation in the nonlinear regime, where extreme electric fields are present within the solid electrolyte and its interfaces. In this work, we generated silicon-compatible nanoscale protonic programmable resistors with highly desirable characteristics under extreme electric fields. This operation regime enabled controlled shuttling and intercalation of protons in nanoseconds at room temperature in an energy-efficient manner. The devices showed symmetric, linear, and reversible modulation characteristics with many conductance states covering a 20× dynamic range. Thus, the space-time-energy performance of the all–solid-state artificial synapses can greatly exceed that of their biological counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W4288425123,"Our understanding of the physical principles organizing the genome in the nucleus is limited by the lack of tools to directly exert and measure forces on interphase chromosomes in vivo and probe their material nature. Here, we introduce an approach to actively manipulate a genomic locus using controlled magnetic forces inside the nucleus of a living human cell. We observed viscoelastic displacements over micrometers within minutes in response to near-piconewton forces, which are consistent with a Rouse polymer model. Our results highlight the fluidity of chromatin, with a moderate contribution of the surrounding material, revealing minor roles for cross-links and topological effects and challenging the view that interphase chromatin is a gel-like material. Our technology opens avenues for future research in areas from chromosome mechanics to genome functions."
https://openalex.org/W4288422717,"Much uncertainty exists about the vulnerability of valuable tidal marsh ecosystems to relative sea level rise. Previous assessments of resilience to sea level rise, to which marshes can adjust by sediment accretion and elevation gain, revealed contrasting results, depending on contemporary or Holocene geological data. By analyzing globally distributed contemporary data, we found that marsh sediment accretion increases in parity with sea level rise, seemingly confirming previously claimed marsh resilience. However, subsidence of the substrate shows a nonlinear increase with accretion. As a result, marsh elevation gain is constrained in relation to sea level rise, and deficits emerge that are consistent with Holocene observations of tidal marsh vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W4288424535,"Covalent modification of carbon nanotubes is a promising strategy for engineering their electronic structures. However, keeping modification sites in registration with a nanotube lattice is challenging. We report a solution using DNA-directed, guanine (G)-specific cross-linking chemistry. Through DNA screening we identify a sequence, C 3 GC 7 GC 3 , whose reaction with an (8,3) enantiomer yields minimum disorder-induced Raman mode intensities and photoluminescence Stokes shift, suggesting ordered defect array formation. Single-particle cryo–electron microscopy shows that the C 3 GC 7 GC 3 functionalized (8,3) has an ordered helical structure with a 6.5 angstroms periodicity. Reaction mechanism analysis suggests that the helical periodicity arises from an array of G-modified carbon-carbon bonds separated by a fixed distance along an armchair helical line. Our findings may be used to remodel nanotube lattices for novel electronic properties."
https://openalex.org/W4288424910,"Approximately half of glioblastoma and more than two-thirds of grade II and III glioma tumors lack the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine methyl transferase (MGMT). MGMT-deficient tumors respond initially to the DNA methylation agent temozolomide (TMZ) but frequently acquire resistance through loss of the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. We report the development of agents that overcome this resistance mechanism by inducing MMR-independent cell killing selectively in MGMT-silenced tumors. These agents deposit a dynamic DNA lesion that can be reversed by MGMT but slowly evolves into an interstrand cross-link in MGMT-deficient settings, resulting in MMR-independent cell death with low toxicity in vitro and in vivo. This discovery may lead to new treatments for gliomas and may represent a new paradigm for designing chemotherapeutics that exploit specific DNA repair defects."
https://openalex.org/W4288422732,"We analyzed 131 human brains (44 neurotypical, 19 with Tourette syndrome, 9 with schizophrenia, and 59 with autism) for somatic mutations after whole genome sequencing to a depth of more than 200×. Typically, brains had 20 to 60 detectable single-nucleotide mutations, but ~6% of brains harbored hundreds of somatic mutations. Hypermutability was associated with age and damaging mutations in genes implicated in cancers and, in some brains, reflected in vivo clonal expansions. Somatic duplications, likely arising during development, were found in ~5% of normal and diseased brains, reflecting background mutagenesis. Brains with autism were associated with mutations creating putative transcription factor binding motifs in enhancer-like regions in the developing brain. The top-ranked affected motifs corresponded to MEIS (myeloid ectopic viral integration site) transcription factors, suggesting a potential link between their involvement in gene regulation and autism."
https://openalex.org/W4288423906,"The long-held belief that animal-mediated pollination is absent in the sea has recently been contradicted in seagrasses, motivating investigations of other marine phyla. This is particularly relevant in red algae, in which female gametes are not liberated and male gametes are not flagellated. Using experiments with the isopod Idotea balthica and the red alga Gracilaria gracilis , we demonstrate that biotic interactions dramatically increase the fertilization success of the alga through animal transport of spermatia on their body. This discovery suggests that animal-mediated fertilization could have evolved independently in terrestrial and marine environments and raises the possibility of its emergence in the sea before plants moved ashore."
https://openalex.org/W4288426049,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic, the accompanying lockdown measures, and their possible long-term effects have made mental health a pressing public health concern. Acts that focus on benefiting others—known as prosocial behaviors—offer one promising intervention that is both flexible and low cost. However, neither the range of emotional states prosocial acts impact nor the size of those effects is currently clear—both of which directly influence its attractiveness as a treatment option. Objective To assess the effect of prosocial activity on emotional well-being (happiness, belief that one’s life is valuable) and mental health (anxiety, depression). Methods 1,234 respondents from the United States and Canada were recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and randomly assigned (by computer software) to perform prosocial (N = 411), self-focused (N = 423), or neutral (N = 400) behaviors three times a week for three weeks. A follow-up assessment was given two weeks after the intervention. Participants were blind to alternative conditions. Analyses were based on 1052 participants (N prosocial = 347, N self = 365, N neutral = 340). Findings Those in the prosocial condition did not differ on any outcome from those in the self-focused or neutral acts conditions during the intervention or at follow-up, nor did prosocial effects differ for those who had been negatively affected socially or economically by the pandemic (all p ’s &gt; 0.05). Exploratory analyses that more tightly controlled for study compliance found that prosocial acts reduced anxiety relative to neutral acts control (β = -0.12 [95% CI: -0.22 to -0.02]) and increased the belief that one’s life is valuable (β = 0.11 [95% CI: 0.03 to 0.19]). These effects persisted throughout the intervention and at follow-up. Conclusion Prosocial acts may provide small, lasting benefits to emotional well-being and mental health. Future work should replicate these results using tighter, pre-registered controls on study compliance."
https://openalex.org/W4288431687,"Likert response surveys are widely applied in marketing, public opinion polls, epidemiological and economic disciplines. Theoretically, Likert mapping from real-world beliefs could lose significant amounts of information, as they are discrete categorical metrics. Similarly, the subjective nature of Likert-scale data capture, through questionnaires, holds the potential to inject researcher biases into the statistical analysis. Arguments and counterexamples are provided to show how this loss and bias can potentially be substantial under extreme polarization or strong beliefs held by the surveyed population, and where the survey instruments are poorly controlled. These theoretical possibilities were tested using a large survey with 14 Likert-scaled questions presented to 125,387 respondents in 442 distinct behavioral-demographic groups. Despite the potential for bias and information loss, the empirical analysis found strong support for an assumption of minimal information loss under Normal beliefs in Likert scaled surveys. Evidence from this study found that the Normal assumption is a very good fit to the majority of actual responses, the only variance from Normal being slightly platykurtic (kurtosis ~ 2) which is likely due to censoring of beliefs after the lower and upper extremes of the Likert mapping. The discussion and conclusions argue that further revisions to survey protocols can assure that information loss and bias in Likert-scaled data are minimal."
https://openalex.org/W4288445133,"Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) diagnosis would greatly benefit from the identification of novel biomarkers to complement D-dimer, a marker limited by low specificity. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been shown to promote thrombosis and could hypothetically be used for diagnosis of acute VTE. Objectives To assess the levels of specific markers of neutrophil activation and NETs and compare their diagnostic accuracy to D-dimer. Methods We measured plasma levels of neutrophil activation marker neutrophil elastase (NE), the NET marker nucleosomal citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit-DNA) and cell-free DNA in patients (n = 294) with suspected VTE (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis) as well as healthy controls (n = 30). A total of 112 VTE positive and 182 VTE negative patients from two prospective cohort studies were included. Results Higher levels of H3Cit-DNA and NE, but not cell-free DNA, were associated with VTE. Area under receiver operating curves (AUC) were 0.90 and 0.93 for D-dimer, 0.65 and 0.68 for NE and 0.60 and 0.67 for H3Cit-DNA in the respective cohorts. Adding NE and H3Cit-DNA to a D-dimer based risk model did not improve AUC. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the presence of neutrophil activation and NET formation in VTE using specific markers. However, the addition of NE or H3Cit-DNA to D-dimer did not improve the discrimination compared to D-dimer alone. This study provides information on the feasibility of using markers of NETs as diagnostic tools in acute VTE. Based on our findings, we believe the potential of these markers are limited in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W4288431701,"Virus neutralization assays provide a means to quantitate functional antibody responses that block virus infection. These assays are instrumental in defining vaccine and therapeutic antibody potency, immune evasion by viral variants, and post-infection immunity. Here we describe the development, optimization and evaluation of a live virus microneutralization assay specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this assay, SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates are pre-incubated with serial diluted antibody and added to Vero E6 cells. Replicating virus is quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the standardized 50% virus inhibition titer calculated. We evaluated critical test parameters that include virus titration, assay linearity, number of cells, viral dose, incubation period post-inoculation, and normalization methods. Virus titration at 96 hours was determined optimal to account for different growth kinetics of clinical isolates. Nucleocapsid protein levels directly correlated with virus inoculum, with the strongest correlation at 24 hours post-inoculation. Variance was minimized by infecting a cell monolayer, rather than a cell suspension. Neutralization titers modestly decreased with increasing numbers of Vero E6 cells and virus amount. Application of two different normalization models effectively reduced the intermediate precision coefficient of variance to <16.5%. The SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay described and evaluated here is based on the influenza virus microneutralization assay described by WHO, and are proposed as a standard assay for comparing neutralization investigations."
https://openalex.org/W4288432591,"Currently, hydrogels are considered as ideal biomaterials due to their unique structure and characteristics that facilitates considerable hydrophilicity, swelling, drug loading and release. In this study, we report pH-responsive GG-MAA-AMPS hydrogel delivery system prepared via free radical polymerization technique. Hydrogels were loaded with Metformin HCl as a model drug. Hydrogels were characterized through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FTIR confirmed the successful crosslinking of reactants, hydrogel network formation and drug loading. TGA and DSC proved the higher thermal stability of reactants after crosslinking and drug loading. XRD analysis showed decrease in crystallinity of drug after loading into the hydrogels. SEM revealed smooth and glassy appearance of both loaded and unloaded hydrogels. Gel content was increased with increase in concentration of reactants. Drug entrapment was decreased by increasing concentration of GG and AMPS while MAA acted inversely. Hydrogels displayed pH-dependent swelling and drug release behavior being high at pH 6.8 and 7.4 while low at acidic pH (1.2). Oral tolerability in rabbits showed that hydrogels were safe without causing any hematological or histopathological changes in healthy rabbits. Based on the obtained results, GG-MAA-AMPS can be considered as potential carrier for metformin HCl as well as other hydrophilic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4288433426,"Identifying COVID-19 patients that are most likely to progress to a severe infection is crucial for optimizing care management and increasing the likelihood of survival. This study presents a machine learning model that predicts severe cases of COVID-19, defined as the presence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and highlights the different risk factors that play a significant role in disease progression.A cohort composed of 289,351 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 was created using US administrative claims data from Oct 2015 to Jul 2020. For each patient, information about 817 diagnoses, were collected from the medical history ahead of COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome of the study was the presence of ARDS in the 4 months following COVID-19 infection. The study cohort was randomly split into training set used for model development, test set for model evaluation and validation set for real-world performance estimation.We analyzed three machine learning classifiers to predict the presence of ARDS. Among the algorithms considered, a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree had the highest performance with an AUC of 0.695 (95% CI, 0.679-0.709) and an AUPRC of 0.0730 (95% CI, 0.0676 - 0.0823), showing a 40% performance increase in performance against a baseline classifier. A panel of five clinicians was also used to compare the predictive ability of the model to that of clinical experts. The comparison indicated that our model is on par or outperforms predictions made by the clinicians, both in terms of precision and recall.This study presents a machine learning model that uses patient claims history to predict ARDS. The risk factors used by the model to perform its predictions have been extensively linked to the severity of the COVID-19 in the specialized literature. The most contributing diagnosis can be easily retrieved in the patient clinical history and can be used for an early screening of infected patients. Overall, the proposed model could be a promising tool to deploy in a healthcare setting to facilitate and optimize the care of COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W4288436687,"Solute carrier (SLC) proteins represent the largest superfamily of transmembrane transporters. While many of them play key biological roles, their systematic analysis has been hampered by their functional and structural heterogeneity. Based on available nomenclature systems, we hypothesized that many as yet unidentified SLC transporters exist in the human genome, which await further systematic analysis. Here, we present criteria for defining “SLC-likeness” to curate a set of “SLC-like” protein families from the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) and Protein families (Pfam) databases. Computational sequence similarity searches surprisingly identified ~120 more proteins in human with potential SLC-like properties compared to previous annotations. Interestingly, several of these have documented transport activity in the scientific literature. To complete the overview of the “SLC-ome”, we present an algorithm to classify SLC-like proteins into protein families, investigating their known functions and evolutionary relationships to similar proteins from 6 other clinically relevant experimental organisms, and pinpoint structural orphans. We envision that our work will serve as a stepping stone for future studies of the biological function and the identification of the natural substrates of the many under-explored SLC transporters, as well as for the development of new therapeutic applications, including strategies for personalized medicine and drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4288437696,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by inclusions of aggregated α-synuclein (α-Syn). Oxidative stress plays a critical role in nigrostriatal degeneration and is responsible for α-Syn aggregation in PD. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid acts as an effective antioxidant to prevent free radical damage. However, vitamin C is easily oxidized and often loses its physiological activity, limiting its therapeutic potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether NXP031, a new compound we developed consisting of Aptamin C and Vitamin C, is neuroprotective against α-synucleinopathy. To model α-Syn induced PD, we stereotactically injected AAV particles overexpressing human α-Syn into the substantia nigra (SN) of mice. One week after AAV injection, NXP031 was administered via oral gavage every day for eight weeks. We found that oral administration of NXP031 ameliorated motor deficits measured by the rotarod test and prevented the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons caused by WT-α-Syn overexpression in the SN. Also, NXP031 blocked the propagation of aggregated α-Syn into the hippocampus by alleviating oxidative stress. These results indicate that NXP031 can be a potential therapeutic for PD."
https://openalex.org/W4288442277,"Slope One algorithm and its descendants measure user-score distance and use the statistical score distance between users to predict unknown ratings, as opposed to the typical collaborative filtering algorithm that uses similarity for neighbor selection and prediction. Compared to collaborative filtering systems that select only similar neighbors, algorithms based on user-score distance typically include all possible related users in the process, which needs more computation time and requires more memory. To improve the scalability and accuracy of distance-based recommendation algorithm, we provide a user-item link prediction approach that combines user distance measurement with similarity-based user selection. The algorithm predicts unknown ratings based on the filtered users by calculating user similarity and removing related users with similarity below a threshold, which reduces 26 to 29 percent of neighbors and improves prediction error, ranking, and prediction accuracy overall."

https://openalex.org/W4288429810,"Introduction Little is known about the impact of low muscle mass (MM) assessed by calf circumference (CC), arm circumference (AC), arm muscle circumference (AMC), and corrected arm muscle circumference (CAMC)—on mortality risk later in life. We aimed to investigate the impact of low MM assessed by CC, AC, AMC and, CAMC on all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality risk. Methods Data came from 418 older adults who participated in a 10-year follow-up prospective cohort study. Low MM was defined as a CC &lt; 33 cm for women and &lt; 34 cm for men and by the lowest tertile of AC, AMC, and CAMC stratified by sex. The log rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression were used. Results There were 147 deaths: 49 related to CVD and 22 to cancer. A small CC (HR = 1.57, 95% CI, 1.12–2.20), AMC (HR = 1.61, 95% CI, 1.13–2.30) and CAMC (HR = 1.45, 95% CI, 1.03–2.04) were associated with all-cause mortality. A small CAMC was a protective factor for CVD mortality (HR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.22–0.98). In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, older adults with LMM presented low all-cause mortality survival, with AC (p &lt; 0.05), AMC (p &lt; 0.005), CAMC (p &lt; 0.002), and CC (p &lt; 0.001). Cancer mortality was associated with low CAMC (p &lt; 0.020). Conclusions Low MM assessed by anthropometric measures (AC, AMC, CAMC and CC) increased the all-cause mortality risk. A small CAMC decreased the CVD mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4288429840,"Despite extensive global efforts, sub-Saharan Africa remains disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. This generalized epidemic can be seen in Lesotho which in 2014 the HIV prevalence rate of those aged 15-49 years was 24.6%, with and incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100-person-year exposures. To better understand the impact of Lesotho's national HIV response and significant predictors associated with HIV infection, the Lesotho Population-based HIV Impact Assessment was conducted. This survey provided a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 15-59 years old in which participants were tested for HIV and given an individual questionnaire that included socio-demographic and behavioral risk questions. The association of factors between survey questions and HIV incident was assessed using logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression models for men and women were constructed for each outcome using variables known to be or plausibly associated with recent or chronic infection. Overall annualized incidence among people aged 15-49 was 1.19% (95% CI 0.73-1.65) per year. The overall prevalence of HIV was 25.6% with women having significantly higher prevalence. Multiple variables, including decreased wealth status, lower education levels, marital status, condom use at first sex, and circumcision (men only) were identified as being significantly associated with HIV infection for both men and women. In combination with improving the awareness of HIV status, an increased focus is needed on AGYW and men 35-49 years old to prevent new infections. HIV education and prevention programs should focus heavily on younger age groups prior to and soon after sexual debut to prevent HIV transmission. The findings of the survey showed significant room for improvement in increasing awareness of HIV status and reinforcing the need for continued HIV prevention and treatment efforts in Lesotho to prevent new infections."
https://openalex.org/W4288437722,"Introduction Chondrosarcoma, although relatively uncommon, represents a significant percentage of primary osseous tumors. Nonetheless, there are few large-cohort, longitudinal studies of long-term survival and treatment outcomes of chondrosarcoma patients and none using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods Chondrosarcoma patients were identified from the 2004–2015 NCDB datasets and divided on three primary tumor sites: appendicular, axial, and other. Demographic, treatment, and long-term survival data were determined for each group. Multivariate Cox analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to assess long-term survival over time for each. Results In total, 5,329 chondrosarcoma patients were identified, of which 2,686 were appendicular and 1,616 were axial. Survival was higher among the appendicular cohort than axial at 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year (89.52%, 75.76%, and 65.24%, respectively). Multivariate Cox analysis identified patients in the appendicular cohort to have significantly greater likelihood of death with increasing age category, distant metastases at presentation, and male sex (p&lt;0.001 for each). Best outcomes for seen for those undergoing surgical treatment (p&lt;0.001). Patients in the axial cohort were with increased likelihood of death with increasing age category and distant metastases (p&lt;0.001), while surgical treatment with or without radiation were associated with a significant decrease (p&lt;0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed worst survival for the axial cohort (p&lt;0.001) and patients with distant metastases at presentation (p&lt;0.001). Survival was not significantly different between older (2004–2007) and more recent years (2012–2016) (p = 0.742). Conclusions For both appendicular and axial chondrosarcomas, surgical treatment remains the mainstay of treatment due to its continued superiority for the long-term survival of patients, although advancements in survival over the last decade have been insignificant. Presence of distant metastases and axial involvement are significant, poor prognostic factors perhaps because of difficulty in surgical excision or extent of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4288441762,"The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of the orbicularis oculi (OOc) to the zygomaticus major (Zmj) in connecting the orbital region to the corner of the mouth. The OOc and Zmj of 22 embalmed adult Korean cadavers were dissected in 44 hemifaces. The OOc fibers were traced to determine their contribution to the Zmj. Parts of the superficial bundle in the orbital region of the OOc extended directly or indirectly to the Zmj in 22.7% of the specimens. The anatomical contribution of the OOc to the Zmj was divided into three categories depending on whether the connection between them was direct or indirect: (1) superficial orbital OOc fibers extended directly to the Zmj in 6.8% of the specimens, (2) superficial orbital OOc fibers extended to the zygomaticus minor and their small portion joined to the upper fibers of the Zmj in 15.9% of the specimens, and (3) no connection was identified between the OOc and Zmj in 77.3% of the specimens. The results of this study provide further anatomical insight into the relationship between the OOc and zygomaticus muscle complex. This information could be helpful for elucidating the anatomy of smiling and treatment and surgery designs for balanced or ideal smiles."
https://openalex.org/W4288443130,"Central Asia is an important center of origin for many globally valued fruit and nut tree species. Forest degradation and deforestation are cause for concern for the conservation of these valuable species, now confined to small remnant populations. Home gardens have the important function of sustaining household food consumption and income generation, and can potentially play a critical role in conserving diversity of fruit and nut trees. These systems have been very poorly documented in the scientific literature. This study contributes to filling this gap by describing the diversity of fruit and nut trees in home gardens of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, examining their dynamic flow of planting material and its sources, understanding their future prospects, and looking at significant differences between the three countries. Home gardens show a similar portfolio of the most abundant tree species (apple, apricot, walnut, pear, and plum). Although the diversity of tree species and varieties recorded is significant, small population sizes can limit future possibilities for this diversity to thrive, given the pressure on natural stands and on habitats where the preferred species are found. Furthermore, the selection of species and varieties to be planted in home gardens is increasingly influenced by market opportunities and availability of exotic material. Some of the most abundant tree species recorded are represented largely by exotic varieties (apple, pear), while others (e.g., apricot, walnut, plum) are still mainly characterized by traditional local varieties that are not formally registered. Home gardens continue to play a critical role in rural livelihoods and in national economies, and many rural inhabitants still aspire to maintain them. Thus, home gardens should be integrated in national research and extension systems and closely linked to national conservation efforts. Changes and possible declines in the diversity they host, their health status, and resilience should be carefully monitored."
https://openalex.org/W4288443339,"Background Quantitative pupillometry is part of multimodal neuroprognostication of comatose patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, the reproducibility, repeatability, and reliability of quantitative pupillometry in this setting have not been investigated. Methods In a prospective blinded validation study, we compared manual and quantitative measurements of pupil size. Observer and device variability for all available parameters are expressed as mean difference (bias), limits of agreement (LoA), and reliability expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval. Results Fifty-six unique quadrupled sets of measurement derived from 14 sedated and comatose patients (mean age 70±12 years) were included. For manually measured pupil size, inter-observer bias was -0.14±0.44 mm, LoA of -1.00 to 0.71 mm, and ICC at 0.92 (0.86–0.95). For quantitative pupillometry, we found bias at 0.03±0.17 mm, LoA of -0.31 to 0.36 mm and ICCs at 0.99. Quantitative pupillometry also yielded lower bias and LoA and higher ICC for intra-observer and inter-device measurements. Correlation between manual and automated pupillometry was better in larger pupils, and quantitative pupillometry had less variability and higher ICC, when assessing small pupils. Further, observers failed to detect 26% of the quantitatively estimated abnormal reactivity with manual assessment. We found ICC &gt;0.91 for all quantitative pupillary response parameters (except for latency with ICC 0.81–0.91). Conclusion Automated quantitative pupillometry has excellent reliability and twice the reproducibility and repeatability than manual pupillometry. This study further presents novel estimates of variability for all quantitative pupillary response parameters with excellent reliability."
https://openalex.org/W4288445681,"The landscape of farming and plant breeding is rapidly transforming due to the complex requirements of our world. The explosion of collectible data has started a revolution in agriculture to the point where innovation must occur. To a commercial organization, the accurate and efficient collection of information is necessary to ensure that optimal decisions are made at key points of the breeding cycle. In particular, recent technology has enabled organizations to capture in-field images of crops to record color, shape, chemical properties, and disease susceptibility. However, this new challenge necessitates the need for advanced algorithms to accurately identify phenotypic traits. This work, advanced the current literature by developing an innovative deep learning algorithm, named DeepStand, for image-based counting of corn stands at early phenological stages. The proposed method adopts a truncated VGG-16 network to act as a feature extractor backbone. We then combine multiple feature maps with different dimensions to ensure the network is robust against size variation. Our extensive computational experiments demonstrate that our DeepStand framework accurately identifies corn stands and out-performs other cutting-edge methods."

The present study considers the overall effect of Human Development Index (HDI), Socio Demographic Index (SDI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for income to measure how these variables impact Global Burden of Diseases (GDB), bringing a different perspective to the results. Data from over 177 countries mainly including European, Asian, North American, South American, African and Australian regions were analysed from 2000 to 2019. A Panel regression technique was applied, and Fixed Effects (FE) and Random Effects (RE) estimations were chosen to derive outcomes of the Hausman test. The findings reflected that alcohol consumption (wine, beer, spirit and other alcohol) has a positive significant relationship with the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) globally and in the African continent excluding North America and South America. Human Development Index (HDI) have a negative impact on GBD on all countries. Particularly HDI have a negative impact on GBD in African continent except other continents. Also, in the African continent and globally, GBD has a significant positive and in Europe, a significant negative impact on the Socio Demographic Index (SDI). The findings demonstrate the overall picture of the impact of alcohol consumption and other variables on GBD and provide suggestions on how these variables should be tackled in the future to reduce GBD. This is the initial empirical study that investigates the impact of alcohol consumption, analysing the combined effect of HDI, SDI and income on the GBD of continent wise and globally."
https://openalex.org/W4288435605,"The Brazilian palm fruits and hearts-of-palm of Euterpe edulis , E . oleracea and E . precatoria are an important source for agro-industrial production, due to overexploitation, conservation strategies are required to maintain genetic diversity. Chloroplast genomes have conserved sequences, which are useful to explore evolutionary questions. Besides the plastid DNA, genome skimming allows the identification of other genomic resources, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), providing information about the genetic diversity of species. We sequenced the chloroplast genome and identified gene content in the three Euterpe species. We performed comparative analyses, described the polymorphisms among the chloroplast genome sequences (repeats, indels and SNPs) and performed a phylogenomic inference based on 55 palm species chloroplast genomes. Finally, using the remaining data from genome skimming, the nuclear and mitochondrial reads, we identified SNPs and estimated the genetic diversity among these Euterpe species. The Euterpe chloroplast genomes varied from 159,232 to 159,275 bp and presented a conserved quadripartite structure with high synteny with other palms. In a pairwise comparison, we found a greater number of insertions/deletions (indels = 93 and 103) and SNPs (284 and 254) between E . edulis / E . oleracea and E . edulis / E . precatoria when compared to E . oleracea / E . precatoria (58 indels and 114 SNPs). Also, the phylogeny indicated a closer relationship between E . oleracea / E . precatoria . The nuclear and mitochondrial genome analyses identified 1,077 SNPs and high divergence among species (F ST = 0.77), especially between E . edulis and E . precatoria (F ST = 0.86). These results showed that, despite the few structural differences among the chloroplast genomes of these Euterpe palms, a differentiation between E . edulis and the other Euterpe species can be identified by point mutations. This study not only brings new knowledge about the evolution of Euterpe chloroplast genomes, but also these new resources open the way for future phylogenomic inferences and comparative analyses within Arecaceae."

https://openalex.org/W4288431200,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) induced myofibroblast differentiation is central to the pathological scarring observed in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and other fibrotic diseases. Our lab has recently identified expression of GPR68 (Ovarian Cancer Gene Receptor 1, OGR1), a pH sensing G-protein coupled receptor, as a negative regulator of TGF-β induced profibrotic effects in primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs). We therefore hypothesized that small molecule activators of GPR68 would inhibit myofibroblast differentiation. Ogerin is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GPR68, inducing a leftward shift of the dose response curve to proton induced signaling. Using PHLFs derived from patients with both non-fibrotic and IPF diagnoses, we show that Ogerin inhibits, and partially reverses TGF-β induced myofibroblast differentiation in a dose dependent manner. This occurs at the transcriptional level without inhibition of canonical TGF-β induced SMAD signaling. Ogerin induces PKA dependent CREB phosphorylation, a marker of Gαs pathway activation. The ability of Ogerin to inhibit both basal and TGF-β induced collagen gene transcription, and induction of Gαs signaling is enhanced at an acidic pH (pH 6.8). Similar findings were also found using fibroblasts derived from dermal, intestinal, and orbital tissue. The biological role of GPR68 in different tissues, cell types, and disease states is an evolving and emerging field. This work adds to the understanding of Gαs coupled GPCRs in fibrotic lung disease, the ability to harness the pH sensing properties of GPR68, and conserved mechanisms of fibrosis across different organ systems."
https://openalex.org/W4288434357,"Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental disorder in childhood, with a 5%-6% worldwide prevalence. Children with ADHD often demonstrate impaired executive function, which is closely related to the development of the commonly observed behavioral problems such as inattention, impaired inhibition, and hyperactivity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a game-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program can improve the executive function of children with ADHD, compared with a traditional structured aerobic exercise program and a non-treatment control group. Methods/Design A total of 42 children with ADHD will be recruited to participate in this three-arm school-based randomized controlled trial. An 8-week specially designed game-based HIIT (GameHIIT) program and a traditional game-based structured aerobic exercise (GameSAE) program will be delivered to those children randomly assigned to these two intervention groups, while the children in the control group will maintain their regular physical activity over the same period. A number of outcome measures including executive function, cerebral hemodynamic response, physical activity, physical fitness, and enjoyment and adherence to the intervention will be assessed for both groups at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention period (T1), and after the follow-up period (T2). Discussion HIIT has recently emerged as a feasible and efficacious strategy for increasing physical health outcomes and cognitive function, including executive function, in healthy young people. However, research has yet to investigate whether the executive function of children with ADHD can be effectively enhanced through HIIT. If, as hypothesized, GameHIIT program improves outcomes for children with ADHD, the present research will inform the development of targeted exercise programs that can be more broadly used with this particular population."
https://openalex.org/W4288434606,"Background There is consistent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have statistical and clinical significant efficacy to prevent incident and severe cases of COVID-19, although different outcomes were analyzed and different risk reductions were observed. However, randomized control trials (RCT) were not designed or powered to assess whether the vaccines prevent deaths, even though this was a secondary or exploratory outcome across many studies. Early real-world observational data suggest that these vaccines are highly effective in reducing hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Our objective is to summarize and appraise—the existing evidence on the efficacy and real-world effectiveness of all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently approved for full or limited use to prevent all-cause and COVID-19-attributed mortality. Methods The p opulation consists of persons with a record of vaccination status and the outcome of interest. Randomized controlled trials, comparative cohort and case-control studies reporting vaccination with any of the vaccines approved ( i ntervention ) will be eligible. The primary o utcome will be all cause deaths. COVID-19-attributed deaths and deaths attributable to the vaccination (adverse event deaths) will be secondary outcomes. We will c ompare deaths occurring in vaccinated persons versus those non-vaccinated or having received placebo. Studies in any language will be eligible. Two independent reviewers will screen for inclusion and assess quality of studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and the ROBINS-1 tool, as appropriate. Hazard ratios will be calculated. Assessment of statistical heterogeneity amongst the studies will be done using I 2 and prediction intervals, as well as visual inspection of the forest plots. Publication bias will be assessed using a funnel plot and Egger statistical test if we have more than 10 studies in a forest plot. We have followed the PRISMA-Protocol checklist for the current protocol, which is registered at Prospero (York University, CRD42021262211)."
https://openalex.org/W4288436186,"Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) are known to serve as discrimination cues and will trigger defence behaviour in a plethora of eusocial insects. However, little is known how about nestmate recognition ability selects for CHC diversification. In this study we investigate differences in CHC composition of four major honey bee species with respect to the differences in their nesting behavior. In contrast to A . mellifera , A . cerana and A . florea , the giant honey bee A . dorsata prefers to build their nests in aggregations with very small spatial distances between nests, which increases the probability of intrusions. Thus, A . dorsata exhibits a particularly challenging nesting behavior which we hypothesize should be accompanied with an improved nestmate recognition system. Comparative analyses of the worker CHC profiles indicate that A . dorsata workers exhibit a unique and more complex CHC profile than the other three honey bee species. This increased complexity is likely based on a developmental process that retains the capability to synthesize methyl-branched hydrocarbons as adults. Furthermore, two sets of behavioral experiments provide evidence that A . dorsata shows an improved nestmate discrimination ability compared to the phylogenetically ancestral A . florea , which is also open-nesting but does not form nest aggregations. The results of our study suggest that ecological traits like nesting in aggregation might be able to drive CHC profile diversification even in closely related insect species."
https://openalex.org/W4288437357,"Introduction Information on LDL’s dynamic behaviour of LDL (i.e. production rate and fractional catabolic rate) are of interest if pathologies, lipid-lowering strategies or LDL-metabolism itself are investigated. Determination of these rates is costly and elaborate. Here we studied the interrelationship of LDL mass, its composition and other lipoproteins. Based on this data, we deducted information about LDL’s dynamic behaviour. Methods Lipoprotein profiles of n = 236 participants are evaluated. Plasma was separated by sequential ultracentrifugation into VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL. Additionally, LDL and HDL were separated into subfractions. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were used to study LDL’s ApoB mass and lipid composition. Relying on these results and on causation, we constructed a mathematical model to estimate LDL’s retention time. Results The ApoB mass in LDL correlated best among all measured parameters (including corresponding lipid compositions but using no LDL-associated parameters) with the cholesterol ester content in IDL. TG/CE ratios in LDL’s subfractions were strongly correlated with the corresponding ratios in IDL and HDL. The constructed mathematical model links the TG/CE ratio of LDL and HDL to LDL’s ApoB concentration and enables a good estimate of LDL’s retention time in plasma. Discussion Relying on our statistic evaluations, we assume that i) the production of nascent LDL via IDL as well as ii) LDL’s prolonged retention are mapped by the TG/CE ratio in LDL subfractions. HDL’s TG/CE ratio is associated with the change in LDL’s TG/CE ratio during its retention in plasma. Our mathematical model uses this information and enables–by relying on causation- a good estimation of LDL’s retention time."
https://openalex.org/W4288438752,"Smoking among women is characteristically high among call center employees and is associated with various individual and work-related characteristics, which have been paid little attention so far. This study explored the differences in intrapersonal and interpersonal characteristics and environmental factors among Korean women working in call centers by smoking status, based on an ecological model. In this cross-sectional study, an anonymous online survey was conducted among a sample of female employees from three credit card-based call centers (N = 588). Differences in intrapersonal (social nicotine dependence, smoking attitudes, emotional labor), interpersonal (smoking among family or friends, social support), and environmental factors (smoking cessation education, and perceived and preferred smoking policy at work) were compared according to smoking status (smokers, ex-smokers, and never smokers). Approximately 20% (n = 115) were smokers. Smokers were younger, mostly unmarried, had lower education, and had poorer perceived health status than ex- and never smokers. The mean scores for social nicotine dependence and smoking attitude were the highest among smokers, indicating their tendency to underestimate the negative effects of smoking. They also reported the highest level of emotional labor, with about half (50.4%) and almost all (95.7%) reporting smoking behaviors in their families and friends, respectively. Smokers took a lenient stance on the smoking ban policy. The results indicated the necessity to develop tailored smoking cessation programs to motivate female call center employees to quit smoking. As call centers may have a smoking-friendly environment, comprehensive smoking prevention programs considering multilevel factors are required to support smoking cessation."
https://openalex.org/W4288441754,"Background Studies have indicated that the advance care planning knowledge and attitudes of elderly individuals strongly affect their implementation of advance care planning. A measurement with a theoretical base for evaluating elderly individuals’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions regarding advance care planning is lacking. Objectives To develop a questionnaire and understand elderly individuals’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions regarding implementing advance care planning. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted. The content validity index, and statistical methods, including discrimination, factor, and reliability analysis, were adopted for psychometric testing. Descriptive statistics mainly presented data analysis. Results 401 elderly individuals were recruited from a medical center and one senior activity center. The content validity index was approximately 0.71–0.92 for the developed questionnaires, the Kuder–Richardson formula 20 was 0.84 for advance care planning knowledge, and the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.86, 0.94, 0.76, and 0.92 for attitudes, behavioral intentions, influencing factors, and subjective norms, respectively. The average score for advance care planning knowledge for elderly individuals was 4.42, with a correct answer rate of 49.1%. They lacked knowledge of advance care planning-related legislation. The mean score for attitudes and behavioral intentions was 14.32 and 3.48, respectively. Elderly individuals agreed that advance care planning has benefits but were worried about the emotional distress caused by advance care planning discussions. Elderly individuals with positive behavioral intentions tend to implement advance care planning. Spouses, children, doctors, and nurses are significant reference people for elderly individuals. Conclusions The developed questionnaire exhibits good validity and reliability for understanding elderly individuals’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions concerning advance care planning. Advance care planning materials or decision aids suitable for elderly individuals must be developed to increase their understanding of advance care planning. Additionally, the role of nurses is indispensable in promoting advance care planning among elderly individuals."

It is the device owners’ responsibility to ensure that the ownership settings of Internet of things devices are maintained, allowing them to communicate with other user devices autonomously. The ultimate goal of the future Internet of Things is for it to be able to make decisions on its own, without the need for human intervention. Therefore, trust computing and prediction have become more vital in the processing and handling of data as well as in the delivery of services. In this paper, we compute trust in social IoT scenarios using a hybrid approach that combines a distributed computation technique and a global machine learning approach. The approach considers social similarity while assessing other users’ ratings and utilize a cloud-based architecture. Further, we propose a dynamic way to aggregate the different computed trust values. According to the results of the experimental work, it is shown that the proposed approaches outperform related work. Besides, it is shown that the use of machine learning provides slightly better performance than the computing model. Both proposed approaches were found successful in degrading malicious ratings without the need for more complex algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4288429813,"Introduction Community acquired infection (CAI) is the leading indication for paediatric hospitalization in South Africa. Methods We conducted secondary data analysis of prospective, consecutive paediatric admissions to Tygerberg Hospital (May 2015-November 2015). Clinical characteristics, admission diagnosis, appropriateness of diagnostic tests, use of antimicrobial prescriptions, hospital outcome and costs were analyzed. Results CAI episodes were documented in (364/451; 81%) children admitted to the general paediatric ward; median age 4.8 months (Interquartile range, IQR, 1.5–17.5) and weight 5.4kg (IQR, 3.6–9.0). Male gender predominated (210/364; 58%), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection prevalence was 6.0% (22/364). Common CAI types included respiratory tract infections (197; 54%), gastroenteritis (51; 14%), and bloodstream infections (33; 9%). Pre-hospital antibiotics (ceftriaxone) were given to 152/364 (42%). Of 274 blood cultures and 140 cerebrospinal fluid samples submitted, 5% and 2% respectively yielded a pathogen. Common CAI antibiotic treatment regimens included: ampicillin alone (53%); ampicillin plus gentamicin (25%) and ampicillin plus cefotaxime (20%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found in 39% of the children investigated for pneumonia. Most antibiotic prescriptions (323/364; 89%) complied with national guidelines and were appropriately adjusted based on the patient’s clinical condition and laboratory findings. The overall estimated cost of CAI episode management ZAR 22,535 (≈1423 USD) per CAI admission episode. Unfavourable outcomes were uncommon (1% died, 4% required re-admission within 30 days of discharge). Conclusion CAI is the most frequent reason for hospitalization and drives antimicrobial use. Improved diagnostic stewardship is needed to prevent inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions. Clinical outcome of paediatric CAI episodes was generally favourable."
https://openalex.org/W4288431692,"Background Environmental factors can influence the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19. To estimate the true impact of these factors on COVID-19, climate and disease data should be monitored and analyzed over an extended period of time. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are particularly lacking in such studies. This ecological study investigates the association between climate parameters and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the GCC. Methods Data on temperature, wind-speed and humidity and COVID-19 cases and deaths from the six countries of the GCC were collected between 29/1/2020 and 30/3/2021. Using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, we examined associations between climate parameters and COVID-19 cases and deaths by month, over four different time periods. A two-step cluster analysis was conducted to identify distinct clusters of data using climate parameters and linear regression analysis to determine which climate parameters predicted COVID-19 new cases and deaths. Results The United Arab Emirates (UAE) had the highest cumulative number of COVID-19 cases while Bahrain had the highest prevalence rate per 100,000. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) reported the highest cumulative number of deaths while Oman recorded the highest death rate per 100,000. All GCC countries, except the UAE, reported a positive correlation between temperature and cases and deaths. Wind speed was positively correlated with cases in Qatar, but negatively correlated with cases in the UAE and deaths in KSA. Humidity was positively correlated with cases and deaths in Oman, negatively correlated in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and KSA but there was no correlation in the UAE. The most significant predictors in cluster analysis were temperature and humidity, while in the regression analysis, temperature, humidity and wind speed predicted new COVID-19 cases and deaths. Conclusion This study provides comprehensive epidemiological information on COVID-19 and climate parameters and preliminary evidence that climate may play a key role in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. This study will assist decision makers in translating findings into specific guidelines and policies for the prevention and elimination of COVID-19 transmission and infection."
https://openalex.org/W4288432546,"The E . coli element IS 30 has adopted the copy-out-paste-in transposition mechanism that is prevalent in a number of IS-families. As an initial step, IS 30 forms free circular transposition intermediates like IS minicircles or tandem IS-dimers by joining the inverted repeats of a single element or two, sometimes distantly positioned IS copies, respectively. Then, the active IR-IR junction of these intermediates reacts with the target DNA, which generates insertions, deletions, inversions or cointegrates. The element shows dual target specificity as it can insert into hot spot sequences or next to its inverted repeats. In this study the pathways of rearrangements of transposition-derived cointegrate-like structures were examined. The results showed that the probability of further rearrangements in these structures depends on whether the IS elements are flanked by hot spot sequences or take part in an IR-IR junction. The variability of the deriving products increases with the number of simultaneously available IRs and IR-IR joints in the cointegrates or the chromosome. Under certain conditions, the parental structures whose transposition formed the cointegrates are restored and persist among the rearranged products. Based on these findings, a novel dynamic model has been proposed for IS 30 , which possibly fits to other elements that have adopted the same transposition mechanism. The model integrates the known transposition pathways and the downstream rearrangements occurring after the formation of different cointegrate-like structures into a complex network. Important feature of this network is the presence of “feedback loops” and reversible transposition rearrangements that can explain how IS 30 generates variability and preserves the original genetic constitution in the bacterial population, which contributes to the adaptability and evolution of host bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4288437740,"Aims Coronary artery stents have profound effects on arterial function by altering fluid flow mass transport and wall shear stress. We developed a new integrated methodology to analyse the effects of stents on mass transport and shear stress to inform the design of haemodynamically-favourable stents. Methods and results Stents were deployed in model vessels followed by tracking of fluorescent particles under flow. Parallel analyses involved high-resolution micro-computed tomography scanning followed by computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess wall shear stress distribution. Several stent designs were analysed to assess whether the workflow was robust for diverse strut geometries. Stents had striking effects on fluid flow streamlines, flow separation or funnelling, and the accumulation of particles at areas of complex geometry that were tightly coupled to stent shape. CFD analysis revealed that stents had a major influence on wall shear stress magnitude, direction and distribution and this was highly sensitive to geometry. Conclusions Integration of particle tracking with CFD allows assessment of fluid flow and shear stress in stented arteries in unprecedented detail. Deleterious flow perturbations, such as accumulation of particles at struts and non-physiological shear stress, were highly sensitive to individual stent geometry. Novel designs for stents should be tested for mass transport and shear stress which are important effectors of vascular health and repair."

The Cs represent five youth strengths: competence, confidence, character, caring, and connection. The results of the exploratory factor analyses showed a reasonable data fit with the 5-C Model. The total and subscale scores evinced good internal reliability (α = .7 to .9) and the confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the convergence of the five Cs on a second-order latent factor of PYD, showing adequate goodness of fit (CFI = 0.94; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.04). Metric and scalar invariance were found across gender. Metric and partial scalar invariance were found for rural-urban groups. Supportive evidence on convergent and discriminatory validity was also found. We conclude that the Chinese version of the 5-C PYD Scale is a reliable and valid instrument, with good construct validity for Chinese young adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4288446987,"Osa Peninsula in remote southwest Costa Rica harbors 2.5% of global terrestrial biodiversity in only 1,200 km 2 and has the largest remaining tract of Pacific lowland wet forest in Mesoamerica. However, little is known about the marine ecosystems of this diverse region. Much of the coastline consists of soft sediment exposed to strong wave action. Three major hard bottom habitat types define this region, including: 1) coral reefs around Isla del Caño Biological Reserve, a no-take marine protected area (MPA) of 52 km 2 , 2) coastal rocky reefs and islets along the peninsula, including Corcovado National Park, and 3) submerged pinnacles just outside the Isla del Caño MPA. Average coral cover at Isla del Caño was 21%, composed primarily of Porites lobata and Pocillopora elegans . In contrast, coastal rocky reefs were dominated by turf algae (39.8%) and macroalgae (20.7%) with low coral cover (1.1%). Submerged pinnacles were dominated by crustose coralline algae (33.3%) and erect coralline algae (25.7%). Fish assemblage characteristics (species richness, abundance, biomass) were significantly higher at the pinnacles compared to the other habitats and was dominated by schooling species such as Haemulon steindachneri , and the herbivores Kyphosus ocyurus , and Acanthurus xanthopterus . Top predators, primarily Triaenodon obesus , Caranx sexfasciatus , and Lutjanus argentimaculatus , were also most abundant at these pinnacles and accounted for the largest differences in fish trophic structure among habitats. Despite Isla del Caño being fully protected from fishing, biomass was similar to fished areas along the coast and lower than the adjacent submerged pinnacles outside the reserve. Similarly, Corcovado National Park includes 20.3 km 2 of no-take MPAs; however, there is limited enforcement, and we noted several instances of fishing within the park. The unique configuration of healthy offshore coral reefs and pinnacles connected to coastal habitats provides corridors for many species including large predators such as sharks and other marine megafauna, which warrants additional protection."
