https://openalex.org/W1578086030,"We have previously characterized in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts a growth factor activatable and amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport (Pouyssegur, J., Chambard, J. C., Franchi, A., Paris, S., and Van Obberghen-Schilling, E. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 3935-3939). In this report, we compared the affinity of 28 analogs of amiloride for inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiport and inhibition of growth factor-induced DNA synthesis. We showed that the guanidino moiety of amiloride must be protonated to elicit inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchange. Substitutions within this moiety by methyl, phenyl, or benzyl groups reduced the activity 20- to 1000-fold. On the contrary, substitution of the proton(s) of the 5-amino group of amiloride with alkyl or alkenyl groups increases potency up to 100-fold (5-N,N-diethylamiloride has a KI of 4 X 10(-8) M). In HCO-3-free medium and at lower [Na+]0 (25 or 50 mM) to reduce competition with amiloride, we found that growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis of G0-arrested cells is inhibited by amiloride and its analogs with the same rank order as that for Na+/H+ antiporter inhibition. Over a range of 3 logs of concentration, a tight correlation was established between IC50 for the blockade of both processes, Na+/H+ exchange and percentage of cells entering the S phase upon growth factor action. These findings indicate that, in HCO-3-free medium, the functioning of the Na+/H+ exchange system is required for growth factor-induced DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606716377,"The role of changes in cytosolic free calcium (Ca) in the activation sequence of the human neutrophil has been monitored by means of the fluorescent probe Quin2. Complete secretagogues such as the chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe and aggregated IgG, as well as the incomplete secretagogue concanavalin A, elicited prompt rises in cytosolic Ca. The rise in cytosolic Ca was in all cases one of the earliest measurable events, consistent with the hypothesis that increments in cytosolic free Ca serve as a signal to activate subsequent physiological responses. The source of cytosolic Ca is principally intracellular, since removal of extracellular Ca had little effect on the rise in cytosolic Ca. Although increments in cytosolic Ca may be essential for neutrophil activation, they are evidently not sufficient; chemotactic levels of f-Met-Leu-Phe elicited optimal increments in cytosolic Ca without triggering degranulation, O-2 generation, and aggregation. Some other factor, associated with high levels of receptor occupancy, must be required for secretion. The tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate was an exceptional stimulus, since it elicited degranulation, aggregation, and O-2 generation without triggering a rise in cytosolic Ca. Finally, an efflux of Ca is initiated which serves to maintain low intracellular levels of Ca."

https://openalex.org/W1503386326,"Molecular cloning, mapping, and DNA sequencing techniques have been used to characterize the functional human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. The gene is about 30 kilobases in length. Its coding portions are separated into 6 exons, the intron-exon boundaries of which are identical to those of the previously characterized mouse DHFR gene. The 5 introns vary in length from 362 to 12,000 base pairs. The position of the DHFR gene promoter was identified as being shortly upstream from the initiation codon in an in vitro transcription reaction by polymerase II. A DHFR minigene was constructed in a plasmid expression vector by combining a DNA fragment containing exon 1, intron I, and a small part of exon 2 from the functional gene, with a second DNA fragment containing exons 2-6 from a processed intronless gene, the coding sequences of which are identical to those of the normal locus. Transcription initiation from the DHFR promoter was localized to a position 71 +/- 2 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon, both in monkey kidney cells transfected with vectors containing the DHFR minigene, and in human HeLa cells. This single transcription start and the three previously identified polyadenylation sites account for the 800-, 1,000-, and 3,800-nucleotide DHFR mRNA species found in human cells. On comparison of the mouse and human DHFR genes, sequence homology was shown to be limited to the coding regions and 100 base pairs of the 3' untranslated region up to the first polyadenylation site of both genes. In addition, there is fairly extensive homology in the 5' flanking region, although the quadruply repeated 48-base pair sequence found in the mouse genome is represented only once in human DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1587807023,"Limited proteolysis of calmodulin with trypsin in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N,N',N'-tetracetic acid (EGTA) or Ca2+ was performed according to a modification of the method of Drabikowski et al. (Drabikowski, W., Kuznicki, J., and Grabarek, Z. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 485, 124-133). The resulting peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Tryptic digests in EGTA yielded peptides 1-106, 1-90, and 107-148 with yields of 9, 47, and 61%, respectively. The digests performed with Ca2+ yielded peptides 1-77 and 78-148 in 35 and 45% yield. Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography indicated that the purified fragments contained less than 0.1% contamination by calmodulin, thus allowing a definitive study of the ability of these fragments to activate, or interact with, calmodulin-regulated enzymes and anti-calmodulin drugs. Each of the fragments, except 107-148, bound to a phenothiazine affinity column in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Thus, calmodulin contains two interaction sites for phenothiazines: one on the NH2-terminal half (fragment 1-77) and one on the COOH-terminal half (fragment 78-148). None of the fragments activates the protein phosphatase, calcineurin, or prevents its stimulation by calmodulin, nor does any of the fragments stimulate Ca2+-dependent cAMP phosphodiesterase. A single cleavage in the middle of the calmodulin molecule results in the rapid dissociation of the two resultant fragments and a loss of ability to activate cAMP phosphodiesterase. One fragment, 78-148, interacts with phosphodiesterase and prevents its activation by calmodulin (Ki: 1.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(-6) M). The same fragment, 78-148, can fully activate phosphorylase kinase but with a lower affinity than calmodulin (Kuznicki, J., Grabarek, Z., Brzeska, H., Drabikowski, W., and Cohen, P. (1981) FEBS Lett. 130, 141-145). Thus, peptide 78-148 behaves as a calmodulin agonist or antagonist or as neither, depending on the enzyme under study."

https://openalex.org/W1555388714,"Abstract The relationship between receptor-ligand interaction in human neutrophils and initiation of enhanced permeability (45Ca uptake) has been correlated with cell function. Different ligands varied in their efficacy in provoking 45Ca permeability changes: chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe greater than concanavalin A greater than immune complexes greater than phorbol myristate acetate. Mixtures of stimuli at optimal concentrations elicited no summation of responses, indicating that interaction of f-Met-Leu-Phe, concanavalin A, and phorbol myristate acetate with their respective receptors regulates a common site of 45Ca uptake. The onset of uptake was an early event, preceding onset of aggregation, O-2 generation, and degranulation. Enhanced 45Ca permeability during neutrophil activation is dependent on mobilization of intracellular Ca, since 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl:3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride was a potent inhibitor of the permeability response. In contrast, calmodulin antagonists did not inhibit permeability changes; the requirement for calmodulin in the physiological responses of aggregation, O-2 generation, and degranulation must therefore be subsequent to activation of the Ca translocator. We propose a role for a Ca-translocating mechanism as an amplifying factor in neutrophil activation."
https://openalex.org/W2156930003,"The nucleotide sequence of the melB gene coding for the melibiose carrier in Escherichia coli has been determined. The melibiose carrier is predicted to consist of 469 amino acid residues, resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of 52,029. The predicted carrier protein is highly hydrophobic (70% nonpolar amino acid residues). The hydropathic profile suggests that there are 10 long hydrophobic segments in the primary structure of the carrier protein. Most of them seem to traverse the membrane. Although the hydropathic profile of the melibiose carrier is similar to that of the lactose carrier as a whole, homology in the primary structure between the two carriers is very low. Furthermore, no homology in the nucleotide sequence is found in the structural genes for the two carriers. However, the nucleotide sequences of the intergenic regions are very similar between the melibiose operon and the lactose operon. There is a typical intercistronic regulatory sequence in the 3'-flanking region of the melB as well as in that of the lacY, which suggests the presence of another gene downstream of the melB."
https://openalex.org/W1487442802,"Opiate receptor down-regulation in neuroblastoma X glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells possibly involved the internalization of ligand-receptor complexes during chronic treatment. However, receptor internalization was not supported by the observed decrease in [3H] enkephalin(D-Ala2,D-Leu5) ( [3H]DADLE) associated with the hybrid cells during prolonged incubation with 10 nM [3H]DADLE at 37 degrees C. This decrease in [3H]DADLE bound was determined to be due to degradation of the ligand-receptor complexes, for a time-dependent increase in [3H]DADLE bound was observed when the incubations were carried out in the presence of 0.1 mM chloroquine. The increase did not exceed the amount of down-regulated receptor, could be blocked by naloxone, and was not observed at 24 degrees C. The [3H]DADLE bound in the presence of chloroquine was not sensitive to trypsin or to 20 microM diprenorphine. The accumulated [3H]DADLE was demonstrated to be intracellularly located by the fractionation of the homogenates in self-generating Percoll gradients. In the presence of chloroquine, a time-dependent translocation of [3H]DADLE from the plasma membrane-enriched fractions to the lysosome-enriched fractions was observed. The translocation was not observed at 24 degrees C in the presence of chloroquine or at 37 degrees C in the absence of chloroquine. The [3H]DADLE in the lysosome-enriched fractions was not sensitive to trypsin and remained bound in the presence of chloroquine. With the removal of chloroquine, an increase in the release of [3H]DADLE into the medium was observed. Sephadex G-50 column chromatography of the sodium deoxycholate extracts of the lysosome-enriched fractions suggested that the [3H]DADLE was bound to macromolecules intracellularly. Thus, chronic [3H]DADLE treatment of the hybrid cells resulted in an internalization of ligand-receptor complexes which were degraded in the lysosomes. Subsequently, the [3H]DADLE was regurgitated by the hybrid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539947129,"Purified G-protein from vesicular stomatitis virus was reconstituted into egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles by detergent dialysis of octyl glucoside. A homogeneous population of reconstituted vesicles could be obtained, provided the protein to lipid ratio was high (about 0.3 mol % protein) and the detergent removal was slow. The reconstituted vesicles were assayed for fusion activity using electron microscopy and fluorescence energy transfer. The fusion activity mediated by the viral envelope protein was dependent upon pH, temperature, and target membrane lipid composition. Incubation of reconstituted vesicles at low pH with small unilamellar vesicles containing negatively charged lipids resulted in the appearance of large cochleate structures, as shown by electron microscopy using negative stain. This process did not cause leakage of a vesicle-encapsulated aqueous marker. The rate of fusion was pH-dependent with a pK of about 4 and the apparent energy of activation for the fusion was 16 +/- 1 kcal/mol. G-protein-mediated fusion showed a large preference for target membranes which contain phosphatidylserine or phosphatidic acid. Inclusion of 36% cholesterol in any of the lipid compositions had no effect on the rate of fusion. These reconstituted vesicles provide a system to study the mechanism of pH-dependent fusion induced by a viral spike protein."
https://openalex.org/W1571149900,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae anthranilate synthase:indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase is a multifunctional hetero-oligomeric enzyme encoded by genes TRP2 and TRP3. TRP2, encoding anthranilate synthase Component I, was cloned by complementation of a yeast trp2 mutant. The nucleotide sequence of TRP2 as well as that of TRP3 were determined. The deduced anthranilate synthase Component I primary structure from yeast exhibits only limited similarity to that of the corresponding Escherichia coli subunit encoded by trpE. On the other hand, yeast anthranilate synthase Component II and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase amino acid sequences from TRP3 are clearly homologous with the corresponding sequences of the E. coli trpG and trpC polypeptide segments and thereby establish the bifunctional structure of TRP3 protein. Based on comparisons of TRP3 amino acid sequence with homologous sequences from E. coli and Neurospora crassa, an 11-amino acid residue connecting segment was identified which fuses the trpG and trpC functions of the bifunctional TRP3 protein chain. These comparisons support the conclusion that the amino acid sequence of connectors in homologous multifunctional enzymes need not be conserved. Connector function is thus not dependent on a specific sequence. Nuclease S1 mapping was used to identify mRNA 5' termini. Heterogeneous 5' termini were found for both TRP2 and TRP3 mRNA. TRP2 and TRP3 5'-flanking regions were analyzed for sequences that might function in regulation of these genes by the S. cerevisiae general amino acid control system. The 9 base pair direct repeat (Hinnebusch, A.G., and Fink, G.R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5238-5247) and inverted repeats were identified in the 5'-flanking sequences of TRP2 and TRP3."
https://openalex.org/W1500184452,"We have studied the time course of the absorption of bovine liver catalase after pulse radiolysis with oxygen saturation in the presence and absence of superoxide dismutase. In the absence of superoxide dismutase, catalase produced Compound I and another species. The formation of Compound I is due to the reaction of ferric catalase with hydrogen peroxide, which is generated by the disproportionation of the superoxide anion (O-2). The kinetic difference spectrum showed that the other species was neither Compound I nor II. In the presence of superoxide dismutase, the formation of this species was found to be inhibited, whereas that of Compound I was little affected. This suggests that this species is formed by the reaction of ferric catalase with O-2 and is probably the oxy form of this enzyme (Compound III). The rate constant for the reaction of O-2 and ferric catalase increased with a decrease in pH (cf. 4.5 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 at pH 9 and 4.6 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 at pH 5.). The pH dependence of the rate constant can be explained by assuming that HO2 reacts with this enzyme more rapidly than O-2."
https://openalex.org/W1513881553,"To compare the kinetics of the O-2-generating enzyme in nonactivated and activated macrophages and granulocytes from the mouse peritoneal cavity, we sought conditions in which the activity of this enzyme in cell lysates was comparable to that in intact cells. Pretreatment of macrophages with 10 mM diethyldithiocarbamate inhibited endogenous superoxide dismutase by 70% and enhanced O-2 secretion up to 15-fold, so that it was comparable to H2O2 secretion. O-2 secretion was terminated by detergent lysis and reconstituted by addition of NAD(P)H to the lysates. Optimal detection of O-2 production in lysates depended on prior stimulation of the respiratory burst, lysis with 0.05% deoxycholate rather than any of 4 other detergents or sonication, acetylation of the cytochrome c used as an indicator, and addition of NADPH rather than NADH. Kinetic analysis using NADPH-reconstituted deoxycholate lysates, together with spectra of oxidized and reduced cells, failed to reveal either marked differences in the Vmax of the O-2-generating enzyme or correlations between O-2 secretion and cytochrome b559 content among 5 macrophage populations whose H2O2 secretion ranged from 0 to 365 nmol/90 min/mg of protein. In contrast, the Km of the oxidase for NADPH varied markedly and inversely with the capacity of the intact cells to secrete O-2 or H2O2: J774G8 histiocytoma cells, 1.43 mM; resident macrophages, 0.41 mM; proteose peptone-elicited macrophages, 0.20 mM; casein-activated macrophages, 0.05 mM; NaIO4-activated macrophages, 0.05 mM; and granulocytes, 0.04 mM. These results suggest that macrophage activation, a process that enhances oxygen-dependent antitumor and antimicrobial functions, may equip the cell to secrete increased amounts of reactive oxygen intermediates largely by increasing the affinity of the oxidase for NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1592446613,"Vinculin, isolated from turkey gizzard smooth muscle, was purified by chromatography on CM-cellulose after isolation from a DEAE-cellulose column. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of crude muscle fractions demonstrated that: 1) much of the approximately 130,000-dalton protein present in smooth muscle did not co-isoelectrically focus with the purified 130,000-dalton vinculin and 2) the purified vinculin consisted of three major, closely spaced isoelectric variants that were present only in small amounts in the original smooth muscle sample. Purified vinculin sedimented as a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient S0 20,w of 5.9. Circular dichroism spectra of purified vinculin indicated a considerable degree of secondary structure, with an alpha-helical content of approximately 50% as measured at 208 nm. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of vinculin gave a measured E1%(278) of 4.64. Digestion of vinculin, much of which is located at the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane, with Ca2+-activated neutral protease purified from skeletal muscle yielded major fragments with molecular weights determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 98,000, 85,000, and 26,000. The factor(s) in DEAE-cellulose-purified vinculin responsible for decreasing the low shear viscosity of actin was removed and found in a crude fraction isolated by CM-cellulose chromatography. The purified vinculin had a small, but positive effect on the MgCl2-induced polymerization of actin as measured by low shear viscometry."

https://openalex.org/W1661458410,"A protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase with exceptionally sharp spectral features and a new subunit composition has been purified and crystallized from the Gram-positive organism Brevibacterium fuscum. EPR spectra show that the catalytically essential Fe3+ resides in a site of almost the maximal rhombicity (E/D = 0.333 +/- 0.003). The spectral line widths (1.4 milliTesla at g = 9.67) are the smallest reported for any biological high spin Fe3+ complex and suggest that the enzyme is quite homogeneous in the vicinity of the Fe site. The same conclusion is drawn from Mossbauer spectra measured with enzyme prepared from cells cultured in 57Fe-enriched media as well as from resonance Raman and optical spectra. In contrast, EPR and Mossbauer spectra of the anaerobic complex with protocatechuate (PCA) are complex and demonstrate that multiple species with markedly different electronic symmetries and both positive and negative zero field splittings are present. The Mr = 315,000 enzyme has a composition of (alpha beta Fe)5 (Mr(alpha) = 22,500; Mr (beta) = 40,000). Amino acid analysis shows that neither subunit contains cysteine, thus eliminating this amino acid as a possible Fe ligand. The general features of the structure, spectra, and catalyzed reaction of this enzyme appear to be very similar to those of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase isolated from Gram-negative organisms. However, the kinetic parameters (Km(PCA) = 125 microM, Km(O2) = 800 microM, turnover number = 25,000 min-1 at infinite PCA and O2 concentrations) are 5- to 50-fold higher. The sharp spectra and the kinetic properties facilitate mechanistic studies described in this and the following reports."

https://openalex.org/W1571208565,"Epinephrine-induced changes in insulin release and cyclic AMP levels were measured simultaneously in isolated rat islets. Forskolin was used to enhance islet cyclic AMP levels. Forskolin (30 microM) stimulated adenylate cyclase activity 10-fold in islet homogenates and raised cyclic AMP levels 5-fold in intact islets (both at low and high glucose). Insulin release was enhanced by forskolin only at high glucose. Epinephrine (0.1 microM) inhibited glucose- and forskolin-induced insulin release to basal rates. At the same time epinephrine potentiated forskolin-elevated cyclic AMP levels. In contrast epinephrine attenuated forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in islet homogenates. At low glucose, both alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic blockade counteracted the epinephrine potentiation, each by 50%. At high glucose the effect was mainly beta-adrenergic in nature. The actions of epinephrine in the presence of a beta-blocker were mimicked by the alpha 2-agonist clonidine. Despite the variations in cyclic AMP levels stimulated insulin release was always inhibited by activation of alpha 2-receptors. Finally, insulin release stimulated by exogenous cyclic AMP was abolished by epinephrine. These results suggest that epinephrine inhibits insulin release at a step distal to the generation of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1547224370,"Proteolytic digestion of the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus (pp60src) with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or thermolysin generated a 29,000-dalton fragment representing the carboxyl half of this molecule. This proteolytic fragment was able to phosphorylate pp60src-specific immunoglobulin as well as exogenous substrates such as angiotensin, casein, and tubulin. When quantitated on a molar basis, the protease-resistant fragment of pp60src had a greater specific activity than the intact enzyme. Digestion of pp90yes, the transforming protein of Y73 sarcoma virus with these proteases yielded a peptide of similar molecular weight which was capable of autophosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. The proteolytic fragments of both pp60src and pp90yes displayed the same strict specificity for phosphorylation of tyrosine as the intact enzymes. These results indicate that the 29,000-dalton carboxyl end of pp60src and pp90yes can function independently as phosphotransferases and indicate that the catalytic domains of these molecules have a conformation which confers protection against limited conditions of proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1566803604,"Hyperfine broadening is observable in the EPR spectrum of Brevibacterium fuscum protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase after lyophilization and rehydration in 17O-enriched water, demonstrating H2O ligation to the active site iron. Lack of detectable broadening in the sharp features of the spectra of three substrate complexes suggests that H2O is displaced by substrate. Water is bound in the monodentate complex with the competitive inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzoate which binds directly to the iron showing that two iron ligation sites can be occupied by nonprotein ligands. Ketonized substrate analogs which mimic a proposed transition state of the reaction cycle, 2-hydroxyisonicotinic acid N-oxide (2-OHINO) and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid N-oxide (6-OH NNO), have H2O bound in their final, bleached enzyme complexes, suggesting that these complexes are also monodentate. In contrast, a transient, initial complex of 6-OH NNO which is spectrally similar to the substrate complex, apparently does not have H2O bound. Cyanide binding occurs in two steps. The active site Fe3+ of the initial, rapidly formed, violet complex is high spin while that of the second, slowly formed, green complex is low spin; a unique state for mononuclear non-heme iron enzymes. The data suggest that the Fe-CN- and Fe-(CN-)2 complexes form sequentially. CN- binds to enzyme complexes with 2-OH INO and 6-OH NNO in one step to yield high spin Fe3+ species. In contrast, preformed substrate complexes prevent CN- binding. CN- binding eliminates the broadening due to 17O-water in the EPR spectra of both native enzyme and the enzyme-ketonized analog complexes. A model is proposed in which H2O is displaced by bidentate binding of the substrate but can potentially rebind after a subsequent substrate ketonization. The proximity of the vacatable H2O-binding site of the iron to the site of oxygen insertion suggests, however, that this site may serve to stabilize an oxygenated intermediate during the reaction cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1552252651,"Apocytochrome c (cytochrome c without the heme) is synthesized in the cell cytoplasm without a cleaved signal sequence, then transported across the outer mitochondrial membrane. We have studied the interaction of apocytochrome c with lipid vesicles as a model for understanding protein translocation across membranes. Apocytochrome c (but not holocytochrome c) that has been incubated with vesicles at 37 degrees C in 0.2 M NaCl binds to the vesicles. Under these conditions, as well as upon incubation with detergent or at high protein concentrations, all the added protein remains partly accessible to externally added protease, but a COOH-terminal fragment of some of the protein molecules becomes protected against digestion. When apocytochrome c is added to azolectin vesicles with internally trapped proteases, most of the added protein can be digested, even in the presence of a large excess of protease inhibitor external to the vesicles. Thus, in spite of a lack of nonpolar stretches in its amino acid sequence, apocytochrome c is capable of binding to and inserting into lipid membranes. In this model system, transport may be driven by trapping of protease-digested apocytochrome c on one side of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1526535705,"Continued passage of the human parvovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), at high multiplicity of infection in human cells results in the accumulation of AAV particles containing variant genomes. We have analyzed the structure of individual variant AAV genomes by molecular cloning in the Escherichia coli plasmid, pBR328. Each of the AAV inserts in six individual recombinant plasmids contained a single internal deletion but in contrast to a previous model, the locations of the deletions were nonrandom. The molecular cloning protocol also generated recombinant plasmids containing the entire AAV2 DNA sequence which yielded infectious AAV particles when transfected into human 293 cells in the presence of helper adenovirus using a DEAE-transfection procedure. Infectious AAV genomes were also generated by recombination when cells were jointly transfected with a mixture of plasmids containing two different mutant AAV genomes. The efficiency of this recombination appear to be influenced by the degree of homology between the mutant AAV genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1495457041,"During bone remodeling, activation of resorption is followed by a cycle of formation and this ordered sequence of events has long suggested that local interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts are an important regulatory mechanism in bone metabolism. To study this phenomenon, we have prepared bone cells containing primarily osteoclasts by brief digestion of mice calvariae in collagenase, overnight attachment to polystyrene tissue culture flasks in serumless medium supplemented with OB (osteoblast) cell conditioned medium and subsequent growth in low serum. These OC (osteoclast) cells were found to be highly enriched in acid phosphatase activity and expressed cAMP responses to PTH (parathyroid hormone) and prostaglandin E2 but exhibited no PTH-stimulated hyaluronate synthesis in contrast to prostaglandin E2. PTH effects on hyaluronate, however, could be restored upon coculture of OC cells with OB cells (noncontact) or with OB cell conditioned medium, thereby suggesting that OB cells regulate OC cell PTH responsiveness and/or differentiation by soluble cell products secreted into the medium."

https://openalex.org/W1540511739,"A discrete primary transcript of HeLa mitochondrial DNA containing 12 S rRNA, tRNAPhe, and 19 +/- 2 nucleotides upstream has been identified. The 5' ends of heavy strand encoded RNAs adjacent to the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA were mapped by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection to a site 19 +/- 2 nucleotides upstream from the start of tRNAPhe. Hybridization of a tRNAPhe-specific probe to a blot of mitochondrial RNA detected a discrete species with a molecular weight consistent with an RNA containing 12 S rRNA, tRNAPhe, and a short upstream leader sequence. The di- or triphosphate nature of the 5' end of this polycistronic RNA was demonstrated by in vitro capping with [alpha-32P]GTP and guanylyltransferase. S1 nuclease protection of the purified in vitro capped RNA established that the 5' end, 19 +/- 2 nucleotides upstream from tRNAPhe, is an initiation site for heavy strand transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1559582654,"Electron spin resonance spin-trapping techniques were used to investigate the in vitro and in vivo formation of free radicals during 3-methylindole (3MI) metabolism by goat lung. Utilizing the spin trap phenyl-t-butylnitrone, a nitrogen-centered free radical was detected 3 min after the addition of 3MI to an in vitro incubation system containing goat lung microsomes in the presence of NADPH and O2. The spectrum of the spin adduct was identical to that observed when 3MI was irradiated with ultraviolet light. A carbon-centered radical was also observed which increased in concentration with increasing incubation time. Microsomal incubations containing ferrous sulfate in the absence of 3MI to initiate lipid peroxidation produced the same carbon-centered free radical as obtained by spin-trapping. Malondialdehyde, and end product of lipid peroxidation, was also found to increase in concentration with increasing incubation time of 3MI. The concept that 3MI causes lipid peroxidation in the lung was supported by the in vivo study in which a carbon-centered radical was spin-trapped by phenyl-t-butylnitrone in lungs of intact goats infused with 3MI. This carbon-centered radical had hyperfine splitting constants identical to those carbon-centered free radicals trapped in in vitro incubations of 3MI. These data demonstrate that microsomal metabolism of 3MI produces a nitrogen-centered radical from 3MI which initiates lipid peroxidation in vitro and in vivo causing the formation of carbon-centered radicals from microsomal membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1516003598,"125I-Human growth hormone was cross-linked with high efficiency to lactogen receptors in membranes and in Triton X-100-solubilized preparations from luteinized rat ovaries using the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate. Cross-linked samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography of dried gels. Analysis of cross-linked hormone-receptor complexes in membranes revealed the presence of a major radioactive band at Mr = 60,000. Cross-linking of detergent-solubilized complexes resulted in the appearance of two major radioactive bands of Mr = 60,000 and Mr = 100,000. Excess unlabeled lactogenic hormones inhibited the labeling of the major bands while non-lactogenic hormones had no effect. The same major radioactive bands were observed when the cross-linked samples were analyzed under nonreducing conditions. However, in solubilized preparations, the ratio between the intensities of the lower and the higher Mr bands was markedly lower under nonreducing than under reducing conditions. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies (first dimension, nonreducing; second dimension, reducing) demonstrated that a species with Mr = 60,000 can be released from the Mr = 100,000 species upon cleavage of disulfide bonds. Since the Mr of 125I-human growth hormone is 22,000, these results suggest that the ovarian lactogen receptors are molecules with an approximate Mr of 80,000, containing a subunit with a Mr of approximately 40,000 bearing the recognition site for the hormone. Some of these subunits appear to be linked to the rest of the molecule by disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1541508612,"Liver mitochondria isolated from rats treated acutely with glucagon exhibit higher respiration-dependent H+ ion gradients across the mitochondrial inner membrane than mitochondria from control rats. It has been suggested that similar increases in mitochondrial delta pH in situ could stimulate gluconeogenesis, chiefly because the transport of pyruvate into mitochondria would increase in response to the increase in mitochondrial matrix pH. In order to determine whether the increased delta pH observed in vitro in isolated mitochondria also occurs in situ, the effect of glucagon on the pH in the cytosol and mitochondria matrix spaces of isolated hepatocytes was determined. For qualitative results, the spectral responses of intracellularly trapped 6-carboxyfluorescein was used to monitor cytosol pH, while fluorescein-loaded hepatocytes were used to monitor the mitochondrial pH. Hepatocytes were incubated with the diacetate ester derivatives of these dyes. The esters are permeable to the cell membranes, but are rapidly hydrolyzed in the cells. The free unesterified dyes are relatively impermeable to the cell membranes. After being trapped in the cell, 6-carboxyfluorescein remains localized in the cell cytosol, whereas fluorescein is taken up by the mitochondria as a function of the mitochondrial delta pH. In order to quantitate the actual pH in these compartments, the spectral responses (490-465 nm) of 6-carboxyfluorescein-loaded hepatocytes were used to determine the cytosolic pH. Calibration of these responses was obtained within the cell by determination of the dye's differential absorption coefficient (epsilon 490-465 nm) in various high K+ buffers after equilibration of the internal and external pH with valinomycin and the uncoupler 1799. All absorbance values were corrected for dye leakage. Equal hematocrits of unloaded cells were used to correct for absorbance contributions from cellular constituents. The mitochondrial pH was determined by a combination of the indicator dye and [14C]5,5'-demethyloxazolidine-2, 4-dione (DMO) distribution ratio methods. The weak acid DMO freely distributes across the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane in whole cells according to the pH gradient across each membrane. Knowledge of the cytoplasmic pH from the 6-carboxyfluorescein data allows the expected distribution of DMO across the plasma membrane to be calculated. The excess accumulation of DMO in intact hepatocytes over that predicted from the plasma membrane pH gradient alone was then used to calculate the pH gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The effects of valinomycin, uncouplers, and hormones on the pH in cytosolic and mitochondrial compartm"

Phosphorylation of EGF receptors was stimulated to the same extent when cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was substituted for 3',5'-cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the extent of phosphorylation of EGF receptor at tyrosine residues was the same regardless of whether cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was present in or omitted from the system. Increased EGF receptor phosphorylation occurring in response to cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was accounted for by phosphorylation at serine or threonine residues. In samples phosphorylated in the presence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, phosphate was present in tyrosine, serine, and threonine in a ratio of 32:60:8. Two-dimensional mapping of radiolabeled phosphopeptides produced from EGF receptors by digestion with trypsin revealed the generation of one additional major phosphoserine-containing peptide when cAMP-dependent protein kinase was present with EGF in the EGF receptor kinase system. Degradation of 160-kDa EGF receptors to a 145-kDa form by purified Ca2+-activated neutral protease produced a 145-kDa fragment with phosphoserine content increased over that present initially in the 160-kDa precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1579621845,"An exceptionally potent DNA catenation activity, identified in an extract from Escherichia coli, has been purified and partially characterized. Catenation results from the sequential action of the following two polypeptides: beta, 34 kDa and identical to exonuclease III; and alpha, 101 kDa and identical to DNA topoisomerase I (omega protein). An additional requirement is that a small proportion of the circles be nicked in order to provide the substrate for exonuclease III to generate gaps, estimated to be about 100 nucleotides long. Following exonuclease III digestion, one molecule of topoisomerase I can interlock per minute at 30 degrees C about 20 supercoiled and gapped DNA circles into a massively catenated network. The reaction requires Mg2+ and a hydrophilic polymer (polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene glycol) at about 7%, but neither ATP nor spermidine. The hydrophilic polymer appears to drive catenation by condensing the DNA; decatenation by topoisomerase I proceeds upon removal of the polymer."
https://openalex.org/W1608747619,"From a study of the magnetic field dependence of the linear electric field effect (LEFE) in EPR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that iron-sulfur cluster 3 in air-oxidized, beef heart succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex II) is a 3-iron cluster. This suggests that cluster 3 may arise by oxidative degradation from a 4-iron cluster originally present in the enzyme and may be reconverted back into a 4-iron cluster under reducing conditions. Linear electric field effect studies of succinate-reduced Complex II are in accord with the view that cluster 1 is a 2-iron cluster."

https://openalex.org/W1577843043,"The binding reactions of two heterocyclic analogs of protocatechuate (PCA), 2-hydroxyisonicotinic acid N-oxide and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid N-oxide, to Brevibacterium fuscum protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase have been characterized. These analogs were synthesized as models for the ketonized tautomer of PCA which we have previously proposed as the form which reacts with O2 in the enzyme complex (Que, L., Jr., Lipscomb, J.D., Munck, E., and Wood, J.M. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 485, 60-74). Both analogs have much higher affinity for the enzyme than PCA. Repetitive scan optical spectra of each binding reaction show that at least one intermediate is formed. The spectra of the intermediates are red-shifted (lambda max = 500 nm) relative to that of native enzyme (lambda max = 435 nm) but are similar to that of the anaerobic enzyme-PCA complex. In contrast, the spectrum of the final, deadend complex formed by each analog is significantly blue-shifted (lambda max less than 340 nm) resulting in an apparent bleaching of the chromophore of the enzyme. A transient intermediate exhibiting a similar bleached spectrum has been detected in the enzyme reaction cycle immediately after O2 is added to the enzyme-PCA complex (Bull C., Ballou D.P., and Otsuka, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12681-12686). Stopped flow measurements of the analog binding reactions show that a relatively weak enzyme complex is initially formed followed by at least two isomerizations leading to the bleached, high affinity complexes. EPR spectra of both the early and final complexes reveal only high spin Fe3+ with negative zero field splitting, showing that the optical bleaching is not due to Fe reduction. The studies show that the ketonized analogs are poor models for the enzyme-substrate complex but do successfully mimic many features of the first oxy complex of the reaction cycle. We propose that substrate ketonization occurs coincident with or after O2 binding and may be involved directly in the O2 insertion reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1600528241,"Dispersed mouse pancreas acinar cells were prepared in which phosphatidylinositol had been labeled with myo[2-3H]inositol. During incubation with 0.3 microM cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) for 15 min, there was a loss of [3H]phosphatidylinositol radioactivity (23%) and a 3-fold gain in trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. Replacement of NaCl by up to 58 mM LiCl did not significantly affect the amount of CCK-8-stimulated [3H]phosphatidylinositol breakdown or the gain in acid-soluble radioactivity. However, in normal medium, the product of phosphatidylinositol breakdown was almost all inositol, whereas in Li+-containing medium, the product was almost all inositol 1-phosphate. Similar results were obtained with acetylcholine which, in the presence of Li+, gave a dose-responsive increase in inositol 1-phosphate over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 microM. No increased accumulation of [3H]inositol diphosphate or [3H]inositol triphosphate was detected in stimulated cells. Time courses in the presence of Li+ indicated that the formation of inositol 1-phosphate preceded the formation of inositol. Addition of up to 50 mM myoinositol to the incubation medium showed no diluting effect on the amount of [3H]inositol 1-phosphate found. The accumulation of inositol 1-phosphate is presumably due to the known ability of Li+ to inhibit myoinositol 1-phosphatase. The results provide clear evidence that stimulated phosphatidylinositol breakdown involves a phospholipase C type of phosphodiesterase activity. 1.25 mM Li+ gave half-maximal inositol 1-phosphate accumulation. This is close to the range of plasma Li+ levels which is used therapeutically in psychiatric disorders. In unstimulated cells, [3H]inositol 1-phosphate accumulation in the presence of Li+ corresponded to a breakdown rate for [3H]phosphatidylinositol of 2 to 3%/h."
https://openalex.org/W1589514289,"Friend murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL cells) contain a cAMP-independent protein kinase which phosphorylates the 100,000-Da catalytic subunit of the (Na,K)-ATPase both in living cells and in the purified plasma membrane (Yeh, L.-A., Ling, L., English, L., and Cantley, L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6567-6574). We have taken advantage of the selective phosphorylation of the 100,000-Da subunit in purified plasma membranes and the similarity between the proteolysis patterns of the MEL cell and dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase to map the site of kinase phosphorylation on the MEL cell enzyme. The chymotryptic and tryptic cleavage sites of the dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase have previously been located (Castro, J., and Farley, R. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2221-2228). The 100,000-Da catalytic subunits of the dog kidney and MEL cell enzymes were specifically labeled at the active site aspartate residue by incubation with (32P)orthophosphate in the presence of Mg2+ and ouabain. Digestion of these two enzymes with chymotrypsin or trypsin revealed similar active site aspartate containing proteolytic fragments indicating a similar structure for the two enzymes. Chymotryptic digestions of MEL cell (Na,K)-ATPase labeled in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP localize the region of kinase phosphorylation to within a 35,000-Da peptide derived from the middle of the 100,000-Da subunit. Tryptic digestion of the MEL cell plasma membranes degraded the 100,000-Da subunit to an NH2-terminal 43,000-Da peptide which contained the active site aspartate but which did not contain the kinase-labeled region. These results further locate the region of kinase phosphorylation to the COOH-terminal half of the 35,000-Da chymotryptic peptide. This location places the site of phosphorylation between the active site aspartate residue which accepts the phosphate of ATP during turnover and an ATP-binding site which has previously been located by labeling with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (Carilli, C. T., Farley, R. A., Perlman, D. M., and Cantley, L. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5601-5606). Phosphorylation of the (Na,K)-ATPase in this region may serve to regulate the activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1510017077,"Conditions have been developed for desensitizing the beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase of turkey erythrocytes in a cell-free system. Desensitization is observed when cell lysates are incubated with isoproterenol or cAMP analogs for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Maximally effective concentrations of isoproterenol produce a 41.0 +/- 1.55% loss of iosproterenol-stimulated and a 15.0 +/- 2.35% loss of fluoride-stimulated enzyme activity. cAMP causes a 26.5 +/- 1.5% fall in isoproterenol-stimulated and a 21.5 +/- 4.4% fall in fluoride-sensitive activity. Desensitization by isoproterenol is dose-dependent, stereospecific, and blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Cell-free desensitization required ATP, Mg2+, and factor(s) present in the soluble fraction of the cell. Nonphosphorylating analogs of ATP did not support desensitization. Desensitization by agonist or cAMP in the cell-free system caused structural alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptor peptides apparent as an altered mobility of the photoaffinity labeled receptor peptides on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As with the desensitization reaction, supernatant factors and ATP were also required for the agonist or cAMP-promoted receptor alterations. These data indicate that beta-adrenergic agonists promote a cAMP-mediated process which leads to receptor alterations and desensitization. The reactions involved in this process require ATP and soluble cellular factors. Additional processes must also occur to account for decreases in fluoride-sensitive enzyme activity. The availability of this cell-free system should facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W128347260,"Effects of Na+, K+, and nucleotides on Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation of (Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase by Pi were studied under equilibrium conditions. Na+ was a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to Mg2+ and a mixed inhibitor with respect to Pi. K+ was a partial inhibitor; it interacted with positive cooperativity and induced negative cooperativities in the interactions of Mg2+ and Pi with the enzyme. Adenyl-5'-yl (beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, interacted with negative cooperativity to inhibit phosphorylation in competition with Pi. ATP was also a competitive inhibitor. Na+ and K+ acted antagonistically, Na+ and nucleotides inhibited synergistically, and K+ and nucleotides were mutually exclusive. In the presence of ouabain, when nucleotides were excluded from the site inhibiting phosphorylation, a low affinity regulatory site for nucleotides became apparent, the occupation of which reduced the rate of dephosphorylation and the initial rate of phosphorylation of the enzyme without affecting the equilibrium constant of the reaction of Pi with the ouabain-complexed enzyme. The regulatory site was also detected in the absence of ouabain. The data suggest that catalytic and transport functions of the oligomeric enzyme may be regulated by homotropic and heterotropic site-site interactions, ligand-induced slow isomerizations, and distinct catalytic and regulatory sites for ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1522987565,"A photoaffinity derivative of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate (hCG-HSAB) ) was used to identify components of the lutropin (LH)/hCG receptor in plasma membranes prepared from pregnant mare serum-pretreated rat ovaries. In intact plasma membranes, the Kd for hCG (1 X 10(-10) M) was the same with both 125I-hCG and 125I-hCG-HSAB, and the binding capacity for the photoaffinity label (1 pmol/mg of membrane protein) was the same as for native hCG. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions of 125I-hCG-HSAB cross-linked to plasma membranes revealed newly formed complexes of Mr = 106,000, 85,000, and 80,000 (representing membrane protein components of Mr = 86,000, 65,000, and 60,000, respectively). However, only the Mr = 106,000 complex displayed an affinity for hCG (Kd of 1 X 10(-10) M) consistent with the physiological LH/hCG receptor. The other binding sites were nonsaturable. Half-maximal saturation by 125I-hCG-HSAB of the Mr = 106,000 complex (1-2 X 10(-9) M) was similar to the Kd of the specific binding of 125I-hCG-HSAB to intact plasma membranes (8 X 10(-10) M). The present data suggest that among the different components of the LH/hCG receptor, only one component (of Mr = 86,000) possesses the affinity and binding capacity characteristics of the LH/hCG receptor as determined using radiolabeled, underivatized hCG."
https://openalex.org/W1484759894,"Abstract We have utilized limited in situ trypsinization of the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor of frog erythrocytes to probe the processes of receptor activation, desensitization, and recycling. Treatment of intact erythrocytes with trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 1 h at 20 degrees C converts all the receptor peptides (identified by photoaffinity labeling with p-azido-125I-benzylcarazolol) from a Mr approximately 58,000 to a Mr approximately 40,000 species. Nonetheless, the trypsinized beta-adrenergic receptors bind agonists and antagonists with unaltered affinity and with no change in the number of binding sites. Moreover, the ability of the proteolyzed receptors to interact with the nucleotide regulatory protein to form a high affinity guanine nucleotide-sensitive state and to activate adenylate cyclase were also unaltered. However, upon exposure of intact cells to the agonist isoproterenol, trypsinized beta-adrenergic receptors were more rapidly and more completely cleared from the plasma membranes (down-regulated) than untrypsinized receptors. Whereas down-regulated receptors from nontrypsinized cells appear to recycle to the cell surface after removal of the agonist, internalized trypsinized beta-adrenergic receptors do not recycle to the plasma membrane and appear to be degraded within the cell. Moreover, when internalized receptors, recovered in a light vesicle fraction, were fused with a heterologous adenylate cyclase system, untreated but not trypsinized receptors reconstituted catecholamine stimulation of the enzyme. These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptor contains a trypsin-sensitive site which is exposed on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Proteolysis at this site releases a fragment which though not critically involved in either ligand binding or effector coupling might be important for anchoring the receptors in the plasma membrane. These data also suggest that in situ proteolysis of the receptors might serve as a physiological trigger for their internalization and degradation."

Both components of mixed denaturant systems enhance each other's effect in unfolding the protein. The effect of lithium bromide on the midpoint of guanidine hydrochloride denaturation transition is approximately the sum of the effects of the constituent ions. For all the mixed denaturants tested, the dependence of the free energy change on denaturation is linear. The conformational free energy associated with the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation transition in water is 7.5 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1, and it is unchanged in the presence of low concentrations of lithium bromide, lithium chloride, and sodium bromide which by themselves are not concentrated enough to unfold the protein. The conformational free energy associated with the lithium bromide denaturation transition in water is 11.7 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1, and it is not affected by the presence of low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride which by themselves do not disrupt the structure of native ribonuclease A."
https://openalex.org/W1514161513,"Plasma membranes of 6-h differentiated Dictyostelium discoideum cells contain a cAMP-binding protein with the properties ascribed to the chemotaxis receptor present on these cells. We have purified this cAMP-binding protein using DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography on decylagarose and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in nonionic detergent. Photoaffinity labeling of the DEAE-purified material with 8-azido-[32P] cAMP shows that only an Mr = 70,000 species on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels contains a cAMP-binding site. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of material eluted from decyl-agarose and photoaffinity labeled indicates that the cAMP-binding protein is the most acidic of many Mr = 70,000 proteins present. This method is readily scaled up to process up to 10(11) cells which yield from 25 to 100 micrograms of cAMP-binding protein. Nucleotide specificity studies established that the cAMP-binding site of the protein is similar to that of the cAMP receptor assayed on intact cells and membranes. The rates of association and dissociation of the cAMP-binding protein are extremely rapid as found for the receptor, and its affinity for cAMP is comparable. The cAMP-binding protein is a concanavalin A binding glycoprotein, and is resistant to proteolysis by trypsin, but not chymotrypsin. Like the cAMP receptor in membranes and crude detergent extracts, this cAMP-binding protein is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purified binding protein exists in solution largely as a monomeric species, with some dimer being detected on gel filtration. Based on these criteria, we conclude that this cAMP binding protein represents the binding subunit of the cAMP chemotaxis receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1557381449,"Cupric phenanthroline was used to catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds in cAMP-dependent protein kinase II. Incubation of holoenzyme alone with cupric phenanthroline resulted in no disulfide bond formation. In contrast, when holoenzyme was preincubated with cAMP prior to treatment with cupric phenanthroline, specific interchain disulfide bonding was found between the regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits. Formation of the R-C dimer was independent of the phosphorylation state of R. Experiments with R that had been freed of bound cyclic nucleotide suggest that a ternary complex of R, C, and cAMP is necessary for the formation of this cross-linked species. When the dimeric R-subunit alone was incubated with cupric phenanthroline, the two protomers of the R-dimer were frequently cross-linked. Phosphorylation of R did not affect the formation of R-R dimers. In contrast to the R-subunit of the type I protein kinase, R-R dimers of the type II protein kinase were not normally observed in the absence of an added catalyst. Factors which favor disulfide bond formation in the R-dimer have not been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1608290591,"Abstract The activation of yeast enolase by cobaltous ion in 0.1 M KCl is characterized by an activation constant of 1 microM and an inhibition constant of 18 microM. Measurements of binding of Co2+ to the apoenzyme show that a maximum of four Co2+ ions are bound per dimer in the presence or absence of substrate although binding is far tighter in the presence of substrate. Ultraviolet spectral titrations show evidence for a conformational change due exclusively to the binding of the first two ions of Co2+. Both visible and EPR spectra confirm that the environment of the first pair of cobalt ions (conformational sites) is markedly different from that of the second pair in the catalytic sites. Cobalt at the conformational site appears to be a tetragonally distorted octahedral complex while the second pair of metal ions appears to be in a more regular tetrahedral symmetry. Addition of either Mg2+ or substrate to the enzyme with only one pair of cobalt ions per dimer causes striking changes in the metal ion environment. The conformational metal sites appear sufficiently shielded from solvent to be inaccessible to oxidation by H2O2, in contrast to the second pair of cobaltous ions whose ready oxidation by H2O2 inactivates the enzyme. Comparison of kinetic and binding data suggests that only one site of the dimeric enzyme can be active, since activity requires more than two metals bound per dimer and inactivation results from the binding of the fourth ion per dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1512768502,"In this report we describe a novel in vitro phenomenon involving the interaction of insulin with purified protein phosphatases. Evidence is presented that porcine insulin is capable of activating and binding to rabbit skeletal muscle protein phosphatases in vitro. Its effects were examined on four rabbit skeletal muscle protein phosphatases. Two of these, phosphatases C-I and C-II, are of Mr approximately 35,000 and are the dissociated forms of protein phosphatase. The two other phosphatases, H-I and H-II, have Mr approximately 250,000 by gel filtration and represent nondissociated forms of phosphatase. Insulin reproducibly activated homogeneous preparations of protein phosphatase C-II and H-II approximately 3-5-fold in vitro. The activation was dependent on temperature, time, and insulin concentration. The activities of the phosphatases toward both phosphorylase alpha and histone were affected, indicating that this was not a substrate-directed effect. The activation phenomenon was not mimicked by insulin A or B chains, somatostatin, glucagon, or bovine serum albumin, and could be prevented by insulin antiserum. 125I-Insulin was shown to bind to the protein phosphatases by solid phase binding assays. Phosphatases C-I, C-II, and H-II, but not phosphatase H-I, were found to bind insulin reversibly. Half-maximal binding to the protein phosphatases was observed at approximately 5 X 10(-10) M insulin. Labeled insulin was found to coelute with protein phosphatase H-II on gel filtration when a mixture of the two was chromatographed, providing evidence for the formation of an enzyme-insulin complex. These findings suggest that certain protein phosphatases may have a specific binding site(s) for insulin and that these insulin-phosphatase complexes may also exhibit enhanced catalytic activity."
