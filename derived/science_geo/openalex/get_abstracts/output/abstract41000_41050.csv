https://openalex.org/W2071056869,"When a chimeric gene encoding a ubiquitin-beta-galactosidase fusion protein is expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ubiquitin is cleaved off the nascent fusion protein, yielding a deubiquitinated beta-galactosidase (beta gal). With one exception, this cleavage takes place regardless of the nature of the amino acid residue of beta gal at the ubiquitin-beta gal junction, thereby making it possible to expose different residues at the amino-termini of the otherwise identical beta gal proteins. The beta gal proteins thus designed have strikingly different half-lives in vivo, from more than 20 hours to less than 3 minutes, depending on the nature of the amino acid at the amino-terminus of beta gal. The set of individual amino acids can thus be ordered with respect to the half-lives that they confer on beta gal when present at its amino-terminus (the ""N-end rule""). The currently known amino-terminal residues in long-lived, noncompartmentalized intracellular proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes belong exclusively to the stabilizing class as predicted by the N-end rule. The function of the previously described posttranslational addition of single amino acids to protein amino-termini may also be accounted for by the N-end rule. Thus the recognition of an amino-terminal residue in a protein may mediate both the metabolic stability of the protein and the potential for regulation of its stability."
https://openalex.org/W2000775841,"The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (cox) subunit II gene from trypanosomes contains a frameshift at amino acid 170. This gene is highly conserved in different trypanosome species, suggesting that it is functional. Sequence determination of coxII transcripts of T. brucei and C. fasciculata reveals four extra, reading frame-restoring nucleotides at the frameshift position that are not encoded in the DNA. Southern blot analysis of DNA of both trypanosome species failed to show the existence of a second version of the coxII gene. We conclude, therefore, that the extra nucleotides are added during or after transcription of the frameshift gene by an RNA-editing process."
https://openalex.org/W2084352383,"WIN 51711 and WIN 52084 are structurally related, antiviral compounds that inhibit the replication of rhino (common cold) viruses and related picornaviruses. They prevent the pH-mediated uncoating of the viral RNA. The compounds consist of a 3-methylisoxazole group that inserts itself into the hydrophobic interior of the VP1 beta-barrel, a connecting seven-membered aliphatic chain, and a 4-oxazolinylphenoxy group (OP) that covers the entrance to an ion channel in the floor of the ""canyon."" Viral disassembly may be inhibited by preventing the collapse of the VP1 hydrophobic pocket or by blocking the flow of ions into the virus interior."
https://openalex.org/W1997662437,"Using ts045, a temperature sensitive strain of Vesicular stomatitis virus, we show that oligomerization of G protein is a prerequisite for its transport from RER to the Golgi apparatus and for its subsequent maturation. While wild-type G forms an oligomer in the RER, ts045 G synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature does not. When the permissive temperature is reinstated, ts045 G forms an oligomer and moves to the Golgi. The state of oligomerization was determined by chemical cross-linking and by the ability of a microinjected monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxy-terminal five amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of G to cause patching of G in intracellular membranes. We conclude that formation of an oligomer of G protein, probably a trimer, is necessary for G protein maturation."

https://openalex.org/W2080383215,"Phosphoinositide breakdown in response to thrombin stimulation of human platelets results in the formation of the calcium-mobilizing messenger molecules inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,2-cyclic-4,5-trisphosphate and of diglyceride, which activates protein kinase C. We find that protein kinase C phosphorylates and thereby increases the activity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5'-phosphomonoesterase, a phosphatase that hydrolyzes these molecules to inert compounds. The 5'-phosphomonoesterase phosphorylated using [gamma-32P]ATP comigrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a protein (40 kd) phosphorylated rapidly in response to thrombin stimulation of 32PO4-labeled platelets. Peptide maps of proteolytic digests of these two phosphorylated proteins indicate that they are the same. We propose that platelet Ca2+ mobilization is regulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5'-phosphomonoesterase. These results explain the observation that phorbol ester treatment of intact human platelets results in decreased levels of inositol trisphosphate and decreased Ca2+ mobilization upon subsequent thrombin addition."
https://openalex.org/W2083703476,"Closed-circular HBV DNA was introduced into cells of the established human hepatoma culture HepG2. The culture medium of one of 40 single-cell clones contained HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), core-related antigens (HBc/eAg), and HBV DNA sequences. HBV DNA and DNA polymerase activity were detected in particles resembling both nucleocapsids and complete virions (Dane particles). Intracellular integrated and extrachromosomal HBV DNA sequences were detected. Relaxed-circular and single-stranded forms of viral DNA were identified as likely replicative intermediates of the HBV genome. In conclusion, in vitro production of Dane-like particles by transformed human hepatocytes has been achieved. This model should be valuable as a cell culture system for studying virus replication and virus-host cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2058357010,"Eosinophils are white blood cells that in humans are found in association with helminthic infections and various inflammatory disease processes. These cells contain a unique lysosomal peroxidase that oxidizes halides to generate highly reactive and toxic hypohalous acids. Although chloride is found in vivo at concentrations at least 1000-fold greater than those of other halides, human eosinophils did not preferentially oxidize chloride under physiologic conditions. Instead, eosinophils used bromide, a halide with a hitherto unknown function in humans, to generate a halogenating oxidant with characteristics similar, if not identical, to those of hypobromous acid. These results indicate that physiological concentrations of bromide arm human eosinophils with the ability to generate and release an unusual oxidant capable of destroying a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2079290149,"The polyomavirus major capsid protein VP1, purified after expression of the recombinant gene in E. coli, was isolated as oligomers resembling the dissociated capsomeres derived from viral capsids. Image analysis of low-dose electron micrographs demonstrates that these VP1 oligomers are exclusively pentamers. The purified VP1 pentamers associated to form capsid-like assemblies and polymorphic aggregates at high ionic strength. The capsid-like assemblies were stabilized at low ionic strength by the addition of calcium. Self-assembly of the unmodified, recombinant DNA-generated VP1 implies that the posttranslational charge modifications of VP1 and the minor virion protein components, VP2 and VP3, are not essential for capsid formation. The nonequivalently related subunits of the penta- and hexavalent capsomeres therefore must spontaneously switch their bonding specificity during assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2105369923,"The neutrophil oxidative burst is characterized by increased cellular O2 consumption due to the activation of a membrane-associated superoxide-generating NADPH-oxidase. The response is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including opsonized zymosan, formylmethionylleucinephenylalanine (FMLP), arachidonate, short-chain diacylglycerols, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We herein demonstrate that incubation of cells with sphinganine or sphingosine blocks or reverses activation by these agonists. The inhibition is reversible, does not affect cell viability, and does not affect another complex cell function, phagocytosis. Inhibitory concentrations of sphinganine did not significantly affect cytoplasmic calcium levels or FMLP-generated calcium transients. Structural requirements for inhibition of the oxidative burst include a long aliphatic chain and an amino-containing head-group, and there is modest specificity for the native (erythro) isomer of sphinganine. Inhibition involves stimulus-induced activation mechanisms rather than a direct effect on the NADPH oxidase, since sphinganine did not inhibit NADPH-dependent superoxide generation in isolated membranes containing the active enzyme. Activation by FMLP, diacylglycerol, PMA, opsonized zymosan, and arachidonate was blocked by the same concentrations of sphinganine, indicating that these agonists share a common inhibited step. Three lines of evidence indicate that this step involves protein kinase C. First, in a micelle system and in platelets, long-chain bases are inhibitors of this enzyme (Hannun, Y., Loomis, C., Merrill, A., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12604-12609). Second, sphinganine blocks PMA-stimulated incorporation of 32PO4 into neutrophil proteins. Third, sphinganine inhibits the binding of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate to its cellular receptor, known to be protein kinase C. We suggest that long-chain bases function as physiologic modulators of cellular regulatory pathways involving protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W1529786888,"DNA sequences encoding the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and various EGF-receptor deletion mutants were transfected into chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells devoid of endogenous EGF receptors. A functional human EGF-receptor is expressed on the surface of heterologous CHO cells with the following properties: it exhibits typical high affinity (10%; Kd = 3 X 10(-10) M) and low affinity (90%; Kd = 3 X 10(-9) M) binding sites for 125I-EGF; it is expressed as a polypeptide of 170,000 molecular weight with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. EGF stimulates the kinase activity leading to self-phosphorylation and to phosphorylation of exogenous substrate; 125I-EGF is rapidly internalized into the CHO cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and; EGF stimulates DNA synthesis in the cells expressing the human EGF-receptor. Deletion of 63 amino acids from the C-terminal end of EGF-receptor, which removes two autophosphorylation sites, abolishes the high affinity state of the receptor. Nevertheless, this receptor mutant is able to undergo endocytosis and to respond mitogenically to EGF to a similar extent as the wild type receptor. Further deletions from the cytoplasmic domain give rise to low affinity endocytosis-defective receptor mutants. Finally, deletion of the transmembrane domain of the human receptor yields an EGF-receptor ligand binding domain which is secreted from the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515819565,"We have utilized monoclonal antibodies against the two IgG Fc receptors (p40 and p72) of U937 cells to stimulate the release of superoxide. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for p40 (IV3) has been described elsewhere. A murine IgG1 mAb specific for the high affinity p72 Fc receptor (designated mAb FcR32 or simply mAb 32) bound to the same p72 precipitated by Sepharose-human IgG as shown by preclearing experiments and by identical isoelectric focussing patterns. Binding of mAb 32 to p72 was independent of the Fc region of the antibody since Fab' fragments of mAb 32 affinity adsorbed p72. The binding of both mAb 32 and human IgG1 to the intact U937 cell was not reciprocally inhibitory, indicating that mAb 32 does not interfere with the ligand binding site of p72. mAb 32 bound to human monocytes, U937, and HL60 cells, but not to granulocytes or lymphocytes. U937 cells cultured in gamma-interferon and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol generated superoxide when incubated with mAb 32 or IV3 followed by cross-linking with F(ab')2 anti-murine Ig. Incubation with mAb 32 or IV3 alone or with 3 of 5 other anti-U937 mAbs cross-linked with anti-murine Ig did not result in superoxide generation. Immune complex-mediated superoxide production was inhibited 80% by IgG, but not by mAb 32 or IV3."
https://openalex.org/W2010451082,"In mammary tumors induced by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), the int-1 gene is frequently activated by adjacent proviral insertions and is thereby strongly implicated in tumorigenesis. To seek a direct biological effect of int-1 that would validate its proposed role as an oncogene, we constructed a retrovirus vector containing the gene and examined its effects on tissue culture cells. Expression of int-1 in a mammary epithelial cell line caused striking morphological changes, unrestricted growth at high cell density, and focus formation on a monolayer, although the cells were not tumorigenic in vivo. This partial transformation induced by int-1 was not observed in cells infected by an otherwise identical virus bearing a frameshift mutation in the gene. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that int-1 plays a functional role in MMTV-induced mammary tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2004844506,"Human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV's) differ from most other retroviruses based on the presence of trans-regulatory genes for virus expression. In this study, using an in vitro cell-free transcription system, we demonstrate that nuclear extracts obtained from cells infected with HTLV-III (human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) contain a factor(s) that stimulates transcription specifically from the HTLV-III promoter. Present studies indicate that this activation is mainly involved in the initiation of transcription from the HTLV-III promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2046011112,"Some Cnemidophorus exsanguis have mitochondrial DNA's (mtDNA's) that are 22.2 kilobases (kb) in size, whereas most have mtDNA's of 17.4 kb. Restriction site mapping, DNA transfer hybridization experiments, and electron microscopy show that the size increment stems from the tandem duplication of a 4.8-kb region that includes regulatory sequences and transfer and ribosomal RNA genes. This observation is notable in that sequences outside of the control region are involved in major length variation. Besides revealing a novel form of mtDNA evolution in animals, these duplications provide a useful system for investigating the molecular and evolutionary biology of animal mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2089843624,"Viral infection of mammalian cells entails the regulated induction of viral gene expression. The induction of many viral genes, including the herpes simplex virus gene encoding thymidine kinase (tk), depends on viral regulatory proteins that act in trans. Because recognition of the tk promoter by cellular transcription factors is well understood, its trans induction by viral regulatory proteins may serve as a useful model for the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. A comprehensive set of mutations was therefore introduced into the chromosome of herpes simplex virus at the tk promoter to directly analyze the effects of promoter mutations on tk transcription. The promoter domains required for efficient tk expression under conditions of trans induction corresponded to those important for recognition by cellular transcription factors. Thus, trans induction of tk expression may be catalyzed initially by the interaction of viral regulatory proteins with cellular transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2124692993,"To determine the fraction of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome that is required for normal cell growth and division, we constructed diploid strains that were heterozygous for random single disruptions. We monitored the effects of approximately 200 independent disruptions by sporulating the diploids and examining the phenotype of the resulting haploid strains. We found that only 12% of the disruptions were haploid-lethal, 14% resulted in slow growth, and an additional 4% were associated with some other new phenotype (such as an auxotrophic requirement). No obvious new phenotype was detected for 70% of the disruptions."
https://openalex.org/W2044154275,"Biological and serological assays have been used to define four subregions for the I region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the order I-A, I-B, I-J, and I-E. The I-J subregion presumably encodes the I-J polypeptide of the elusive T-cell suppressor factors. Restriction enzyme site polymorphisms and DNA sequence analyses of the I region from four recombinant mouse strains were used to localize the putative I-B and I-J subregions to a 1.0-kilobase (kb) region within the E beta gene. Sequencing this region from E beta clones derived from the two mouse strains: B10.A(3R), I-Jb and B10.A(5R), I-Jk initially used to define the I-J subregion revealed that these regions are identical, hence the distinct I-Jb and I-Jk molecules cannot be encoded by this DNA. In addition, the DNA sequence data also refute the earlier mapping of the I-B subregion. Analysis of the DNA sequences of three parental and four I region recombinants reveals that the recombinant events in three of the recombinant strains occurred within a 1-kb region of DNA, supporting the proposition that a hotspot for recombination exists in the I region. The only striking feature of this hotspot is a tetramer repeat (AGGC)n that shows 80 percent homology to the minisatellite sequence which may facilitate recombination in human chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2070887270,"Lambda integrative recombination depends on supercoiling of the phage attachment site, attP. Using dimethylsulfate protection and indirect end-labeling, the interaction of the recombination proteins Int and IHF with supercoiled and linear attP has been studied. Supercoiling enhances the binding of Int to attP, but not if a truncated attP site is employed or if IHF is omitted. We reason that the altered affinity reflects the formation of a higher-order nucleoprotein structure, an “attP intasome,” that involves Int and IHF assembly of both arms of attP into a wrapped configuration. The good correlation between the degree and sign of supercoiling needed to promote recombination and that needed for the “attP intasome” indicates that the primary role of supercoiling is to drive the formation of the wrapped structure."
https://openalex.org/W1999899106,"During cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, gene expression is regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional events. Although recent studies have established that posttranscriptional controls are important determinants of gene expression in several eukaryotic systems, the precise signals and mechanisms have not been clearly identified. We present evidence for a cis-acting signal, contained within the 5′ leader region of a CMV β (or early) gene, that acts posttranscriptionally in the regulation of gene expression. Addition of this signal to an α (or immediate early) gene construct converted expression of the indicator protein to the β class, even though the gene remained under α transcriptional control. Deletion of a portion of the β gene leader sequence (nucleotides +62 to +142) reverted expression to the α class. This cis-dominant signal appers to act by blocking expression posttranscriptionally until a viral function activates full gene expression at the appropriate time in infection."
https://openalex.org/W1966872571,"Cells of S. pneumoniae contain either Dpnl, a restriction endonuclease that cleaves only the methylated DNA sequence 5′-GmeATC-3′, or Dpnll, which cleaves the same sequence when not methylated. A chromosomal DNA segment containing Dpnll genes was cloned in S. pneumoniae. Nucleotide sequencing of this segment revealed genes encoding the methylase and endonuclease and a third protein of unknown function. When the plasmid was introduced into Dpnl cells, recombination during chromosomal facilitation of its establishment substituted genes encoding the Dpnl endonuclease and another protein in place of the Dpnll genes. DNA hybridization and sequencing showed that the Dpnl and Dpnll segments share homology on either side but not between themselves or with other regions of the chromosome. Thus, the complementary restriction systems are found on non-homologous and mutually exclusive cassettes that can be inserted into a particular point in the chromosome of S. pneumoniae on the basis of neighboring homology."

https://openalex.org/W1531449482,"The metabolism of exogenous [3H]diacylglycerols by intact human platelets was studied in order to examine: the metabolic fate of these second messengers in an intact cell, the effect of diacylglycerol kinase and diacylglycerol lipase inhibitors on this metabolism, the effect of agonist stimulation on metabolism, and the dependence of metabolism on diacylglycerol chain length. When 2.5 microM [3H]dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) was added to 10(9) platelets it was rapidly metabolized; 80% was converted to various products in 2.5 min. Initially, 40% was recovered as 3H-labeled phospholipid (predominantly phosphatidic acid) reflecting the action of diacylglycerol kinase, 20% was recovered as [3H]glycerol due to the action of diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol lipases, and small amounts were recovered as triacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol. Thrombin stimulation of platelets did not affect the rate or pathway of metabolism. Pretreatment of platelets with the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitors, diC8ethyleneglycol or 1-monooleoylglycerol, inhibited 3H-labeled phospholipid production 47% and 75%, respectively, and resulted in a longer lived diC8 signal. The diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, RHC 80267, inhibited the production of water-soluble metabolites 75%. Despite inhibition of the lipase, the overall metabolism of exogenous [3H]diC8 occurred at a similar rate as in control platelets due to an increased flux towards phospholipid. The ability of exogenous diacylglycerols to be metabolized by diacylglycerol kinase correlated well with their ability to activate protein kinase C in platelets. [3H]Dibutyroylglycerol, didodecanoylglycerol, and ditetradecanoylglycerol, were not metabolized by this route. These diacylglycerols were still metabolized via the lipase pathway. The results indicate that platelets possess potent attenuation systems to defend against the accumulation of diacylglycerol second messengers, and that the primary metabolic fate of cell-permeable, exogenous diacylglycerols is conversion to phosphatidic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2415635752,"There are two major beta-hexosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.52, isozymes in normal human tissues. They exist as active dimers of alpha- and/or beta-subunits. A defect of their beta-subunit results in Sandhoff disease (O-variant GM2 gangliosidosis), an inherited, clinically heterogeneous, lysosomal storage disease. The status of the HEXB gene, pre beta-polypeptide chain mRNA, and residual beta-hexosaminidase activities were examined in a clinically and ethnically diverse collection of 16 fibroblast cell lines from patients with Sandhoff disease. Differentiation of the two major clinical types, infantile and juvenile onset, could be made by the determination of the activity of the residual beta-hexosaminidase eluting in the same pH range as hexosaminidase A. All the juvenile lines were found to have normal or reduced levels of pre beta-chain mRNA and no gross abnormalities in the HEXB gene. Of the 11 infantile type cell lines examined, four were found to contain no detectable pre beta-chain mRNA. Two cell lines in this group contained partial gene deletions localized to the 5' end of the HEXB gene. One of these cell lines has previously been assigned to the single complementation group in Sandhoff disease, conclusively demonstrating that the primary gene defect in the majority of Sandhoff cases is in the HEXB gene itself. These data suggest that each clinical group is made up of a collection of different HEXB mutations."
https://openalex.org/W37130593,"Canine tracheal epithelial cells freshly isolated from mongrel dog trachea were used to study relationships between arachidonic acid metabolism and chloride ion movement. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the cell incubation media after the addition of A23187 showed the presence of prostaglandin H synthase and lipoxygenase-derived metabolites. The major prostaglandin H synthase metabolite identified by HPLC, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry was prostaglandin (PG) D2. The major lipoxygenase metabolites were leukotriene (LT) C4 and LTB4. LTB4 was identified by HPLC, UV spectroscopy, and gas chromatography. Straight phase HPLC of the methyl esters indicated only a minor formation of LTB4 isomers. LTC4 was identified by HPLC, UV spectroscopy, and conversion to LTD4 by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Analysis by radioimmunoassays indicated approximately 1-2 ng of LTB4 and peptide LT formed by 10(6) cells after A23187 stimulation. The addition of ionophore A23187 caused a rapid release of arachidonic acid metabolites which was completed within 5 min of stimulation. Cl- secretion was measured in parallel studies of excised tracheas in Ussing chambers. Cl- secretion occurred at 2-3 min after the addition of ionophore, and the most rapid change occurred with the highest PGD2 concentrations. Indomethacin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of PGD2 formation and Cl- movement. The addition of PGE2, PGD2, and PGH2 effectively stimulated Cl- secretion. LTC4 also stimulated Cl- secretion, but the stimulation was inhibited by indomethacin. These results indicate that canine tracheal epithelial cells metabolize arachidonic acid via both prostaglandin H synthase and lipoxygenase enzymes. It appears that endogenous PGD2 formation is the important variable controlling the Cl- ion movement in canine trachea."
https://openalex.org/W79961592,"Addition of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) to pituitary cells prelabeled with [32P]Pi or with myo-[2-3H]inositol, resulted in a rapid decrease in the level of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (approximately 10 s), and in [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (approximately 1 min), followed by increased labeling of [32P]phosphatidylinositol and [32P]phosphatidic acid (1 min). GnRH stimulated the appearance of [3H]myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (10 s), [3H]myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (15 s), and [3H]myo-inositol 1-phosphate (1 min) in the presence of Li+ (10 mM). Li+ alone stimulated the accumulation of [3H]myo-inositol 1-phosphate and [3H]myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate but not [3H]myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, but had no effect on luteinizing hormone release. The effect of GnRH on inositol phosphates (Ins-P) production was dose-related (ED50 = 1-5 nM), and was blocked by a potent antagonist [D-pGlu,pClPhe,D-Trp]GnRH. Elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i), by ionomycin and A23187 from intracellular or extracellular Ca2+ pools, respectively, had no significant effect on [3H]Ins-P production. GnRH-induced [3H]Ins-P production was not dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and was noticed also after extracellular or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by A23187 or ionomycin, respectively. The effect of GnRH on [3H]Ins-P accumulation was not affected by prior treatment of the cells with the tumor promoter phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or with islet-activating protein pertussis toxin. These results indicate that GnRH stimulates a rapid phosphodiester hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides. The stimulatory effect is not mediated via an islet-activating protein-substrate, is not dependent on elevation of [Ca2+]i, neither is it negatively regulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate which activates Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein C kinase. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that GnRH-induced phosphoinositide turnover is responsible for Ca2+ mobilization followed by gonadotropin release."

https://openalex.org/W105767410,"A lack of factor VIII:C, manifested as a bleeding disorder due to the absence of clot formation, is known as hemophilia A, an X chromosome-linked inherited disease afflicting 1-2 males/10,000. To determine the minimum functional domain(s) essential for factor VIII:C activity, we have expressed the amino-terminal (92-kDa) and carboxyl-terminal (80-kDa) proteolytic cleavage products as individual, secreted polypeptides in monkey cells without the 909-residue central region. We have found that neither terminal domain alone is able to promote coagulation in factor VIII:C-deficient plasma. However, when the 92- and 80-kDa peptides are co-expressed, clotting activity is readily detected. Thus, these two chains alone constitute an active or activatable complex. The central domain is required neither for activity nor for the assembly of an active complex from two chains expressed in trans. These results suggest that a truncated derivative of factor VIII:C may be useful in coagulation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1937896568,"The role of iron ions in paraquat toxicity was studied in bacterial system. We show that addition of ferrous iron led to an enhancement of the bacterial killing, whereas addition of chelating agents, such as nitrilotriacetate and desferrioxamine, markedly reduced, up to a total abolishment, the toxic effects. The calculated rates of bacterial killing are proportional to both paraquat and iron concentrations, and conform to the rate equation: dN/dt = -k[paraquat] [Fe2+]. The killing constant for iron, k, is 24-fold smaller than the corresponding value for copper. Mannitol, an OH. scavenger, has a partial protective effect: 15-35% at concentrations range of 1-50 mM, respectively. Histidine, on the other hand, provided a more efficient protection that may be due to a combination of various effects. Induction of endogenous superoxide dismutase and catalase provided partial protection (about 25%). These findings, together with an earlier study on the role of copper in paraquat toxicity (Kohen, R., and Chevion, M. (1985) Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1, 79-88) indicate that transition metals play a central catalytic role in the production of the deleterious effects of paraquat, probably by redox cycling and producing OH. via the site-specific Fenton reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2011281622,"We have cloned and sequenced the telomeric DNA of the linear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of T. thermophila BVII. The mtDNA telomeres consist of a 53 bp sequence tandemly repeated from 4 to 30 times, with most molecules having 15 +/- 4 repetitions. The previously recognized terminal heterogeneity of the mtDNA is completely accounted for by the variability in the number of repeats. The 53 bp repeat does not resemble known telomeric DNA in sequence, repeat size, or number of repetitions. The termini occur at heterogeneous positions within the 53 bp repeat. The junction of the telomeric repeat with the internal DNA is at a different position within the telomeric repeat on each end of the mtDNA. We propose a model for the maintenance of the mtDNA ends involving unequal homologous recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1590625469,"The lc gene of the lambdoid bacteriophage PA-2 and the nmpC gene located on a defective lambdoid prophage in the 12-min region of the Escherichia coli K12 chromosome have been sequenced. The porin proteins encoded by these two genes were almost identical, with only 4 of the 365 residues of the precursor forms of the proteins being different. The Lc and NmpC proteins were strongly homologous to the OmpC, ompF, and PhoE proteins, with greater than 56% of the residues identical in each case. Sequencing of the region flanking the lc gene allowed precise positioning of this gene with respect to the rightward cos site of the phage and to sequences which are homologous between PA-2 and lambda. In wild-type strains of E. coli K12, the nmpC gene is not expressed and contains an IS5 insertion near the 3' end of the coding region. This insertion deletes 18 residues from the COOH terminus of NmpC protein and adds 8 residues from an open reading frame extending into IS5 sequence. Expression of this form of the gene in an expression vector plasmid demonstrated that this altered protein is still capable of being translocated to the outer membrane. Plasmid expression experiments using lc-nmpC hybrid genes show that it is the presence of the IS5 insertion which prevents expression of the porin in wild-type E. coli K12. In the nmpC mutant which expresses the protein, there has been a precise excision of the IS5 which regenerates a COOH terminus of NmpC protein which is identical to that of the Lc protein. Blot hybridization detected no mRNA transcripts from the wild-type nmpC gene, although transcripts were readily detected from the lc gene in PA-2 lysogens and from the nmpC mutant which has excised the IS5. This indicates that IS5 affects the production or stability of transcripts from the adjacent nmpC gene."

https://openalex.org/W1586159404,"Abstract Carotenoids are membrane pigments present in all photosynthetic organisms, providing essential photoprotective functions. The first carotenoid formed in the pathway is phytoene, a colorless compound which is then converted into colored carotenoids by a series of dehydrogenation reactions. In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas capsulata mutations that affect carotenoid biosynthesis before colored carotenoids are formed have a phenotype as opposed to the red of wild type cells. We have extracted carotenoids from several blue-green mutants and found that two strains (BPY69 and BPY102) accumulate phytoene and no colored carotenoids. These mutants failed to dehydrogenate phytoene in an in vitro assay. However, dehydrogenation of this compound can be achieved in vitro by adding a cell-free extract from another blue-green mutant blocked earlier in the pathway. Genetic complementation and deletion mapping indicate that the gene crtI is responsible for the conversion of phytoene into colored carotenoids in these mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2131031314,"A yeast strain lacking a functional copy of ADH1 has been isolated that is resistant to antimycin A because of the presence of multiple copies of a nuclear gene, ADH4. The amplified copies of ADH4 exist on linear molecules 42 kb in length, which can be separated from chromosomal DNA by orthogonal-field-alternation gel electrophoresis. These amplified molecules are palindromes that reanneal rapidly after denaturation to form linear, snap-back molecules 21 kb in length. The amplified ADH4 sequences are bounded by telomere-homologous sequences. The chromosomal copy of ADH4 is the most distal marker on the left arm of chromosome VII, and the amplified ADH4-containing molecules appear to contain two copies of the region extending from ADH4 to the telomere."
https://openalex.org/W50475275,"We have used renal (Na,K)-ATPase, covalently labeled with fluorescein, and phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with labeled enzyme, to detect conformational transitions induced by acetyl phosphate in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ ions. Equilibrium fluorescence measurements show quenching of the fluorescein fluorescence, which is thought to reflect conversion of the initial E1 form to the phosphorylated E2P form. These fluorescence changes occur on inside-out-oriented pumps. The rates of acetyl phosphate-induced fluorescence changes have been measured using a stopped-flow fluorimeter. The rate of fluorescence quenching (1.5-3 s-1) is a measure of the rate of the E1P(Na)----E2P transition. The quenching is preceded by a fast fluorescence increase (12.3 +/- 4 s-1) associated with phosphorylation of E1 to E1P(Na), shown clearly in experiments with enzyme treated with oligomycin. Oligomycin greatly reduces the rate of the fluorescence quenching (0.044 +/- 0.01 s-1). Using potassium-loaded vesicles treated with valinomycin or lithium-loaded vesicles treated with Li+ ionophore N,N'-diheptyl-N,N'-didiethyl ether, 5,5-dimethyl-3,7-dioxanonanediamide in order to induce electrical diffusion potentials, negative inside, the rates of the fluorescence quenching are accelerated by up to 4-fold. The experiments demonstrate that the conformational transition E1P(Na)----E2P, associated with transport of 3 Na+ ions, is a voltage-sensitive reaction, carrying a net positive charge. This confirms a prediction based on transport experiments. In experiments with fluorescein-labeled (Na,K)-ATPase, the use of acetyl phosphate rather than ATP, which does not bind, provides a valuable tool to detect fluorescence signals accompanying steps in the turnover cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1986874057,"Vascular smooth muscle from different arteries of the rabbit varies in sensitivity to norepinephrine, even when factors known to contribute to this variation are excluded. Sensitivity to norepinephrine mediated through the alpha-adrenoceptor is linearly related to the agonist dissociation constant, but is not significantly related to receptor reserve. These results suggest that agonist affinity is the primary determinant of sensitivity to norepinephrine, at least in these arteries, and that this is a locally regulated characteristic which may account for regional sensitivity changes."
https://openalex.org/W167349005,"Conditionally lethal Escherichia coli mutants in secY (prlA) show defective export of proteins to the periplasm and outer membrane. It has been proposed that this gene and other sec genes must act on pro-OmpA at an early stage of protein synthesis in order to allow later translocation to occur. We have described a temperature-sensitive mutation in which the secYts function is impaired at the nonpermissive temperature (Ito, K. (1984) Mol. Gen. Genet. 197, 204-208). A plasmid bearing the wild-type secY gene under the control of the lactose operon (Shiba, K., Ito, K., Yura, T., and Cerretti, D. P. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 631-635) has been introduced into this mutant strain. We now report that the in vivo chase of pulse-labeled full length pro-OmpA to mature OmpA is accelerated by inducing the synthesis of the wild-type secY protein at the end of the period of pulse labeling. We have also assayed the requirements for secY function for in vitro protein translocation. Membranes derived from secY ts cells which were incubated at 42 degrees C were inactive in vitro in the post-translational uptake and processing of pro-OmpA. Thus, the secY protein can act post-translationally, enhancing the translocation of completed pro-OmpA polypeptide chains across the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W135785445,"A pink, high molecular weight form of uteroferrin (Uf) has been isolated from uterine secretions and allantoic fluid of pigs. This protein fraction (denoted FIII) which is relatively stable under physiological conditions of pH, ionic strength, and temperature has a molecular weight of about 80,000, a value approximately twice that of purple Uf (Mr approximately 35,000) isolated from a separate fraction (FIV) by gel filtration. The visible absorption spectrum, EPR signal, and acid phosphatase activity of Uf in FIII are almost identical to those of FIV Uf after the latter has been reduced by 2-mercaptoethanol. However, unlike reduced FIV Uf, the pink, high molecular form does not revert to purple, nor does it show loss of EPR signal and phosphatase activity in the presence of oxygen. In addition, it does not become purple at orthophosphate concentrations which inhibit Uf acid phosphatase activity. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate has shown that FIII consists of approximately equal amounts of Uf polypeptides (Mr = 35,000 and 37,000) and a group of three polypeptides (Mr = 40,000, 46,000, and 50,000) antigenically unrelated to Uf. The latter share a common epitope not found on Uf and are probably differentially processed forms of the same protein. FIII can be dissociated by pH conditions below 5.0, by exposure to antibodies raised against Uf or the associated polypeptides, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate at 100 degrees C. The polypeptides in FIII are not therefore linked by disulfide bonds. Treatment with dimethyl suberimidate, however, results in a cross-linked complex (Mr approximately 82,000) consisting of Uf and the associated polypeptides. It is concluded that this high Mr form of Uf is a heterodimer of fully activated Uf and a second polypeptide of unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W158576272,"Tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor can be regulated by its state of association. Studies done with the purified receptor solubilized in Triton X-100 indicate that dimer formation results in negative regulation of kinase, whereas successive binding of EGF and ATP shift the association equilibrium toward the catalytically active monomeric form. The promotion of the monomeric state by ATP can be mimicked by various nonphosphorylating analogs indicating that nucleotide binding rather than autophosphorylation is responsible for stabilizing the monomeric receptor form. Truncated receptor forms, lacking either the external EGF-binding domain or the internal kinase (ATP-binding) domain, are unable to form stable dimers. These results suggest that both intra- and extracellular domains of the receptor act to stabilize the kinase-regulatory dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1530661278,"Phorbol esters in the presence of Ca2+ apparently mimic diacylglycerol in activating protein kinase C. Resulting phosphorylations alter multiple cellular processes including inhibition of the action of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists. In contrast to this inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization, addition of 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to murine S49 lymphoma cells stimulated Mg2+ influx severalfold without any detectable alteration of Mg2+ efflux or of Ca2+ influx or efflux. Stimulation of Mg2+ influx did not require extracellular Ca2+, was half-maximal at 10 nM PMA, and was characterized by a marked increase in the Vmax of Mg2+ influx without change in the Ka for Mg2+. Stimulation of Mg2+ influx was not mimicked by 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate, which does not activate protein kinase C and was not the result of Na+/H+ exchange activity. The effect of PMA on Mg2+ influx was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol, which we have previously shown to inhibit Mg2+ influx by a non-cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism (Maguire, M. E., and Erdos, J. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1030-1035). Forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, also inhibited PMA stimulation of Mg2+ influx, suggesting the presence of both cyclic AMP-dependent and -independent influences on Mg2+ influx. We have also previously demonstrated that Mg2+ influx occurs solely into a small subcytoplasmic pool (Grubbs, R. D., Collins, S. D., and Maguire, M. E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12184-12192). PMA did not alter this compartmentation; rather, it almost doubled the content of this cytosolic Mg2+ pool. These data indicate that, in addition to phorbol ester modulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, substantial changes in Mg2+ flux and content occur. They further demonstrate that Mg2+ influx is regulated by a variety of stimuli. It seems likely that such alterations in Mg2+ flux and content would have physiological consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1506309955,"Cyclic GMP has been implicated in controlling the light-regulated conductance of rod photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina. However, there is little direct evidence correlating changes in cGMP concentration with the light-regulated permeability mechanism in living cells. A preparation of intact frog rod outer segments suspended in a Ringer's medium containing low Ca2+ has been used to demonstrate that initial changes in total cellular cGMP concentration parallel changes in the light-regulated membrane current over a wide range of light intensities. At light intensities bleaching from 160 to 5.6 X 10(6) rhodopsin molecules/rod/s, decreases in the response latency for the cGMP kinetics parallel decreases in the latent period of the electrical response. Further, changes in the rate of the cGMP decrease parallel the rate of membrane current suppression as the light intensity is varied. Up to 10(5) cGMP molecules are hydrolyzed per photolyzed rhodopsin, consistent with in vitro studies showing that each bleached rhodopsin can activate over 100 phosphodiesterase molecules. Addition of the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, does not affect the initial kinetics of the cGMP decrease or of the electrical response, excluding a direct role for Ca2+ in the initial events of phototransduction. These results are consistent with cGMP being the intracellular messenger that links rhodopsin isomerization with changes in membrane permeability upon illumination. It is unlikely, however, that light-induced changes in total cGMP concentration are the sole regulators of membrane current. This is suggested by several observations: at bright light intensities, the subsecond light-induced cGMP decrease is essentially complete prior to complete suppression of membrane current; maximal light-induced decreases in cGMP concentration occur at all light intensities tested, whereas the extent of membrane current suppression varies over the same range of light intensities; changing the external Ca2+ concentration from 1 mM to 10 nM in the dark causes an increase in membrane current that is significantly more rapid than corresponding changes in cGMP concentration. Thus, light-induced changes in total cellular cGMP concentration correlate with some, but not all, aspects of the visual excitation process in vertebrate photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2465542970,"Both VARNA genes in the adenovirus genome are transcribed by host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III. Nevertheless, late in infection the mass ratio of VARNA2 to VARNA1 in adenovirus-infected human KB or HeLa cells is about 1:40. This difference is most likely due to differences in promoter strength which may be attributed to sequence differences in the control regions of the two genes. To investigate this possibility, the two genes were cloned into separate plasmid molecules and their transcription efficiencies were compared in vitro. The VARNA2 gene was transcribed in vitro at least 50 times less efficiently than the VARNA1 gene. The competing strengths of the two genes were similar, which suggests that the B block sequence in the VARNA2 gene may be fully functional for sequestering factors. Therefore, the major difference must reside in the region upstream of the B block. By analyzing the hybrid RNAs transcribed from a hybrid gene and 27 fused genes in which only the control region of the VARNA1 gene was fused to various lengths of the 5'-flanking and the coding regions of the VARNA2 gene, one major and one minor termination site, which caused premature termination, were revealed downstream of the A block sequence and in the 5'-flanking region of the VARNA2 gene, respectively. The presence of termination sequences, a suboptimal interblock spacing, and an altered A block sequence in the control region may result in a weaker promoter in the VARNA2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1525635642,"Rabbit muscle phosphoglycerate mutase, presumed to manifest an absolute cofactor requirement for activity, has been found to express catalysis (3 +/- 1% of optimum) in the absence of added D-glycerate-2,3-P2. Isotope experiments indicate that this catalysis proceeds through a binary phosphoryl enzyme-glycerate intermediate which dissociates into free enzyme and monophosphoglycerate. 32P-Labeled phosphoglycerate mutase is formed by reaction with either D-32P-glycerate-3-P or D-U32P-glycerate-2,3-P2. In each case, the acid lability and alkali stability of the covalent adduct, phosphoenzyme, is consistent with a phosphohistidyl residue having been formed within the active site. D-[U-14C]Glycerate reacts with phosphoenzyme to generate D-[U-14C]monophosphoglycerate which, in turn, can react further with phosphoenzyme to yield D-[U-14C]glycerate-2,3-P2. The pH profile for the cofactor-independent activity exhibits an optimum at 6.0 as opposed to 7.0 when D-glycerate-2,3-P2 is present in the reaction medium. Bisubstrate kinetics (pH 7.0, 23 degrees C) with D-glycerate-3-P concentration as the variable, yields a family of reciprocal plots which is in accord with a modified ping-pong mechanism when D-glycerate-2,3-P2 concentrations are greater than 10(-1) Km (where Km = 0.33 microM). Progressively diminishing concentrations (much less than Km) of D-glycerate-2,3-P2 produce curvilinear reciprocal plots that approach linearity as a limit in accordance with single substrate kinetics."
