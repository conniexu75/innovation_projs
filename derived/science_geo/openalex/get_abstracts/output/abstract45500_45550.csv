https://openalex.org/W1595133660,"Sphingosine inhibited protein kinase C activity and phorbol dibutyrate binding. When the mechanism of inhibition of activity and phorbol dibutyrate binding was investigated in vitro using Triton X-100 mixed micellar methods, sphingosine inhibition was subject to surface dilution; 50% inhibition occurred when sphingosine was equimolar with sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (diC18:1) or 40% of the phosphatidylserine (PS) present. Sphingosine inhibition was modulated by Ca2+ and by the mole percent of diC18:1 and PS present. Sphingosine was a competitive inhibitor with respect to diC18:1, phorbol dibutyrate, and Ca2+. Increasing levels of PS markedly reduced inhibition by sphingosine. Since protein kinase C activity shows a cooperative dependence on PS, the kinetic analysis of competitive inhibition was only suggestive. Sphingosine inhibited phorbol dibutyrate binding to protein kinase C but did not cause protein kinase C to dissociate from the mixed micelle surface. Sphingosine addition to human platelets blocked thrombin and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol-dependent phosphorylation of the 40-kDa (47 kDa) dalton protein. Moreover, sphingosine was subject to surface dilution in platelets. The mechanism of sphingosine inhibition is discussed in relation to a previously proposed model of protein kinase C activation. The possible physiological role of sphingosine as a negative effector of protein kinase C is suggested and a plausible cycle for its generation is presented. The potential physiological significance of sphingosine inhibition of protein kinase C is further established in accompanying papers on HL-60 cells (Merrill, A. H., Jr., Sereni, A. M., Stevens, V. L., Hannun, Y. A., Bell, R. M., Kinkade, J. M., Jr. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12010-12615) and human neutrophils (Wilson, E., Olcott, M. C., Bell, R. M., Merrill, A. H., Jr., and Lambeth, J. D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12616-12623). These results also suggest that sphingosine will be a useful inhibitor for investigating the function of protein kinase C in vitro and in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2057375535,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a human disease associated with a consistent chromosomal translocation that results in sequences from the c-abl locus on chromosome 9 being fused to sequences in a breakpoint cluster region (bcr) on chromosome 22. CML cells have two novel products: an 8.5-kilobase RNA transcript containing both abl and bcr and a 210-kilodalton phosphoprotein (P210) recognized by v-abl-specific antisera. To test whether the P210 is the product of the novel 8.5-kilobase bcr/abl fusion transcript, antibodies were prepared against c-abl and bcr determinants. By using these reagents and v-abl-specific antisera, it was demonstrated that the P210 in CML cells is indeed the protein product of the 8.5-kilobase transcript. By analogy to the gag/abl fusion protein of Abelson murine leukemia virus, the replacement of amino terminal c-abl sequences by bcr sequences in P210 may create a transforming protein involved in CML. A 190-kilodalton phosphoprotein that is a candidate for the normal bcr protein was identified in both HeLa and K562 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030903599,"A method is described for directly cloning enzymatically amplified segments of genomic DNA into an M13 vector for sequence analysis. A 110-base pair fragment of the human beta-globin gene and a 242-base pair fragment of the human leukocyte antigen DQ alpha locus were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method, a procedure based on repeated cycles of denaturation, primer annealing, and extension by DNA polymerase I. Oligonucleotide primers with restriction endonuclease sites added to their 5' ends were used to facilitate the cloning of the amplified DNA. The analysis of cloned products allowed the quantitative evaluation of the amplification method's specificity and fidelity. Given the low frequency of sequence errors observed, this approach promises to be a rapid method for obtaining reliable genomic sequences from nanogram amounts of DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1981686096,"In the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, we observe estrogen induction of the stable transfected Xenopus vitellogenin A2 gene. An estrogen-responsive element (ERE) could be defined by using a vitellogenin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase hybrid gene in transient transfection experiments. The ERE is located in the 5' flanking region and is able to confer estrogen inducibility to the thymidine kinase gene promoter. By 5' and 3' deletions we have determined a 35 bp sequence sufficient for high stimulation by estradiol. Even 18 bp give a small estrogen response. The 35 bp ERE contains the palindromic sequence 5'GGTCACAGTGACC-3' as an essential element. The fact that the ERE of a frog gene functions in human cells demonstrates that signals and factors involved in the control have been conserved during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1528585209,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) stimulates cell replication in fetal rat calvariae, and studies with isolated bone cells suggest that the primary mitogenically responsive cell is of the osteoblast lineage. The effect of TGF beta on bone cell replication is biphasic and depends on both the TGF beta concentration and cell density in monolayer culture. After 23 h of treatment, DNA synthesis in confluent cells is progressively enhanced by 0.15-15 ng/ml TGF beta; but in subconfluent cells, 15 ng/ml is less than maximal; and in sparse cell cultures, it is inhibitory. At all cell densities, however, 15 ng/ml TGF beta stimulates collagen synthesis, an effect which is more pronounced when DNA synthesis rates are declining. Furthermore, 1 mM hydroxyurea, which blocks the mitogenic effect of TGF beta by 85%, only minimally influences the increase in collagen synthesis. Cytoplasmic slot blot analysis reveals alterations in the amount of type I collagen mRNA in TGF beta-treated cells, suggesting that control is exerted, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Since TGF beta is found in culture medium conditioned by bone explants and in bone tissue extracts, these results support that TGF beta is an important and multifunctional autocrine regulator of bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W1999340769,"Damage to the vessel wall is a signal for endothelial migration and replication and for platelet release at the site of injury. Addition of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) purified from platelets to growing aortic endothelial cells inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner. A transient inhibition of DNA synthesis was also observed in response to wounding; cell migration and replication are inhibited during the first 24 hours after wounding. By 48 hours after wounding both TGF-beta-treated and -untreated cultures showed similar responses. Flow microfluorimetric analysis of cell cycle distribution indicated that after 24 hours of exposure to TGF-beta the cells were blocked from entering S phase, and the fraction of cells in G1 was increased. The inhibition of the initiation of regeneration by TGF-beta could allow time for recruitment of smooth muscle cells into the site of injury by other platelet components."
https://openalex.org/W1534534898,"A phosphorylated glycoprotein was purified from the mixture of proteins extracted by demineralization of rat bone with 0.5 M EDTA in 4 M guanidinium chloride. A high level of purity for the preparation was indicated by a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gradient gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugal data, and by automated Edman degradation results. The molecular weight of the phosphoprotein was shown to be about 44,000 by sedimentation equilibrium analyses in 4 M guanidinium chloride, even though an Mr of 75,000 was obtained by 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Subsequent analysis by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave an Mr of 45,000. Analytical data showed that the protein contained 16.6% carbohydrate, possibly including 1 N-linked oligosaccharide and 5-6 O-linked oligosaccharides. The aspartic acid- and glutamic acid-rich protein contained about 300 amino acid residues including 1 phosphothreonine and 12 phosphoserine residues. Alkaline beta-elimination/NaBH4 reduction data showed that the phosphate obtained by complete acid hydrolysis prior to amino acid analysis was equivalent to the phosphate subject to alkaline beta-elimination. In this experiment, the losses of serine plus threonine exceeded the amount of phosphate liberated by 5-6 residues/protein. These serine and threonine residues probably represent O-linked oligosaccharides, since the protein contained about this number of N-acetyl-galactosamine residues. That the phosphoprotein is synthesized and secreted by osteoblast-like cells was shown with cultures of clonal rat osteosarcoma cells. After pulsing with 32PO4 the proteins secreted into the medium were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and the radiolabeled proteins were immunoadsorbed. A protein migrating in the same position, on 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (i.e. with an Mr = 75,000) and on 15% gels (Mr = 45,000), as the phosphoprotein obtained from bone could be specifically immunoprecipitated."
https://openalex.org/W2046756969,"Acquisition of the ability to produce and respond to a growth factor may result in increased cellular proliferation and could lead to malignant transformation. The fact that a large variety of tumor cells secrete transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) suggests involvement of TGF-alpha in cellular transformation and provides supporting evidence for the autocrine stimulation model. In order to determine directly the role of TGF-alpha in tumorigenicity, we introduced a human TGF-alpha cDNA expression vector into established nontransformed Fischer rat fibroblast (Rat-1) cells. Synthesis and secretion of human TGF-alpha by these cells results in the loss of anchorage-dependent growth and induces tumor formation in nude mice. Anti-human TGF-alpha monoclonal antibodies prevent TGF-alpha expressing Rat-1 cells from forming colonies in soft agar."
https://openalex.org/W1495519011,"Cartilage-inducing factors-A (CIF-A) and -B (CIF-B), purified from bovine bone on the basis of their ability to induce the cartilage phenotype in vitro, are proteins with molecular weights of 26,000 composed of two apparently identical disulfide-linked chains. CIF-A is apparently identical to TGF-beta from human platelets (Seyedin S. M., Thompson, A. Y., Bentz, H., Rosen, D. M., McPherson, J. M., Conti, A., Siegel, N. R., Galluppi, G. R., and Piez, K. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5693-5695). We have now found that, like CIF-A and TGF-beta, CIF-B induces anchorage-independent proliferation of NRK-49F cells when these cells are simultaneously treated with epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, CIF-B competes with CIF-A for the same cell membrane receptors in NRK-49F cells. Partial amino acid sequencing reveals that CIF-B is a distinct molecule with extensive homology to CIF-A/TGF-beta. These results show that CIF-B and TGF-beta are structurally and functionally similar molecules, but differ more from each other than does TGF-beta from different species."
https://openalex.org/W1524495054,"The effects of long-chain (sphingoid) bases on the phorbol ester-dependent differentiation of HL-60 cells were investigated since these molecules are potent inhibitors of protein kinase C (Hannun, Y. A., Loomis, C. R., Merrill, A. H., Jr., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12604-12609). After 24 h, low concentrations of sphinganine (1-5 microM blocked both cell adherence and the inhibition of growth in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, as measured by cell number and acid phosphatase activity. Sphinganine and sphingosine decreased adherence by 50% at 1-3 microM; other long-chain bases were effective in parallel to their inhibition of protein kinase C. Sphinganine decreased the binding of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate by the phorbol receptor of HL-60 cells, protein kinase C, and inhibited the response of HL-60 cells to dioctanoylglycerol, a cell permeable activator of this enzyme. Long-chain base uptake by HL-60 cells was demonstrated with [3-3H]sphinganine and within 1-3 days much had been converted to ceramides. By day 3, most of the cells had recovered the ability to adhere and exhibited macrophage characteristics, whereas cells in suspension did not differentiate. The level of free sphinganine in HL-60 cells was determined to be 12.3 +/- 1.2 pmol/10(6) cells. These results establish that sphingoid bases inhibit protein kinase C in HL-60 cells and may function physiologically as negative effectors of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2016142807,"cDNA analysis has revealed that the 50 amino acid transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is derived from a 160 amino acid precursor. Antibodies to TGF-alpha and to a C-terminal portion of the precursor were used to study the biosynthesis and processing of the precursor. CHO cells transfected with a TGF-alpha expression vector secrete high levels of TGF-alpha; a mixture of species of about 18 kd is secreted in addition to the 50 amino acid form. These larger species are N-glycosylated and are derived from the same precursor as the smaller form. The C-terminal segment of the precursor remains anchored in the membrane and has covalently attached palmitate. The newly synthesized TGF-alpha precursor is thus a transmembrane protein that subsequently undergoes external proteolytic cleavages, releasing several TGF-alpha species."

https://openalex.org/W53883719,"O-Linked oligosaccharides were isolated from normal granulocytes, chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, and acute myelogenous leukemia cells by alkaline borohydride treatment. Oligosaccharides were fractionated by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration and QAE-Sephadex column chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry after permethylation and methylation analysis before and after specific exoglycosidase treatments. Results show that normal granulocytes and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells contain a series of O-linked oligosaccharides with the following structure, (formula: see text) where, in normal granulocytes n = 0 is major and n = 1 or 2, and thus polylactosaminyl oligosaccharides are present as minor components. However, these polylactosaminyl oligosaccharides were barely detectable in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. On the other hand, acute myelogenous leukemia cells, which represent poorly differentiated myeloid cells, mainly contain short O-linked oligosaccharides with 2----6-linked sialic acid as follows. (formula: see text) These results suggest that structures of O-linked oligosaccharides vary in the different maturation stages along the same cell lineage."

https://openalex.org/W1591119530,"Ca2+-activated and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) isolated from rat brain cytosol undergoes autophosphorylation in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, Ca2+, phosphatidylserine, and diolein. Approximately 2-2.5 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of the kinase. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, the phosphorylated kinase showed a single protein band of Mr = 82,000 compared to the Mr = 80,000 of the nonphosphorylated enzyme. Analysis of the 32P-labeled tryptic peptides derived from the autophosphorylated kinase by peptide mapping revealed that multiple sites were phosphorylated. Both serine and threonine residues were found to be labeled with 32P. Limited proteolysis of the autophosphorylated kinase with trypsin resulted in the conversion of the kinase into a phospholipid- and Ca2+-independent form. Two major 32P-labeled fragments, Mr = 48,000 and 38,000, were formed as a result of proteolysis, suggesting that the catalytic domain and possibly the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding region were both phosphorylated. Protein kinase C autophosphorylation has a Km for ATP (1.5 microM) about 10-fold lower than that for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. The kinetically preferred autophosphorylation appears to be an intramolecular reaction. The autophosphorylated protein kinase C, unlike the protease-degraded enzyme, still depends on Ca2+ and phospholipid for maximal activity. However, the autophosphorylated form of the kinase has a lower Ka for Ca2+ and a higher affinity for the binding of [3H]phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate. These findings suggest that autophosphorylation of protein kinase C may be important in the regulation of the enzymic activity subsequent to signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2082315237,"The bombesin-like peptides are potent mitogens for Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, human bronchial epithelial cells, and cells isolated from small cell carcinoma of the lung. The mechanism of signal transduction in the proliferative response to bombesin was investigated by studying the effect of Bordetella pertussis toxin on bombesin-stimulated mitogenesis. At nanomolar concentrations, bombesin increased levels of c-myc messenger RNA and stimulated DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (5 nanograms per milliliter) completely blocked bombesin-enhanced c-myc expression and eliminated bombesin-stimulated DNA synthesis. This treatment had essentially no effect on the mitogenic responses to either platelet-derived growth factor or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. These results suggest that the mitogenic actions of bombesin-like growth factors are mediated through a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein. Furthermore they indicate that bombesin-like growth factors act through pathways that are different from those activated by platelet-derived growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W2068778107,"Increasing quantities of man-made organic chemicals are released each year into the biosphere. Some of these compounds are both toxic and relatively resistant to physical, chemical, or biological degradation, and they thus constitute an environmental burden of considerable magnitude. Genetic manipulation of microbial catabolic pathways offers a powerful means by which to accelerate evolution of biodegradative routes through which such compounds might be eliminated from the environment. In the experiments described here, a catabolic pathway for alkylbenzoates specified by the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas was restructured to produce a pathway capable of processing a new substrate, 4-ethylbenzoate. Analysis of critical steps in the TOL pathway that prevent metabolism of 4-ethylbenzoate revealed that this compound fails to induce synthesis of the catabolic enzymes and that one of its metabolic intermediates inactivates catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), the enzyme that cleaves the aromatic ring. Consequently, the pathway was sequentially modified by recruitment of genes from mutant bacteria selected for their production of either an altered pathway operon regulator that is activated by 4-ethylbenzoate or an altered C23O that is less sensitive to metabolite inactivation. The redesigned pathway was stably expressed and enabled host bacteria to degrade 4-ethylbenzoate in addition to the normal substrates of the TOL pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1518872013,"One of the early events associated with the treatment of cells by tumor promotor phorbol esters is the tight association of protein kinase C to the plasma membrane. To better understand the factors that regulate this process, phorbol ester-induced membrane binding of protein kinase C was studied using homogenates, as well as isolated membranes and purified enzyme. Addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to the homogenates of parietal yolk sac cells and NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of Ca2+ resulted in plasma membrane binding of protein kinase C which subsequently remained bound to the membrane independent of Ca2+. Although protein kinase C was activated by TPA in the absence of Ca2+ and by diolein in the presence of Ca2+, both these agents when added to homogenates under these respective conditions had no effect on membrane association of protein kinase C. However, under these conditions relatively weak binding of protein kinase C was found if purified protein kinase C was used with isolated membranes. Binding studies using purified protein kinase C and washed membranes showed that the binding of the TPA-kinase complex to membranes required phospholipids and reached saturation at 0.1 unit (24 ng of protein kinase C)/mg of parietal yolk sac cell membrane protein. Phorbol ester treatment of cells in media with and without Ca2+ showed that the TPA-induced increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C was regulated by Ca2+ levels even in intact cells. TPA-stabilized membrane binding of protein kinase C differs in several aspects from the previously reported Ca2+-induced reversible binding. TPA-stabilized binding of protein kinase C to isolated membranes is temperature dependent, relatively high in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction, saturable at physiological levels of protein kinase C, requires the presence of both membrane protein(s) and phospholipids, and further requires the addition of phospholipid micelles. In contrast, Ca2+-induced reversible binding is more rapid, not appreciably influenced by temperature, not selective for a particular subcellular fraction, not saturable with physiological amounts of protein kinase C, exhibits trypsin-insensitive membrane binding sites, and requires membrane phospholipids but not added phospholipid micelles."
https://openalex.org/W1601933856,"Trypsinization of rat brain protein kinase C (80 kDa) into 50- and 32-kDa fragments occurred without inhibition of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) binding activity. The 50-kDa fragment, the catalytic domain (Inoue, M., Kishimoto, A., Takai, Y., and Nishizuka, Y. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7610-7616), was further degraded by trypsin, whereas the 32-kDa fragment was resistant. Protein kinase activity and the [3H]PDBu binding activity were completely separated upon gel filtration of a solution containing Triton X-100/phosphatidylserine mixed micelles and trypsinized protein kinase C. Pooled fractions of the [3H]PDBu binding activity contained a 32-kDa fragment exclusively. The binding of [3H]PDBu to this fragment was dependent on calcium and phosphatidylserine and was of high affinity (Kd = 2.8 nM) and of essentially identical specificity to that of native protein kinase C. It is concluded that the 32-kDa fragment represents a lipid binding, regulatory domain of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2042752473,"Valosin, a novel 25-amino-acid peptide isolated recently from pig intestine, has several effects on the digestive system of dogs. We report here that the valosin-specific complementary DNA clone from pigs codes for a polypeptide unlike most precursors of biologically active peptides. The predicted protein lacks a characteristic amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence and contains no processing signals of the type acted upon by endopeptidases to generate other active peptides from precursors. Antibodies to synthetic valosin have been used to show that nearly all valosin immunoreactivity is in the cytoplasm and that the protein detected (valosin-containing protein, VCP), although smaller than the predicted product of the cDNA sequence, is much larger than valosin. Valosin-specific messenger RNA is found in extracts from many pig tissues, which contrasts with the restricted occurrence expected of a biologically active peptide. We conclude that valosin is an artefact of the purification procedure and does not occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1517283541,"For the first time, the enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase; EC 2.8.1.1) has been renatured from 6 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) by direct dilution of the denaturant at relatively high protein concentrations. This has been made possible by using the nonionic detergent dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (lauryl maltoside). Lauryl maltoside concentration dependence of the renaturation and reactivation time courses were studied using 50 micrograms/ml rhodanese. There was no renaturation at lauryl maltoside (less than 0.1 mg/ml), and the renaturability increased, apparently cooperatively, up to 5 mg/ml detergent. This may reflect weak binding of lauryl maltoside to intermediate rhodanese conformers. The renaturability began to decrease above 5 mg/ml lauryl maltoside and was significantly reduced at 20 mg/ml. Individual progress curves of product formation, for rhodanese diluted into lauryl maltoside 90 min before assay, showed induction phases as long as 7 min before an apparently linear steady state. The induction phase increased with lauryl maltoside concentration and could even be observed in native controls above 1 mg/ml detergent. These results are consistent with suggestions that refolding of GdmCl-denatured rhodanese involves an intermediate with exposed hydrophobic surfaces that can partition into active and inactive species. Further, lauryl maltoside can stabilize those surfaces and prevent aggregation and other hydrophobic interaction-dependent events that reduce the yield of active protein. The rhodanese-lauryl maltoside complex could also form with native enzyme, thus explaining the induction phase with this species. Finally, it is suggested that renaturation of many proteins might be assisted by lauryl maltoside or other nondenaturing detergents."
https://openalex.org/W2061942270,"Two different pathogenic effects of the Friend ecotropic murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) were distinguished by serial examinations of hematocrits and reticulocyte counts of IRW mice inoculated as newborns. F-MuLV induced hemolytic anemia with increased levels of erythropoiesis, which was detectable as early as 13 days of age, whereas blocked erythroid differentiation, associated with erythroleukemia, was apparent only after 30 days of age. Using strains of Friend-MuLV with different virulences, we constructed recombinant viruses that allowed us to map the hemolytic effect and the ability to induce rapid erythroleukemia to different regions of the viral genome. Moreover, the ability of the virus to induce rapid erythroleukemia appeared to be independent of the presence of severe early hemolytic anemia."
https://openalex.org/W1548293202,"A mixed micellar assay for the binding of phorbol-esters to protein kinase C was developed to investigate the specificity and stoichiometry of phospholipid cofactor dependence and oligomeric state of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) required for phorbol ester binding. [3H]Phorbol dibutyrate was bound to protein kinase C in the presence of Triton X-100 mixed micelles containing 20 mol % phosphatidylserine (PS) in a calcium-dependent manner with a Kd of 5 X 10(-9) M. The [3H]phorbol dibutyrate X protein kinase C . Triton X-100 . PS mixed micellar complex eluted on a Sephacryl S-200 molecular sieve at an Mr of approximately 200,000; this demonstrates that monomeric protein kinase C binds phorbol dibutyrate. This conclusion was supported by molecular sieve chromatography of a similar complex where Triton X-100 was replaced with beta-octylglucoside. Phorbol dibutyrate activation of protein kinase C in Triton X-100/PS mixed micelles occurred and was dependent on calcium. The PS dependence of both phorbol ester activation and binding to protein kinase C lagged initially and then was highly cooperative. The minimal mole per cent PS required was strongly dependent on the concentration of phorbol dibutyrate or phorbol myristic acetate employed. Even at the highest concentration of phorbol ester tested, a minimum of 3 mol % PS was required; this indicates that approximately four molecules of PS are required. [3H]Phorbol dibutyrate binding was independent of micelle number at 20 mol % PS. The phospholipid dependencies of phorbol ester binding and activation were similar, with PS being the most effective; anionic phospholipids (cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylglycerol were less effective, whereas phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin did not support binding or activation. sn-1,2-Dioleoylglycerol displaced [3H]phorbol dibutyrate quantitatively and competitively. The data are discussed in relation to a molecular model of protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W2165022312,"The peptide Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu was shown to be a specific substrate for casein kinase II (CK II) in extracts of 3T3-L1 cells. Fractionation of a cell extract on DEAE-cellulose revealed only one peptide kinase and it eluted at the same salt concentration required to elute CK II. Consistent with the properties of CK II, the peptide kinase activity was inhibited by very low concentrations of heparin (Ki less than 6 nM) and it used GTP efficiently as a substrate. A Western blot, developed with antiserum to bovine thymus CK II, demonstrated the presence of CK II protein in 3T3-L1 extracts and that peptide kinase activity was directly related to the amount of CK II protein. The peptide was used to assay CK II activity in extracts of 3T3-L1 cells stimulated to differentiate into adipocytes. Differentiation produced a transient increase in CK II activity that reached a maximum (4-fold) on day 4. The increased activity was accounted for by increased CK II protein. Induction of CK II preceded the increase in total protein and was not the result of cell proliferation. CK II induction was coincident with induction of the insulin receptor, but, whereas insulin binding remained elevated, CK II activity declined after day 4. Agents that stimulate differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells did not cause induction of CK II in 3T3-C2 cells that do not differentiate. The transient nature of the induction of CK II suggests that the kinase may contribute to the process of differentiation rather than being a phenotypic change like that of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2073564321,"Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q-) are frequently found in hematopoietic neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukemias, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and (less frequently) myeloid leukemias. The c-myb proto-oncogene has been mapped to region 6q21-24, which suggests that it could be involved in the 6q- aberrations. By means of in situ chromosomal hybridization on cells from six hematopoietic malignancies, it was demonstrated that the c-myb locus is not deleted, but is retained on band q22, which is consistently bordered by the chromosomal breakpoints in both interstitial and terminal 6q- deletions. The deletion breakpoints were located at some distance from the myb locus since no rearrangement of c-myb sequences was found. In one case, however, amplification of the entire c-myb locus was detectable. Furthermore, in all cases tested that carry 6q- deletions, myb messenger RNA levels were significantly higher than in normal cells or in malignant cells matched for lineage and stage of differentiation but lacking the 6q- marker. These results indicate that 6q- deletions are accompanied by structural and functional alterations of the c-myb locus and that these alterations may be involved in the pathogenesis of leukemias and lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2121049876,"Phorbol ester tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) activate the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C and enhance three biological responses (prolactin release, prolactin synthesis, and cell stretching) in GH4C5 rat pituitary cells. We have examined several actions on GH4C5 cells of TPA and two other classes of protein kinase C activators, synthetic cell permeant dioleins and bryostatins isolated from the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina. Bryostatins 1 and 2 (B1 and B2, respectively) competed for [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding to the protein kinase C complex in intact cells nearly equipotently with TPA. B1 and B2, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (Di8) as well as TPA each activated partially purified protein kinase C from GH4C5 cells. B1, B2, and TPA each enhanced the acute release of prolactin from GH4C5 cells to a similar maximal extent. B1, B2, and TPA also enhanced prolactin synthesis. However, B1 and B2 were only partial agonists because they enhanced prolactin synthesis to a lesser maximal extent than did TPA and, given in combination, they reduced TPA-enhanced prolactin synthesis. OAG and Di8 stimulated prolactin release (to a lesser maximal extent than TPA) and did not stimulate prolactin synthesis. Pretreatment with OAG did not reduce TPA-stimulated prolactin release or synthesis. B2 and TPA induced cell stretching in GH4C5 cells, whereas B1, OAG, and Di8 induced little if any stretching. B1, but not B2, given in combination with TPA antagonized TPA-induced stretching but did not reduce thyrotropin-releasing hormone- or epidermal growth factor-induced stretching. We conclude that the bryostatins, phorbol esters, and dioleins bind to the same site on the protein kinase C complex to activate the enzyme, but they alter three biological responses in GH4C5 cells with selectivities and efficacies that differ. We propose that different activators of protein kinase C (such as bryostatins, dioleins, and phorbol esters) may elicit different cellular responses by altering the substrate specificity or activating multiple forms of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W160249998,"Three mutant calmodulin (CaM) genes together with the normal chicken CaM cDNA have been expressed in bacteria for the purpose of determining structure/function relationships in CaM. The mutant CaM genes were generated by in vitro recombination between a chicken CaM cDNA and a processed pseudogene that encodes a full-length CaM but with 19 amino acid substitutions as compared to authentic vertebrate CaM. The calmodulin-like (CaML) proteins derived from the pseudogene are called CaML19, CaML16, and CaML3 and contain 19, 16, and 3 amino acid substitutions, respectively. CaML3 is functionally identical to CaM by all criteria tested. The functional characteristics of CaML16 and CaML19 are also indistinguishable yet quite different from normal CaM. CaML19 and CaML16 will maximally activate myosin light chain kinase but will only half-maximally activate calcineurin and CaM-dependent multiprotein kinase. In addition, CaML16 and CaML19 do not activate phosphorylase kinase. The differential activation of these enzymes does not result from the loss of Ca2+-binding sites, since CaML16 binds four Ca2+ with affinity similar to CaM or CaM23. It is more likely that the functional characteristics of the mutant proteins result from an altered tertiary structure, since the Ca2+-dependent enhancement of tyrosine fluorescence and limited proteolysis pattern of CaML16 are different from that of CaM. The data demonstrate that the nature of the interaction of CaM with myosin light chain kinase is different from its interaction with calcineurin, CaM-dependent multiprotein kinase, and phosphorylase kinase and may involve different functional domains in CaM."
https://openalex.org/W1604566898,"Casein kinase II of yeast has been purified to near homogeneity by a procedure which includes affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose. The purified enzyme consists of four polypeptides with molecular weights of 42,000, 41,000, 35,000, and 32,000. The 42,000- and 35,000-Da polypeptides are immunologically related and exhibit cross-reactivity with the alpha subunits of calf and Drosophila casein kinase II. Amino-terminal sequencing reveals that the two subunits are distinct but homologous polypeptides and that both sequences share 40-50% homology with the Drosophila alpha subunit. These results demonstrate that yeast contains two distinct alpha subunits which must be encoded by separate genes. The 41,000- and 32,000-Da polypeptides both incorporate phosphate during autophosphorylation, a characteristic of the beta subunit in all type II casein kinases studied to date. The 41,000-Da subunit also exhibits immunological cross-reactivity with the beta subunit of Drosophila casein kinase II. These results identify the 41,000-Da polypeptide as an unusually large beta subunit. The possibility that the 32,000-Da polypeptide may be a beta' subunit is currently under investigation. The interpretation of the subunit structure of yeast casein kinase II reported here differs significantly from previous reports (Rigobello, M. P., Jori, E., Carignani, G., and Pinna, L. A. (1982) FEBS Lett. 144, 354-358; Kudlicki, W. N., Szyszka, R., and Gasior, E. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 784, 102-107)."

https://openalex.org/W1497554006,"An important property of ascorbic acid is its ability to increase the availability of storage iron to chelators. To examine the mechanism of this effect, K562 cells were incubated with ascorbate, attaining an intracellular level of 1 nmol/10(7) cells. In contrast to the reductive mobilization of iron seen with isolated ferritin, ascorbate stabilized iron preincorporated into cellular ferritin. Biosynthetic labeling with [35S]methionine demonstrated that ascorbate also retarded the degradation of the ferritin protein shell. Ferritin is normally degraded in lysosomes. The lysosomal protease inhibitors leupeptin and chloroquine produced a qualitatively similar stabilization of ferritin. Ascorbate did not act as a general inhibitor of proteolysis, however, since it did not effect hemoglobin degradation in these cells. The stabilization of cellular ferritin by ascorbate was accompanied by an expansion of the pool of chelatable iron."
https://openalex.org/W1564697032,"We have located sequences within the rat growth hormone (rGH) promoter region which are required for pituitary cell-type specific responsiveness to T3 (thyroid hormone, 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine). Transient transfections with a series of plasmids containing as few as 202 nucleotides upstream of the start site of the rat growth hormone mRNA showed specific induction by T3 in rat pituitary cell lines. Both the magnitude and the kinetics of this response were similar to those of the endogenous rGH gene, showing a strong early induction followed by a decline in T3 effect. Deletion of an additional 19 base pairs (to -183 relative to the start site) eliminated this induction. Plasmids containing sequences up to -237 or -202 showed significant promoter activity but no T3 responsiveness in transfections of mouse fibroblasts or monkey kidney cells. The presence of high affinity nuclear T3 binding proteins was demonstrated in both cell types. These results show that sequences between -183 and -202 are required for pituitary cell specific T3 regulation of the rGH promoter. The lack of T3 responsiveness in non-pituitary cells suggests that such regulation may be mediated by factors present in pituitary cells and absent in other cells."
https://openalex.org/W1493906696,"A 6-kDa alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF) was purified 100,000-fold to homogeneity from the culture fluid conditioned by normal bovine anterior pituitary-derived cells. Initial purification of the acid-soluble TGF from concentrated conditioned medium was achieved by Bio-Gel P-60 gel filtration (apparent molecular mass of 9 kDa). After the Bio-Gel step, three different steps of reverse-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography on the same Pharmacia C18 column, using linear acetonitrile gradients, gave complete purification. The ion-pairing agents used in the three consecutive steps were: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.13% heptafluorobutyric acid, and again, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a shallower gradient. Homogeneity was confirmed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, where TGF visualization was facilitated by autoradiography of 125I-TGF. The 125I-TGF bound to epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and after elution ran identically to the starting material. The molecular mass of TGF is 6 kDa by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 6.6 kDa by amino acid analysis. The amino acid composition of bovine TGF is similar to that of rat or human alpha TGF and distinct from epidermal growth factor. Colony-stimulating activity was lost after purification, but the TGF retained its ability to stimulate thymidine uptake by quiescent cells. This mitogenic activity could be blocked completely by anti-EGF-receptor monoclonal antibodies, indicating that the activity was mediated through the EGF-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1480063057,"Treatment of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), causes rapid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of pp17, a 17-20-kDa, pI 5.5 cytosolic protein, as an early event in a response sequence leading to growth arrest and terminal differentiation into monocytes (Feuerstein, N., and Cooper, H. L., (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2782-2788). In the present study, we have identified the nonphosphorylated precursor to pp17 by tryptic peptide mapping of single proteins recovered from two-dimensional gels. The pI of the precursor, p17, was 5.9, and the apparent Mr of both p17 and pp17 was 18,400 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (one dimension). p17 was shown to be a major cytosolic protein, comprising about 0.5% of steady state labeled protein in that fraction. Both p17 and pp17 were found exclusively in the cytosol (detergent-released SOL) and were not detected in membranes, cytoskeleton, or nuclei. In untreated cells, about 90% of the protein was present in the nonphosphorylated form. Upon TPA treatment, pre-existing p17 was rapidly phosphorylated to pp17. After 15 min, the two forms were nearly equal in quantity. This corresponds to phosphorylation, within that period, of about 0.2% of total cytosolic protein, represented by a single species. The maximum level of pp17 was reached within 1 h, with pp17 exceeding p17 by about 25%. Quantitatively, therefore, the phosphorylation of p17 to pp17 is one of the most prominent early biochemical responses to TPA treatment. Available data indicate that p17 predominates in rapidly proliferating cells, while phosphorylation to pp17 occurs where cell growth is modified by TPA or other agents. Thus, the p17/pp17 system is potentially a major mechanism for intracellular propagation of growth regulatory signals. We propose the name, prosolin, for this prominent cytosolic protein."
https://openalex.org/W1520122363,"The conformations of sulfur-free and sulfur-containing rhodanese were followed with and without the detergent lauryl maltoside after guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) addition to 5 M to study the apparent irreversibility of denaturation. Without lauryl maltoside, sulfur-containing rhodanese denatured in a transition giving, at approximately 2.3 M GdmCl, 50% of the total denaturation induced change observed by activity, CD, or intrinsic fluorescence. Sulfur-free rhodanese gave more complex behavior by intrinsic fluorescence and CD. CD showed loss of secondary structure in a broad, complex, and apparently biphasic transition extending from 0.5 to 3 M GdmCl. The interpretation of the transition was complicated by time-dependent aggregation due to noncovalent interactions. Results with the apolar fluorescence probe 2-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid, implicated apolar exposure in aggregation. Sulfhydryl reactivity indicated that low GdmCl concentrations induced intermediates affecting the active site conformation. Lauryl maltoside prevented aggregation with no effect on activity or any conformational parameter of native enzyme. Transitions induced by GdmCl were still observed and consistent with several phases. Even in lauryl maltoside, an increase in apolar exposure was detected by 2-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid, and by protein adsorption to octyl-Sepharose well below the major unfolding transitions. These results are interpreted with a model in which apolar interdomain interactions are disrupted, thereby increasing active site accessibility, before the intradomain interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1586162418,"We have previously shown that platelet glycoprotein Ib is expressed in a minority of cells of the human leukemic cell line HEL (Tabilio, A., Rosa, J. P., Testa, U., Kieffer, N., Nurden, A. T., Del Canizo, M. C., Breton-Gorius, J., and Vainchenker, W. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 453-459). In this report, we have selected a stable HEL subclone with increased expression of glycoprotein (GP) Ib as assessed by 6 different monoclonal antibodies in order to investigate the biochemical characteristics of this glycoprotein. A single polypeptide chain of apparent Mr = 60,000 was precipitated under reducing and nonreducing conditions by a specific polyclonal anti-platelet glycocalicin antibody and two anti-GPIb alpha monoclonal antibodies (AN51 and AP1), both from surface-labeled and metabolically labeled HEL cells. We were unable to demonstrate the presence of a polypeptide corresponding to the beta subunit of GPIb or GPIX which is closely associated with GPIb. Competitive immunoprecipitation performed in the presence of an excess amount of cold platelet glycocalicin completely displaced the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide. Synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharide chains on this Mr = 60,000 polypeptide was inhibited by the antibiotic tunicamycin, and a shift of the apparent Mr from 60,000 to 48,000 was observed. O-Linked oligosaccharide chains identical to platelet GPIb hexasaccharides were deficient or incomplete since no peanut agglutinin binding to the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide was observed after neuraminidase treatment of HEL cells. Thus, our results provide evidence that the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide expressed on the surface membrane of HEL cells is closely related to platelet GPIb and corresponds to an incompletely or abnormally O-glycosylated GPIb alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1517338327,"We previously reported that the synthesis of NeuAc(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcCer (GM3) ganglioside was preferentially enhanced during the differentiation of HL-60 cells into a monocyte/macrophage lineage induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-O-acetate (TPA). Since exogenously added GM3 ganglioside was shown to be able to induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into the monocyte/macrophage lineage in a synthetic medium, the functional role of the GM3 ganglioside increase during the differentiation of HL-60 cells has become the subject of much interest. In the present study, we investigated the activity of CMP-NeuAc:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase, which catalyzes the synthesis of GM3 ganglioside from lactosylceramide, in cells undergoing differentiation induced by two different reagents, TPA and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, which induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into the monocyte/macrophage lineage through different modes of action. We showed that the activation of CMP-NeuAc:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase and the increase in GM3 ganglioside were not related to the differentiated lineage but to the specific action of TPA, i.e. activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1634612574,"[3H]Forskolin binds to human platelet membranes in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 with a Bmax of 125 fmol/mg of protein and a Kd of 20 nM. The Bmax for [3H]forskolin binding is increased to 455 and 425 fmol/mg of protein in the presence of 100 microM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and 10 mM NaF, respectively. The increase in the Bmax for [3H]forskolin in the presence of Gpp(NH)p or NaF is not observed in the absence of MgCl2. The EC50 values for the increase in the number of binding sites for [3H]forskolin by Gpp(NH)p and NaF are 600 nM and 4 mM, respectively. The EC50 value for Gpp(NH)p to increase the number of [3H]forskolin binding sites is reduced to 35 mM and 150 nM in the presence of 50 microM PGE1 or PGD2, respectively. The increase in the number of [3H]forskolin binding sites observed in the presence of NaF is unaffected by prostaglandins. The binding of [3H]forskolin to membranes that are preincubated with Gpp(NH)p for 120 min or assayed in the presence of PGE1 reaches equilibrium within 15 min. In contrast, a slow linear increase in [3H]forskolin binding is observed over a period of 60 min when Gpp(NH)p and [3H]forskolin are added simultaneously to membranes. A slow linear increase in adenylate cyclase activity is also observed as a result of preincubating membranes with Gpp(NH)p. In human platelet membranes, agents that activate adenylate cyclase via the guanine nucleotide stimulatory protein (Ns) increase the number of binding sites for [3H]forskolin in a magnesium-dependent manner. This is consistent with the high affinity binding sites for [3H]forskolin being associated with the formation of an activated complex of the Ns protein and adenylate cyclase. This state of the adenylate cyclase may be representative of that formed by a synergistic combination of hormones and forskolin."
https://openalex.org/W1555728604,"The phosphorylation of a prominent 43-kDa phosphoprotein (pp43) in the membranes of normal murine erythroid cells was reduced markedly by exposure of the membranes to highly purified erythropoietin. A virtually identical reduction of pp43 phosphorylation was seen when erythropoietin-responsive Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cell membranes were exposed to the hormone. This effect was both time-dependent, occurring within 30 min after erythropoietin exposure, and concentration-dependent. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that pp43 is phosphorylated on serine residues. The results provide the first evidence that rapid alterations in membrane protein phosphorylation may serve as a trans-membrane signal for erythropoietin."
https://openalex.org/W1606605016,"For the first time, the enzyme rhodanese has been refolded after denaturation in guanidinium chloride (GdmHCl). Renaturation was by either (a) direct dilution into the assay, (b) intermediate dilution into buffer, or (c) dialysis followed by concentration and centrifugation. Method (c) preferentially retained active enzyme whose specific activity was 1140 IU/mg, which fell to 898 IU/mg after 6 days. The specific activity of native enzyme is 710 IU/mg. Progress curves were linear for the dialyzed enzyme, and kinetic analysis showed it had the same Km for thiosulfate as the native enzyme, but apparently displayed a higher turnover number. Progress curves for denatured enzyme directly diluted into assay mix showed as many as three phases: a lag during which no product formed; a first order reactivation; and an apparently linear steady state. An induction period was determined by extrapolating the steady-state line to the time axis. The percent reactivation fell to 7% (t1/2 = 10 min) as the time increased between GdmHCl dilution and the start of the assay, independent of the presence of thiosulfate. The induction period, which decreased to zero as the incubation time increased, was retained in the presence of thiosulfate. There were no observable differences between native and renatured protein by electrophoresis or fluorescence spectroscopy. Previous reports of some refolding of urea-denatured rhodanese (Stellwagen, E. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 135, 217-229) were confirmed, extended, and compared with results using GdmHCl. A working hypothesis is that rhodanese refolding involves intermediates that partition into active and inactive products. These intermediates may result from nucleation of the two rhodanese domains, which exposes hydrophobic surfaces that become the interdomain interface in the correctly folded protein."
https://openalex.org/W1638626468,"The effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on the utilization of extracellular amino acids by fetal lung fibroblasts was examined. PGE2 decreased the uptake of proline and aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by quiescent fibroblasts in culture. The uptake of AIB by serum-activated cultures was also dramatically decreased by PGE2. The PGE2-induced decrease in the uptake of AIB was first observed at 4 h following the addition of the effector molecule to the cultures. PGE2 did not affect the uptake of leucine. The addition of cycloheximide also resulted in a decrease in the uptake of proline, similar to that induced by PGE2 at 5 X 10(-8) M. The combination of cycloheximide and PGE2 resulted in a further decrease in proline uptake. Kinetic analysis of AIB uptake following a 24-h PGE2 treatment showed an increase in the apparent Km as compared with untreated cultures. The prostaglandin remained active for at least 72 h after the addition of the molecule. Removal of the PGE2 was followed by an influx of proline into the cells. The decrease in proline uptake was associated with a decrease in the amount of intracellular free proline and an overall decrease in the amount of cell-associated protein. While PGE2 is known to increase intracellular protein degradation, the effect of PGE2 on amino acid uptake was not the result of an increase in the intracellular concentration of amino acids (transinhibition)."

https://openalex.org/W1551162209,"During treatment of HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells in culture with polar solvents or retinoic acid at a concentration inducing terminal maturation in 90-95% of the cells, there is a rapid decline (within 2 h) in the Vmax for influx of the folate analogue, [3H]methotrexate. Following 24 h of exposure to these agents, there is no effect on growth, but influx Vmax is reduced by 70%. After 7 days of exposure, influx Vmax is reduced 90-95%. A similar time course was seen for the reduction in intracellular levels of dihydrofolate reductase, a marker of cellular proliferation. Both the extent of terminal maturation (as determined by the extent of nitro blue tetrazolium reduction) and decrease in influx showed the same dependence on the concentration of inducer. In contrast to the effect seen on influx Vmax, both influx Km and mediated efflux of [3H]methotrexate remained unchanged in HL-60 cells exposed to inducers of maturation. Finally, evidence is presented for the coupling of this alteration on [3H]methotrexate influx with commitment of HL-60 cells to terminal maturation. This evidence shows that the effect on folate analogue influx precedes commitment and documents the irreversible nature of the reduction in influx once the majority of the cells exposed to inducer were committed to the process of maturation. The possible relevance of these results to the process of neoplastic transformation is discussed."

Expression of the glycoprotein is reduced under conditions that inhibit B16 growth, such as low serum, high cell density, and addition of transforming growth factor-beta. The glycoprotein reappears during S phase, when growth-arrested cells are restimulated.

https://openalex.org/W1593670210,"When arylsulfatase C, a microsomal membrane-bound enzyme, is assayed with its natural substrates, the 3-beta-hydroxysteroid sulfates, it is also known as steroid sulfatase. Whether arylsulfatase C and steroid sulfatase are identical enzymes or not, however, has long been disputed. We now report that two electrophoretic variants of arylsulfatase C occur in normal human fibroblasts: one has a single anodic band of activity, and the other has an additional faster migrating band, f. The two types, s and + s, occur in cells from either sex. When fibroblast strains with the f + s forms of arylsulfatase C were cloned, two types of primary clones were always obtained: s and f + s. A single f band was never seen. When these primary clones were subcloned, however, the arylsulfatase C phenotype remained unchanged: primary s clones gave rise to s subclones and f + s clones to f + s subclones only. Therefore, these forms were clonal in origin and demonstrated a novel inheritance pattern in human cultured cells. The appearance of increasing amounts of the f band was correlated with up to 4-fold increase of arylsulfatase C activity, whereas the steroid sulfatase activity remained constant, thus demonstrating that arylsulfatase C was not identical with steroid sulfatase activity. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the s form immunoprecipitated activities of the s form of arylsulfatase C and steroid sulfatase but not the f form of arylsulfatase C. Therefore, we conclude that only the s form of arylsulfatase C is immunologically related to steroid sulfatase so that arylsulfatase C per se is not necessarily identical with steroid sulfatase. In addition, a novel form of genetic heterogeneity of isozymes in human fibroblasts is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1599633873,"The earliest known ionic event during Friend murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cell differentiation along the erythroid pathway is a 45% drop in intracellular sodium concentration ([Na+]i) due to a decrease in Na+ influx (Lannigan, D. A., and Knauf, P. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7322-7324). We have analyzed the mechanism of the decreased Na+ influx. The Na+ influx in uninduced cells was insensitive to dimethylamiloride, bumetanide, and diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonate. The intracellular pH (pHi) did not change up to 15 h after dimethyl sulfoxide induction, at which time Na+ influx has decreased by approximately 40%; thus, the decrease in Na+ influx is not coupled to a change in pHi. A substantial amount of the decrease in Na+ influx seems to result from a drop in amino acid-dependent Na+ transport. This reduction in amino acid-dependent Na+ influx reflects a decrease in net Na+ influx rather than solely in Na+/Na+ exchange and can account for an appreciable portion of the reduction in [Na+]i seen during differentiation. The drop in amino acid-dependent Na+ influx could not be explained by membrane depolarization but was correlated with a decrease in protein synthesis. Inhibition of protein synthesis in uninduced cells by cycloheximide also caused a decrease in Na+ influx. We conclude that during differentiation the reduction in protein synthesis decreases amino acid-dependent Na+ influx which in turn causes a drop in [Na+]i leading to a reduction in the Na+/K+ pump rate."
