https://openalex.org/W2094273627,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, which is heterogenous with respect to clinical manifestations and response to therapy. Identification of biomarkers appears desirable for an improved diagnosis of MS as well as for monitoring of disease activity and treatment response. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs, which have been shown to have the potential to serve as biomarkers for different human diseases, most notably cancer. Here, we analyzed the expression profiles of 866 human miRNAs. In detail, we investigated the miRNA expression in blood cells of 20 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 19 healthy controls using a human miRNA microarray and the Geniom Real Time Analyzer (GRTA) platform. We identified 165 miRNAs that were significantly up- or downregulated in patients with RRMS as compared to healthy controls. The best single miRNA marker, hsa-miR-145, allowed discriminating MS from controls with a specificity of 89.5%, a sensitivity of 90.0%, and an accuracy of 89.7%. A set of 48 miRNAs that was evaluated by radial basis function kernel support vector machines and 10-fold cross validation yielded a specificity of 95%, a sensitivity of 97.6%, and an accuracy of 96.3%. While 43 of the 165 miRNAs deregulated in patients with MS have previously been related to other human diseases, the remaining 122 miRNAs are so far exclusively associated with MS. The implications of our study are twofold. The miRNA expression profiles in blood cells may serve as a biomarker for MS, and deregulation of miRNA expression may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS."
https://openalex.org/W1977896329,"Proinflammatory stimuli, after amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, have been hypothesized to create a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop that increases amyloidogenic processing of the Abeta precursor protein (APP), promoting further Abeta accumulation and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, has been shown to be increased in AD patients implying a pathological interaction. To assess the effects of IL-6 on Abeta deposition and APP processing in vivo, we overexpressed murine IL-6 (mIL-6) in the brains of APP transgenic TgCRND8 and TG2576 mice. mIL-6 expression resulted in extensive gliosis and concurrently attenuated Abeta deposition in TgCRND8 mouse brains. This was accompanied by up-regulation of glial phagocytic markers in vivo and resulted in enhanced microglia-mediated phagocytosis of Abeta aggregates in vitro. Further, mIL-6-induced neuroinflammation had no effect on APP processing in TgCRND8 and had no effect on APP processing or steady-state levels of Abeta in young Tg2576 mice. These results indicate that mIL-6-mediated reactive gliosis may be beneficial early in the disease process by potentially enhancing Abeta plaque clearance rather than mediating a neurotoxic feedback loop that exacerbates amyloid pathology. This is the first study that methodically dissects the contribution of mIL-6 with regard to its potential role in modulating Abeta deposition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2043973101,"The physiopathology of sepsis continues to be poorly understood, and despite recent advances in its management, sepsis is still a life-threatening condition with a poor outcome. If new diagnostic markers related to sepsis pathogenesis will be identified, new specific therapies might be developed and mortality reduced. Small regulatory non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), were recently linked to various diseases; the aim of our prospective study was to identify miRNAs that can differentiate patients with early-stage sepsis from healthy controls and to determine if miRNA levels correlate with the severity assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.By using genome-wide miRNA profiling by microarray in peripheral blood leukocytes, we found that miR-150, miR-182, miR-342-5p, and miR-486 expression profiles differentiated sepsis patients from healthy controls. We also proved by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction that miR-150 levels were significantly reduced in plasma samples of sepsis patients and correlated with the level of disease severity measured by the SOFA score, but were independent of the white blood counts (WBC). We found that plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-10, and interleukin-18, all genes with sequence complementarity to miR-150, were negatively correlated with the plasma levels of this miRNA. Furthermore, we identified that the plasma levels ratio for miR-150/interleukin-18 can be used for assessing the severity of the sepsis.We propose that miR-150 levels in both leukocytes and plasma correlate with the aggressiveness of sepsis and can be used as a marker of early sepsis. Furthermore, we envision miR-150 restoration as a future therapeutic option in sepsis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2131134696,"Background Heterosis describes the superior phenotypes observed in hybrids relative to their inbred parents. Maize is a model system for studying heterosis due to the high levels of yield heterosis and commercial use of hybrids. Methods The inbred lines from an association mapping panel were crossed to a common inbred line, B73, to generate nearly 300 hybrid genotypes. Heterosis was evaluated for seventeen phenotypic traits in multiple environments. The majority of hybrids exhibit better-parent heterosis in most of the hybrids measured. Correlations between the levels of heterosis for different traits were generally weak, suggesting that the genetic basis of heterosis is trait-dependent. Conclusions The ability to predict heterosis levels using inbred phenotype or genetic distance between the parents varied for the different traits. For some traits it is possible to explain a significant proportion of the heterosis variation using linear modeling while other traits are more difficult to predict."
https://openalex.org/W2120617868,"The reliable estimation of animal location, and its associated error is fundamental to animal ecology. There are many existing techniques for handling location error, but these are often ad hoc or are used in isolation from each other. In this study we present a Bayesian framework for determining location that uses all the data available, is flexible to all tagging techniques, and provides location estimates with built-in measures of uncertainty. Bayesian methods allow the contributions of multiple data sources to be decomposed into manageable components. We illustrate with two examples for two different location methods: satellite tracking and light level geo-location. We show that many of the problems with uncertainty involved are reduced and quantified by our approach. This approach can use any available information, such as existing knowledge of the animal's potential range, light levels or direct location estimates, auxiliary data, and movement models. The approach provides a substantial contribution to the handling uncertainty in archival tag and satellite tracking data using readily available tools."
https://openalex.org/W2055200195,"Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is characterized by low sequence diversity making this bacterium one of the classical examples of a genetically monomorphic pathogen. Because of this limited DNA sequence variation, routine genotyping of clinical MTBC isolates for epidemiological purposes relies on highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting methods based on mobile and repetitive genetic elements. According to the standard view, isolates exhibiting the same fingerprinting pattern are considered direct progeny of the same bacterial clone, and most likely reflect ongoing transmission or disease relapse within individual patients. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we further investigated this assumption and used massively parallel whole-genome sequencing to compare one drug-susceptible (K-1) and one multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate (K-2) of a rapidly spreading M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype clone from a high incidence region (Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan). Both isolates shared the same IS6110 RFLP pattern and the same allele at 23 out of 24 MIRU-VNTR loci. We generated 23.9 million (K-1) and 33.0 million (K-2) paired 50 bp purity filtered reads corresponding to a mean coverage of 483.5 fold and 656.1 fold respectively. Compared with the laboratory strain H37Rv both Beijing isolates shared 1,209 SNPs. The two Beijing isolates differed by 130 SNPs and one large deletion. The susceptible isolate had 55 specific SNPs, while the MDR variant had 75 specific SNPs, including the five known resistance-conferring mutations. Conclusions Our results suggest that M. tuberculosis isolates exhibiting identical DNA fingerprinting patterns can harbour substantial genomic diversity. Because this heterogeneity is not captured by traditional genotyping of MTBC, some aspects of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis could be missed or misinterpreted. Furthermore, a valid differentiation between disease relapse and exogenous reinfection might be impossible using standard genotyping tools if the overall diversity of circulating clones is limited. These findings have important implications for clinical trials of new anti-tuberculosis drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2087764724,"Cancers are driven by a population of cells with the stem cell properties of self-renewal and unlimited growth. As a subpopulation within the tumor mass, these cells are believed to constitute a tumor cell reservoir. Pathways controlling the renewal of normal stem cells are deregulated in cancer. The polycomb group gene Bmi1, which is required for neural stem cell self-renewal and also controls anti-oxidant defense in neurons, is upregulated in several cancers, including medulloblastoma. We have found that Bmi1 is consistently and highly expressed in GBM. Downregulation of Bmi1 by shRNAs induced a differentiation phenotype and reduced expression of the stem cell markers Sox2 and Nestin. Interestingly, expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), which was found to be consistently expressed in primary GBM, also declined. This suggests a functional link between Bmi1 and GSK3β. Interference with GSK3β activity by siRNA, the specific inhibitor SB216763, or lithium chloride (LiCl) induced tumor cell differentiation. In addition, tumor cell apoptosis was enhanced, the formation of neurospheres was impaired, and clonogenicity reduced in a dose-dependent manner. GBM cell lines consist mainly of CD133-negative (CD133-) cells. Interestingly, ex vivo cells from primary tumor biopsies allowed the identification of a CD133- subpopulation of cells that express stem cell markers and are depleted by inactivation of GSK3β. Drugs that inhibit GSK3, including the psychiatric drug LiCl, may deplete the GBM stem cell reservoir independently of CD133 status."
https://openalex.org/W2076973534,"To construct maternal phylogeny and prehistoric dispersals of modern human being in the Indian sub continent, a diverse subset of 641 complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes belonging to macrohaplogroup M was chosen from a total collection of 2,783 control-region sequences, sampled from 26 selected tribal populations of India. On the basis of complete mtDNA sequencing, we identified 12 new haplogroups - M53 to M64; redefined/ascertained and characterized haplogroups M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M8′C′Z, M9, M10, M11, M12-G, D, M18, M30, M33, M35, M37, M38, M39, M40, M41, M43, M45 and M49, which were previously described by control and/or coding-region polymorphisms. Our results indicate that the mtDNA lineages reported in the present study (except East Asian lineages M8′C′Z, M9, M10, M11, M12-G, D ) are restricted to Indian region.The deep rooted lineages of macrohaplogroup ‘M’ suggest in-situ origin of these haplogroups in India. Most of these deep rooting lineages are represented by multiple ethnic/linguist groups of India. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) shows substantial subdivisions among the tribes of India (Fst = 0.16164). The current Indian mtDNA gene pool was shaped by the initial settlers and was galvanized by minor events of gene flow from the east and west to the restricted zones. Northeast Indian mtDNA pool harbors region specific lineages, other Indian lineages and East Asian lineages. We also suggest the establishment of an East Asian gene in North East India through admixture rather than replacement."
https://openalex.org/W2080918266,"Background The two inflammatory molecules, S100A8 and S100A9, form a heterodimer, calprotectin. Plasma calprotectin levels are elevated in various inflammatory disorders. We hypothesized that plasma calprotectin levels would be increased in subjects with low-grade systemic inflammation i.e. either obese subjects or subjects with type 2 diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings Plasma calprotectin and skeletal muscle S100A8 mRNA levels were measured in a cohort consisting of 199 subjects divided into four groups depending on presence or absence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and presence or absence of obesity. There was a significant interaction between obesity and T2D (p = 0.012). Plasma calprotectin was increased in obese relative to non-obese controls (p<0.0001), whereas it did not differ between obese and non-obese patients with T2D (p = 0.62). S100A8 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle were not influenced by obesity or T2D. Multivariate regression analysis (adjusting for age, sex, smoking and HOMA2-IR) showed plasma calprotectin to be strongly associated with BMI, even when further adjusted for fitness, CRP, TNF-α or neutrophil number. Conclusions/Significance Plasma calprotectin is a marker of obesity in individuals without type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2093775867,"Heavy metals are known to generate reactive oxygen species that lead to the oxidation and fragmentation of proteins, which become toxic when accumulated in the cell. In this study, we investigated the role of the proteasome during cadmium stress in the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Using biochemical and proteomics approaches, we present the first evidence of an active proteasome pathway in plants. We identified and characterized the peptidases acting sequentially downstream from the proteasome in animal cells as follows: tripeptidyl-peptidase II, thimet oligopeptidase, and leucine aminopeptidase. We investigated the proteasome proteolytic pathway response in the leaves of 6-week-old A. thaliana plants grown hydroponically for 24, 48, and 144 h in the presence or absence of 50 μm cadmium. The gene expression and proteolytic activity of the proteasome and the different proteases of the pathway were found to be up-regulated in response to cadmium. In an in vitro assay, oxidized bovine serum albumin and lysozyme were more readily degraded in the presence of 20 S proteasome and tripeptidyl-peptidase II than their nonoxidized form, suggesting that oxidized proteins are preferentially degraded by the Arabidopsis 20 S proteasome pathway. These results show that, in response to cadmium, the 20 S proteasome proteolytic pathway is up-regulated at both RNA and activity levels in Arabidopsis leaves and may play a role in degrading oxidized proteins generated by the stress."
https://openalex.org/W2129702134,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent cause of blindness in Western societies. Variants in the genes encoding complement factor H (CFH), complement component 3 (C3) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) have repeatedly been shown to confer significant risks for AMD; however, their role in disease progression and thus their potential relevance for interventional therapeutic approaches remains unknown.Here, we analyzed association between variants in CFH, C3 and ARMS2 and disease progression of geographic atrophy (GA) due to AMD. A quantitative phenotype of disease progression was computed based on longitudinal observations by fundus autofluorescence imaging. In a subset of 99 cases with pure bilateral GA, variants in CFH (Y402H), C3 (R102G), and ARMS2 (A69S) are associated with disease (P = 1.6x10(-9), 3.2x10(-3), and P = 2.6x10(-12), respectively) when compared to 612 unrelated healthy control individuals. In cases, median progression rate of GA over a mean follow-up period of 3.0 years was 1.61 mm(2)/year with high concordance between fellow eyes. No association between the progression rate and any of the genetic risk variants at the three loci was observed (P>0.13).This study confirms that variants at CFH, C3, and ARMS2 confer significant risks for GA due to AMD. In contrast, our data indicate no association of these variants with disease progression which may have important implications for future treatment strategies. Other, as yet unknown susceptibilities may influence disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2142335722,"Pathogens use diverse molecular machines to penetrate host cells and manipulate intracellular vesicular trafficking. Viruses employ glycoproteins, functionally and structurally similar to the SNARE proteins, to induce eukaryotic membrane fusion. Intracellular pathogens, on the other hand, need to block fusion of their infectious phagosomes with various endocytic compartments to escape from the degradative pathway. The molecular details concerning the mechanisms underlying this process are lacking. Using both an in vitro liposome fusion assay and a cellular assay, we showed that SNARE-like bacterial proteins block membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells by directly inhibiting SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. More specifically, we showed that IncA and IcmG/DotF, two SNARE-like proteins respectively expressed by Chlamydia and Legionella, inhibit the endocytic SNARE machinery. Furthermore, we identified that the SNARE-like motif present in these bacterial proteins encodes the inhibitory function. This finding suggests that SNARE-like motifs are capable of specifically manipulating membrane fusion in a wide variety of biological environments. Ultimately, this motif may have been selected during evolution because it is an efficient structural motif for modifying eukaryotic membrane fusion and thus contribute to pathogen survival."
https://openalex.org/W2042754732,"Fatty liver or steatosis is a frequent histopathological change. It is a precursor for steatohepatitis that may progress to cirrhosis and in some cases to hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study we addressed the in situ composition and distribution of biochemical compounds on tissue sections of steatotic liver using both synchrotron FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) and ToF-SIMS (time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry) microspectroscopies. FTIR is a vibrational spectroscopy that allows investigating the global biochemical composition and ToF-SIMS lead to identify molecular species in particular lipids. Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy demonstrated that bands linked to lipid contribution such as -CH3 and -CH2 as well as esters were highly intense in steatotic vesicles. Moreover, a careful analysis of the -CH2 symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching modes revealed a slight downward shift in spectra recorded inside steatotic vesicles when compared to spectra recorded outside, suggesting a different lipid environment inside the steatotic vesicles. ToF-SIMS analysis of such steatotic vesicles disclosed a selective enrichment in cholesterol as well as in diacylglycerol (DAG) species carrying long alkyl chains. Indeed, DAG C36 species were selectively localized inside the steatotic vesicles whereas DAG C30 species were detected mostly outside. Furthermore, FTIR detected a signal corresponding to olefin (C = C, 3000-3060 cm−1) and revealed a selective localization of unsaturated lipids inside the steatotic vesicles. ToF-SIMS analysis definitely demonstrated that DAG species C30, C32, C34 and C36 carrying at least one unsaturated alkyl chain were selectively concentrated into the steatotic vesicles. On the other hand, investigations performed on the non-steatotic part of the fatty livers have revealed important changes when compared to the normal liver. Although the non-steatotic regions of fatty livers exhibited normal histological aspect, IR spectra demonstrated an increase in the lipid content and ToF-SIMS detected small lipid droplets corresponding most likely to the first steps of lipid accretion."
https://openalex.org/W2035847970,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC or Sanfilippo syndrome type C (MPS IIIC, MIM #252930) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal membrane enzyme, heparan sulfate acetyl-CoA: alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT, EC 2.3.1.78), which catalyses transmembrane acetylation of the terminal glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate prior to their hydrolysis by alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Lysosomal storage of undegraded heparan sulfate in the cells of affected patients leads to neuronal death causing neurodegeneration and is accompanied by mild visceral and skeletal abnormalities, including coarse facies and joint stiffness. Surprisingly, the majority of MPS IIIC patients carrying missense mutations are as severely affected as those with splicing errors, frame shifts or nonsense mutations resulting in the complete absence of HGSNAT protein.In order to understand the effects of the missense mutations in HGSNAT on its enzymatic activity and biogenesis, we have expressed 21 mutant proteins in cultured human fibroblasts and COS-7 cells and studied their folding, targeting and activity. We found that 17 of the 21 missense mutations in HGSNAT caused misfolding of the enzyme, which is abnormally glycosylated and not targeted to the lysosome, but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The other 4 mutants represented rare polymorphisms which had no effect on the activity, processing and targeting of the enzyme. Treatment of patient cells with a competitive HGSNAT inhibitor, glucosamine, partially rescued several of the expressed mutants. Altogether our data provide an explanation for the severity of MPS IIIC and suggest that search for pharmaceutical chaperones can in the future result in therapeutic options for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2042189473,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is the most proximal component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis that regulates thyroid hormone synthesis. Since transcripts for members of this axis were detected in cultured normal human skin cells and since human hair follicles (HFs) respond to stimulation with thyrotropin, we now have studied whether human HF functions are also modulated by TRH. Here we report that the epithelium of normal human scalp HFs expresses not only TRH receptors (TRH-R) but also TRH itself at the gene and protein level. Stimulation of microdissected, organ-cultured HFs with TRH promotes hair-shaft elongation, prolongs the hair cycle growth phase (anagen), and antagonizes its termination by TGF-beta2. It also increases proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of hair matrix keratinocytes. These TRH effects may be mediated in part by reducing the ATM/Atr-dependent phosphorylation of p53. By microarray analysis, several differentially up- or down-regulated TRH-target genes were detected (e.g., selected keratins). Thus, human scalp HFs are both a source and a target of TRH, which operates as a potent hair-growth stimulator. Human HFs provide an excellent discovery tool for identifying and dissecting nonclassical functions of TRH and TRH-mediated signaling in situ, which emerge as novel players in human epithelial biology."
https://openalex.org/W2040180386,"Subretinal delivery of polyethylene glycol-substituted lysine peptide (CK30PEG)-compacted DNA nanoparticles results in efficient gene expression in retinal cells. This work evaluates the ocular safety of compacted DNA nanoparticles. CK30PEG-compacted nanoparticles containing an EGFP expression plasmid were subretinally injected in adult mice (1 µl at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 µg/µl). Retinas were examined for signs of inflammation at 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post-injection. Neither infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils or lymphocytes was detected in retinas. In addition, elevation of macrophage marker F4/80 or myeloid marker myeloperoxidase was not detected in the injected eyes. The chemokine KC mRNA increased 3–4 fold in eyes injected with either nanoparticles or saline at 1 day post-injection, but returned to control levels at 2 days post-injection. No elevation of KC protein was observed in these mice. The monocyte chemotactic protein-1, increased 3–4 fold at 1 day post-injection for both nanoparticle and saline injected eyes, but also returned to control levels at 2 days. No elevations of tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA or protein were detected. These investigations show no signs of local inflammatory responses associated with subretinal injection of compacted DNA nanoparticles, indicating that the retina may be a suitable target for clinical nanoparticle-based interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2040870739,"During breast cancer progression, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) switches from a tumor suppressor to a pro-metastatic molecule. Several recent studies suggest that this conversion in TGF-β function depends upon fundamental changes in the TGF-β signaling system. We show here that these changes in TGF-β signaling are concomitant with aberrant expression of the focal adhesion protein, p130Cas. Indeed, elevating expression of either the full-length (FL) or just the carboxyl terminus (CT) of p130Cas in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) diminished the ability of TGF-β1 to activate Smad2/3, but increased its coupling to p38 MAPK. This shift in TGF-β signaling evoked (i) resistance to TGF-β-induced growth arrest, and (ii) acinar filling upon three-dimensional organotypic cultures of p130Cas-FL or -CT expressing MECs. Furthermore, rendering metastatic MECs deficient in p130Cas enhanced TGF-β-stimulated Smad2/3 activity, which restored TGF-β-induced growth inhibition both in vitro and in mammary tumors produced in mice. Additionally, whereas elevating TβR-II expression in metastatic MECs had no affect on their phosphorylation of Smad2/3, this event markedly enhanced their activation of p38 MAPK, leading to increased MEC invasion and metastasis. Importantly, depleting p130Cas expression in TβR-II-expressing metastatic MECs significantly increased their activation of Smad2/3, which (i) reestablished the physiologic balance between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling, and (ii) reversed cellular invasion and early mammary tumor cell dissemination stimulated by TGF-β. Collectively, our findings identify p130Cas as a molecular rheostat that regulates the delicate balance between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling, a balance that is critical to maintaining the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β during breast cancer progression.

IntroductionInvasion and metastasis are the most lethal characteristics of breast cancer (1.Yoshida B.A. Sokoloff M.M. Welch D.R. Rinker-Schaeffer C.W. J. Natl.

Piek E. Böttinger E.P. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During breast cancer progression, the tumor suppressing function of TGF-β is frequently subverted, thus transforming TGF-β from a suppressor of breast cancer formation to a promoter of its growth and metastasis (2.Wakefield L.M. Piek E. Böttinger E.P. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3.Buck M.B. Knabbe C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Unfortunately, how mammary tumorigenesis overcomes the cytostatic function of TGF-β remains incompletely understood, as does the manner in which developing breast cancers ultimately sense TGF-β as a pro-metastatic factor.Transmembrane signaling by TGF-β commences upon binding to its type II receptor (TβR-II), which recruits and activates its type I receptor (TβR-I), which then phosphorylates and activates Smads 2 and 3. Following their activation, Smads 2 and 3 form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, which collectively translocate to the nucleus to regulate a multitude of transcriptional events and cellular responses (i.e. apoptosis, cytostasis, and homeostasis, (5.Chen R.H. Chang T.Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar)). In addition to stimulating Smad2/3, TGF-β also activates several noncanonical signaling systems, including members of the MAP kinase family (e.g. ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK (7.Galliher A.J. Neil J.R. Schiemann W.P. Future Oncol. 2006; 2: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, several studies suggest that genetic and epigenetic events cooperate with aberrant Smad2/3 activities and functions to facilitate the conversion of TGF-β from tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter (8.Gomis R.R. Alarcón C. Nadal C. Van Poznak C. Massagué J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9.Adorno M. Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Dupont S.

Cell. 2009; 137: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). However, these and other studies also present strong evidence implicating dysregulated activation of several noncanonical TGF-β effectors during this same switch in TGF-β function (10.Tian M. Schiemann W.P. Future Oncol. 2009; 5: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, deciphering the relative contribution of signaling imbalances that arise between Smad2/3-dependent and -independent TGF-β signaling systems is essential to enhancing our understanding of how TGF-β ultimately promotes the development and progression of mammary tumorigenesis.Recently, we identified a critical αvβ3 integrin:pY284-TβR-II:Grb2 signaling axis that mediates TGF-β stimulation of MAP kinases in normal and malignant MECs, leading to their acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasive, and metastatic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12.Galliher A.J. Schiemann W.P.

Moreover, activation of this oncogenic signaling axis by TGF-β requires β3 integrin to form complexes with TβR-II (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12.Galliher A.J. Schiemann W.P.

Unfortunately, it remains uncertain as to whether this interaction is direct or facilitated through another scaffolding protein. As such, we sought to identify members of focal adhesion complexes as potential integrin effectors capable of contributing to altered TGF-β signaling.p130Cas (Crk-associated substrate) functions as a molecular scaffold within focal adhesion complexes, and is readily phosphorylated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src (14.Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Additionally, p130Cas binds stably to a variety of signaling molecules, including the (i) protein-tyrosine kinases FAK, PYK2, Src, Fyn, and Abl; (ii) adaptor molecules Crk, CrkL, Trip6, and AJUBA; (iii) guanine nucleotide exchange factors AND34 and CG3; and (iv) the MAPK family member, JNK (15.Brábek J.

Cell. 2006; 127: 879-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The extensive interactome of p130Cas ideally positions and enables this molecule to interpret and integrate a variety of signaling inputs arising from numerous receptor systems. Indeed, the biological importance of p130Cas is emphasized by studies showing that its genetic ablation in mice elicits embryonic lethality, whereas fibroblasts derived from p130Cas-deficient embryos exhibit drastically altered cytoskeletal architectures (17.Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, fibroblasts transformed by Src become significantly more invasive when engineered to simultaneously overexpress p130Cas (15.Brábek J. Constancio S.S. Shin N.Y. Pozzi A. Weaver A.M. Hanks S.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7406-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Patients with primary breast tumors expressing high levels of p130Cas (also known as breast cancer resistance-1) experience a more rapid disease recurrence and have a greater risk of resistance to tamoxifen therapy (18.van der Flier S. Chan C.M. Brinkman A. Smid M. Johnston S.R. Dorssers L.C. Dowsett M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that specific overexpression of p130Cas/breast cancer resistance-1 expression can confer breast cancer resistance to adriamycin (19.Ta H.Q. Thomas K.S. Schrecengost R.S. Bouton A.H. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8796-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, directed overexpression of p130Case in murine MECs significantly increased their proliferative and survival indices in vivo, as well as greatly reduced the latency of mammary tumors arising from murine mammary tumor virus-driven Her2/Neu expression in mice (20.Cabodi S. Tinnirello A. Di Stefano P. Bisarò B. Ambrosino E. Castellano I. Sapino A. Arisio R. Cavallo F. Forni G. Glukhova M. Silengo L. Altruda F. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4672-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This study also observed the expression of p130Cas to be up-regulated significantly in a subset of human breast cancer samples (20.Cabodi S. Tinnirello A. Di Stefano P. Bisarò B. Ambrosino E. Castellano I. Sapino A. Arisio R. Cavallo F. Forni G. Glukhova M. Silengo L. Altruda F. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4672-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings highlight the critical roles played by p130Cas in regulating normal tissue morphogenesis, and in promoting breast cancer progression. With respect to TGF-β, a recent study identified p130Cas as a potential inhibitor of Smad3 function (21.Kim W. Seok Kang Y. Soo Kim J. Shin N.Y. Hanks S.K. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the pathophysiological importance of this event, if any, in mediating the oncogenic activities of TGF-β and/or p130Cas during breast cancer progression remains to be established.The objective of the present study was to determine the role of p130Cas in facilitating the acquisition of oncogenic signaling by TGF-β during breast progression. We show here that p130Cas expression is up-regulated significantly in metastatic breast cancer cells (murine 4T1/human MCF10A-Ca1a) as compared with their nonmetastatic counterparts (murine 67NR/human MCF10A). Moreover, increased p130Cas expression was consistent with a decrease in TGF-β1-induced Smad2/3 signaling. Indeed, overexpression of p130Cas in nonmetastatic MECs led to a decrease in Smad2/3 activity, whereas depletion of p130Cas in metastatic MECs increased Smad2/3 activity. Most importantly, we show for the first time that p130Cas is essential for TGF-β stimulation of breast cancer growth, invasion, and pulmonary dissemination in mice. Taken together, our findings establish p130Cas as a novel molecular rheostat that regulates the balance between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling in developing mammary tumors, whose acquisition of metastatic phenotypes is potentiated by elevated p130Cas expression and its consequential disruption of homeostatic TGF-β signaling.DISCUSSIONTGF-β is a principal player involved in suppressing mammary tumorigenesis, doing so through its ability to maintain the composition of normal MEC microenvironments, and by inhibiting the aberrant proliferation of normal MECs (6.Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar, 38.Siegel P.M. Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Mammary tumorigenesis has evolved a variety of mechanisms that subvert the tumor suppressing functions of TGF-β, and in doing so, confer oncogenic and metastatic activities upon this multifunctional cytokine (34.Tang B. Vu M. Booker T. Santner S.J. Miller F.R. Anver M.R. Wakefield L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Indeed, how TGF-β both suppresses and promotes mammary tumorigenesis remains a fundamental question that directly impacts the ability of science and medicine to effectively target the TGF-β signaling system during the treatment of breast cancer patients. Deciphering this paradox remains the most important question concerning the biological and pathological actions of this multifunctional cytokine (39.Schiemann W.P. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2007; 7: 609-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).We previously established the importance of aberrant interactions between β3 integrin and TβR-II to promote Src-mediated phosphorylation of TβR-II, which then recruits and binds Grb2. Once bound to phospho-Tyr-284 in TβR-II, Grb2 facilitates TGF-β-mediated activation of noncanonical MAP kinase signaling without affecting the coupling of TGF-β to Smad2/3 (12.Galliher A.J. Schiemann W.P. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3752-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 13.Galliher A.J. Schiemann W.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2006; 8: R42Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Importantly, measures capable of disrupting this signaling axis readily prevent TGF-β from driving breast cancer invasion and metastasis (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40.Wendt M.K. Schiemann W.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2009; 11: R68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to establishing the critical importance of p38 MAPK activation in mediating breast cancer metastasis stimulated by TGF-β, these studies also suggested that inappropriate imbalances between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling systems may in fact underlie its prometastatic activities in breast cancer cells. Our findings herein provide the first definitive evidence that (i) canonical and noncanonical signaling imbalances do indeed dictate MEC response to TGF-β, and (ii) p130Cas functions as a novel molecular rheostat that governs the delicate balance between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β effectors. Indeed, overexpression of either full-length or the carboxyl terminus of p130Cas was sufficient to decrease TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation while simultaneously increasing that of p38 MAPK. Moreover, depleting p130Cas significantly increased the activity of Smad2/3 and concomitantly decreased that of p38 MAPK induced by TGF-β, and finally, elevating TβR-II expression amplified the activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-β, which significantly enhanced early metastatic progression of mammary tumors in mice (Fig. 7) (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In “hypermetastatic” TβR-II-expressing cells, p130Cas deficiency similarly increased the coupling of TGF-β to Smad2/3, an event that negated the proinvasive and prometastatic activities of p38 MAPK in developing 4T1 tumors. Thus, p130Cas functions in balancing the activation status of canonical and noncanonical effectors targeted by TGF-β, findings that are clinically and medically relevant to the development and progression of mammary tumors regulated by TGF-β.A schematic depicting the function of p130Cas in TGF-β signaling is presented in Fig. 8. Indeed, in normal MECs, TGF-β receptors fail to interact significantly with integrins, which limits TGF-β stimulation of p38 MAPK and the initiation of oncogenic signaling by TGF-β (13.Galliher A.J. Schiemann W.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2006; 8: R42Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 40.Wendt M.K. Schiemann W.P.

Landström M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The net effect of these signaling events results in tumor suppression by TGF-β. However, during mammary tumorigenesis, p130Cas expression is up-regulated dramatically, as is the aberrant formation of integrin and TGF-β receptor complexes (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12.Galliher A.J. Schiemann W.P.

Schiemann W.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2009; 11: R68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which collectively decrease the activity of Smad2/3 and increase that of p38 MAPK and other noncanonical effectors that promote breast cancer metastasis stimulated by TGF-β (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40.Wendt M.K. Schiemann W.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2009; 11: R68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This signaling imbalance can be potentiated by elevated TβR-II expression and its consequential enhancement of p38 MAPK activation and metastasis (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34.Tang B. Vu M. Booker T. Santner S.J. Miller F.R. Anver M.R. Wakefield L.M. J. Clin.

Invest. 2002; 109: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In all cases, these various signaling inputs are critically balanced and influenced by the level of p130Cas expression. Indeed, we (see Fig. 1) and others (20.Cabodi S. Tinnirello A. Di Stefano P. Bisarò B. Ambrosino E. Castellano I. Sapino A. Arisio R. Cavallo F. Forni G. Glukhova M. Silengo L. Altruda F. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4672-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) find mammary tumorigenesis to dramatically increase the expression of p130Cas. Based on our findings presented herein, we suggest that this event limits TGF-β stimulation of Smad2/3, which (i) diminishes MEC responsiveness to the cytostatic activities of TGF-β (44.Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); and (ii) promotes amplified coupling of TGF-β to its noncanonical effectors, leading to breast cancer invasion and metastasis. In fact, our findings strongly support the progressive hypothesis that inappropriate imbalances between canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling systems underlies the acquisition of metastatic phenotypes in mammary carcinomas, as well as facilitates the oncogenic switch of TGF-β from a tumor suppressor to a prometastatic molecule.Along these lines, a recent report suggests that murine mammary tumor virus-driven p130Cas expression in mice is sufficient to induce mammary gland hyperplasia (20.Cabodi S. Tinnirello A. Di Stefano P. Bisarò B. Ambrosino E. Castellano I. Sapino A. Arisio R. Cavallo F. Forni G. Glukhova M. Silengo L. Altruda F. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4672-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, it was necessary to combine transgenic p130Cas expression with that of HER2 to enhance formation of mammary tumors (20.Cabodi S. Tinnirello A. Di Stefano P. Bisarò B. Ambrosino E. Castellano I. Sapino A. Arisio R. Cavallo F. Forni G. Glukhova M. Silengo L. Altruda F. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4672-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although specific effects on TGF-β activity and signaling were not examined in this mouse model, these findings do suggest that the tumor promoting properties of p130Cas only manifest in the face of additional oncogenic signaling inputs (i.e. elevated HER2 expression), which mirrors our own results showing that heightened TGF-β signaling (TβR-II expression) requires p130Cas to induce pulmonary dissemination. Moreover, we show that transgenic TβR-II expression led to increased basal and TGF-β-induced production of the prometastatic protein, PAI1, without impacting the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. These findings suggest that (i) p130Cas specifically regulates the activity of Smad2/3 as opposed to that of the TGF-β receptors, and (ii) Smad2/3 expression levels, not those of TGF-β receptors, are rate-limiting during the activation of canonical TGF-β signaling. Thus, p130Cas acts as a molecular rheostat of canonical Smad2/3 and noncanonical p38 MAPK signaling stimulated by TGF-β, and disruption of the balance between these two pathways has dramatic affects on breast cancer growth and progression.In summary, we demonstrated that p130Cas functions to regulate the balance between TGF-β-mediated activation of Smad2/3 and p38 MAPK in normal and metastatic MECs. Moreover, we provide compelling evidence that p130Cas is both necessary and sufficient to drive the oncogenic activities of TGF-β, including its regulation of mammary tumor growth and the initiation of early steps in the metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells. Collectively, our findings establish p130Cas as an essential mediator that underlies the oncogenic conversion of TGF-β function, thereby enhancing its ability to promote the progression of mammary carcinomas. IntroductionInvasion and metastasis are the most lethal characteristics of breast cancer (1.Yoshida B.A. Sokoloff M.M. Welch D.R. Rinker-Schaeffer C.W. J. Natl.

Piek E. Böttinger E.P. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During breast cancer progression, the tumor suppressing function of TGF-β is frequently subverted, thus transforming TGF-β from a suppressor of breast cancer formation to a promoter of its growth and metastasis (2.Wakefield L.M. Piek E. Böttinger E.P. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3.Buck M.B. Knabbe C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Unfortunately, how mammary tumorigenesis overcomes the cytostatic function of TGF-β remains incompletely understood, as does the manner in which developing breast cancers ultimately sense TGF-β as a pro-metastatic factor.Transmembrane signaling by TGF-β commences upon binding to its type II receptor (TβR-II), which recruits and activates its type I receptor (TβR-I), which then phosphorylates and activates Smads 2 and 3. Following their activation, Smads 2 and 3 form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, which collectively translocate to the nucleus to regulate a multitude of transcriptional events and cellular responses (i.e. apoptosis, cytostasis, and homeostasis, (5.Chen R.H. Chang T.Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar)). In addition to stimulating Smad2/3, TGF-β also activates several noncanonical signaling systems, including members of the MAP kinase family (e.g. ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK (7.Galliher A.J. Neil J.R. Schiemann W.P. Future Oncol. 2006; 2: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, several studies suggest that genetic and epigenetic events cooperate with aberrant Smad2/3 activities and functions to facilitate the conversion of TGF-β from tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter (8.Gomis R.R. Alarcón C. Nadal C. Van Poznak C. Massagué J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9.Adorno M. Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Dupont S.

Cell. 2009; 137: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). However, these and other studies also present strong evidence implicating dysregulated activation of several noncanonical TGF-β effectors during this same switch in TGF-β function (10.Tian M. Schiemann W.P. Future Oncol. 2009; 5: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, deciphering the relative contribution of signaling imbalances that arise between Smad2/3-dependent and -independent TGF-β signaling systems is essential to enhancing our understanding of how TGF-β ultimately promotes the development and progression of mammary tumorigenesis.Recently, we identified a critical αvβ3 integrin:pY284-TβR-II:Grb2 signaling axis that mediates TGF-β stimulation of MAP kinases in normal and malignant MECs, leading to their acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasive, and metastatic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J.

Moreover, activation of this oncogenic signaling axis by TGF-β requires β3 integrin to form complexes with TβR-II (11.Galliher-Beckley A.J. Schiemann W.P.

https://openalex.org/W2141556225,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of three (PPARalpha, -beta/delta, and -gamma) nuclear receptors. In particular, PPARalpha is involved in regulation of fatty acid metabolism, cell growth and inflammation. PPARalpha mediates the cardiac fasting response, increasing fatty acid metabolism, decreasing glucose utilisation, and is the target for the fibrate lipid-lowering class of drugs. However, little is known regarding the endogenous generation of PPAR ligands. CYP2J2 is a lipid metabolising cytochrome P450, which produces anti-inflammatory mediators, and is considered the major epoxygenase in the human heart.Expression of CYP2J2 in vitro results in an activation of PPAR responses with a particular preference for PPARalpha. The CYP2J2 products 8,9- and 11-12-EET also activate PPARalpha. In vitro, PPARalpha activation by its selective ligand induces the PPARalpha target gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 in cardiac tissue. In vivo, in cardiac-specific CYP2J2 transgenic mice, fasting selectively augments the expression of PDK4.Our results establish that CYP2J2 produces PPARalpha ligands in vitro and in vivo, and suggests that lipid metabolising CYPs are prime candidates for the integration of global lipid changes to transcriptional signalling events."
https://openalex.org/W1987301893,"It is widely believed that human malaria parasites infect only man as a natural host. However, earlier morphological observations suggest that great apes are likely to be natural reservoirs as well. To identify malaria parasites in great apes, we screened 60 chimpanzees imported into Japan. Using the sequences of small subunit rRNA and the mitochondrial genome, we identified infection of Plasmodium malariae, a human malaria parasite, in two chimpanzees that were imported about thirty years ago. The chimpanzees have been asymptomatic to the present. In Japan, indigenous malaria disappeared more than fifty years ago; and thus, it is most likely inferred that the chimpanzees were infected in Africa, and P. malariae isolates were brought into Japan from Africa with their hosts, suggesting persistence of parasites at low level for thirty years. Such a long term latent infection is a unique feature of P. malariae infection in humans. To our knowledge, this is the first to report P. malariae infection in chimpanzees and a human malaria parasite from nonhuman primates imported to a nonendemic country."
https://openalex.org/W2050915090,"The cell surface low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, LRP1, plays a major role in lipid metabolism. The question that remains open concerns the function of LRP1 in adipogenesis. Here, we show that LRP1 is highly expressed in murine preadipocytes as well as in primary culture of human adipocytes. Moreover, LRP1 remains abundantly synthesised during mouse and human adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that LRP1 silencing in 3T3F442A murine preadipocytes significantly inhibits the expression of PPARγ, HSL and aP2 adipocyte differentiation markers after adipogenesis induction, and leads to lipid-depleted cells. We further show that the absence of lipids in LRP1-silenced preadipocytes is not caused by lipolysis induction. In addition, we provide the first evidences that LRP1 is significantly up-regulated in obese C57BI6/J mouse adipocytes and obese human adipose tissues. Interestingly, silencing of LRP1 in fully-differentiated adipocytes also reduces cellular lipid level and is associated with an increase of basal lipolysis. However, the ability of mature adipocytes to induce lipolysis is independent of LRP1 expression. Altogether, our findings highlight the dual role of LRP1 in the control of adipogenesis and lipid homeostasis, and suggest that LRP1 may be an important therapeutic target in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2045582146,"Fibrosis, the excessive deposition of scar tissue by fibroblasts, is one of the largest groups of diseases for which there is no therapy. Fibroblasts from lesional areas of scleroderma patients possess elevated abilities to contract matrix and produce alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), type I collagen and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF). The basis for this phenomenon is poorly understood, and is a necessary prerequisite for developing novel, rational anti-fibrotic strategies.Compared to healthy skin fibroblasts, dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesional areas of scleroderma (SSc) patients possess elevated Rac activity. NSC23766, a Rac inhibitor, suppressed the persistent fibrotic phenotype of lesional SSc fibroblasts. NSC23766 caused a decrease in migration on and contraction of matrix, and alpha-SMA, type I collagen and CCN2 mRNA and protein expression. SSc fibroblasts possessed elevated Akt phosphorylation, which was also blocked by NSC23766. Overexpression of rac1 in normal fibroblasts induced matrix contraction and alpha-SMA, type I collagen and CCN2 mRNA and protein expression. Rac1 activity was blocked by PI3kinase/Akt inhibition. Basal fibroblast activity was not affected by NSC23766.Rac inhibition may be considered as a novel treatment for the fibrosis observed in SSc."
https://openalex.org/W2110467030,"To elucidate novel cell biological functions of specific protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes, we identified and biochemically characterized a complex between the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) and a PP2A holoenzyme comprising PR130/B″α1 as a regulatory subunit (PP2AT130)in several mammalian cell lines. PR130/B″α1 and SHIP2 partially colocalize in untreated HeLa cells, and both translocate to the cell membrane on epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Concomitantly, a transient EGF-dependent interaction of PR130/B″α1 with the EGF receptor (EGFR) was observed, whereas the SHIP2-PR130 interaction remained constitutive. As previously reported for SHIP2, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of PR130 in COS-7 cells resulted in increased EGF-induced proteasome-dependent EGFR degradation, and an increased interaction of EGFR with the E3 ligase c-Cbl. In concordance with faster EGFR clearance or desensitization, intrinsic EGFR kinase activity (phospho-Tyr-1068) and downstream protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways were more rapidly inactivated in PR130-knockdown cells. Notably, these effects could be rescued by reintroduction of RNA interference-resistant Myc-PR130, excluding any off-target effect. These data highlight a novel biological role of the PP2AT130 holoenzyme in EGF signaling through interaction with EGFR and the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase SHIP2. This interaction may be of clinical relevance as dysfunction of EGF-mediated signaling has been linked to various human cancers.—Zwaenepoel, K., Goris, J., Erneux, C., Parker, P.J., Janssens, V.

https://openalex.org/W1983329975,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major factor which contributes to the failure of cancer chemotherapy, and numerous efforts have been attempted to overcome MDR. To date, none of these attempts have yielded a tolerable and effective therapy to reverse MDR; thus, identification of new agents would be useful both clinically and scientifically.To identify small molecule compounds that can reverse chemoresistance, we developed a 96-well plate high-throughput cell-based screening assay in a paclitaxel resistant ovarian cancer cell line. Coincubating cells with a sublethal concentration of paclitaxel in combination with each of 2,000 small molecule compounds from the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set Library, we identified a previously uncharacterized molecule, NSC23925, that inhibits Pgp1 and reverses MDR1 (Pgp1) but does not inhibit MRP or BCRP-mediated MDR. The cytotoxic activity of NSC23925 was further evaluated using a panel of cancer cell lines expressing Pgp1, MRP, and BCRP. We found that at a concentration of >10 microM NSC23925 moderately inhibits the proliferation of both sensitive and resistant cell lines with almost equal activity, but its inhibitory effect was not altered by co-incubation with the Pgp1 inhibitor, verapamil, suggesting that NSC23925 itself is not a substrate of Pgp1. Additionally, NSC23925 increases the intracellular accumulation of Pgp1 substrates: calcein AM, Rhodamine-123, paclitaxel, mitoxantrone, and doxorubicin. Interestingly, we further observed that, although NSC23925 directly inhibits the function of Pgp1 in a dose-dependent manner without altering the total expression level of Pgp1, NSC23925 actually stimulates ATPase activity of Pgp, a phenomenon seen in other Pgp inhibitors.The ability of NSC23925 to restore sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy or to prevent resistance could significantly benefit cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1976366902,"The early diagnosis of melanoma is critical to achieving reduced mortality and increased survival. Although clinical examination is currently the method of choice for melanocytic lesion assessment, there is a growing interest among clinicians regarding the potential diagnostic utility of computerised image analysis. Recognising that there exist significant shortcomings in currently available algorithms, we are motivated to investigate the utility of lacunarity, a simple statistical measure previously used in geology and other fields for the analysis of fractal and multi-scaled images, in the automated assessment of melanocytic naevi and melanoma. Digitised dermoscopic images of 111 benign melanocytic naevi, 99 dysplastic naevi and 102 melanomas were obtained over the period 2003 to 2008, and subject to lacunarity analysis. We found the lacunarity algorithm could accurately distinguish melanoma from benign melanocytic naevi or non-melanoma without introducing many of the limitations associated with other previously reported diagnostic algorithms. Lacunarity analysis suggests an ordering of irregularity in melanocytic lesions, and we suggest the clinical application of this ordering may have utility in the naked-eye dermoscopic diagnosis of early melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2115014638,"Despite a clear association between left ventricular (LV) mechanical dysfunction in end-stage heart failure and the incidence of arrhythmias, the majority of sudden cardiac deaths occur at earlier stages of disease development. The mechanisms by which structural, mechanical, and molecular alterations predispose to arrhythmias at the tissue level before the onset of LV dysfunction remain unclear. In a rat model of pressure overload hypertrophy (PoH) produced by ascending aortic banding, we correlated mechanical and structural changes measured in vivo with key electrophysiological changes measured ex vivo in the same animals. We found that action potential prolongation, a hallmark of electrical remodeling at the tissue level, is highly correlated with changes in LV wall thickness but not mechanical function. In contrast, conduction delays are not predicted by either mechanical or structural changes during disease development. Moreover, disrupted Cx43 phosphorylation at intermediate (increased) and late (decreased) stages of PoH are associated with moderate and severe conduction delays, respectively. Interest-ingly, the level of interaction between Cx43 and the cytoskeletal protein ZO-1 is exclusively decreased at the late stage of PoH. Closely coupled action potentials consistent with afterdepolarization-mediated triggered beats were readily observed in 6 of 15 PoH hearts but never in controls. Similarly, PoH (8/15) but not control hearts exhibited sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia after rapid stimulation. The initiation and early maintenance of arrhythmias in PoH were formed by rapid and highly uniform activation wavefronts emanating from sites distal to the former site of stimulation. In conclusion, repolarization but not conduction delays are predicted by structural remodeling in PoH. Cx43 phosphorylation is disrupted at intermediate (increased) and late (decreased) stages, which are associated with conduction delays. Dephosphorylation of Cx43 is associated with loss of interaction with ZO-1 and severe conduction delays. Remodeling at all stages of PoH predisposes to triggers and focal arrhythmias.—Jin, H., Chemaly, E. R., Lee, A., Kho, C., Hadri, L., Hajjar, R. J., Akar, F. G.

https://openalex.org/W2022961519,"Background Substantial amount of time is lost before initiation of treatment in Schizophrenia. The delay in treatment is labelled as Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP). Most of these estimates come from western countries, where health systems are relatively better developed. There is dearth of information on pathway to care from developing countries. Methods and Results Patients with ICD-10 based diagnosis of Schizophrenia were enrolled by convenient method of sampling. The pathway to care was explored through a semi-structured questionnaire. Onset, course and symptoms of psychosis were assessed using Interview for the Retrospective Assessment of the Onset of Schizophrenia (IRAOS). Ethical approval of the project was taken from The Aga Khan University, Ethics Review Committee. Of the enrolled 93 subjects, 55 (59%) were males and 38 (41%) were females. In our sample, 1.56 mean (median, 2) attempts were made prior to successful help seeking. The duration of untreated psychosis was 14.8 months (St. Deviation; 29.4). DUP was 16.8 months (St. Deviation; 34.9) for males and 11.8 months (St. Deviation; 18.9) for females. In the pathway to care, psychiatrists featured prominently as initial care providers. In the first attempt at help-seeking, 43% patients were initially taken to psychiatrists. After the initial consultation, 45% were prescribed psychotropic medication while 7% were hospitalized. Only 9% subjects were given the diagnosis of schizophrenia initially. When participants were inquired about the reasons for delay, 29% reported financial difficulties as the barrier to care. Positive symptoms of psychosis were present in 57% subjects while negative symptoms were present in 30% subjects. There was a statistically significant difference (Chi-square; 7.928, df: 1, Sig 0.005) between DUP and the positive and negative symptoms category. Conclusion In the absence of well developed primary care health system in Pakistan, majority of patients present to psychiatrists as a first contact. DUP, as a measurement of help seeking behaviour, tends to be shorter with positive symptoms of Schizophrenia. Substantial amount of time is lost due to non recognition of disease and subsequently, inadequate treatment. Secondary prevention strategies should focus on families, which play an important role in the treatment-seeking process of psychotic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2009240605,"Memory consolidation, which converts acquired information into long-term storage, is new protein synthesis-dependent. As protein synthesis is a dynamic process that is under the control of multiple translational mechanisms, however, it is still elusive how these mechanisms are recruited in response to learning for memory consolidation. Here we found that eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) was dramatically dephosphorylated within 0.5-2 hr in the hippocampus and amygdala of mice following training in a fear-conditioning test, whereas genome-wide microarrays did not reveal any significant change in the expression level of the mRNAs for translational machineries or their related molecules. Moreover, blockade of NMDA receptors with MK-801 immediately following the training significantly impeded both the post-training eEF-2 dephosphorylation and memory retention. Notably, with an elegant sophisticated transgenic strategy, we demonstrated that hippocampus-specific overexpression of eEF-2 kinase, a kinase that specifically phosphorylates and hence inactivates eEF-2, significantly inhibited protein synthesis in the hippocampus, and this effects was more robust during an ""ongoing"" protein synthesis process. As a result, late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampus and long-term hippocampus-dependent memory in the mice were significantly impaired, whereas short-term memory and long-term hippocampus-independent memory remained intact. These results reveal a novel translational underpinning for protein synthesis pertinent to memory consolidation in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2032587649,"Cholelithiasis is a multifactorial process and several mechanisms of gallstone formation have been postulated. As one of these mechanisms, a decreased expression of the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter gene SLC10A2 in gallstone carriers was described previously. In this study the SLC10A2 gene was investigated to identify novel genetic variants and their association with gallstone formation.Study subjects were selected with the presence or absence of gallstones confirmed by ultrasound and medical history. Genomic DNA was obtained from blood leukocytes. Sequence analysis was performed of all six exonic and flanking regions as well as of 2,400 base pairs of the SLC10A2 promoter in a cohort of gallstone carriers and control subjects from Stuttgart, Germany. Genotype frequencies of newly identified genetic variants (n = 6) and known single nucleotide polymorphisms (n = 24) were established using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Six new genetic variants were found within the SLC10A2 gene. Although none of the variants was linked to gallstone disease in the Stuttgart cohort overall, the minor allele of SNP rs9514089 was more prevalent in male non-obese gallstone carriers (p = 0.06680, OR = 11.00). In a separate population from Aachen, Germany, the occurrence of rs9514089 was two-fold higher in gallstone patients (22%) than in corresponding controls (11%) (p = 0.00995, OR = 2.19). In the pooled Aachen/Stuttgart cohort rs9514089 was highly significantly linked to cholelithiasis (p = 0.00767, OR = 2.04). A more frequent occurrence was observed for male gallstone carriers (22%) compared to controls (9%) (p = 0.01017, OR = 2.99), for the total normal weight group (p = 0.00754, OR = 2.90), and for male non-obese gallstone patients (p = 0.01410, OR = 6.85). Moreover, for the minor allele of rs9514089 an association with low plasma cholesterol levels was found especially in gallstone carriers (p = 0.05).We have identified SLC10A2 as a novel susceptibility gene for cholelithiasis in humans. Comprehensive statistical analysis provides strong evidence that rs9514089 is a genetic determinant especially in male non-obese gallstone carriers. The minor allele of rs9514089 is related to differences in plasma cholesterol levels among the subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2084937218,"The co-packaged RNA genomes of human immunodeficiency virus-1 recombine at a high rate. Recombination can mix mutations to generate viruses that escape immune response. A cell-culture-based system was designed previously to map recombination events in a 459-bp region spanning the primer binding site through a portion of the gag protein coding region. Strikingly, a strong preferential site for recombination in vivo was identified within a 112-nucleotide-long region near the beginning of gag. Strand transfer assays in vitro revealed that three pause bands in the gag hot spot each corresponded to a run of guanosine (G) residues. Pausing of reverse transcriptase is known to promote recombination by strand transfer both in vivo and in vitro. To assess the significance of the G runs, we altered them by base substitutions. Disruption of the G runs eliminated both the associated pausing and strand transfer. Some G-rich sequences can develop G-quartet structures, which were first proposed to form in telomeric DNA. G-quartet structure formation is highly dependent on the presence of specific cations. Incubation in cations discouraging G-quartets altered gel mobility of the gag template consistent with breakdown of G-quartet structure. The same cations faded G-run pauses but did not affect pauses caused by hairpins, indicating that quartet structure causes pausing.

Virus Res. 2008; 134: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in accumulating mutations during the reverse transcription. Additionally, recombination is also a medically important source of diversity in HIV-1. Like other retroviruses, HIV-1 packages two copies of single stranded RNA genomes within its virion (6.Duesberg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1968; 60: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). RT is able to switch templates during reverse transcription (7.Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). When the two co-packaged RNA templates are non-identical, template switching results in genetic recombination. In HIV-1, the rates of recombination vary from 3 to 30 times per viral replication, depending on the host cell type (8.Chen J. Rhodes T.D. Hu W.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9337-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9.Jetzt A.E. Yu H. Klarmann G.J. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J.

Virus Res. 2008; 134: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our group previously proposed that stalling of RT at pause sites would induce RT RNase H activity to make a series of adjacent cuts in the first RNA template (donor). The degradation of the donor RNA was proposed to create an invasion site for the second RNA template (acceptor) to interact with the newly synthesized DNA, which initiates the strand transfer process (13.DeStefano J.J.

Virol. 2006; 80: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There was a direct correlation between pausing in vitro and increased rate of recombination in vivo, supporting the idea that template secondary structure promotes recombination. In addition, our group indicated in vitro, using RNA templates containing the HIV-1 dimerization initiation sequence (DIS), that factors increasing proximity between the donor and acceptor templates also promoted recombination (19.Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, the viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein, an RNA chaperone that coats the viral genome, enhances strand transfer through the rearrangement of RNA secondary structure as well as the annealing of complementary strands during reverse transcription (20.Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Other factors, such as low dNTPs (21.Operario D.J. Balakrishnan M. Bambara R.A. Kim B. J. Biol.

To understand how recombination contributes to HIV-1 evolution, it is important to learn whether recombination occurs randomly throughout the genome or whether there are preferred sites. Recently, a putative hot spot for recombination within the C2 portion of the gp120 env gene was identified in vivo (23.Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Véron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol.

Upon the destabilization of this hairpin, the rate of recombination decreased to the background level (23.Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Véron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24.Galetto R. Giacomoni V. Véron M. Negroni M. J. Biol.

Moreover, HIV-1 repeated sequence R was also reported as a preferred site for recombination in vitro (25.Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The two R regions, located at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the HIV-1 genome, are the donor and acceptor sites for minus strand transfer (26.Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Frequent crossovers have also been observed within R (25.Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M.

RNA. 2001; 7: 1097-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We previously reported a recombination hot spot in vivo within a 112-nt-long region encompassing the gag AUG codon (28.Dykes C. Balakrishnan M. Planelles V. Zhu Y. Bambara R.A. Demeter L.M. Virology. 2004; 326: 262-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two HIV-1 strains, NL4-3 and JRCSF, which differed by approximately every 25 bases from DIS to vpr, were used to locate recombination events by a cell culture-based system. A 459-bp region from DIS to gag was sequenced. About 64% of the recombination events were found around the beginning of gag, a region representing only 20% that of the sequenced length. The recombination hot spot starts 30 bases upstream of the gag AUG and continues 82 bases into the sequence that encodes the matrix (MA) domain of the HIV-1 Gag protein. The HIV-1 Gag protein is initially synthesized as a polyprotein precursor and then cleaved by a virus-encoded protease into the mature Gag proteins p17 MA, p24 capsid (CA), p7 nucleocapsid (NC), and p6 (29.Freed E.O. Virology. 1998; 251: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). MA protein plays a critical role in viral assembly at the plasma membrane through its myristoylated N-terminal Gly residue as well as a highly basic domain between MA amino acid residues 17 and 31 (30.Bukrinskaya A. Virus Res. 2007; 124: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a recent study of a drug-resistant NL4-3/SPL2923 strain of HIV-1, several amino acid substitutions were observed in the MA of the strain selected in the presence of SPL2923, an inhibitor blocking HIV-1 binding to its target cell (31.Hantson A.

Chemother. 2005; 16: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Significantly, three of the total of four substitutions, E12K, K26R, and V35I, were located in or around the gag hot spot region (31.Hantson A. Fikkert V. Van Remoortel B. Pannecouque C.

Amino acid substitutions were also observed in the gp120 gene, another hot spot for recombination in HIV-1 (23.Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Véron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in MA (E12K and V35I) were reported to confer resistance to the anti-viral drug Amprenavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (32.Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K.

The overlapping of recombination hot spots and HIV-1 drug resistance sites indicated that facile recombination in gag could be advantageous in the development of drug resistance. Moreover, it follows that understanding the mechanisms responsible for the gag recombination hot spot could suggest approaches to suppress drug resistance. Here, we report analyses in vitro of the gag recombination hot spot in HIV-1 identified previously using a cell-culture based system. This hot spot is G-rich (38%) compared with the rest of the genome (24%) (33.Berkhout B. de Ronde A. AIDS. 2004; 18: 1861-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and there are several evenly spaced runs of G or A/G residues that correlate with synthesis pauses (28.Dykes C. Balakrishnan M. Planelles V. Zhu Y. Bambara R.A. Demeter L.M. Virology. 2004; 326: 262-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We employed a substrate RNA-containing sequence from the primer-binding site to a portion of gag for strand transfer assays. The effect of altering or weakening the pause sites on crossover efficiency was determined by creating mutant substrates with disrupted G runs. We also developed profiles of transfer positions to locate and compare crossover distributions in substrates with or without intact G runs. Experiments were designed to define the connection, if any, between G runs, unique structures in the RNA, pausing, and high efficiency strand transfer.

For each mutant substrate two DNA primers, both containing the desired mutations, were designed to be complementary to the WT double-stranded plasmid template sequences. Mutant plasmids were generated by primer extension with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The desired mutations of each construct are underlined. For A mutant donor construct, the paired primers containing the desired mutations are 5′-GAA TTA GAT AAA TGG GAA CCA ATT CGG TTA AGG CC-3′ and the complementary strand. For A mutant acceptor construct, the paired primers containing the desired mutations are 5′-GAA TTG GAT AGG TGG GAA CCA ATT CGG TTA AGG CC-3′ and the complementary strand. For the G mutant donor construct, the paired DNA primers containing the desired mutations are 5′-GCG TCG GTA TTA AGC TGC GGA GAA TTA GAT AAA TGG G-3′ and the complementary strand. For G mutant acceptor constructs, the paired primers containing the desired mutations are 5′-GCG TCA GTA TTA AGC TGC GGA GAA TTG GAT AGG TGG G-3′ and the complementary strand. For AG mutant donor construct, the paired primers containing the desired mutations are 5′-GGA ACC AAT TCG GTT AAG GCC ACG GCG AAA GAA AC-3′ and the complementary strand. For AG mutant acceptor construct, the paired primers containing the desired mutations are 5′-GGG AAC CAA TTC GGT TAA GGC CAC GAC GAA AGA AAC-3′ and the complementary strand. To generate GAG mutant donor and acceptor constructs, the same primers that generated the G mutant were used based on the AG mutants constructs. For the GGG mutant donor construct, the paired primers containing the desired mutations are 5′-GAA TTA GAT AAA TGC GAA AAA ATT CGG TTA AGG CC-3′ and the complementary strand based on the GAG mutant donor construct. Donor and acceptor DNA templates were generated from pNL182–520 and pJRC150–502, respectively (19.Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PCR primers AL(143)-gl-minus (5′-CTC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG G-3′) and MB24 (5′-CCC AGT ATT TGT CTA CAG CC-3′) were used to amplify donor DNA templates, whereas primers AL(143)-gl-minus and lg50 (5′-CTT CTG ATG ATT CTA ACA GGC C-3′) were used to amplify acceptor DNA templates. To amplify the short wild type sWT donor DNA, primers ws9 (5′-CCT CTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGC ATA TTA AGC GGG GGA GAA-3′) and lg66 (5′-AGC TCC CTG CTT GCC CAT AC-3′) were used. To amplify the sGGG-mut donor DNA, primers ws10 (5′-CCT CTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGC ATA TTA AGC TGC GGA GAA-3′) and lg66 were used. To amplify the sWT acceptor DNA template, primers ws8 (5′-CCT CTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGA GAG AGA TGG GTG CG-3′) and lg69 (5′-TAT ATG TTT TAA TCT ATA TTT TTT C-3′) were used. RNA templates were produced by run-off transcription in vitro using a MEGAshortscript kit. Full-length transcripts were purified on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (AccuGel 19:1) and analyzed for integrity. Annealing reactions were performed in 20-μl final reaction volume. The donor RNA (1 pmol) was incubated with 5′-end-labeled DNA primer (2 pmol) MB24 in 100 mm KCl at 95 °C for 5 min and slow-cooled to room temperature to facilitate primer annealing to the donor RNA. Transfer assays were performed in 12.5-μl final reaction volume. Nucleocapsid protein at a concentration for 200% substrate coating (100% nucleocapsid protein was defined as 1 protein molecule for every 7 nucleotides) was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with acceptor RNA (100 fmol) and a 0.5-μl annealing reaction (containing 50 fmol of primer and 25 fmol of donor) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. For donor extension assays, acceptor RNA was excluded. RT was added at a final concentration of 35 nm and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were initiated by adding MgCl2 and dNTPs at a final concentration of 6 mm and 50 μm, respectively. After the incubation at 37 °C for different time points, reactions were terminated by adding 12.5 μl of termination dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1% each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). Reaction products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (AccuGel 19:1), visualized by Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare), and analyzed by ImageQuant software Version 1.2 (GE Healthcare). For testing the effect of cations on pause profiles, 100 mm cation (KCl, LiCl, or NaCl) were added in the annealing reactions, respectively. Moreover, 50 mm cation (KCl, LiCl, or NaCl) were added in the transfer reactions, respectively. To locate the transfer events, transfer assays were performed, and gels were run and analyzed by autoradiography while still wet. Bands corresponding to transfer products were excised. The excised DNA was recovered by elution, amplified by PCR using primers lg61 (5′-ACC AGA GCT CTA GGC GAT TGG AGC TCC-3′) and lg62 (5′- ACT GGG ATC CTG CCC AGT GTT TGT CTA C-3′), and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Individual clones representing transfer products were first amplified by the Templiphi amplification kit, then sequenced using M13 (−20) forward primer (5′-GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT-3′) to identify the recombination sites. To address the possibility of false recombinant products generated during PCR amplification, WT donor extension and acceptor extension products were mixed in equal amounts and subjected to the same PCR amplification as the transfer products. Because of natural sequence difference between donor and acceptor templates at the 3′-end, equal amounts of reverse primers ws7 (for donor template) (5′-CTT CTG ATG TCT CTA AAA GGC C-3′) and lg40 (for acceptor template) (5′-CTT CTG ATG ATT CTA ACA GGC C-3′) were mixed with forward primer ws2 (5′-ACC AGA GCT CTA CGC CCG AAC AGG G-3′) to perform the PCR reactions. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced to determine the percentage of the recombinants contributed by PCR. The assays were performed in a 12.5-μl reaction volume. 5′-32P-Labeled sWT or sGGG-mut RNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA was incubated with or without 50 mm salt (KCl, LiCl, or NaCl). The reactions were heated at 95 °C for 1 min and cooled down slowly to room temperature, then separated by electrophoresis on 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (AccuGel 29:1). The gels were dried and exposed by Storm PhosphorImager and analyzed by ImageQuant software Version 1.2. To understand the factors that contribute to the peak of transfers in HIV-1 gag in vivo, we used a previously described strand transfer gag in vitro in which donor RNA (NL4-3) and acceptor RNA (JRCSF) harbor the same naturally occurring periodic sequence differences as in the cell culture-based system (28.Dykes C. Balakrishnan M. Planelles V. Zhu Y. Bambara R.A. Demeter L.M. Virology. 2004; 326: 262-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These differences act as markers to identify positions of crossovers in the transfer distribution assay. The donor and acceptor templates share a 320-nt homology spanning the primer-binding site through the beginning of gag, as shown in Fig. 1A. In this system, the primer was annealed to and extended on the donor template. The primer could switch from the donor onto the acceptor followed by completion of synthesis on the acceptor to yield a 385-nt transfer product (TP), or the primer could complete the synthesis on the donor without transfer to yield a 353-nt donor extension product (DE) (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows a typical gel of products from a strand transfer reaction using wild type donor and acceptor templates. The locations of markers are indicated on the left of the gel, whereas the major RT pause sites are indicated on the right of the gel. The arrow indicates the direction of DNA synthesis. According to the study in vivo, the peak of transfers falls into the 112-nt region between markers 4 and 9 (28.Dykes C. Balakrishnan M. Planelles V. Zhu Y. Bambara R.A. Demeter L.M. Virology. 2004; 326: 262-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By examining the pause profile, we noticed a series of regularly spaced pause bands in and around the peak of transfers. RT pausing is known to occur at hairpin structures in the donor RNA (36.Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or could happen at homopolymeric runs of nucleotides (37.Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Ji J. Hoffmann J.S. Loeb L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We noticed that several pause bands located downstream of the gag hot spot were correlated with known hairpin structures, such as the DIS and splice donor (SD) hairpin. Remarkably, the locations of three pause sites (designated G1, A/G, and G2) in the hot spot region correspond to three runs of G or A/G residues (Fig. 1C). Compared with the HIV-1 genome (24%) (33.Berkhout B. de Ronde A. AIDS. 2004; 18: 1861-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the 112-nt sequence of the gag hot spot region is unusually G-rich (38%). There are 43 G residues throughout the entire hot spot sequence, and these include four independent runs of Gs (with three or more adjacent bases). We previously reported that pauses promote strand transfer (36.Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the runs of G or A/G residues in the gag hot spot have the ability to pause RT in a way that is particularly favorable to promote strand transfers. To test whether regularly spaced G or A/G runs can pause RT and promote strand transfers, we made several base substitutions to disrupt the natural runs in the gag hot spot region (Fig. 2A). Strand transfer assays were performed using both wild type and mutant templates to examine the pause profiles (Fig. 2B) and transfer efficiency (Fig. 2C). “A-mut” disrupts the run of A residues in the A/G run (nt 382–390) with two A to C base substitutions. The pause profile in and around the A-mut sequence change was the same as that of the wild type templates, suggesting that the run of A residues on the donor RNA template is not able to cause RT pausing, and the pause band corresponding to this A/G run may result from the three continuous G residues in the A/G run. “G-mut” alters the G run between markers 5 and 6, the second G run encountered by the RT (G2: nt 363–367). Significantly, this mutation eliminated the corresponding G2 pause, providing more evidence that runs of G residues stall the RT. “AG-mut” contains base substitutions in the G run at marker 8 (G1: nt 405–409) in addition to those present in A-mut. Again, the A/G pause was not affected, but the G1 pause completely disappeared. “GAG-mut,” created by the disruption of all three G and A/G runs, exhibited the least pauses in the entire hot spot region as expected. The only remaining significant pause band was in the A/G region corresponding to the remaining G run. These results highlight the significance of runs of G residues rather than the A residues in causing RT pauses in the hot spot region. Our group previously reported that pausing of RT on donor templates concentrated RT-RNase H cuts in a way anticipated to make short gaps. These would be places on the nascent DNA that are accessible for acceptor invasion in vivo or in vitro, facilitating transfer (13.DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A.

Considering the evidence linking RT pausing with transfers, we hypothesized that the mutant templates, which eliminate some RT pauses, would be less effective than the wild type template in promoting transfers. The transfer efficiency values used to make comparisons were calculated as: 100 × transfer products/(transfer products + full-length donor extension products). To our surprise a comparison of wild type with mutant substrates in which both donor and acceptor templates were mutated as described above showed that the mutations did not decrease the efficiency of transfer. With G-mut, AG-mut, and GAG-mut sequence changes, although pauses were eliminated, transfer efficiency was almost the same as with the WT sequence (data not shown). As we considered how to explain this, we realized that the accessibility of"

Acquired prosopagnosia results after brain damage, developmental or congenital prosopagnosia (CP) is not caused by brain lesion, but has presumably been present from early childhood onwards. Since other sensory, perceptual, and cognitive abilities are largely spared, CP is considered to be a stimulus-specific deficit, limited to face processing. Given that recent behavioral and imaging studies indicate a close relationship of face and biological-motion perception in healthy adults, we hypothesized that biological motion processing should be impaired in CP. Five individuals with CP and ten matched healthy controls were tested with diverse biological-motion stimuli and tasks. Four of the CP individuals showed severe deficits in biological-motion processing, while one performed within the lower range of the controls. A discriminant analysis classified all participants correctly with a very high probability for each participant. These findings demonstrate that in CP, impaired perception of faces can be accompanied by impaired biological-motion perception. We discuss implications for dedicated and shared mechanisms involved in the perception of faces and biological motion."
https://openalex.org/W1989211084,"The microtubule cytoskeleton provides essential structural support for all eukaryotic cells and can be assembled into various higher order structures that perform drastically different functions. Understanding how microtubule-containing assemblies are built in a spatially and temporally controlled manner is therefore fundamental to understanding cell physiology. Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, contains at least five distinct tubulin-containing structures, the spindle pole, centrioles, cortical microtubules, the conoid, and the intra-conoid microtubules. How these five structurally and functionally distinct sets of tubulin containing structures are constructed and maintained in the same cell is an intriguing problem. Previously, we performed a proteomic analysis of the T. gondii apical complex, a cytoskeletal complex located at the apical end of the parasite that is composed of the conoid, three ring-like structures, and the two short intra-conoid microtubules. Here we report the characterization of one of the proteins identified in that analysis, TgICMAP1. We show that TgICMAP1 is a novel microtubule binding protein that can directly bind to microtubules in vitro and stabilizes microtubules when ectopically expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, in T. gondii, TgICMAP1 preferentially binds to the intra-conoid microtubules, providing us the first molecular tool to investigate the intra-conoid microtubule assembly process during daughter construction."
https://openalex.org/W1980964357,"The aims of this study were to investigate the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 in dyslipidemia-associated vascular dysfunction as well as autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Apolipoprotein (ApoE)−/− mice fed a high-fat diet were used as a model of atherosclerosis. Vascular and autonomic functions were measured in conscious mice using telemetry. The study revealed that PARP-1 plays an important role in dyslipidemia-associated vascular and autonomic dysfunction. Inhibition of this enzyme by gene knockout partially restored baroreflex sensitivity in ApoE−/− mice without affecting baseline heart-rate and arterial pressure, and also improved heart-rate responses following selective blockade of the autonomic nervous system. The protective effect of PARP-1 gene deletion against dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction was associated with preservation of eNOS activity. Dyslipidemia induced PARP-1 activation was accompanied by oxidative tissue damage, as evidenced by increased expression of iNOS and subsequent protein nitration. PARP-1 gene deletion reversed these effects, suggesting that PARP-1 may contribute to vascular and autonomic pathologies by promoting oxidative tissue injury. Further, inhibition of this oxidative damage may account for protective effects of PARP-1 gene deletion on vascular and autonomic functions. This study demonstrates that PARP-1 participates in dyslipidemia-mediated dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system and that PARP-1 gene deletion normalizes autonomic and vascular dysfunctions. Maintenance of eNOS activity may be associated with the protective effect of PARP-1 gene deletion against dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2155322770,"NR2E3 (PNR) is an orphan nuclear receptor essential for proper photoreceptor determination and differentiation. In humans, mutations in NR2E3 have been associated with the recessively inherited enhanced short wavelength sensitive (S-) cone syndrome (ESCS) and, more recently, with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). NR2E3 acts as a suppressor of the cone generation program in late mitotic retinal progenitor cells. In adult rod photoreceptors, NR2E3 represses cone-specific gene expression and acts in concert with the transcription factors CRX and NRL to activate rod-specific genes. NR2E3 and CRX have been shown to physically interact in vitro through their respective DNA-binding domains (DBD). The DBD also contributes to homo- and heterodimerization of nuclear receptors.We analyzed NR2E3 homodimerization and NR2E3/CRX complex formation in an in vivo situation by Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET(2)). NR2E3 wild-type protein formed homodimers in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. NR2E3 homodimerization was impaired in presence of disease-causing mutations in the DBD, except for the p.R76Q and p.R104W mutant proteins. Strikingly, the adRP-linked p.G56R mutant protein interacted with CRX with a similar efficiency to that of NR2E3 wild-type and p.R311Q proteins. In contrast, all other NR2E3 DBD-mutant proteins did not interact with CRX. The p.G56R mutant protein was also more effective in abolishing the potentiation of rhodospin gene transactivation by the NR2E3 wild-type protein. In addition, the p.G56R mutant enhanced the transrepression of the M- and S-opsin promoter, while all other NR2E3 DBD-mutants did not.These results suggest different disease mechanisms in adRP- and ESCS-patients carrying NR2E3 mutations. Titration of CRX by the p.G56R mutant protein acting as a repressor in trans may account for the severe clinical phenotype in adRP patients."
https://openalex.org/W1982598734,"Diazotrophic heterocyst formation in the filamentous cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, is one of the simplest pattern formations known to occur in cell differentiation. Most previous studies on heterocyst patterning were based on statistical analysis using cells collected or observed at different times from a liquid culture, which would mask stochastic fluctuations affecting the process of pattern formation dynamics in a single bacterial filament. In order to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of heterocyst formation at the single filament level, here we developed a culture system to monitor simultaneously bacterial development, gene expression, and phycobilisome fluorescence. We also developed micro-liquid chamber arrays to analyze multiple Anabaena filaments at the same time. Cell lineage analyses demonstrated that the initial distributions of hetR::gfp and phycobilisome fluorescence signals at nitrogen step-down were not correlated with the resulting distribution of developed heterocysts. Time-lapse observations also revealed a dynamic hetR expression profile at the single-filament level, including transient upregulation accompanying cell division, which did not always lead to heterocyst development. In addition, some cells differentiated into heterocysts without cell division after nitrogen step-down, suggesting that cell division in the mother cells is not an essential requirement for heterocyst differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2046216549,"The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is the defining feature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its kinase activity is required for induction of this disease. Current thinking holds that BCR-ABL forms a multi-protein complex that incorporates several substrates and adaptor proteins and is stabilized by multiple direct and indirect interactions. Signaling output from this highly redundant network leads to cellular transformation. Proteins known to be associated with BCR-ABL in this complex include: GRB2, c-CBL, p62DOK, and CRKL. These proteins in turn, link BCR-ABL to various signaling pathways indicated in cellular transformation. In this study we show that a triple mutant of BCR-ABL with mutations of the direct binding sites for GRB2, CBL, p62DOK and CRKL, is defective for transformation of primary hematopoietic cells in vitro and in a murine CML model, while it retains the capacity to induce IL-3 independence in 32D cells. Compared to BCR-ABL, the triple mutant's ability to activate the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase pathways is severely compromised, while STAT5 phosphorylation is maintained, suggesting that the former are crucial for the transformation of primary cells, but dispensable for transformation of factor dependent cell lines. Our data suggest that inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia by disrupting protein interactions could be possible, but would require blocking of multiple sites."
https://openalex.org/W2039513725,"Background While the static structure of the intracellular Ca2+ release channel, the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) has been determined using cryo electron microscopy, relatively little is known concerning changes in RyR1 structure that accompany channel gating. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods can resolve small changes in protein structure although FRET measurements of RyR1 are hampered by an inability to site-specifically label the protein with fluorescent probes. Methodology/Principal Findings A novel site-specific labeling method is presented that targets a FRET acceptor, Cy3NTA to 10-residue histidine (His) tags engineered into RyR1. Cy3NTA, comprised of the fluorescent dye Cy3, coupled to two Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid moieties, was synthesized and functionally tested for binding to His-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP fluorescence emission and Cy3NTA absorbance spectra overlapped significantly, indicating that FRET could occur (Förster distance = 6.3 nm). Cy3NTA bound to His10-tagged GFP, quenching its fluorescence by 88%. GFP was then fused to the N-terminus of RyR1 and His10 tags were placed either at the N-terminus of the fused GFP or between GFP and RyR1. Cy3NTA reduced fluorescence of these fusion proteins by 75% and this quenching could be reversed by photobleaching Cy3, thus confirming GFP-RyR1 quenching via FRET. A His10 tag was then placed at amino acid position 1861 and FRET was measured from GFP located at either the N-terminus or at position 618 to Cy3NTA bound to this His tag. While minimal FRET was detected between GFP at position 1 and Cy3NTA at position 1861, 53% energy transfer was detected from GFP at position 618 to Cy3NTA at position 1861, thus indicating that these sites are in close proximity to each other. Conclusions/Significance These findings illustrate the potential of this site-specific labeling system for use in future FRET-based experiments to elucidate novel aspects of RyR1 structure."
https://openalex.org/W2077159851,"Germinal Vesicle (GV) stage mouse oocytes in first meiotic prophase exhibit highly active HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchange--a class of transport nearly ubiquitously involved in regulation of intracellular pH and cell volume. During meiosis, however, oocyte HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchange becomes inactivated during first metaphase (MI), remains inactive in second metaphase (MII), and is reactivated only after egg activation. Previous work using pharmacological manipulations had indicated that activity of the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway was negatively correlated with HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchange activity during meiosis. However, the mechanism by which the exchanger is inactivated during meiotic progression had not been determined, nor had the role of MEK/MAPK been directly established.Expression of a constitutively active form of MEK (MAP kinase kinase), which prevented the normal downregulation of MAPK after egg activation, also prevented reactivation of HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchange. Conversely, suppression of endogenous MAPK activity with dominant negative MEK activated the normally quiescent HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchange in mature MII eggs. A GFP-tagged form of the HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchanger isoform Ae2 (Slc4a2) was strongly expressed at the GV oocyte plasma membrane, but membrane localization decreased markedly during meiotic progression. A similar pattern for endogenous Ae2 was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. The loss of membrane-localized Ae2 appeared selective, since membrane localization of a GFP-tagged human dopamine D1 receptor did not change during meiotic maturation.Direct manipulation of MAPK activity indicated that GFP-tagged Ae2 localization depended upon MAPK activity. Inactivation of HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchange during the meiotic cell cycle may therefore reflect the loss of Ae2 from the oocyte plasma membrane, downstream of MEK/MAPK signaling. This identifies a novel role for MEK/MAPK-mediated cytostatic factor (CSF) activity during meiosis in membrane protein trafficking in mouse oocytes, and shows for the first time that selective retrieval of membrane proteins is a feature of meiosis in mammalian oocytes."

We have determined the precise breakpoints of several existing deficiencies and have generated new deficiencies. Our results show that the region contains at least three different loci associated with gastrulation effects. One maternal effect gene involved in ventral furrow formation maps at 24F but could not be identified. For a second maternal effect gene which is required for germ band extension, we identify a candidate gene, CG31660, which encodes a G protein coupled receptor. Finally, one gene acts zygotically in ventral furrow formation and we identify it as Traf4."

We investigated the physiological response of captive koalas Phascolarctos cinereus in a conservation centre to the presence of tourists walking through their habitat. We compared, using animal-attached data-recorders, the electrocardiogram activity of female koalas in contact with tourists and in a human-free area. One of the koalas in the tourist zone presented elevated heart rate values and variability throughout the recording period. The remaining female in the exhibit area showed a higher field resting heart rates during the daytime than that in the isolated area. In the evening, heart rate profiles changed drastically and both the koalas in the exhibit and in the tourist-free zones displayed similar field resting heart rates, which were lower than those during the day. In parallel, the autonomic nervous systems of these two individuals evolved from sympathetic-dominant during the day to parasympathetic-dominant in the evening. Our results report ECG of free-living koalas for the first time. Although they are preliminary due to the difficulty of having sufficient samples of animals of the same sex and age, our results stress out the importance of studies investigating the physiological reaction of animals to tourists."

The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core in which 146 base pairs of double-stranded DNA are wrapped in ∼1.75 left-handed superhelical turns around an octamer containing two molecules of each of the four conserved core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1.Wolffe A.P.

Site-specific histone post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, are correlated with diverse chromatin functions, including DNA replication, DNA repair, chromatin assembly, gene transcription, and other chromatin-based processes (3.Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7924) Google Scholar, 4.Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that at least some distinct histone modifications act sequentially or in combination to form what has been variously referred to as a histone, epigenetic, or nucleosome “code” that is read by other proteins or protein complexes to alter chromatin structure and regulate distinct downstream events (5.Ruthenburg A.J.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Deciphering this code, which is likely to have complex redundant, combinatorial, and multivalent features, is essential for understanding the in vivo function of the diverse post-translational modifications on histones.Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid globular protein that is conserved in eukaryotes. Unlike proteins that are targeted by polyubiquitylation to the proteosome for degradation, histones are reversibly modified by covalent attachment of one ubiquitin or a short ubiquitin chain. The bulk of histone ubiquitylation occurs on chromatin by the addition of a single ubiquitin molecule via an isopeptide linkage to a specific lysine residue in the C-terminal tail of histones H2A and H2B (7.Goldknopf I.L.

Ubiquitylation on different histones has distinct functions (12.Weake V.M. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 653-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar).A number of recent studies have focused on ubiquitylation of H2B. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H2B is monoubiquitylated at lysine 123 by an evolutionarily conserved E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6/Ubc2 (13.Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Initial reports indicated that Ubc2-mediated H2B monoubiquitylation is a prerequisite for methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 and lysine 79 by the histone methyltransferases Set1 and Dot1, respectively (14.Briggs S.D.

Bre1 was identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that associates with Rad6/Ubc2 and directs it for H2B ubiquitylation (18.Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D.

Ubc2-Bre1-mediated H2B ubiquitylation is dependent on the transcriptional elongation complex Paf1 and promotes efficient RNA polymerase II elongation (22.Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol.

In human cells, H2B ubiquitylation is also involved in transcriptional activation and appears to affect H3K4 methylation, as shown by knockdown of human orthologs of yeast BRE1 (25.Kim J. Hake S.B.

It has been shown that Rad6/Ubc2 is also required for H2B ubiquitylation and efficient H3K4 di- and trimethylation in human cells (27.Kim J. Guermah M. McGinty R.K. Lee J.S. Tang Z. Milne T.A.

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Ubc2-Bre1-mediated H2B monoubiquitylation is conserved and is required for H3K4 methylation (28.Tanny J.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Allis C.D.

The apparent conservation of the relationship between H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 methylation in yeasts and humans has led to the general belief that this pattern of cross-talk is likely to be universal. However, a recent study (30.Foster E.R. Downs J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has called some of the initial results on budding yeast into question. It was shown that in S. cerevisiae, H3K4 methylation is not solely dependent on H2B ubiquitylation and that elimination of the H2B ubiquitylation site, combined with an additional mutation on H2B, which was not identified in previous studies, are required to eliminate H3K4 methylation. This study also confirmed that BRE1 is required for H3K4 methylation in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that components of the H2B ubiquitylation mechanism but not ubiquitylation itself were essential for H3K4 methylation. In addition, in both budding and fission yeast, H2B ubiquitylation has functions in transcription that are independent of H3K4 methylation (28.Tanny J.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29.Zofall M. Grewal S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14065-14072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). H2B ubiquitylation in fission yeast also functions in cell growth, nuclear structure, and heterochromatin derepression by unknown mechanisms that are independent of H3K4 methylation, and H2B ubiquitylation regulates the expression of more genes than does H3K4 methylation (28.Tanny J.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).In this study, the single ubiquitylation site in Tetrahymena thermophila histone H2B was mapped to the conserved lysine 115 of its C-terminal region. In mutant strains lacking H2B ubiquitylation, H3K4 methylation is not detectably affected. Tetrahymena orthologs of Ubc2 and Bre1 were identified as the conserved E2 and E3 enzymes specific for H2B ubiquitylation at Lys115. Neither enzyme is required for H3K4 methylation. These studies strongly suggest that, unlike in yeasts and mammals, neither Ubc2-Bre1-mediated H2B ubiquitylation nor the major components of the H2B ubiquitylation mechanism are required for H3K4 methylation in Tetrahymena, demonstrating that different organisms speak different languages and use different components in the cross-talk between post-translational modifications on different histones.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have shown that, in Tetrahymena, mutant strains lacking H2B ubiquitylation could be created by rescuing the progeny of HTB double knock-out heterokaryons with a mutated HTB1 gene lacking the conserved ubiquitylation site, making Tetrahymena the only organism besides yeasts in which the in vivo function of H2B ubiquitylation has been studied directly by mutating the ubiquitylation site.We have also shown that genes encoding Tetrahymena Ubc2 and Bre1 are the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and E3 ubiquitin ligase, respectively, for H2B ubiquitylation, indicating that, as in yeasts and human cells, Ubc2-Bre1-mediated H2B ubiquitylation is conserved in Tetrahymena. It was suggested that, in human cells, H2B ubiquitylation requires UbcH6, which has E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity in vitro (26.Zhu B. Zheng Y. Pham A.D. Mandal S.S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). However, compared with the previously identified human HR6A and HR6B enzymes (50.Koken M.H. Reynolds P. Jaspers-Dekker I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Together with the evidence that Ubc2 is required for H2B ubiquitylation in Tetrahymena and yeasts, these results suggest that Ubc6H is not a true Ubc2 ortholog. A recent study (27.Kim J. Guermah M.

However, although H2B ubiquitylation is required for H3K4 methylation in some strains of S. cerevisiae (15.Dover J. Schneider J. Tawiah-Boateng M.A. Wood A. Dean K. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J.

Cell. 2005; 20: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), none of the levels of H3K4 methylation were detectably affected in the HTB ubiquitylation mutant strain of Tetrahymena. Our study has shown that none of the levels of H3K4 methylation were detectably affected in UBC2 or BRE1 knock-out strains of Tetrahymena. These results strongly argue that, despite the conservation of the site of H2B monoubiquitylation and H3K4 mono-, di-, and trimethylation and the fact that the genes involved in the H2B ubiquitylation pathway are highly conserved, the cross-talk between Ubc2-Bre1-mediated H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 methylation is not universally conserved among all organisms. IntroductionIn the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, DNA is highly compacted into chromatin, a nucleoprotein complex, whose major protein components are the histones. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core in which 146 base pairs of double-stranded DNA are wrapped in ∼1.75 left-handed superhelical turns around an octamer containing two molecules of each of the four conserved core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1.Wolffe A.P.

All species identified as having USs exhibit epitheliochorial placentation and are in the Ruminantia and Suidae orders of the Laurasiatheria superorder. The objective was to identify US genes in species within and outside Laurasiatheria and evaluate whether evolution of the US gene was associated with development of the epitheliochorial placenta. Through queries of nucleotide and genomic databases, known US genes were identified (caprine, bovine, porcine, water buffalo), and new US coding sequences were found in dolphins, horses, dogs, and cats. The cat sequence contained several stop codons. No sequence was found in completed genomic sequences for primates, rodents, rabbits, opossums, or duck-billed platypuses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed expression of the US gene in the uterus of pregnant horses and dogs. The ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitutions suggests that the US gene evolved under positive selection. In conclusion, the US gene evolved within the Laurasiatheria superorder to play a role in pregnancy for species with epitheliochorial placentation and some but not all Laurasiatheria species that have a different form of placentation. The positive selection taking place in the gene suggests development of species-specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W2150022224,"Background Small molecule inhibitors of RNA virus replication are potent antiviral drugs and useful to dissect selected steps in the replication process. To identify antiviral compounds against Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a model positive stranded RNA virus, we tested acridine derivatives, such as chlorpromazine (CPZ) and quinacrine (QC), which are active against prion-based diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report that CPZ and QC compounds inhibited TBSV RNA accumulation in plants and in protoplasts. In vitro assays revealed that the inhibitory effects of these compounds were manifested at different steps of TBSV replication. QC was shown to have an effect on multiple steps, including: (i) inhibition of the selective binding of the p33 replication protein to the viral RNA template, which is required for recruitment of viral RNA for replication; (ii) reduction of minus-strand synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase; and (iii) inhibition of translation of the uncapped TBSV genomic RNA. In contrast, CPZ was shown to inhibit the in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase, likely due to binding of CPZ to intracellular membranes, which are important for RNA virus replication. Conclusion/Significance Since we found that CPZ was also an effective inhibitor of other plant viruses, including Tobacco mosaic virus and Turnip crinkle virus, it seems likely that CPZ has a broad range of antiviral activity. Thus, these inhibitors constitute effective tools to study similarities in replication strategies of various RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2062464324,"Cyclin B1, an important cell cycle regulator, was up-regulated in lymphocytes of human immunodeficiency virus (HlV)-infected patients. However, the mechanism of cyclin B1 up-regulation and the effects of the up-regulation on the host cells remain unclear. Here, we show that HIV-encoded Tat protein regulates cyclin B1 levels in two different ways: first, Tat stimulates the transcription of cyclin B1, which increases cyclin B1 levels and promotes the cells apoptosis; and second, Tat stimulates polyubiquitination-mediated degradation of cyclin B1 through binding to the N-terminal of cyclin B1 (aa 61–129) that is just downstream of the D box, which prevents excessive levels of cyclin B1 in the cells. These results suggest that Tat-regulating cyclin B1 affects the status of HIV: Tat stimulates cyclin B1 expression to slow down the host cell cycle progress and to promote the host cell apoptosis, which might facilitate HIV release;Tat stimulates cyclin B1 degradation to prevent overaccumulation of cyclin B1, which might facilitate HIV replication. Taken together, our results reveal for the first time how HIV-Tat regulates cyclin B1 and keeps its balance in the cells.—Zhang, S.-M., Sun, Y., Fan, R., Xu, Q.-Z., Liu, X.-D., Zhang, X., Wang, Y., Zhou, P.-K HIV-1 Tat regulates cyclin B1 by promoting both expression and degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2069209078,"Background Endomyocardial Fibrosis (EMF) –is a chronic inflammatory disease of the heart with related pathology to that of late stage Chaga's disease. Indeed, both diseases are thought to result from auto-immune responses against myocardial tissue. As is the case that molecular mimicry between the acidic termini of Trypanosoma cruzi ribosomal P0, P1 and P2β (or simply TcP0, TcP1, and TcP2β) proteins and myocardial tissue causes Chaga's disease, excessive exposure to certain infections, toxins including cassava ones, allergy and malnutrition has been suggested as the possible cause for EMF. Recent studies have defined the proteomic characteristics of the T. cruzi ribosomal P protein-C-termini involved in mediating auto-immunity against Beta1-adrenergic receptors of the heart in Chaga's disease. This study aimed to investigate the similarity of C-termini of TcP0/TcP2β to sequences and molecules of several plants, microbial, viral and chemical elements- most prior thought to be possible causative agents for EMF. Methods and Principal Findings Comparative Sequence alignments and phylogeny using the BLAST-P tool at the Swiss Institute of Biotechnology (SIB) revealed homologs of C-termini of TcP0 and TcP2β among related proteins from several eukaryotes including the animals (Homo sapiens, C. elegans, D. melanogaster), plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Glycina Max, Oryza sativa, Rhizopus oryzae) and protozoa (P. falciparum, T. gondii, Leishmania spp).The chemical formulae of the two T.cruzi ribosomal protein C-terminal peptides were found to be C61H83N13O26S1and C64H87N13O28S1 respectively by Protparam. Both peptides are heavily negatively charged. Constitutively, both auto-antigens predominantly contain Asparagine (D), Glycine (G) and Phenylamine (F), with a balanced Leucine (L) and Methionine (M) percent composition of 7.7%. The afore going composition, found to be non-homologous to all molecules of chemical species in the databases searched, suggests the possible role of a metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis of EMF if aligned with our “molecular mimicry” hypothesis. Conclusions Our findings provide a “window” to suggest that cross reactivity of antibodies against C-terminal sequences of several animal, plant and protozoal ribosomal P proteins with heart tissue may mediate EMF in a similar manner as C- termini of T. cruzi do for Chaga's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2092508403,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary arrhythmia caused by mutations in genes for cardiac ion channels, including a potassium channel, KvLQT1. Inheritance of LQTS is usually autosomal-dominant, but autosomal-recessive inheritance can be observed in patients with LQTS accompanied by hearing loss. In this study, we investigated the functional alterations caused by KCNQ1 mutations, a deletion (delV595) and a frameshift (P631fs/19), which were identified in compound heterozygous state in two patients with autosomal-recessive LQTS not accompanied by hearing loss. Functional analyses showed that both mutations impaired cell surface expression due to trafficking defects. The mutations severely affected outward potassium currents without apparent dominant negative effects. It was found that delV595 impaired subunit binding, whereas P631fs/19 was retained in endoplasmic reticulum due to the newly added 19-amino acid sequence containing two retention motifs (R633GR and R646LR).

From the genetic viewpoints, LQTS is classified into two subtypes, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 220400) and Romano Ward syndrome (OMIM 192500). The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is defined as LQTS of the autosomal-recessive genetic trait, which is often accompanied by sensorineural deafness, whereas Romano Ward syndrome defines LQTS without deafness, which is inherited as the autosomal-dominant trait. Recent genetic analyses have revealed that most of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome patients carried mutations in KCNQ1 that encodes the α-subunit of a voltage-gated cardiac potassium channel, KvLQT1 (2.Neyroud N.

Many KCNQ1 mutations associated with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and Romano Ward syndrome have been reported, most of which were found in the membrane-spanning segments and impaired the channel function (1.Lehnart S.E.

On the other hand, more information is available about the functional alterations caused by mutations in KCNH2 that encodes pore-forming α-subunits of another voltage-gated cardiac potassium channel, HERG.

With regard to the functional alterations caused by KCNH2 mutations associated with Romano Ward syndrome, most mutations in the cytoplasmic regions caused trafficking defects due to misfolding in ER (17.Anderson C.L.

These functional abnormalities decreased the IKr current in the cardiomyocytes and led to the prolongation of repolarizing phase of action potential, manifested with prolonged QT interval in the ECG (19.Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated functional alterations caused by two mutations, delV595 and P631fs/19, in the C-terminal region of the KvLQT1 channel, which were found in an LQTS family of autosomal-recessive inheritance. It was demonstrated that both mutations lead to trafficking defects, resulting in the loss of channel function. This is the first report on two novel mechanisms of channel-trafficking abnormalities: an impaired subunit binding and a newly generated ER retention signal. The proband of the LQTS family was a 10-year-old girl with a history of cardiopulmonary arrest during exercise. Ventricular fibrillation was confirmed when she was revived by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Her ECG showed a wide T-wave and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.55 s). Her eldest brother also suffered from LQTS. He experienced syncope during exercise at the age of 13. His ECG after the event showed T-wave alternans, and prolongation of QTc interval (0.48 s) was found even at rest. Neither patient had any history of hearing loss. Prolongation of QTc interval was not found in the ECGs of either the parents or the second eldest brother. The other relatives of this family had no history of syncope or sudden death. The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Reviewing Committee of the Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Genetic screening was performed for the proband and her family members. The control subjects were 180 genetically unrelated Japanese individuals who were selected at random. Blood samples were obtained from each subject, who provided informed consent for the clinical and genetic studies. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples by conventional methods. Each exon of KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNJ2 genes was amplified by PCR. The PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing using Big Dye Terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of primers used in the genetic analyses are available on request. Amino acid sequences of human KvLQT1 protein predicted from nucleotide sequences (GenBankTM NM_000218) were aligned with those of bovine (XM_001252337), dog (XM_540790), rat (NM_032073), mouse (NM_008434), and chicken (XM_421022), using GENETIX version 8.1.2 software (Genetics, Tokyo, Japan). The tertiary structure of coiled-coil was predicted by using COILS (available on the World Wide Web) (20.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) full-length KCNQ1 (NM_000218) and KCNE1 (NM_000219) cDNA fragments corresponding to aa 1–676 and aa 1–129, respectively, were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from human heart cDNA. Mutant KCNQ1 cDNA fragments carrying deletion of GTA (delV595 mutation) or insertion of C (P631fs/19 mutation) were generated by the primer-directed mutagenesis method. The KCNQ1 cDNA fragments were cloned in the bicistronic plasmid pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to make pIRES2-EGFP-KvLQT1 constructs, whereas KCNE1 cDNA was inserted into the bicistronic plasmid pCD8-IRES to make the pCD8-IRES-MinK construct.

Potassium currents were recorded from cells that were positive for both EGFP and CD8 using the whole-cell patch clamp techniques as described previously (21.Aizawa Y. Ueda K. Scornik F. Cordeiro J.M. Wu Y. Desai M. Guerchicoff A. Nagata Y. Iesaka Y. Kimura A. Hiraoka M. Antzelevitch C. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2007; 18: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and series resistance errors were reduced by 60–70% using electronic compensation. Holding potential was −80 mV. All of the signals were acquired at 5–500 kHz (Digidata 1322, Axon Instruments) with a personal computer running Clampex 9 software (Axon Instruments) and filtered at 5 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel low pass filter. Membrane currents were analyzed with Clampfit 9 software (Axon Instruments). The cDNA fragments corresponding to the C terminus of KvLQT1 (aa 353–676) were generated for WT, delV595, and P631fs/19 by PCR from the KCNQ1 plasmids described earlier. Another mutant cDNA containing a substitution of G with A (R594Q mutation) was obtained from the KvLQT1-WT construct by the primer-directed mutagenesis method. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the C terminus of KvLQT1 were cloned into pCMV-Tag3C (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) and pBIND (Promega, Madison, WI). The co-IP assays were performed as previously described (22.Inagaki N. Hayashi T. Arimura T. Koga Y. Takahashi M. Shibata H. Teraoka K. Chikamori T. Yamashina A. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Briefly, COS-7 cells or HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a combination of pCMV-Tag3C-KvLQT1 (Myc-tagged C terminus KvLQT1) and pBIND-KvLQT1 (GAL4-tagged C terminus KvLQT1) constructs to analyze the binding of KvLQT1 subunits. Aliquots of the cellular extracts were collected for assessing the expression levels, and the remaining supernatants containing equal amount of proteins were used for the co-IP assay using the Catch and Release version 2.0 reversible immunoprecipitation system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA), with mouse anti-GAL4 monoclonal antibody (Ab) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Eluted samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, preincubated with 5% skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated with primary rabbit anti-c-Myc polyclonal Ab (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or rabbit anti-GAL4 polyclonal Ab (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit (for polyclonal Ab) IgG HRP-conjugated Ab (1:1000; Dako A/S, Grostrup, Denmark). The signals were visualized by Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and luminescent image analyzer LAS-3000mini (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The densitometric intensities were measured as means by using Multi Gauge version 3.0 (Fujifilm). KvLQT1-WT, -delV595, and -P631fs/19 cDNA fragments were cloned into pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene) to add a Myc tag at the N terminus of KvLQT1 (Nt-Myc-KvLQT1) or into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to add a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag (GFP-KvLQT1). HEK293 cells (1.0 × 106) were seeded onto a poly-d-lysine-coated 60-mm dish (BD Biosciences). After 24 h, 1 μg of Nt-Myc-KvLQT1 and 1 μg of Myc-tagged C terminus KvLQT1 constructs were added to the dish with TransFectin lipid reagent (Bio-Rad). After 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of transfection, the cells were subjected to sonication in 2% SDS, 250 mm sucrose, 75 mm urea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After measuring the protein concentration by using BCA protein assay regent (Pierce), equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and experiments using Western blotting. The membrane was incubated with primary mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal Ab (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or rabbit anti-c-Myc polyclonal Ab (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by incubation with appropriate secondary Ab: rabbit anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated Ab (1:1000; Dako A/S) or goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated Ab (1:1000; Dako A/S). For the subcellular fraction assay, Nt-Myc-KvLQT1 or GFP-KvLQT1 constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells plated on a poly-d-lysine-coated 60-mm dish (BD Biosciences). After 48 h, cells were subjected to brief sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, nuclei, and large particulates. The supernatant portion containing both the membrane proteins and cytosolic proteins was collected and further centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the membrane fraction from the cytosolic fraction as described by Wu et al. (24.Wu L. Yong S.L. Fan C. Ni Y. Yoo S. Zhang T. Zhang X. Obejero-Paz C.A. Rho H.J. Ke T. Szafranski P. Jones S.W. Chen Q. Wang Q.K. J. Biol.

After measuring the protein concentration by using BCA reagent, equal amounts of proteins were subjected to the SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The membrane was incubated with primary rabbit anti-c-Myc polyclonal Ab (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-GFP monoclonal Ab (1:1000; Clontech), or mouse anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal Ab (1:1000; BD Biosciences), followed by the incubation with the appropriate secondary Ab. Signals were visualized, and the densitometric intensities were measured as described earlier. Mutant cDNA fragments containing substitution of AGA with TGA (P631stop mutation) or insertion of CC (P631fs2/34 mutation) were obtained by the primer-directed mutagenesis method from the KvLQT1-WT construct. We also constructed the P631fs/19-mutant carrying A633AA + R646LR, R633GR + A646AA, or A633AA + A646AA by primer-directed mutagenesis from the KvLQT1-P631fs/19 construct.

To introduce a c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) into the extracellular linker 1 (L1) between the S1 and S2 after the position of aa 146 of each KvLQT1 construct, we used a recombination PCR, and the PCR fragment was introduced into the pcDNA3.1(+)- based KvLQT1 constructs (L1-Myc-KvLQT1) (25.Kanki H.

HEK293 cells (7.0 × 104) were seeded onto poly-d-Lysine 8-well culture slides (BD Biosciences), and 24 h later, 0.3 μg of L1-Myc-KvLQT1 constructs or 0.15 μg of L1-Myc-KvLQT1 constructs plus 0.15 μg of MinK constructs were added into wells with 0.6 μl of TransFectin lipid reagent (Bio-Rad). After 48 h, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal Ab (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After washing with PBS, Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG1 Ab (1:400; Invitrogen) in 3% bovine serum albumin was applied. To detect the intracellular L1-Myc-KvLQT1 protein, HEK293 cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. The permeabilized cells transfected with L1-Myc-KvLQT1 constructs were incubated with the primary and secondary Abs. The permeabilized cells transfected with L1-Myc-KvLQT1 constructs were also incubated with rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal Ab (1:100; Sigma), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG1 Ab, and sheep anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Ab (1:400; Chemicon, Australia). To assess the efficacy of permeabilization, non-permeabilized and permeabilized cells were incubated with mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal Ab (1:1000; Sigma), and with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG1 Ab that detected the intracellular protein α-tubulin only in the permeabilized cells. The transfected HEK293 cells were mounted on cover glass using Mowiol 4-88 reagent (Calbiochem) with or without 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were collected and analyzed with a laser confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss (Jena, Germany)). In the luminometric surface expression assay, we tested L1-Myc-KvLQT1-WT, -delV595, -P631fs/19, -P631stop, -P631fs2/34, and -P631fs/19 derivatives; Nt-Myc-KvLQT1-WT; and Myc(−)-KvLQT1-WT. The assay was performed as previously described (26.Margeta-Mitrovic M. Methods. 2002; 27: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105 in each well of a poly-d-lysine-coated multiwell plate (BD Biosciences). After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 0.6 μg of L1-Myc-KvLQT1 constructs, Nt-Myc-KvLQT1-WT, or Myc(−)-KvLQT1-WT along with 0.6 μg of MinK cDNA and 1.2 μl of TransFectin lipid reagent (Bio-Rad). After 48 h of transfection, the living cells were incubated with primary mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal Ab (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with the secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated Ab (1:2000; Dako) in 3% bovine serum albumin for 40 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the bottoms of the wells were dipped with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore), and the plate was placed in the luminescent image analyzer LAS-3000mini (Fujifilm). The intensity of chemiluminescence from each well was measured with a densitometer using Multi Gauge version 3.0 (Fujifilm) and expressed as arbitrary units (AU). Numerical data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student's t test for paired values. Means were compared by independent sample t tests without correction for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mutational analysis of cardiac ion channel genes in the proband of LQTS family (Fig. 1A) identified two different KCNQ1 mutations, a deletion of three nucleotides at position 1783–1785 in exon 15, resulting in the predicted deletion of valine 595 (delV595) (Fig. 1B) and an insertion of cytosine between positions 1893 and 1894 in exon 16. This resulted in a frameshift mutation after the 631th residue (proline), which replaced the original 45 amino acids with 19 novel amino acids (P631fs/19) (Fig. 1C). Both mutations were not detected in 180 unrelated healthy Japanese individuals. The former mutation is newly described, whereas the latter mutation has been reported to be a cause of LQTS (27.Neyroud N. Richard P. Vignier N. Donger C. Denjoy I. Demay L. Shkolnikova M. Pesce R.

No mutation in the other LQT-causing genes, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNJ2, has been identified in the proband. A family study revealed that the affected eldest brother carried both mutations, whereas the unaffected second eldest brother carried no mutation. Each mutation was found in each parent: delV595 in the father and P631fs/19 in the mother (Fig. 1A). None of the family members suffered hearing loss. Valine 595 was located in four heptad repeats between aa 588 and 616, and evolutionarily conserved in the KvLQT1 channel among various species (Fig. 2A). Structures of WT, delV595, and P631fs/19 in this region were predicted by using the program COILS along with another LQTS-associated mutation R594Q (28.Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Lehmann M.H. Priori S. Robinson J.L. Moss A.J. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Vincent G.M. Keating M.T. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Two coiled-coil structures were predicted for WT, P631fs/19, and R594Q (Fig. 2, B, D, and E, respectively), whereas complete destruction of the second coiled-coil structure was predicted for delV595 (Fig. 2C). Whole-cell currents were recorded by a step pulse protocol from cells expressing EGFP and full-length KvLQT1-WT or -mutant in the presence of CD8-MinK (Fig. 3, A and B). KvLQT1-WT exhibited a slowly activating outward current similar to IKs (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, both KvLQT1-delV595 and KvLQT1-P631fs/19 produced little to no current (Fig. 3, D and E, respectively). Peak current densities measured at the test pulse of +60 mV were significantly smaller in cells expressing either delV595 (2.8 ± 0.6 pA/pF, n = 4; p < 0.001), P631fs/19 (2.6 ± 0.8 pA/pF, n = 4; p < 0.001), or delV595 + P631fs/19 (5.4 ± 2.2 pA/pF, n = 3; p < 0.001) than WT (130.0 ± 15.4 pA/pF, n = 23) (Fig. 3F). To investigate whether the mutant KvLQT1 channels would exhibit dominant negative suppression effects, KvLQT1-delV595 or KvLQT1-P631fs/19 was co-transfected with an equal amount of KvLQT1-WT in the presence of CD8-MinK. It was found that the co-expression of delV595 or P631fs/19 did not affect the peak current densities of KvLQT1-WT (WT + delV595: 145.8 ± 33.3 pA/pF, p = NS; WT + P631fs/19: 113.9 ± 16.4 pA/pF, p = NS), demonstrating that these mutations did not exert the dominant negative suppression (Fig. 3F). In addition, we examined the functional properties of KvLQT1-P631fs/19 carrying A633AA + A646AA (AAA/AAA) that lacked both ER retention signals of R633GR and R646LR (details are described below). The AAA/AAA mutant exhibited peak current density comparable with that of KvLQT1-WT, either alone (AAA/AAA: 94.6 ± 16.2 pA/pF, n = 5, p = NS) or in combination with KvLQT1-WT (WT + AAA/AAA: 146.1 ± 27.2 pA/pF, n = 11, p = NS) (Fig. 3F). To investigate the functional alterations caused by the KCNQ1 mutations in the subunit assembly, we performed co-IP assays for KvLQT1-WT and -mutants. Myc-tagged C terminus KvLQT1-WT or -mutant (delV595, P631fs/19, or R594Q) constructs were co-transfected into COS-7 cells with GAL4-tagged C terminus KvLQT1-WT or -mutant construct (Fig. 4A). Western blot analyses of whole-cell supernatants demonstrated that these constructs expressed proteins at a similar level (Fig. 4B). To evaluate the binding of each subunit, we measured the amount of Myc-tagged proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-GAL4 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4, B and C).

Active-sites or functionally relevant regions are evolutionarily more stable relative to the remainder of a protein structure and provide an alternative means to identify potential functional similarity between proteins. We recently developed the FAST-NMR methodology to discover biochemical functions or functional hypotheses of proteins of unknown function by experimentally identifying ligand binding sites. FAST-NMR utilizes our CPASS software and database to assign a function based on a similarity in the structure and sequence of ligand binding sites between proteins of known and unknown function.The PrgI protein from Salmonella typhimurium forms the needle complex in the type III secretion system (T3SS). A FAST-NMR screen identified a similarity between the ligand binding sites of PrgI and the Bcl-2 apoptosis protein Bcl-xL. These ligand binding sites correlate with known protein-protein binding interfaces required for oligomerization. Both proteins form membrane pores through this oligomerization to release effector proteins to stimulate cell death. Structural analysis indicates an overlap between the PrgI structure and the pore forming motif of Bcl-xL. A sequence alignment indicates conservation between the PrgI and Bcl-xL ligand binding sites and pore formation regions. This active-site similarity was then used to verify that chelerythrine, a known Bcl-xL inhibitor, also binds PrgI.A structural and functional relationship between the bacterial T3SS and eukaryotic apoptosis was identified using our FAST-NMR ligand affinity screen in combination with a bioinformatic analysis based on our CPASS program. A similarity between PrgI and Bcl-xL is not readily apparent using traditional global sequence and structure analysis, but was only identified because of conservation in ligand binding sites. These results demonstrate the unique opportunity that ligand-binding sites provide for the identification of functional relationships when global sequence and structural information is limited."
https://openalex.org/W2074764543,"Along with physical luminance, the perceived brightness is known to depend on the spatial structure of the stimulus. Often it is assumed that neural computation of the brightness is based on the analysis of luminance borders of the stimulus. However, this has not been tested directly. We introduce a new variant of the psychophysical reverse-correlation or classification image method to estimate and localize the physical features of the stimuli which correlate with the perceived brightness, using a brightness-matching task. We derive classification images for the illusory Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet stimulus and a ""real"" uniform step stimulus. For both stimuli, classification images reveal a positive peak at the stimulus border, along with a negative peak at the background, but are flat at the center of the stimulus, suggesting that brightness is determined solely by the border information. Features in the perceptually completed area in the Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet do not contribute to its brightness, nor could we see low-frequency boosting, which has been offered as an explanation for the illusion. Tuning of the classification image profiles changes remarkably little with stimulus size. This supports the idea that only certain spatial scales are used for computing the brightness of a surface."
https://openalex.org/W2128442842,"Background Previous theoretical work on parental decisions in biparental care has emphasized the role of the conflict between evolutionary interests of parents in these decisions. A prominent prediction from this work is that parents should compensate for decreases in each other's effort, but only partially so. However, experimental tests that manipulate parents and measure their responses fail to confirm this prediction. At the same time, the process of parental decision making has remained unexplored theoretically. We develop a model to address the discrepancy between experiments and the theoretical prediction, and explore how assuming different decision making processes changes the prediction from the theory. Model Description We assume that parents make decisions in behavioral time. They have a fixed time budget, and allocate it between two parental tasks: provisioning the offspring and defending the nest. The proximate determinant of the allocation decisions are parents' behavioral objectives. We assume both parents aim to maximize the offspring production from the nest. Experimental manipulations change the shape of the nest production function. We consider two different scenarios for how parents make decisions: one where parents communicate with each other and act together (the perfect family), and one where they do not communicate, and act independently (the almost perfect family). Conclusions/Significance The perfect family model is able to generate all the types of responses seen in experimental studies. The kind of response predicted depends on the nest production function, i.e. how parents' allocations affect offspring production, and the type of experimental manipulation. In particular, we find that complementarity of parents' allocations promotes matching responses. In contrast, the relative responses do not depend on the type of manipulation in the almost perfect family model. These results highlight the importance of the interaction between nest production function and how parents make decisions, factors that have largely been overlooked in previous models."

INTRODUCTIONThe helix bundle motif is a common molecular architecture in proteins (1.Kamtekar S. Hecht M.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).

Classic examples of the helix bundle structure include the N-terminal (NT) domains of apoE (2.Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and apoA-I (3.Ajees A.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Mishra V.K. Hussain M.M. Murthy H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2126-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) as well as apolipophorin III (4.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the case of apoE and apoA-I, the helix bundle motifs are present within the context of a larger protein structure. In each of these examples the bundle exists as an up-and-down series of amphipathic α-helices wherein the hydrophobic face of each helical segment orients toward the interior of the bundle. At the same time, the polar face of the amphipathic helices is directed toward the exterior of the bundle. In this way the globular structure is stabilized by hydrophobic helix-helix interactions and is conferred with water solubility through projection of polar and charged amino acid side chains toward the aqueous milieu. Upon interaction with lipid surfaces, the helix bundle is postulated to unfurl, adopting an extended open conformation that promotes interaction between the hydrophobic faces of amphipathic helices and the lipid surface. Essentially, lipid binding of helix bundle apolipoproteins substitutes helix-helix contacts in the bundle for helix-lipid contacts that stabilize the lipid-bound state.In 2001 a new apolipoprotein, termed apoA-V, was reported that profoundly affects plasma TG levels (5.Pennacchio L.A.

Structural studies revealed that apoA-V is a two-domain protein (7.Beckstead J.A. Wong K. Gupta V. Wan C.P. Cook V.R. Weinberg R.B. Weers P.M. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15484-15489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that its N-terminal 146 residues adopt a helix bundle structure in the absence of lipid (8.Wong K. Beckstead J.A. Lee D. Weers P.M. Guigard E. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8768-8774Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Truncated apoA-V proteins in this size range have been reported in human subjects with severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) (9.Marçais C. Verges B. Charrière S. Pruneta V. Merlin M. Billon S. Perrot L. Drai J. Sassolas A. Pennacchio L.A. Fruchart-Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Durlach V. Moulin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10.Priore Oliva C. Pisciotta L. Li Volti G. Sambataro M.P. Cantafora A. Bellocchio A. Catapano A. Tarugi P. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One of these truncation mutants, Q139X apoA-V, does not associate with VLDL or HDL in circulation (9.Marçais C. Verges B. Charrière S. Pruneta V. Merlin M. Billon S. Perrot L. Drai J. Sassolas A. Pennacchio L.A. Fruchart-Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Durlach V. Moulin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). By contrast, full-length apoA-V is found on both of these lipoprotein classes in normolipidemic subjects (11.O'Brien P.J. Alborn W.E. Sloan J.H. Ulmer M. Boodhoo A. Knierman M.D. Schultze A.E. Konrad R.J. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Insofar as these individuals had no other common mutations known to cause HTG, it is likely that a lipid-binding defect in truncated apoA-V is associated with the HTG phenotype. To address this mechanistically, the lipid interaction properties of recombinant apoA-V(1–146) were investigated. The results obtained provide a molecular explanation for the correlation between naturally occurring C-terminal (CT) truncations in apoA-V and HTG.DISCUSSIONExchangeable apolipoproteins can transfer among lipoproteins in plasma and, in the process, likely exist in a lipid-poor state. The helix bundle motif is postulated to facilitate this exchange by promoting apolipoprotein solubility in both polar and nonpolar environments. The size of potential lipid substrate particles is an important factor regulating apolipoprotein transfer in the circulation (25.Connelly P.W. Kuksis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 666: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ApoA-V is an exchangeable apolipoprotein that in humans, is found on chylomicrons, VLDL, and HDL (11.O'Brien P.J. Alborn W.E. Sloan J.H. Ulmer M. Boodhoo A. Knierman M.D. Schultze A.E. Konrad R.J. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Presumably, apoA-V transfers among the different lipoprotein populations, as proposed by Nelbach et al. (21.Nelbach L. Shu X. Konrad R.J. Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 572-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The NT domain of apoA-V adopts a helix bundle conformation in the absence of lipid, and this may facilitate exchange between lipoprotein particles. In the present studies, we characterized the ability of this domain to bind to particles of various lipid compositions and sizes, including DMPC vesicles, modified LDL, and HDL and VLDL from apoa5−/− mice, in an effort to gain insight into its intrinsic lipid binding properties.Compared with other well studied exchangeable apolipoproteins, full-length apoA-V is unique in that it is not soluble at neutral pH in a lipid-free state (6.van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H. Reitsma P.H. Boers W. Chamuleau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44512-44520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). When bound to lipid, however, apoA-V is soluble at physiological pH. This suggests that during transfer between lipoprotein particles in circulation, apoA-V may exist in a lipid-poor rather than lipid-free state. The ability of apoA-V(1–146) to form discoidal complexes with phospholipid in the size range of nascent HDL particles may be physiologically relevant because apoA-V exchange between lipoprotein particles in circulation may require transient existence in a lipid core-depleted particle.Upon lipid interaction, it appears that apoA-V(1–146) undergoes a conformational change, as judged by an increase in α-helix secondary structure content and altered solvent exposure of reporter Trp residues. The increase in helix content upon lipid interaction is similar to that of other exchangeable apolipoproteins, such as apoA-I (26.Wald J.H. Krul E.S. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20037-20043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amphipathic helix bundle motif in the lipid-free state adopts a globular conformation wherein the hydrophobic faces of its helices orient toward the center of the bundle (27.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon lipid association, the protein is predicted to adopt an open conformation, where the hydrophobic faces of its amphipathic helices interact directly with the lipid surface (27.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Linear infrared dichroism experiments of apoA-V(1–146)·DMPC disks are consistent with a model wherein the helices orient perpendicular with respect to the DMPC bilayer fatty acyl chains. This indicates that, in the lipid-bound state, apoA-V(1–146) adopts a belt-like conformation around the perimeter of the particle, as described for other exchangeable apolipoproteins (28.Raussens V.

Each single Trp variant reported on a specific region within apoA-V(1–146). Certain Trp residues were predicted to reside in a linker region between amphipathic helices or on the polar face of an amphipathic helix, whereas the others were predicted to reside on the nonpolar face of amphipathic helices. In keeping with these predictions, only variants with Trp predicted to reside on the hydrophobic face of amphipathic helices showed a blue shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission between alternate lipid-free and lipid-bound states. This suggests that, when presented with a suitable lipid surface, the helix bundle opens, exposing the bundle interior.To further characterize conformational adaptations in apoA-V(1–146), the relative exposure of various regions within the NT domain were investigated as a function of lipid binding. In Trp fluorescence quenching studies, it was observed that single Trp apoA-V(1–146) variants with their Trp predicted to be on the nonpolar face of amphipathic helices gave rise to the lowest Ksv values, suggesting that these regions of the protein maintain close contact with the lipid surface. For example, Trp97 is predicted to reside in a linker region between two amphipathic helices. Consistent with this, Trp97 apoA-V(1–146) fluorescence emission was highly quenched by acrylamide but less so by KI. This could be due to electrostatic repulsion of KI by negatively charged residues located near Trp97.The ability of apoA-V(1–146) to initiate contact with lipid surfaces is suggested by phospholipid vesicle solubilization studies comparing truncated and full-length apoA-V. The CT domain of apoA-V has been previously shown to avidly bind lipid (7.Beckstead J.A. Wong K. Gupta V. Wan C.P. Cook V.R. Weinberg R.B. Weers P.M. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15484-15489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the absence of the CT domain, apoA-V(1–146) solubilizes DMPC at a faster rate than full-length apoA-V. This suggests that N- and C-terminal domain interactions in the intact protein modulate the lipid binding properties of apoA-V. This may be similar to interactions in apoA-I. In this apolipoprotein, the CT domain initiates lipid-binding, whereas the NT helix bundle opens up to stabilize the lipid-associated state (34.Ji Y. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11290-11297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Although DMPC solubilization assays characterize apolipoprotein-induced phospholipid vesicle disruption and reorganization, PL-C-modified LDL provides a means to assess binding to spherical lipoprotein substrates. PL-C activity generates apolipoprotein-binding sites by hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine moieties present in the surface monolayer (20.Liu H. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conversion of phosphatidylcholine into diacylglycerol destabilizes the lipoprotein particle and promotes aggregation (35.Suits A.G. Chait A. Aviram M. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 2713-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins protect LDL against PL-C-induced aggregation by forming a stable binding interaction with the modified particles (20.Liu H. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ApoA-V(1–146) binding to PL-C-treated LDL was intermediate with respect to other apolipoproteins examined. This finding is consistent with the stability properties of these apolipoproteins. At physiological pH apoA-V(1–146) is less stable than apoE3 NT (guanidine HCl denaturation midpoint of 2.0 m versus 2.5 m, respectively) (8.Wong K. Beckstead J.A. Lee D. Weers P.M. Guigard E. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8768-8774Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36.Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yet is more stable than apoA-I (1 m guanidine HCl denaturation midpoint) (37.Reijngoud D.J. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the intrinsic stability of helix bundle apolipoproteins in solution correlates directly with the ability to bind newly created sites on a spherical lipoprotein substrate (8.Wong K. Beckstead J.A. Lee D. Weers P.M. Guigard E. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8768-8774Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).The ability of apoA-V(1–146) to associate with physiologically relevant lipoproteins was assessed using VLDL and HDL isolated from apoa5 knock-out mice. Importantly, apoA-V(1–146) failed to associate with VLDL and associated sparingly with HDL. This finding is intriguing in light of the report that, unlike full-length apoA-V, apoA-V(1–146) also fails to associate with intracellular lipid droplets (38.Shu X. Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1670-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In considering the sizes of various lipid substrates, VLDL and lipid droplets are considerably larger than HDL or other lipid particles employed in this study. The data indicate that apoA-V(1–146) can associate with smaller lipid substrate particles to a limited degree but apparently lacks the ability to interact with larger lipid particles. One explanation could be related to the tighter packing of phospholipid molecules on the surface of larger particles because of their decreased radius of curvature, as compared with smaller particles (39.Tajima S. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10073-10082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Wetterau J.R. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10961-10966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tighter packing of phospholipid polar head groups enveloping a lipid core could interfere with the ability of apoA-V(1–146) to access hydrophobic surfaces and initiate binding. This aspect is obviated in the case of PL-C-modified LDL but not in the binding experiments with VLDL and HDL. In the latter case, differences in surface lipid composition and/or protein content could also influence binding of apoA-V(1–146). Regardless, it is apparent that, with natural lipoprotein substrates in vitro, apoA-V(1–146) binding is defective. Because this is not due to an intrinsic inability to bind lipid, it suggests that the CT of apoA-V modulates the lipid interaction properties of the NT domain.Naturally occurring apoA-V truncations, including Q139X (9.Marçais C. Verges B. Charrière S. Pruneta V. Merlin M. Billon S. Perrot L. Drai J. Sassolas A. Pennacchio L.A. Fruchart-Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Durlach V. Moulin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), Q148X (10.Priore Oliva C. Pisciotta L. Li Volti G. Sambataro M.P. Cantafora A. Bellocchio A. Catapano A. Tarugi P. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and Q97X (41.Priore Oliva C. Tarugi P. Calandra S. Pisciotta L. Bellocchio A. Bertolini S. Guardamagna O. Schaap F.G. Atherosclerosis. 2006; 188: 215-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), have been reported in human subjects and are associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia. The distribution of apoA-V in ultracentrifugally isolated lipoprotein classes was evaluated in several carriers of the Q139X truncation mutation and demonstrated that the truncated form of the protein does not associate with plasma lipoproteins and is found only in the lipid-poor d > 1.21 g/ml fraction. Because the Q139X apoA-V mutation nomenclature includes the 23-amino acid signal peptide, the mature protein is actually 116 amino acids in length. Although apoA-V(1–146) is longer than these natural mutants, binding studies with natural lipoproteins recapitulate observations in human plasma of individuals carrying these mutant forms of apoA-V.The present findings provide a potential explanation for the HTG observed in patients with truncated apoA-V. The lack of a CT domain alters lipid binding activity such that truncated apoA-V fails to effectively bind to circulating lipoproteins, particularly TG-rich particles. Current hypotheses suggest apoA-V interactions with heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (42.Lookene A. Beckstead J.A. Nilsson S. Olivecrona G. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25383-25387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 43.Merkel M. Loeffler B. Kluger M. Fabig N. Geppert G. Pennacchio L.A. Laatsch A. Heeren J. J. Biol.

Davies B.S. Gin P. Weinstein M.M. Farber E. Qiao X. Peale F. Bunting S. Walzem R.L. Wong J.S. Blaner W.S. Ding Z.M. Melford K. Wongsiriroj N. Shu X. de Sauvage F. Ryan R.O. Fong L.G. Bensadoun A. Young S.G. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) indirectly enhances lipoprotein lipase activity to facilitate hydrolysis of VLDL- associated TG. The data from Nilsson et al. (45.Nilsson S.K. Lookene A. Beckstead J.A. Gliemann J. Ryan R.O. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indicate apoA-V also serves as a ligand for endocytic receptors of the LDL receptor family, where it is possible that apoA-V may have an important role in clearance of VLDL remnants. The putative binding site on apoA-V for lipoprotein lipase activity enhancement and cell surface molecule interactions resides within the CT domain of the protein. The absence of this binding site most likely contributes to defective hydrolysis and clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins. In any case, association of apoA-V with TG-rich lipoproteins is presumably required for manifestation of these effects. If a CT truncated apoA-V is unable to bind larger, TG-rich lipoproteins, then the resulting apoA-V-deficient particles could potentially have an increased plasma residence time, contributing to HTG. Thus, it may be that defective lipid binding arising from the lack of a CT domain precludes binding to circulating lipoproteins, thereby preventing potential TG lowering effects attributed to full-length apoA-V. INTRODUCTIONThe helix bundle motif is a common molecular architecture in proteins (1.Kamtekar S. Hecht M.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Exchangeable apolipoproteins (apo) 4The abbreviations used are: apoapolipoproteinHTGhypertriglyceridemiaDMPCdimyristoylphosphatidylcholineNTN terminusCTC terminusHDLhigh density lipidATR-FTIRattenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopyVLDLvery low density lipidPL-Cphospholipase CTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineTGtriacylglycerol. are known to adopt this conformation, which supports their dual existence in alternate lipid-free and lipid-bound states. Classic examples of the helix bundle structure include the N-terminal (NT) domains of apoE (2.Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and apoA-I (3.Ajees A.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Mishra V.K. Hussain M.M. Murthy H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2126-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) as well as apolipophorin III (4.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the case of apoE and apoA-I, the helix bundle motifs are present within the context of a larger protein structure. In each of these examples the bundle exists as an up-and-down series of amphipathic α-helices wherein the hydrophobic face of each helical segment orients toward the interior of the bundle. At the same time, the polar face of the amphipathic helices is directed toward the exterior of the bundle. In this way the globular structure is stabilized by hydrophobic helix-helix interactions and is conferred with water solubility through projection of polar and charged amino acid side chains toward the aqueous milieu. Upon interaction with lipid surfaces, the helix bundle is postulated to unfurl, adopting an extended open conformation that promotes interaction between the hydrophobic faces of amphipathic helices and the lipid surface. Essentially, lipid binding of helix bundle apolipoproteins substitutes helix-helix contacts in the bundle for helix-lipid contacts that stabilize the lipid-bound state.In 2001 a new apolipoprotein, termed apoA-V, was reported that profoundly affects plasma TG levels (5.Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 6.van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G.

Structural studies revealed that apoA-V is a two-domain protein (7.Beckstead J.A. Wong K. Gupta V. Wan C.P. Cook V.R. Weinberg R.B. Weers P.M. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15484-15489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that its N-terminal 146 residues adopt a helix bundle structure in the absence of lipid (8.Wong K. Beckstead J.A. Lee D. Weers P.M. Guigard E. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8768-8774Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Truncated apoA-V proteins in this size range have been reported in human subjects with severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) (9.Marçais C. Verges B. Charrière S. Pruneta V. Merlin M. Billon S. Perrot L. Drai J. Sassolas A. Pennacchio L.A. Fruchart-Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Durlach V. Moulin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10.Priore Oliva C. Pisciotta L. Li Volti G. Sambataro M.P. Cantafora A. Bellocchio A. Catapano A. Tarugi P. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One of these truncation mutants, Q139X apoA-V, does not associate with VLDL or HDL in circulation (9.Marçais C. Verges B. Charrière S. Pruneta V. Merlin M. Billon S. Perrot L. Drai J. Sassolas A. Pennacchio L.A. Fruchart-Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Durlach V. Moulin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). By contrast, full-length apoA-V is found on both of these lipoprotein classes in normolipidemic subjects (11.O'Brien P.J. Alborn W.E. Sloan J.H. Ulmer M. Boodhoo A. Knierman M.D. Schultze A.E. Konrad R.J. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Insofar as these individuals had no other common mutations known to cause HTG, it is likely that a lipid-binding defect in truncated apoA-V is associated with the HTG phenotype. To address this mechanistically, the lipid interaction properties of recombinant apoA-V(1–146) were investigated. The results obtained provide a molecular explanation for the correlation between naturally occurring C-terminal (CT) truncations in apoA-V and HTG. The helix bundle motif is a common molecular architecture in proteins (1.Kamtekar S. Hecht M.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).
