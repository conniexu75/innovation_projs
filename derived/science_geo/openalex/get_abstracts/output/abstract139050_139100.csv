https://openalex.org/W1996097396,"The synthesis of massive arrays of monodispersed carbon nanotubes that are self-oriented on patterned porous silicon and plain silicon substrates is reported. The approach involves chemical vapor deposition, catalytic particle size control by substrate design, nanotube positioning by patterning, and nanotube self-assembly for orientation. The mechanisms of nanotube growth and self-orientation are elucidated. The well-ordered nanotubes can be used as electron field emission arrays. Scaling up of the synthesis process should be entirely compatible with the existing semiconductor processes, and should allow the development of nanotube devices integrated into silicon technology."

An investigation was performed to determine whether stem cells are restricted to produce specific cell types, namely, those from the tissue in which they reside. After transplantation into irradiated hosts, genetically labeled neural stem cells were found to produce a variety of blood cell types including myeloid and lymphoid cells as well as early hematopoietic cells. Thus, neural stem cells appear to have a wider differentiation potential than previously thought."

These storm-induced events were dated by radiocarbon, and the age of laminae that are less than 200 years old matches the historic record of El Nino events. From about 15,000 to about 7000 calendar years before the present, the periodicity of clastic deposition is greater than or equal to 15 years; thereafter, there is a progressive increase in frequency to periodicities of 2 to 8.5 years. This is the modern El Nino periodicity, which was established about 5000 calendar years before the present. This may reflect the onset of a steeper zonal sea surface temperature gradient, which was driven by enhanced trade winds."

Discovered first in 1817 by Fraunhofer, the coating of lenses became standard practice in the 1930s. In spite of intensive research, broad-band antireflection coatings are still limited by the lack of materials with low refractive indices. A method based on the phase separation of a macromolecular liquid to generate nanoporous polymer films is demonstrated that creates surfaces with high optical transmission."

https://openalex.org/W2097324875,"The origin of new morphological characters is a long-standing problem in evolutionary biology. Novelties arise through changes in development, but the nature of these changes is largely unknown. In butterflies, eyespots have evolved as new pattern elements that develop from special organizers called foci. Formation of these foci is associated with novel expression patterns of the Hedgehog signaling protein, its receptor Patched, the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus, and the engrailed target gene that break the conserved compartmental restrictions on this regulatory circuit in insect wings. Redeployment of preexisting regulatory circuits may be a general mechanism underlying the evolution of novelties."

To evaluate effects on atherosclerosis, transgenic mice with liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI (SR-BI Tg mice) have been crossed onto LDL receptor-deficient backgrounds. To induce atherosclerosis in a setting of moderate hypercholesterolemia, heterozygous LDL receptor-deficient mice (LDLR1) were fed a high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet, and homozygous LDL receptor knock-outs (LDLR0) were fed a high fat/cholesterol diet. LDLR1/SR-BI Tg mice showed decreases in VLDL, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and a significant 80% decrease in mean lesion area in the aortic root compared with LDLR1 mice (female LDLR1 74, 120 μm2 versus LDLR1/SR-BI Tg 12, 667 μm2; male 25, 747 μm2 versus 5, 448 μm2, respectively). LDLR0/SR-BI Tg mice showed decreased LDL and HDL cholesterol but increased VLDL cholesterol and no significant difference in extent of atherosclerosis compared with LDLR0 mice.

Mice with decreased expression of SR-BI as a result of targeted gene mutation have increased HDL cholesterol levels and decreased selective uptake of HDL CE in the liver (6Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L.

The enhancement of reverse cholesterol transport by SR-BI may be related both to increased selective uptake of CE in the liver, as well as increased flux of free cholesterol between HDL and cell membranes (10Ji Y.

The hepatic membrane SR-BI protein levels were shown to be about 12-fold higher compared with control littermates (9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of hepatic overexpression of SR-BI on the development of atherosclerosis. LDL receptor knock-out mice were chosen for study because they represent an atherosclerosis-susceptible model of the common human genetic disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (12Goldstein J.L. Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1981-2030Google Scholar). Accordingly, the SR-BI transgene was bred onto the LDL receptor-deficient background (13Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), and the mice were challenged with high fat, high cholesterol diets. To evaluate lesion development in the context of a moderate level of hypercholesterolemia, studies were carried out in LDLR1 mice fed a high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet and in LDLR0 mice fed a high fat/cholesterol diet.RESULTSPlasma lipids and lipoproteins were characterized in LDLR1/SR-BI transgenic mice and in LDLR0/SR-BI Tg mice, on chow, high fat/cholesterol, or high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diets (TableI). Compared with LDLR1 controls, LDLR1/SR-BI Tg mice showed significant decreases in total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, and apoB on all three diets but no difference in triglyceride level. Similarly, compared with LDLR0 mice, LDLR0/SR-BI Tg mice showed decreases in TC on chow and high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diets; however, there was no difference of TC on the high fat/cholesterol diet. On the three diets, apoB levels tended to decrease in LDLR0/SR-BI Tg compared with LDLR0 mice, but none of these changes were significant. In LDLR0/SR-B1 Tg mice HDL cholesterol was dramatically decreased on all diets. Plasma triglyceride levels were increased in LDLR0/SR-BI Tg mice on chow and high fat/cholesterol diets but not on the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet.Table IPlasma lipid concentration of SR-BI Tg mice in LDLRKO backgroundSR-BI transgeneChow dietHigh fat/cholesterol dietHigh fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet−+−+−+LDLR1 miceSR-BI TgTC73 ± 511 ± 2ap < 0.001.147 ± 11100 ± 10ap < 0.001.182 ± 1457 ± 8ap < 0.001.TG68 ± 558 ± 4105 ± 10102 ± 2241 ± 536 ± 2HDLC48 ± 21.0 ± 0.1ap < 0.001.72 ± 41.0 ± 0.4ap < 0.001.20 ± 21.9 ± 0.4ap < 0.001.Non-HDL25 ± 410 ± 2bp < 0.01.75 ± 1090 ± 5cp < 0.05.162 ± 1555 ± 7ap < 0.001.ApoB59 ± 435 ± 5bp < 0.01.121 ± 1052 ± 3ap < 0.001.144 ± 1295 ± 13cp < 0.05.LDLR0 miceSR-BI TgTC104 ± 252 ± 3ap < 0.001.382 ± 10338 ± 281051, 735739, 491TG75 ± 5182 ± 20ap < 0.001.61 ± 5156 ± 29bp < 0.01.344, 278376, 257HDLC48 ± 21.4 ± 0.4ap < 0.001.86 ± 24.3 ± 0.2ap < 0.001.12, 81.1, 2.0Non-HDL54 ± 250 ± 4296 ± 11333 ± 281039, 727738, 489ApoB144 ± 2497 ± 14276 ± 38227 ± 20951, 1436899, 964The values are expressed as mg/dl for total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol (HDLC), and μg/ml for apoB, respectively.

Open table in a new tab To further characterize the changes in plasma lipoprotein levels, FPLC was carried out on pooled plasma samples. Fig.1 A shows the profiles obtained in LDLR1 mice, with and without the SR-BI transgene, on the three different diets. HDL cholesterol levels were markedly reduced on all three diets. However, the response of VLDL and LDL cholesterol was diet-dependent. On the chow diet, LDL cholesterol was reduced in LDLR1/SR-B1 Tg mice. On the high fat/cholesterol diet, VLDL cholesterol was increased, whereas LDL cholesterol was unchanged. On the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet, both VLDL and LDL cholesterol were decreased in LDLR1/SR-B1 Tg mice compared with LDLR1 mice.Generally parallel but more exaggerated VLDL and LDL responses were obtained when the SR-B1 transgene was expressed in the LDLR0 background (Fig. 1 B). On chow LDL cholesterol was reduced in LDLR0/SR-B1 Tg mice compared with LDLR0 mice, and there appeared also to be a small increase in VLDL cholesterol. On the high fat/cholesterol diet, VLDL was increased, but LDL cholesterol was decreased in LDLR0/SR-B1 Tg mice compared with control. On the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet, both VLDL and LDL cholesterol were lower in LDLR0/SR-B1 Tg mice compared with LDLR0 mice. In summary, SR-BI expression lowered HDL and LDL cholesterol in LDLR1 and LDLR0 backgrounds on all diets (with the exception of the high fat/cholesterol diet in LDLR1 animals where LDL was unchanged). In contrast, VLDL cholesterol was increased on chow or high fat/cholesterol diets but decreased on the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet.To evaluate changes in the plasma apolipoproteins, SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on centrifugally isolated plasma lipoproteins, prepared from pooled plasma (Fig. 2). Expression of the SR-BI transgene resulted in a marked decrease in apoA-I on both LDL receptor-deficient backgrounds, in response to all three diets. The changes in apoB in LDL and VLDL tended to parallel the effects on LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels. Thus, in LDLR1/SR-B1 Tg mice, apoB was decreased in LDL on chow or high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diets; in the former case apoB100 was reduced, whereas in the latter case, apoB48 was reduced (Fig. 2, A and C). In the LDLR0 background, LDL apoB was decreased on chow and unchanged on high fat/cholesterol and high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diets as a result of SR-BI expression (Fig. 2, D–F). In contrast, VLDL apoB was increased on chow and high fat/cholesterol diet but decreased on the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet. In addition, VLDL and HDL apoE were decreased on the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet on the SR-BI Tg background (Fig. 2, C and F).Figure 2SDS-PAGE of isolated lipoproteins of SR-BI Tg mice in LDLRKO background on different diets. The pooled plasmas of female mice (collected after 4–5 h fasting, n = 4–6 for group) on chow, high fat/cholesterol, and high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diets were used. Lipoproteins were isolated by sequential density centrifugation (Beckman, OptimaTM TL Ultracentrifuge, rotor; TLA 100.4), 1.006–1.019 for VLDL/intermediate density lipoproteins, 1.019–1.055 for LDL, and 1.055–1.210 for HDL from 200 μl of pooled plasma. The samples corresponding to 15–20 μl of plasma (A–E and HDL fraction in F) and 6 μl of plasma (VLDL/intermediate density lipoproteins and LDL fractions in F) were loaded onto reducing 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Similar results were obtained in two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The principal goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of SR-B1 overexpression on atherogenesis. Based on our prior experience (18Masucci-Magoulas L. Goldberg I.J. Bisgaier C.L. Serajuddin H. Francone O.L. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we decided to evaluate the extent of atherosclerosis in mice with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Thus, we chose LDLR1 mice fed the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet and LDLR0 mice fed the high fat/cholesterol diet for 12 weeks; we also studied a small number of LDLR0 animals on the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet. On a high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet, LDLR1/SR-BI Tg showed an 80% decrease in mean atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic root compared with LDLR1 mice (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, LDLR0/SR-BI Tg showed no significant difference in extent of atherosclerosis compared with LDLR0 mice after 3 months on the high fat/cholesterol diet (Fig. 3 C). LDLR0/SR-BI Tg were also challenged with a high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet for 6 weeks. The atherosclerotic lesion area was reduced about 60% (Fig.3 B). These results show that in LDL receptor-deficient mice the SR-BI transgene decreased the area of atherosclerosis on a high/fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet but had no effect on a high fat/cholesterol diet.Figure 3Extent of atherosclerosis in the proximal aorta of SR-BI Tg mice in LDL receptor-deficient backgrounds. A, a high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet was administrated to the LDLR1 and LDLR1/SR-BI Tg mice for approximately 12 weeks. Then they were sacrificed, and the heart and proximal aorta were removed. Sequential sections 10-μm-thick were made with cryostat and stained with Oil Red O. The mean area of red color lipid staining per section per animal from five sections was determined for each individual animal. The mean atherosclerosis areas are: female, 74,120 ± 18,648 μm2 for LDLR1 versus 12,667 ± 3,471 μm2 for LDLR1/SR-BI Tg, p < 0.02; male, 25,747 ± 1,616 μm2 versus5,448 ± 2,098 μm2, p < 0.001, respectively (mean ± S.E.).

As reported previously (19Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), female mice tended to have more severe atherosclerosis than males. In contrast, there was no relationship between the extent of atherosclerosis and HDL cholesterol levels (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Correlations between VLDL plus LDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis area (A) and HDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis area (B).Individual values shown are SR-BI Tg mice in LDLRKO (i.e.LDLR1 or LDLR0) background and control LDLRKO (LDLR1 or LDLR0).

These diet/genotype combinations were chosen because they induce moderate elevations in total plasma cholesterol levels (i.e. 200–400 mg/dl) and a lipoprotein profile not dissimilar to that present in humans. The atherosclerosis results were highly correlated with effects of SR-BI overexpression on levels of VLDL plus LDL cholesterol (Fig. 4 A), which were modified by the diet. Although SR-BI overexpression dramatically lowered HDL levels irrespective of diet and LDL receptor genotype, this did not appear to be a major determinant of atherosclerosis (Fig. 4 B). Because VLDL+LDL cholesterol was decreased on the low fat chow diet in both LDLR1 and LDLR0 mice expressing the SR-BI transgene, these studies suggest that the therapeutic overexpression of hepatic SR-BI could be anti-atherogenic on a fat-restricted diet.A major effect of SR-BI overexpression was the lowering of LDL cholesterol and apoB levels, including both apoB100 and apoB48 (Fig.2). This was seen in LDLR2 (9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and LDLR1 backgrounds on chow and high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diets and in LDLR0 background on chow diet. However, effects on VLDL cholesterol and apoB were more variable. VLDL cholesterol was slightly increased on the chow diet, markedly increased on the high fat/cholesterol diet, and decreased on the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet. The mechanisms underlying these complex effects are uncertain. Although SR-BI has been shown to bind native LDL (11Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not known if this leads to LDL uptake and degradation. It is tempting to suggest that the LDL lowering effects of SR-BI overexpression is related to increased removal from the circulation either of LDL itself or its precursors, i.e. VLDL remnants. A possible role of SR-BI in mediating selective uptake of CE from VLDL remnants or LDL could also potentially be involved in lowering the cholesterol content of these fractions. In contrast, the increase in VLDL cholesterol, apoB, and triglycerides that occurred on the high fat/cholesterol diet may have reflected increased VLDL secretion, perhaps due to increased hepatic uptake of fatty acids (e.g.in esterified form) by SR-BI; this effect may be exaggerated by the high fat content of the diet. The failure to observe this response on the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet is likely related to the bile salt component.Although the use of the high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet has been criticized for its possible inflammatory effects (20Breslow J.L. Science. 1996; 272: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), it has been extensively used as an experimental tool to evaluate atherosclerosis in the resistant mouse model (19Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin.

Ivandic B. Welch C. Castellani L. Reue K. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1406-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that there was a continuous correlation of atherosclerotic lesion area and plasma cholesterol levels irrespective of the diet employed, suggesting that effects of the bile salt component on atherosclerosis are primarily mediated by changes in the plasma lipoproteins (Fig.4 A). The bile salt in the diet results in down-regulation of the rate-limiting step (7-α-hydroxylase) in bile salt biosynthesis. The increase in VLDL and LDL levels that occurs in LDLR0 mice on this diet has been shown to be due to increased VLDL secretion and LDL production (13Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar) and to be ameliorated by overexpression of 7-α hydroxylase (25Spady D.S. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M.N. Meidell R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is interesting that SR-BI overexpression resulted in the appearance of SR-BI in the bile canaliculus (8Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We speculate that SR-BI plays a role analogous to 7-α hydroxylase overexpression, leading to an increased mobilization of hepatic cholesterol into bile and compensating for the decreased activity of this enzyme in response to the bile salt containing diet.The finding that the outcome of atherosclerosis studies in SR-BI Tg mice is predominantly influenced by effects on VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels, although unexpected, is consistent with earlier mouse atherosclerosis studies. Thus, Young and co-workers (26Veniant M.M. Pierotti V. Newland D. Cham C.M. Sanan D.A. Walzem R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) found a high correlation between extent of atherosclerosis and plasma total or non-HDL cholesterol levels in mice with different induced mutations of apoB. In contrast to these findings, reduction of HDL levels by apoA-I knock-out or cholesteryl ester transfer protein overexpression, while modifying the extent of lesions in some models, does not have a profound impact on atherosclerosis (27Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Foger B. Vaisman B.L. Paigen B. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S.

Perhaps the lack of predominance of HDL effects in SR-BI Tg mice is related to opposing actions, i.e. the fractional clearance of HDL cholesterol by the liver is increased while HDL levels and pool size are decreased (9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This is reminiscent of the effects of cholesteryl ester transfer protein expression, which also lowers HDL while stimulating the clearance of HDL CE by the liver (30Osono Y. Woollett L.A. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4114-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our transgenic mice have marked 10–40-fold overexpression of SR-BI in the liver (9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is possible that moderate overexpression would result in a different spectrum of lipoprotein changes, and this merits further investigation.The present results showing decreased atherosclerosis suggest that hepatic overexpression of SR-BI or its human homolog could have therapeutic benefits. The lowering of the atherogenic lipoprotein fraction, i.e. VLDL+LDL cholesterol and apoB levels was seen on chow in both LDLR1 and LDLR0 mice. Thus, this therapy could work independent of LDL receptor activity and could be synergistic with statins. In the context of a low fat diet, hepatic SR-BI overexpression could potentially provide a method for lowering LDL cholesterol in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI),1 a member of the CD36 gene family, was recently shown to bind HDL in a specific fashion and to mediate the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters (CE) in cells and tissues (i.e. the uptake of CE from HDL without degradation of HDL protein (1Acton S.

Mice with decreased expression of SR-BI as a result of targeted gene mutation have increased HDL cholesterol levels and decreased selective uptake of HDL CE in the liver (6Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L.

Overexpression of SR-BI results in decreased HDL cholesterol, increased selective uptake of HDL CE in the liver, and an increase in biliary cholesterol content, suggesting an enhancement of reverse cholesterol transport (8Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

The enhancement of reverse cholesterol transport by SR-BI may be related both to increased selective uptake of CE in the liver, as well as increased flux of free cholesterol between HDL and cell membranes (10Ji Y.

Here we show that MMP-13 expression is induced in normal human skin fibroblasts cultured within three-dimensional collagen gel resulting in production and proteolytic activation of MMP-13. Induction of MMP-13 mRNAs by collagen gel was potently inhibited by blocking antibodies against α1 and α2 integrin subunits and augmented by activating antibody against β1 integrin subunit, indicating that both α1β1 and α2β1 integrins mediate the MMP-13-inducing cellular signal generated by three-dimensional collagen. Collagen-related induction of MMP-13 expression was dependent on tyrosine kinase activity, as it was abolished by treatment of fibroblasts with tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A. Contact of fibroblasts to three-dimensional collagen resulted in simultaneous activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in three distinct subgroups: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2, Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38. Induction of MMP-13 expression was inhibited by treatment of fibroblasts with a specific p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, whereas blocking the ERK1,2 pathway (Raf/MEK1,2/ERK1,2) by PD 98059, a selective inhibitor of MEK1,2 activation potently augmented MMP-13 expression. Furthermore, specific activation of ERK1,2 pathway by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate markedly suppressed MMP-13 expression in dermal fibroblasts in collagen gel. These results show that collagen-dependent induction of MMP-13 in dermal fibroblasts requires p38 activity, and is inhibited by activation of ERK1,2. Therefore, the balance between the activity of ERK1,2 and p38 MAPK pathways appears to be crucial in regulation of MMP-13 expression in dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that p38 MAPK may serve as a target for selective inhibition of collagen degradation, e.g. in chronic dermal ulcers.

Controlled degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM)1 is essential in physiologic situations involving connective tissue remodeling, such as tissue morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. On the other hand, excessive breakdown of connective tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, periodontitis, autoimmune blistering disorders of skin, and dermal photoaging, as well as in invasion and metastasis of tumor cells (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of structurally related zinc-dependent endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all ECM components, and they apparently play an important role in ECM remodeling in the physiologic and pathologic situations mentioned above. At present, human MMP gene family contains 16 members, which can be divided into subgroups of collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, membrane-type MMPs, and novel MMPs based on their structure and substrate specificity (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal- Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar, 2Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Members of the collagenase subgroup of MMPs, i.e.collagenase-1 (MMP-1), collagenase-2 (MMP-8), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13), are the principal neutral proteinases capable of degrading native fibrillar collagens in the extracellular space. They all cleave type I, II, and III collagens at a specific site generating 3/4 N-terminal and 1/4 C-terminal fragments, which rapidly denature in physiologic temperature and become susceptible to degradation by other MMPs, e.g. gelatinases (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal- Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar and 2Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP-13 recognizes another cleavage site in N-terminal non-helical telopeptide of type I collagen (3Krane S.M. Byrne M.H. Lemaitre V. Henriet P. Jeffrey J.J. Witter J.P. Liu X. Wu H.

In addition, MMP-13 degrades type IV, X, and XIV collagens, tenascin, fibronectin, and aggrecan core protein (7Knäuper V. Cowell S. Smith B. López-Otı́n C. O'Shea M. Morris H. Zardi L. Murphy G. J.

Apparently due to its ability to degrade an exceptionally wide range of ECM components, the physiologic expression of MMP-13 is limited to situations in which rapid and effective remodeling of collagenous ECM is required,i.e. fetal bone development and bone remodeling in adulthood (8Johansson N.

Controlled degradation of fibrillar collagens of type I and III apparently plays an important role in ECM remodeling in cutaneous wound repair. However, the expression of MMP-13 and MMP-1 in human cutaneous wounds is clearly different, as MMP-1 is expressed in migrating keratinocytes (23Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C.

In contrast, our recent observations show that MMP-13 is not expressed by keratinocytes in wound repair, although it is expressed in dermal fibroblasts in chronic cutaneous ulcers, but not during acute wound repair (13Vaalamo M. Mattila L. Johansson N. Kariniemi A.-L. KarjalainenLindsberg M.-L. Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We also noted that normal human skin fibroblasts express MMP-13 mRNAs when cultured in three-dimensional collagen gel, but not when grown in monolayer (13Vaalamo M. Mattila L. Johansson N.

In this study, we show that collagen-specific induction of MMP-13 expression by dermal fibroblasts is mediated via α1β1 and α2β1 integrins and requires tyrosine kinase activity. We also show that the contact of dermal fibroblasts with three-dimensional collagen coordinately activates three distinct classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), i.e.ERK1,2, JNK, and p38. The activity of p38 MAPK is essential for MMP-13 expression by fibroblasts in collagen gel, whereas specific inhibition of ERK1,2 pathway potently augments induction of MMP-13 expression. These results provide evidence that activity of p38 MAPK pathway plays an essential role in the activation of MMP-13 expression in fibroblasts and it may serve as a target for selective inhibition of collagen degradation, e.g. in chronic dermal ulcers.

Normal human skin fibroblast cultures were established from a punch biopsy obtained from a healthy male volunteer (age 27 years). Fibroblast cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Flow Laboratories, Irvine, United Kingdom) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Collagen gels were prepared from bovine dermal collagen, which contains 95% type I collagen and 5% type III collagen (Cellon, Strassen, France). Briefly, eight volumes of Cellon were mixed with one volume of 10× concentrated DMEM and one volume of 10× concentrated NaOH (0.05 m) in Hepes buffer (0.2m) and kept on ice. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS, mixed into neutralized Cellon solution, transferred into six-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h for collagen polymerization. Thereafter, DMEM supplemented with 1% or 10% FCS, depending on the experimental conditions, was added, the gels were detached from the sides of the wells and the incubations continued for different periods of time. As controls, fibroblasts were plated on plastic as monolayer and cultured under similar conditions as the corresponding fibroblasts in collagen gel. In the experiments involving cytokines, growth factors, C2-ceramide, or TPA, fibroblasts were first incubated for 24 h as monolayer or inside collagen gels, after which the modulators were added and the incubations continued for an additional 24 h. In experiments involving tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PKC inhibitors, MAPK inhibitors, or functional antibodies against different collagen-binding integrin subunits, these were added to the cell suspension prior to mixing it with neutralized collagen solution or plating the cells on plastic, and the incubations were continued for 48 h. In experiments involving two-dimensional collagen, cell culture dishes were coated with rat tail type I collagen (5 μg/cm2) (Sigma). Fibroblasts were released from collagen gels by brief treatment with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (type II, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 1 mmCaCl2. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using the single-step method (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA (5–20 μg) were fractionated on 0.8% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde, transferred to Zetaprobe filter (Bio-Rad) by vacuum transfer (VacuGene XL; LKB, Bromma, Sweden), and immobilized by heating at 80 °C for 30 min. The filters were prehybridized for 2 h and subsequently hybridized for 20 h with cDNAs labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random priming. For detection of MMP-13 mRNAs, we used three cDNA fragments covering altogether 1637 bp of human MMP-13 cDNA (21Johansson N. Westermarck J. Leppä S. Häkkinen L. Koivisto L. López- Otı́n C. Peltonen J. Heino J. Kähäri V.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar) and for collagenase-1 (MMP-1) mRNA, we used a 2.0-kb human cDNA (29Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M.

The [32P]cDNA/mRNA hybrids were visualized with autoradiography, quantified with densitometry, and corrected for the levels of GAPDH mRNA for each sample. The levels of MMP-13 mRNAs were also determined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using the Gene Amp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer/Roche, Branchburg, NJ). The RT reactions were performed with random hexamer primers using 1 μg of total RNA from fibroblasts cultured on plastic or in collagen gel for 48 h as a template. Subsequently, a 300-bp fragment of human MMP-13 cDNA (nucleotides 534–833) (4Freije J.M.P. Dı́ez-Itza I. Balbı́n M. Sánchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol.

Total RNA (1 μg) from HaCaT keratinocytes treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 24 h was used as a positive control (21Johansson N. Westermarck J. Leppä S. Häkkinen L. Koivisto L. López- Otı́n C.

Human skin fibroblasts were seeded inside collagen gels or on plastic and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS for 48 h. Equal aliquots of the conditioned media were concentrated and analyzed for the amount of MMP-13 by Western blotting, as described previously (21Johansson N. Westermarck J. Leppä S. Häkkinen L.

The activation of ERK1,2, JNK/SAPK, and p38 MAPK was determined by Western blotting using antibodies specific for phosphorylated, activated forms of the corresponding MAPKs (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Fibroblasts were seeded in collagen gels in DMEM with 0.5% FCS, released from gels at various time points, as described above, and lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then sonicated, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Corp.). Western blotting was performed as described previously (35Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Holmström T.H Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol.

Specific binding of antibodies was detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham). We have recently noted that MMP-13 is expressed by fibroblasts in chronic human cutaneous ulcers in vivo but not in normally healing acute dermal wounds (13Vaalamo M. Mattila L. Johansson N. Kariniemi A.-L. KarjalainenLindsberg M.-L. Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that MMP-13 mRNAs are expressed by human skin fibroblasts cultured in type I collagen gel but not by fibroblasts in monolayer cultures (13Vaalamo M. Mattila L. Johansson N. Kariniemi A.-L. KarjalainenLindsberg M.-L. Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have elucidated the signaling mechanisms mediating the collagen-dependent induction of MMP-13 expression in human skin fibroblasts. Initially, we cultured fibroblasts for 48 h on plastic, on type I collagen-coated dishes, or in collagen gels and determined the expression of MMP-13 mRNAs by Northern blot hybridizations. Marked expression of two MMP-13 transcripts of 2.0 and 2.5 kb was noted in dermal fibroblasts cultured inside collagen, whereas no MMP-13 mRNA could be detected in fibroblasts maintained in monolayer cultures on plastic or on two-dimensional collagen (Fig.1 A). In comparison, MMP-1 mRNA abundance was slightly enhanced by contact to 2-dimensional collagen and markedly up-regulated (36.5-fold) in cells maintained inside collagen (Fig. 1 A). Examination of the time dependence of MMP-13 induction showed marked expression of MMP-13 mRNAs in dermal fibroblasts 24 h after seeding the cells in collagen gel, and the induction was still detected after 72 h (data not shown). To confirm the observation that expression of MMP-13 is specifically induced in human skin fibroblasts inside collagen we determined the levels of MMP-13 mRNA by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1 B, a specific 300-bp fragment of MMP-13 cDNA was amplified when RNA from fibroblasts cultured in collagen gel for 48 h was used as a template. The same 300-bp MMP-13 cDNA fragment was amplified in RT-PCR reactions using RNA from TGF-β-treated HaCaT keratinocytes known to express high levels of MMP-13 mRNAs (21Johansson N. Westermarck J. Leppä S. Häkkinen L. Koivisto L. López- Otı́n C. Peltonen J. Heino J. Kähäri V.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). In contrast, a very low level of the same MMP-13 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using RNA from fibroblasts cultured on plastic indicating that under these conditions normal human skin fibroblasts express very low levels of MMP-13 mRNA (Fig.1 B). Next, we assayed MMP-13 production by human skin fibroblasts cultured in collagen gel or on plastic for 48 h by Western blot analysis. No detectable amounts of immunoreactive MMP-13 were produced by fibroblasts cultured in monolayer on plastic, supporting the observations above that in dermal fibroblasts in monolayer cultures the expression of MMP-13 mRNAs is very low. In contrast, a specific band with an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa was detected in conditioned media of fibroblasts cultured in collagen gel (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, this immunoreactive MMP-13 was clearly smaller in size than the 62-kDa latent MMP-13 produced by TNF-α-treated HaCaT keratinocytes, indicating that it had been proteolytically processed to active form (Fig. 1 C). No latent MMP-13 was detected in the conditioned media, indicating that all MMP-13 produced by fibroblasts in collagen gel was activated. In chronic dermal ulcers, fibroblasts are exposed to cytokines and growth factors, which have the ability to regulate the expression of several MMPs including MMP-1 (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal- Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar and 2Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). To examine the regulation of MMP-13 expression by cytokines and growth factors, dermal fibroblasts were cultured in collagen gel for 24 h to allow induction of MMP-13 expression, and were subsequently treated with IL-1β, TNF-α, or TGF-β1 for another 24 h. Interestingly, treatment of fibroblasts in collagen gels with IL-1β (5 units/ml) or TNF-α (20 ng/ml) did not markedly alter MMP-13 mRNA levels, whereas treatment with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) decreased MMP-13 mRNA levels (by 60%), as compared with the levels of untreated cells in collagen gel (Fig. 2,A and B). No MMP-13 mRNAs were detected in fibroblasts cultured in monolayer after a 24-h treatment with TNF-α, IL-1β, or TGF-β1 (Fig. 2 A). In comparison, MMP-1 mRNA levels were enhanced up to 1.8-fold by IL-1β and up to 3.2-fold by TNF-α, whereas stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) mRNA abundance was up-regulated 6.1-fold by both IL-1β and TNF-α in fibroblasts inside collagen gel (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, TGF-β1 had no marked effect on the expression of MMP-1 mRNA by fibroblasts inside collagen gels and it even slightly enhanced the abundance of MMP-3 mRNA (Fig. 2, A andB). In addition to MMP-13 and MMP-1, the mRNA levels of MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase), MMP-3, and MT1-MMP (MMP-14) were clearly up-regulated in fibroblasts cultured inside collagen gels, as compared with cells cultured in monolayer (Fig. 2 A). In accordance with our previous observations (32Lohi J. Lehti K. Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. Keski-Oja J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in fibroblasts cultured on plastic were not markedly altered by any of the treatments although a slight up-regulation by IL-1β and TNF-α was detected in fibroblasts cultured inside collagen gel (Fig. 2,A and B).

The SERCA21 gene encodes two Ca2+-transporting ATPases, SERCA2a and SERCA2b, which differ in their C-terminal sequences as a result of alternative splicing (1Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

SERCA2a is expressed at highest levels in heart, where it plays a central role in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling required for excitation/contraction coupling (reviewed in Ref. 4Langer G.A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Contraction is initiated by an increase in Ca2+concentrations around the myofibrils, which occurs as Ca2+is released from the SR or enters the cell via channels in the sarcolemma. SERCA2a pumps Ca2+ out of the cytosol and into the SR, thereby contributing to the low diastolic Ca2+levels required for relaxation and replenishing Ca2+ stores needed for the next contraction. SERCA2a serves a similar function in slow twitch skeletal muscle and is also expressed in some smooth muscles (5Lytton J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Periasamy M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the limited tissue distribution and organ-specific function of SERCA2a, SERCA2b is expressed in all tissues and it has been suggested that it plays an essential housekeeping role (1Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it undoubtedly serves some organ-specific functions as well.An important role for SERCA2a in cardiac function is well established. Recent studies have shown that the levels of SERCA2a are decreased in several animal models of cardiac hypertrophy and human heart failure (reviewed in Refs. 6Wankerl M. Schwartz K. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 7Arai M. Matsui H. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether, and to what extent, the reductions in SERCA2a levels contribute to altered contractile function. In addition, it is unclear whether there are homeostatic mechanisms within the cardiac myocyte that are capable of sensing perturbations in the levels of pump activity and adjusting its expression accordingly. These are important issues, given the observed reductions in SERCA2a mRNA and protein expression in the failing heart, which correlate well with decreased myocardial Ca2+ transport and contractile function. However, it is unclear whether the reduction in the level of SERCA2 expression and activity are a cause or a consequence of impaired cardiac function.To obtain an animal model that could be used to examine the physiological functions of SERCA2 in cardiovascular and other tissues, we used gene targeting to prepare a mouse carrying a null mutation in the SERCA2 gene. Because homozygous SERCA2 null mutants were not observed, we examined cardiovascular function and SERCA2a expression and activity in hearts of heterozygous mutants, which display no outward manifestations of a disease phenotype. These studies show that SERCA2 mRNA, protein, and activity levels are reduced in heterozygous mutants carrying a single functional copy of the SERCA2 gene, and that these reductions have a significant effect on cardiac performance.DISCUSSIONOur primary objective was to analyze the relationship between cardiac performance and the levels of SERCA2 expression and activity in heart. Because we anticipated that homozygous mutants would not survive and that it would be necessary to perform our studies using heterozygotes, a major concern, and an important issue in its own right, was whether SERCA2 levels in heart were critically dependent on the presence of two functional copies of the SERCA2 gene. Homozygous mutants were not observed, demonstrating that one or both variants of SERCA2 serve functions that are essential for life, and that other pumps cannot provide sufficient compensation to rescue the null mutant. The 2:1 genotype ratio of heterozygous and wild-type offspring indicated that embryonic development of heterozygous mutants was normal. Both young and adult heterozygous mutant mice appeared healthy, grew normally, and were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in both appearance and behavior. To gain a better understanding of the in vivo functions of SERCA2, we conducted biochemical and physiological analyses of heterozygous mutants, with the expectation that SERCA2 mRNA, protein, and activity levels would be reduced and that this would produce an informative cardiac phenotype.There are now many examples of mouse knockout models in which mRNA and protein levels are reduced in heterozygous mutants, with a corresponding alteration of physiological function. A particularly relevant example is the phospholamban-deficient mouse (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz J.N. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2826-H2831PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in which heterozygotes display an ∼50% decrease in phospholamban mRNA and protein levels and an increase in cardiac contractility and relaxation. Nevertheless, for proteins that play a central role in critical physiological processes, such as the cardiac SR Ca2+ pump in excitation-contraction coupling, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that homeostatic mechanisms within the cell might sense perturbations and adjust its levels of expression. In fact, recent studies have shown that transgenic mice with a 2.6-fold increase in SERCA2a mRNA in heart have only a 20% increase in SERCA2a protein (21He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.-J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R. Swanson E. Dillman W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and that transgenic overexpression of SERCA1 in mouse heart leads to a ∼50% reduction in the levels of endogenous SERCA2a (12Loukianov E. Ji Y. Grupp I.L. Kirkpatrick D.L. Baker D.L. Loukianova T. Grupp G. Lytton J. Walsh R.A. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The results of those studies indicate the existence of mechanisms that can limit SERCA2a expression in cardiac myocytes when Ca2+ pump activity is greater than normal. The development of the SERCA2-deficient mouse has allowed an investigation of whether the amount of SERCA2a mRNA and protein produced from a single copy of the gene can be up-regulated in response to a deficiency in Ca2+ pump activity.To allow unambiguous determination of the levels of mRNA and protein produced from the remaining functional copy of the SERCA2 gene in heterozygous mutants, we prepared the model using a targeting construct in which 1.5 kb from the 5′ end of the gene was replaced with the neomycin resistance gene. Homologous recombination between the construct and the SERCA2 gene eliminated the TATA box, both the transcription and translation initiation sites, and sequences encoding the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the protein. RNase protection analysis revealed that steady-state levels of SERCA2 mRNA in hearts of heterozygous mice were ∼55% of wild-type levels. These data indicate that the expression of normal levels of SERCA2 mRNA in heart is dependent on the presence of two functional copies of the SERCA2 gene, and that transcriptional up-regulation of the SERCA2 gene in response to a deficit in Ca2+ sequestering activity, if it occurs at all, is very limited. SERCA2a protein, however, was ∼65% of wild-type levels, indicating an ∼30% increase in the amount of protein produced from the single functional copy of the gene in heterozygous mutants. The results of these experiments show that both copies of the SERCA2 gene are required to maintain normal SERCA2 mRNA and protein levels, although some compensatory up-regulation of SR Ca2+ pump expression from the remaining gene does occur in heterozygotes. The mechanisms underlying the modest compensatory up-regulation are unclear, but may occur at several levels, including increased transcription and/or mRNA stability and increased translation and/or a reduction in the rate of SERCA2a protein degradation.When compared with the levels in wild-type mice, theV max of Ca2+ uptake activity and SERCA2a protein in heart samples from heterozygous mutants were reduced to similar extents, confirming that there is a direct relationship between SERCA2a levels and maximum rates of Ca2+sequestration. The Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+uptake activity was the same in mutant and wild-type mice, suggesting that under basal conditions there is no compensatory up-regulation of pump activity in mutant hearts via an increased affinity for Ca2+. Such compensation could occur, for example, by phosphorylation of phospholamban (which represses cardiac contractility and relaxation when it is in its non-phosphorylated state), thereby relieving its inhibition of pump activity (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz J.N. Kranias E.G. Am. J.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The lack of an alteration in Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake activity was somewhat surprising, as phospholamban mRNA levels were the same in wild-type and heterozygous mutant hearts. If the levels of phospholamban protein and its phosphorylation state are unchanged in heterozygous hearts, which were not examined in this study, then the increase in phospholamban/SERCA2 ratios in heterozygous mutants would be expected to cause a reduction in the affinity of the pump for Ca2+, as observed in hearts of transgenic mice in which phospholamban was overexpressed (22Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 81: 485-492Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be needed to determine whether phospholamban protein levels and its phosphorylation state under basal conditions are altered in heterozygous mutant hearts.A clear cardiovascular phenotype was observed in heterozygous mutants, demonstrating that the ∼35% reduction in SERCA2a levels and Ca2+ uptake activity resulting from the loss of one functional copy of the SERCA2 gene has a significant physiological effect. Under basal conditions, mean arterial blood pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure were significantly lower in heterozygotes than in wild-type mice. However, during maximum β-adrenergic stimulation, a condition in which inhibition of the pump by phospholamban is relieved (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz J.N. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2826-H2831PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luo W. Wolska B.M.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), both genotypes exhibited similar arterial and left ventricular pressures. The reduced levels of SERCA2a protein and activity would be expected to lead to both a reduction in SR Ca2+ stores, which would decrease the amount of Ca2+ available for excitation-contraction coupling, and a reduction in the rate of Ca2+sequestration, which would reduce the relaxation rate. Consistent with this expectation, the absolute values of both maximum and minimum dP/dt were significantly lower in mutant mice under basal conditions and at all levels of β-adrenergic stimulation. These results, along with those of previous studies showing that overexpression of SERCA2a (21He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.-J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R.

In the failing human myocardium, Ca2+ transients are markedly prolonged in both Ca2+ release and uptake phases (34Gwathmey J.K. Copelas L. MacKinnon R. Schoen F.J. Feldman M.D. Grossman W. Morgan J.P. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that the reduction in SERCA2a levels is involved in the altered force-frequency relationship (27Hasenfuss G.

On the basis of these and other studies, it has been suggested that SR dysfunction resulting from decreased levels of the SR Ca2+ pump contributes to the pathogenesis of heart disease (6Wankerl M. Schwartz K. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Limas C.J. Olivari M.-T. Goldenberg I.F. Levine T.B. Benditt D.G. Simon A. Cardiovasc.

Invest. 1992; 90: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The experiments described here have shown a direct relationship between SERCA2a levels and Ca2+ uptake activity, and have also shown that a reduction in pump activity impairs cardiac contractility and relaxation. However, the 12–16-week-old mutant mice that we analyzed appeared to be healthy, and overt evidence of heart disease, such as cardiac hypertrophy, was not observed. This indicates that an ∼35% deficit in Ca2+ sequestering activity, such as that resulting from the loss of one copy of the SERCA2 gene, is not a sufficient perturbation to cause heart disease in the relatively young adult mice analyzed here. However, it remains to be determined whether heterozygous mutants may be more prone to heart disease as they age or when subjected to rigorous exercise or other experimental protocols. The SERCA21 gene encodes two Ca2+-transporting ATPases, SERCA2a and SERCA2b, which differ in their C-terminal sequences as a result of alternative splicing (1Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 901-907PubMed Google Scholar). SERCA2a is expressed at highest levels in heart, where it plays a central role in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling required for excitation/contraction coupling (reviewed in Ref. 4Langer G.A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Contraction is initiated by an increase in Ca2+concentrations around the myofibrils, which occurs as Ca2+is released from the SR or enters the cell via channels in the sarcolemma. SERCA2a pumps Ca2+ out of the cytosol and into the SR, thereby contributing to the low diastolic Ca2+levels required for relaxation and replenishing Ca2+ stores needed for the next contraction. SERCA2a serves a similar function in slow twitch skeletal muscle and is also expressed in some smooth muscles (5Lytton J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Periasamy M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the limited tissue distribution and organ-specific function of SERCA2a, SERCA2b is expressed in all tissues and it has been suggested that it plays an essential housekeeping role (1Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it undoubtedly serves some organ-specific functions as well. An important role for SERCA2a in cardiac function is well established. Recent studies have shown that the levels of SERCA2a are decreased in several animal models of cardiac hypertrophy and human heart failure (reviewed in Refs. 6Wankerl M. Schwartz K. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 7Arai M. Matsui H. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether, and to what extent, the reductions in SERCA2a levels contribute to altered contractile function. In addition, it is unclear whether there are homeostatic mechanisms within the cardiac myocyte that are capable of sensing perturbations in the levels of pump activity and adjusting its expression accordingly. These are important issues, given the observed reductions in SERCA2a mRNA and protein expression in the failing heart, which correlate well with decreased myocardial Ca2+ transport and contractile function. However, it is unclear whether the reduction in the level of SERCA2 expression and activity are a cause or a consequence of impaired cardiac function. To obtain an animal model that could be used to examine the physiological functions of SERCA2 in cardiovascular and other tissues, we used gene targeting to prepare a mouse carrying a null mutation in the SERCA2 gene. Because homozygous SERCA2 null mutants were not observed, we examined cardiovascular function and SERCA2a expression and activity in hearts of heterozygous mutants, which display no outward manifestations of a disease phenotype. These studies show that SERCA2 mRNA, protein, and activity levels are reduced in heterozygous mutants carrying a single functional copy of the SERCA2 gene, and that these reductions have a significant effect on cardiac performance. DISCUSSIONOur primary objective was to analyze the relationship between cardiac performance and the levels of SERCA2 expression and activity in heart. Because we anticipated that homozygous mutants would not survive and that it would be necessary to perform our studies using heterozygotes, a major concern, and an important issue in its own right, was whether SERCA2 levels in heart were critically dependent on the presence of two functional copies of the SERCA2 gene. Homozygous mutants were not observed, demonstrating that one or both variants of SERCA2 serve functions that are essential for life, and that other pumps cannot provide sufficient compensation to rescue the null mutant. The 2:1 genotype ratio of heterozygous and wild-type offspring indicated that embryonic development of heterozygous mutants was normal. Both young and adult heterozygous mutant mice appeared healthy, grew normally, and were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in both appearance and behavior. To gain a better understanding of the in vivo functions of SERCA2, we conducted biochemical and physiological analyses of heterozygous mutants, with the expectation that SERCA2 mRNA, protein, and activity levels would be reduced and that this would produce an informative cardiac phenotype.There are now many examples of mouse knockout models in which mRNA and protein levels are reduced in heterozygous mutants, with a corresponding alteration of physiological function. A particularly relevant example is the phospholamban-deficient mouse (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz J.N. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2826-H2831PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in which heterozygotes display an ∼50% decrease in phospholamban mRNA and protein levels and an increase in cardiac contractility and relaxation. Nevertheless, for proteins that play a central role in critical physiological processes, such as the cardiac SR Ca2+ pump in excitation-contraction coupling, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that homeostatic mechanisms within the cell might sense perturbations and adjust its levels of expression. In fact, recent studies have shown that transgenic mice with a 2.6-fold increase in SERCA2a mRNA in heart have only a 20% increase in SERCA2a protein (21He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.-J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R. Swanson E. Dillman W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and that transgenic overexpression of SERCA1 in mouse heart leads to a ∼50% reduction in the levels of endogenous SERCA2a (12Loukianov E. Ji Y. Grupp I.L. Kirkpatrick D.L. Baker D.L. Loukianova T. Grupp G. Lytton J. Walsh R.A. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The results of those studies indicate the existence of mechanisms that can limit SERCA2a expression in cardiac myocytes when Ca2+ pump activity is greater than normal. The development of the SERCA2-deficient mouse has allowed an investigation of whether the amount of SERCA2a mRNA and protein produced from a single copy of the gene can be up-regulated in response to a deficiency in Ca2+ pump activity.To allow unambiguous determination of the levels of mRNA and protein produced from the remaining functional copy of the SERCA2 gene in heterozygous mutants, we prepared the model using a targeting construct in which 1.5 kb from the 5′ end of the gene was replaced with the neomycin resistance gene. Homologous recombination between the construct and the SERCA2 gene eliminated the TATA box, both the transcription and translation initiation sites, and sequences encoding the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the protein. RNase protection analysis revealed that steady-state levels of SERCA2 mRNA in hearts of heterozygous mice were ∼55% of wild-type levels. These data indicate that the expression of normal levels of SERCA2 mRNA in heart is dependent on the presence of two functional copies of the SERCA2 gene, and that transcriptional up-regulation of the SERCA2 gene in response to a deficit in Ca2+ sequestering activity, if it occurs at all, is very limited. SERCA2a protein, however, was ∼65% of wild-type levels, indicating an ∼30% increase in the amount of protein produced from the single functional copy of the gene in heterozygous mutants. The results of these experiments show that both copies of the SERCA2 gene are required to maintain normal SERCA2 mRNA and protein levels, although some compensatory up-regulation of SR Ca2+ pump expression from the remaining gene does occur in heterozygotes. The mechanisms underlying the modest compensatory up-regulation are unclear, but may occur at several levels, including increased transcription and/or mRNA stability and increased translation and/or a reduction in the rate of SERCA2a protein degradation.When compared with the levels in wild-type mice, theV max of Ca2+ uptake activity and SERCA2a protein in heart samples from heterozygous mutants were reduced to similar extents, confirming that there is a direct relationship between SERCA2a levels and maximum rates of Ca2+sequestration. The Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+uptake activity was the same in mutant and wild-type mice, suggesting that under basal conditions there is no compensatory up-regulation of pump activity in mutant hearts via an increased affinity for Ca2+. Such compensation could occur, for example, by phosphorylation of phospholamban (which represses cardiac contractility and relaxation when it is in its non-phosphorylated state), thereby relieving its inhibition of pump activity (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz J.N. Kranias E.G. Am. J.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The lack of an alteration in Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake activity was somewhat surprising, as phospholamban mRNA levels were the same in wild-type and heterozygous mutant hearts. If the levels of phospholamban protein and its phosphorylation state are unchanged in heterozygous hearts, which were not examined in this study, then the increase in phospholamban/SERCA2 ratios in heterozygous mutants would be expected to cause a reduction in the affinity of the pump for Ca2+, as observed in hearts of transgenic mice in which phospholamban was overexpressed (22Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 81: 485-492Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be needed to determine whether phospholamban protein levels and its phosphorylation state under basal conditions are altered in heterozygous mutant hearts.A clear cardiovascular phenotype was observed in heterozygous mutants, demonstrating that the ∼35% reduction in SERCA2a levels and Ca2+ uptake activity resulting from the loss of one functional copy of the SERCA2 gene has a significant physiological effect. Under basal conditions, mean arterial blood pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure were significantly lower in heterozygotes than in wild-type mice. However, during maximum β-adrenergic stimulation, a condition in which inhibition of the pump by phospholamban is relieved (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz J.N. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2826-H2831PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luo W. Wolska B.M.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), both genotypes exhibited similar arterial and left ventricular pressures. The reduced levels of SERCA2a protein and activity would be expected to lead to both a reduction in SR Ca2+ stores, which would decrease the amount of Ca2+ available for excitation-contraction coupling, and a reduction in the rate of Ca2+sequestration, which would reduce the relaxation rate. Consistent with this expectation, the absolute values of both maximum and minimum dP/dt were significantly lower in mutant mice under basal conditions and at all levels of β-adrenergic stimulation. These results, along with those of previous studies showing that overexpression of SERCA2a (21He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.-J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The lack of an alteration in Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake activity was somewhat surprising, as phospholamban mRNA levels were the same in wild-type and heterozygous mutant hearts. If the levels of phospholamban protein and its phosphorylation state are unchanged in heterozygous hearts, which were not examined in this study, then the increase in phospholamban/SERCA2 ratios in heterozygous mutants would be expected to cause a reduction in the affinity of the pump for Ca2+, as observed in hearts of transgenic mice in which phospholamban was overexpressed (22Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 81: 485-492Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be needed to determine whether phospholamban protein levels and its phosphorylation state under basal conditions are altered in heterozygous mutant hearts. A clear cardiovascular phenotype was observed in heterozygous mutants, demonstrating that the ∼35% reduction in SERCA2a levels and Ca2+ uptake activity resulting from the loss of one functional copy of the SERCA2 gene has a significant physiological effect. Under basal conditions, mean arterial blood pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure were significantly lower in heterozygotes than in wild-type mice. However, during maximum β-adrenergic stimulation, a condition in which inhibition of the pump by phospholamban is relieved (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz J.N. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2826-H2831PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luo W. Wolska B.M.

Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), both genotypes exhibited similar arterial and left ventricular pressures. The reduced levels of SERCA2a protein and activity would be expected to lead to both a reduction in SR Ca2+ stores, which would decrease the amount of Ca2+ available for excitation-contraction coupling, and a reduction in the rate of Ca2+sequestration, which would reduce the relaxation rate. Consistent with this expectation, the absolute values of both maximum and minimum dP/dt were significantly lower in mutant mice under basal conditions and at all levels of β-adrenergic stimulation. These results, along with those of previous studies showing that overexpression of SERCA2a (21He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.-J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R.

Morgan J.P. Circ.

On the basis of these and other studies, it has been suggested that SR dysfunction resulting from decreased levels of the SR Ca2+ pump contributes to the pathogenesis of heart disease (6Wankerl M.

The experiments described here have shown a direct relationship between SERCA2a levels and Ca2+ uptake activity, and have also shown that a reduction in pump activity impairs cardiac contractility and relaxation. However, the 12–16-week-old mutant mice that we analyzed appeared to be healthy, and overt evidence of heart disease, such as cardiac hypertrophy, was not observed. This indicates that an ∼35% deficit in Ca2+ sequestering activity, such as that resulting from the loss of one copy of the SERCA2 gene, is not a sufficient perturbation to cause heart disease in the relatively young adult mice analyzed here. However, it remains to be determined whether heterozygous mutants may be more prone to heart disease as they age or when subjected to rigorous exercise or other experimental protocols.

In this paper we report the cloning of two cDNAs encoding members of a new family of histone deacetylase in mouse that show a better homology to yeast HDA1 histone deacetylase. These cDNAs encode relatively large proteins, presenting an in vitro trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylase activity.

Our data showed that these newly identified genes could belong to a network of genes coordinately regulated and involved in the remodeling of chromatin during cell differentiation. Indeed, the expression of mHDA1 and mHDA2 is tightly linked to the state of cell differentiation, behaving therefore like the histone H1°-encoding gene. Moreover, like histone H1° gene, mHDA1 and mHDA2 gene expression is induced upon deacetylase inhibitor treatment.

Enzymes involved in the modification of histones by acetylation, histone acetyltransferases (HAT)1 and histone deacetylases (HD), are believed to play an important role in the regulation of transcription (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 2Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Moreover, acetylation appears to be a signaling process that involves not only histones but also non-histone proteins, mostly transcriptional regulators (3Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 4Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The identification of HATs and HDs are therefore crucial for the full understanding of the function of the signaling pathways through acetylation. The first histone deacetylase identified, HDAC1, showed a striking sequence homology with a yeast protein, RPD3 (5Taunton J. Hassing C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). After this discovery, not only histone deacetylases have been identified in many higher eukaryotes, but also variants have been reported (6Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 7Yang W.M. Yaoe Y,L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis performed on these proteins showed that they all contain a conserved feature; a large domain of homology with the yeast RPD3, covering the 2/3 N-terminal of the protein and a short C-terminal region with the most variable sequence (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The RPD3 homology domain is also shared by several procaryotic proteins interacting with various acetylated substrates (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Leipe D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 18: 3693-3697Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Ladomery M. Lyons S. Sommerville J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggested that this homology domain is also the deacetylase domain (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, mutagenesis of this domain confirmed its involvement in the enzymatic activity (12Hassing C.A. Tong J. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Biochemical study in yeast allowed the identification (13Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and the cloning of another histone deacetylase, HDA1 (14Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavkin S. Turner B. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Indeed, in yeast, two histone deacetylase complexes have been functionally identified (although, based on sequence homology, other potential members have been identified (14Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavkin S. Turner B. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar)): one, containing the histone deacetylase RPD3 (HDB complex), and the other (HDA complex), containing a distinct member of the histone deacetylase family, the HDA1. The protein is functionally different from RPD3 as it shows a greater sensitivity to trichostatin A (TSA) and is present in a complex different from that containing RPD3 (14Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavkin S. Turner B. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Moreover, HDA1 is not involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes controlled by RPD3 (15Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N.R. Turner B. Grunstein M. Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the deacetylase homology domain of this protein is homologous but significantly different from that of RPD3 (14Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavkin S. Turner B. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The putative histone deacetylase domain of all the histone deacetylases reported in higher eukaryotes, except that of maize nucleolar HD2 (16Lussar A. Borsch G. Loidl A. Haas H. Loidl P. Science. 1997; 277: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), show striking sequence homology to yeast RPD3 (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Leipe D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 18: 3693-3697Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Ladomery M. Lyons S. Sommerville J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are all members of the same family. It was therefore very tempting to know if, as in yeast, higher eukaryote deacetylases with divergent sequence in their deacetylase domain can be demonstrated. To identify members of such a family in higher eukaryotes, we sought a strategy based on the systematic search of expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for open reading frames, showing a better homology to yeast HDA1 than to yeast RPD3. This screening yields a considerable mass of raw information that has been treated, thanks to a computer program we designed to organize the information in a way that allows a rapid identification of interesting ESTs (consultable on an Internet site, see below). This strategy allowed us to clone two members of this family in mouse. The histone deacetylase activity of these proteins was confirmed, and the study of their expression allowed us to demonstrate the existence of a network of genes involved in the organization of chromatin and the control of cell differentiation that shows a coordinate profile of expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSIdentification of Higher Eukaryotic Homologues of Yeast HDA1Data base EST and data base EST cumulative updates were searched using the BCM search launcher Nucleic Acid Sequence Searches facility at NCBI 2http://dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/seq-search/nucleic_acid-search.html. through the TBLASTX/dbest that allows a search for homology considering the six translation frames of the query versus the six translation frames of ESTs. Although the reading frame of the query is known, we searched with the six possible frames as control to know if incorrect frames give rise to significant hits. In almost all the cases, the program found significant hits only with the correct frame of the query.The result of this search, carried out with the yeast HDA1 sequence and 26 other chromatin/transcription-related yeast proteins, can be consulted. 3http://ujf-iab.ujf-grenoble.fr/IAB/cgibin/saadi/. To rapidly identify interesting ESTs (those presenting the best homology to the most N-terminal part of yeast HDA1), we designed a computer program to treat the raw data and to set up a schematic representation of homologous ESTs considering all the homology parameters (see below). Homologous EST sequences were presented as a bar under the schematic representation of the query (yeast HDA1). The bar indicates the largest homologous fragment possible, built from the actual sequence alignments output. Moreover, for each EST, we considered the homology score and the number of homologous sub-fragments (n) and p(n) (see BLAST server). When n is greater than 1, union of the fragment showing the highest score (the highest scoring segment pair (HSP)) and other segment pairs (lower scoring pair or (LSP)), was performed. In case of discontinued homologies, the gap between two fragments was symbolized in gray. To have the most significant representation possible, we listed ESTs having a high score greater than 100. This methodology allowed us to identify two different mouse ESTs presenting an open reading frames with significant sequence homology with yeast HDA1. These ESTs were purchased from Genom System Inc. and sequenced.Cloning of Full-length mHDA1 and mHDA2 cDNAsTo obtain the complete mHDA1 and mHDA2 coding sequence, we used a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends-based strategy. A Marathon-Ready mouse cDNA library (CLONTECH) was purchased, and amplifications were performed using two nested cDNA-specific primers and a primer corresponding to the linker sequence following the user manual protocol. The polymerase chain reaction products were then cloned and sequenced.Immunoprecipitation Histone Deacetylase AssayscDNAs containing the whole mHDA1 and mHDA2 coding region were cloned in the pcDNA-His vector (Invitrogen). As a control, we also cloned the cDNA encoding HDAC1 (an EST purchased from Genome system Inc. and entirely sequenced) in the same vector. Rat embryonic cells (17Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) were transfected with 10 μg of each plasmid using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and sonicated in the lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture: Boehringer Mannheim). Protein G-Sepharose was added to the cleared lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. After the removal of the beads, 2 μg of anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of anti-penta-His antibody (Qiagen) were added to the lysate, and the incubation was continued overnight. Immunocomplexes were precipitated using protein G-Sepharose and washed three times in TL1 (100 mm Tris HCl, pH 8, 0.5m LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and three times in HD buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 275 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA). Finally, the beads containing the immunocomplexes were resuspended in 100 μl of HD buffer, and 15 μl portions were assayed for enzymatic activity. 3H-labeled acetylated histones were obtained according to the protocol published by Carmenet al. (13Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in duplicate in 50 μl containing 60,000 cpm [3H]acetate-labeled histones and immunocomplexes in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml TSA. Incubation was carried out for 2 h at room temperature, the volume was adjusted to 200 μl with HD buffer, and 50 μl of Stop buffer (13Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were added. The released [3H]acetic acid was extracted with 600 μl of ethyl acetate and measured. Cpm corresponding to the nonenzymatic release of [3H]acetate (obtained by incubating 3H-labeled histones with protein G-Sepharose in HD buffer, around 300 cpm) were subtracted from values obtained with the immunocomplexes.Cell Culture ConditionsMurine erythroleukemia cells and murine B16 cells were maintained in culture and induced to differentiate as described previously (18Khochbin S.

The appearance of hyperacetylated H4 was also monitored using antibody raised against hyperacetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) followed by cytofluorimetric measurement of immunofluorescence according to the published protocol (21Gorka C.

Indeed, in contrast to all animal deacetylases already defined, their histone deacetylase homology domain is more related to yHDA1 than to yRPD3. We therefore named these proteins mHDA1 and mHDA2, members of a new histone deacetylase family in higher eukaryotes. mHDA1 and mHDA2 are able to deacetylate histones in vitro and present sequence features, characteristic of histone deacetylases. Indeed, most of the amino acids conserved between the RPD3/HDAC family and prokaryotic acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase and the acetion utilization protein, acuC (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Leipe D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 18: 3693-3697Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Ladomery M. Lyons S. Sommerville J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), are also present in the deacetylase homology domains of mHDA members (not shown). In particular, all of the histidines and aspartic acids with potential catalytic and metal coordinating properties (12Hassing C.A. Tong J. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), are absolutely conserved in mHDA1 and mHDA2 (see Fig. 1), confirming the deacetylase nature of these members. One of the deacetylases reported in this work, mHDA2, possesses two deacetylase homology domains. This is the first enzyme of this type reported to have this special feature. The significance of this particular structure is not clear. mHDA1 possesses one deacetylase homology domain located in the C-terminal part of the protein; the N-terminal half of mHDA1 (over 500 amino acids) does not show sequence homology to a known deacetylase domain nor is homologous to any known proteins. This region is therefore a good candidate for regulating the function of the protein and to mediate its interaction with potential partners. The deletion of this nondeacetylase domain in the testis-specific variant of mHDA1 supports this hypothesis. Indeed, this large domain may not only regulate the enzymatic activity but may also target the protein to specific complexes. The deletion of this domain could therefore be a way to obtain a more general and nonspecific deacetylase that is needed for the regulation of histone acetylation during spermatogenesis (30Meistrich M.L. Trostle-Weige P.K. Lin R. Bhatnagar Y.M. Allis D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 31: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Different members of HDAC family have been found in different regulatory complexes (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 2Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 31Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 272: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and the identification of proteins involved in these complexes was essential for the understanding of the specific function of these deacetylases. The nature of these partners helped to show that besides the involvement of HDAC family members in chromatin assembly (32Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), the regulation of transcription is their major function. Indeed, HDACs have been found in various complexes containing different known repressors of transcription (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 2Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 31Wolffe A.P.

Nature. 1998; 393: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These enzymes also have the potential to sustain a chromatin-remodeling activity. Nevertheless, this chromatin-remodeling activity is either too modest to be visible by classical techniques (35Wong J. Patterton D. Imhof A. Guschin D. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 520-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or operates locally at the level of nuclease hypersensitive sites (36Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J.C. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). The identification of cellular proteins able to interact with the mHDA members is certainly crucial to understanding the specific function of these proteins. The remarkable pattern of expression of mHDA1 and mHDA2 in testis (the overexpression of mHDA2 and the appearance of a truncated form of HDA1, which has lost the nondeacetylase domain) is the only evidence we have at present concerning their possible function. Indeed, in this tissue, cell differentiation is associated with spectacular chromatin remodeling, characterized by the replacement of histones by transition proteins and protamines that could involve histone hyperacetylation/deacetylation (30Meistrich M.L. Trostle-Weige P.K. Lin R. Bhatnagar Y.M. Allis D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 31: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Such a special pattern of expression was not detected for members of the HDAC family in testis (7Yang W.M. Yaoe Y,L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). One can therefore suggest a specific involvement of the mHDA family in chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis and cell differentiation in general.mHDA1 and mHDA2 belong to a group of genes that show a coordinate-induced expression in response to the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity. Interestingly, members of this group consist of the histone deacetylases, mHDA1, mHDA2 (this work), HDAC1 (37Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and a differentiation-specific linker histone, H1° (20Girardot V. Yoshida M. Beppu T. Lawrence J.J. Khochbin S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Kress H. Tönjes R. Doenecke D.R.

Rousseau D. Lawrence J.J. Khochbin S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that p21/WAF is also induced after the inhibition of deacetylase activity by TSA (data not shown), as has been observed after butyrate treatment (38Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orito T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p21/WAF has been shown to play a major role as a nuclear organizer (39Linares-Cruz G. Bruzzoni H. lvaro V. Roperch J.P. Tuynder M. Schoevaert D. Nemani M. Prieur S. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Reclar V. Faille A. Chassoux D. Dausset J. Amson R.B. Calvo F. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The response of these genes to chromatin hyperacetylation reveals the existence of an interesting network of genes that are involved in the remodeling and organization of chromatin, among them three histone deacetylase-encoding genes, histone H1°, and the nuclear organizer, p21/WAF. The fact that these genes are induced upon chromatin hyperacetylation also indicates the existence of a chromatin-structure response system. The product of these genes could be involved in a cellular response to severe disturbance of the regular chromatin structure. These genes also seem to be involved in other cellular events such as differentiation. The chromatin-modifying function of H1° (21Gorka C. Brocard M.P. Curtet S. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1208-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the histone deacetylase activity of the proteins identified here may play an important role in the correct remodeling of chromatin during cell differentiation and the initiation of a particular genetic program.Our results strongly suggest that the mHDA1- and mHDA2-encoding gene promoters like that of H1° gene, are communicating with cellular signals controlling cell differentiation. It will therefore be very interesting to identify transcription factors involved in the coordinate expression of H1° and these histone deacetylases. The identification of such factors would provide important insight into the molecular nature of the chromatin-remodeling command mechanism operating during cell differentiation. Enzymes involved in the modification of histones by acetylation, histone acetyltransferases (HAT)1 and histone deacetylases (HD), are believed to play an important role in the regulation of transcription (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 2Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Moreover, acetylation appears to be a signaling process that involves not only histones but also non-histone proteins, mostly transcriptional regulators (3Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 4Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The identification of HATs and HDs are therefore crucial for the full understanding of the function of the signaling pathways through acetylation. The first histone deacetylase identified, HDAC1, showed a striking sequence homology with a yeast protein, RPD3 (5Taunton J. Hassing C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). After this discovery, not only histone deacetylases have been identified in many higher eukaryotes, but also variants have been reported (6Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 7Yang W.M. Yaoe Y,L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis performed on these proteins showed that they all contain a conserved feature; a large domain of homology with the yeast RPD3, covering the 2/3 N-terminal of the protein and a short C-terminal region with the most variable sequence (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The RPD3 homology domain is also shared by several procaryotic proteins interacting with various acetylated substrates (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Leipe D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 18: 3693-3697Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Ladomery M. Lyons S. Sommerville J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggested that this homology domain is also the deacetylase domain (9Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, mutagenesis of this domain confirmed its involvement in the enzymatic activity (12Hassing C.A. Tong J. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Biochemical study in yeast allowed the identification (13Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and the cloning of another histone deacetylase, HDA1 (14Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavkin S. Turner B. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Indeed, in yeast, two histone deacetylase complexes have been functionally identified (although, based on sequence homology, other potential members have been identified (14Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavkin S. Turner B. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar)): one, containing the histone deacetylase RPD3 (HDB complex), and the other (HDA complex), containing a distinct member of the histone deacetylase family, the HDA1. The protein is functionally different from RPD3 as it shows a greater sensitivity to trichostatin A (TSA) and is present in a complex different from that containing RPD3 (14Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavkin S. Turner B. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Moreover, HDA1 is not involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes controlled by RPD3 (15Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N.R. Turner B. Grunstein M. Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the deacetylase homology domain of this protein is homologous b"

High-resolution measurements in the ocean mixed layer are used to show that temperature and salinity gradients on horizontal scales of 20 meters to 10 kilometers tend to compensate in their effect on density. These observations support the notion of a horizontal mixing in the mixed layer that depends on density gradient.

PDI has also been implicated as a cell-surface recognition/adhesion molecule during neuronal differentiation of the retina (23Krishna Rao A.S.M. Hausman R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we examined the consequence of over- or underexpression of PDI for the redox state of cell-surface protein thiols/disulfides. Human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) were stably transfected with a PDI expression vector or with a PDI antisense construct. Overexpression of PDI resulted in enhanced secretion of PDI but not two other KDEL-containing proteins and enhanced cell-surface association of PDI. Similarly, antisense-mediated underexpression of PDI caused decreased secretion and cell-surface localization of PDI. By using two different membrane-impermeable thiol-specific reagents, we showed that increased or decreased secretion of PDI correlated with increased or decreased protein thiols on the cell surface. At least 14 proteins on the surface of control and PDI-transfected cells contained redox-active thiols/disulfides that were regulated by the level of secreted PDI. These results demonstrated that secreted PDI was controlling the redox state of certain cell-surface protein thiols/disulfides. HT1080 cells from ATCC (Rockville, MD) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All media components were from Life Technologies, Inc. A 1.7-kilobase pair PDI cDNA was isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from total RNA extracted from primary human foreskin fibroblasts and cloned into the vector, pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). The PDI primers were ATTGATGGATCCATGCTGCGCCGCGCTCTGCT (PDI sequence position 76–96) and TTCAGGAAACAAGCCACCAG (position 1823–1803) (Bresatec, Adelaide, Australia). The PDI cDNA contained the open reading frame of PDI from nucleotides 76 to 1599 that codes for 508 amino acids, including the 17 amino acid signal peptide. Moloney murine leukemia virus Reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase Expand High Fidelity, and reagents for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were from Boehringer Mannheim, Australia. Integrity of the cDNA was confirmed by automatic sequencing (ABI-377 Automatic Sequencer, Applied Biosystems) and was the same as the reported sequence (25Cheng S.-Y. Gong Q.-H. Parkinson C. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11221-11227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PDI cDNA was derived as a BamHI fragment and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 in either the sense or antisense direction (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). HT1080 cells were transfected with either 5 μg of unmanipulated vector or vector containing the sense or antisense PDI cDNA using calcium phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected control and over- or underexpressing cells were selected by incubation with medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 that was reduced to 200 μg/ml after the first passage. Stably transfected cells were cloned using cloning plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany). Northern analyses of PDI mRNA were performed as follows. Control, PDI overexpressing (HT1080s) or underexpressing (HT1080as) cells were grown to confluency, washed, and incubated in DMEM without FBS for 6 h. Cells (5 × 106) were lysed in TRIZOL buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and total RNA extracted as described by the manufacturer. Total RNA (20 μg) was blotted onto nylon Hybond transfer membrane (Amersham Australia, Sydney, Australia) and probed with a riboprobe complementary to PDI mRNA. The riboprobe was transcribed from the pcDNA3-PDI vector using SP6 polymerase. The riboprobes were visualized using digoxigenin detection (Boehringer Mannheim, Sydney, Australia). Reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels were determined as described by Vandeputte et al.(26Vandeputte C. Guizon I. Genestie-Denis I. Vannier B. Lorenzon G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For secreted GSH levels, HT1080 cells at 80% confluence were washed twice with PBS and incubated in DMEM without FBS for 6 h (0.7 × 106 cells per ml of medium). Conditioned media were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. For cellular GSH levels, HT1080 cells (1.5 × 106) were detached from culture flasks using 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 0.3 ml of PBS, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cellular protein was precipitated with 5-sulfosalicylic acid according to Vandeputteet al. (26Vandeputte C. Guizon I. Genestie-Denis I. Vannier B. Lorenzon G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and the GSH and GSSG content of the supernatant was determined. To determine protein-bound GSH, the pellets from the acid precipitation were resuspended in 1% sodium borohydride, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 1 h at 25 °C. The resulting supernatant was neutralized with 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 buffer, and the GSH content determined. Total thiol content of HT1080 cell lysates was determined using 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Sigma) (27Balázs M. Matkó J. Szöllösi J. Mátyus L. Fulwyler M.J. Damjanovich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) after denaturing the proteins with 5% SDS. Cellular protein thiol content was calculated by subtracting the cellular GSH content from the total thiol content. Affinity purified anti-PDI polyclonal antibodies (100 μl of 5 μg/ml in 15 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 0.02% azide, pH 9.6 buffer) were adsorbed to Nunc PolySorp 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C in a humid environment. Wells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), nonspecific binding sites blocked by adding 200 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubating for 90 min at 37 °C, and then washed two times with PBS/Tween. HT1080 cells (5 × 106) were detached from culture flasks using 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 5 mmEDTA, and 10 μm aprotinin (Bayer Australia Ltd., Sydney, Australia), and sonicated on ice. Purified placenta PDI and HT1080 cell lysates were diluted in PBS/Tween and 100-μl aliquots added to antibody-coated wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with PBS/Tween and 100 μl of 5 μg/ml of the murine anti-PDI monoclonal antibody, M10, added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. The M10 antibody was a gift from Prof. Johan Stenflo, Lund University, Sweden. Wells were washed three times with PBS/Tween, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was added at 1 in 500 dilution in 100 μl of PBS/Tween and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with PBS/Tween and the color developed with 100 μl of 0.003% H2O2, 1 mg/ml 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) in 50 mm citrate, pH 4.5 buffer, for 20 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Absorbances were read at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices Thermomax Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). Results were corrected for control wells not coated with polyclonal antibody. The ELISA is linear up to a PDI concentration of 200 ng/ml. HT1080 cell-surface PDI was estimated by labeling with either sulfosuccinimidobiotin (SSB) (Pierce) (28Ingalls H.M. Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), or 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) (Molecular Probes) (28Ingalls H.M. Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both SSB and MPB are membrane-impermeable. SSB labeled the primary amines in PDI, and MPB labeled the reactive site sulfhydryls. HT1080 control, HT1080s, or HT1080as cells (5 × 106) were detached from culture flasks using 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 100 μm of either SSB or MPB, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Unreacted SSB was quenched with 200 μmglycine (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Unreacted MPB was quenched with 200 μm GSH (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature, and remaining sulfhydryl groups were quenched with 400 μm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, sonicated in lysis buffer as described above, and incubated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) for 60 min at 4 °C with rotary mixing. Bound proteins were washed five times with 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and the SSB- or MPB-labeled PDI detected by Western blot. Secretion of PDI by HT1080 control, HT1080s, or HT1080as cells was assessed by washing 80% confluent cultures twice and incubating in DMEM without FBS for 6 h. Conditioned media were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris, and media from 3 × 104cells were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and detected by Western blot. Protein thiols on control HT1080, HT1080s, or HT1080as cells were quantitated using either DTNB (27Balázs M. Matkó J. Szöllösi J. Mátyus L. Fulwyler M.J. Damjanovich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or MPB (see above). Cells at 80–90% confluence were detached from culture flasks using 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed twice with PBS. For DTNB labeling, 1.5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, DTNB added to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the mixture incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rolling. Cells were pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min, and 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid content of the supernatant was measured from absorbance at 412 nm using an extinction coefficient of 14,150 m−1 cm−1 (27Balázs M. Matkó J. Szöllösi J. Mátyus L. Fulwyler M.J. Damjanovich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For MPB labeling, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, MPB added to a final concentration of 100 μm MPB, and the mixture incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rolling. Unreacted MPB was quenched with GSH and iodoacetamide as described above. Labeled cells were sonicated in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described above. Lysate corresponding to 2.5 μg of protein (approximately 1 × 104 cells) was resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and MPB-labeled proteins detected by blotting with streptavidin peroxidase. On some occasions, cells at 80–90% confluence were washed with PBS and incubated with either 50 μg/ml preimmune rabbit IgG or affinity purified anti-PDI rabbit polyclonal antibodies in serum-free DMEM for 48 h prior to labeling with MPB. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were developed against purified human placenta PDI in New Zealand white rabbits and affinity purified on a PDI-AffiGel 15 matrix (Bio-Rad). PDI was purified from human placenta as described previously (30Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with modifications (31Hotchkiss K.A. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9761-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved on either 10 or 5–15% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to PVDF membrane. Proteins were detected by Western blot using affinity purified anti-human PDI rabbit polyclonal antibodies (used at 3 μg/ml), a anti-human Grp78/Grp94 murine monoclonal antibody (used at 5 μg/ml) from Stressgen, British Columbia, Canada, or a anti-human thioredoxin murine monoclonal antibody (used at 5 μg/ml) from Dr. Frank Clarke, Griffith's University, Brisbane, Australia. Swine anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) were used at 1:2000 and 1:1000 dilution, respectively. MPB-labeled proteins were blotted with streptavidin peroxidase (Amersham, Sydney, Australia) used at 1:500 dilution. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescence films were analyzed by densitometry (GS300 Transmittance/Reflectance Densitometer, Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). HT1080 cells were transfected with either the unmanipulated pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (HT1080) or the vector containing PDI cDNA inserted in either the sense (HT1080s) or antisense (HT1080as) direction. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 and cloned. One control and two sense and two antisense clones were selected for investigation. These clones have been called HT1080 control, HT1080s 1 and 2 and HT1080as 1 and 2, respectively. PDI mRNA in the control, sense, and antisense clones is shown in Fig.1 A. HT1080s1 and HT1080s2 clones contained 2.9- and 3.0-fold more PDI mRNA than control cells, respectively, whereas PDI mRNA in HT1080as1 and HT1080as2 clones was 42 and 40% that in control cells, respectively. PDI protein in cell lysates of HT1080 control, HT1080s, or HT1080as clones is shown in Figs. 1 B. Consistent with the mRNA levels, HT1080s1 and HT1080s2 clones contained 1.9- and 2.1-fold more PDI protein per mg of cell protein than control cells, respectively, whereas PDI protein in HT1080as1 and HT1080as2 clones was 53 and 37% that in control cells, respectively. There was no difference in the amount of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor or β1 integrin protein in whole cell lysates, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the extracellular matrix, of control versus HT1080s2 or HT1080as2 cells (not shown). This suggested that PDI overexpression did not have a general effect on protein synthesis. Control and PDI sense and antisense transfected cells were plated at 3000 cells per well in 6-well plates, and cell number was determined each day for 4 days (Fig.2 A). The rate of proliferation of sense and antisense clones was marginally slower than control, although not statistically significant. The rate of proliferation of control, HT1080s2, and HT1080as2 clones is shown in Fig. 2 A.The rate of proliferation of the sense and antisense clone 1 cells was indistinguishable from the clone 2 cells (not shown). Phase contrast micrographs of control and HT1080s2 and HT1080as2 cells at high density is shown in Fig. 2 B. The control and sense cells had indistinguishable morphology. In contrast, the antisense clones tended to bunch in cell islands and never reached 100% confluency. The morphology of the sense and antisense clone 1 cells was indistinguishable from the clone 2 cells (not shown). The intracellular GSH and protein-bound GSH content of control and PDI sense and antisense transfected cells was very similar (Fig.3). The intracellular GSSG content was less than 1% of the GSH content and was also similar in all cells (not shown). In contrast, the sense and antisense transfected cells secreted an average 1.9- and 4.1-fold more GSH, respectively, than control cells. The total protein thiol content of sense transfected cells was slightly higher than control cells, whereas it was slightly lower than control in antisense transfected cells. PDI was secreted by the control and transfected cells (Fig.4 A). The extent of PDI secretion paralleled the PDI protein levels in cell lysates (see Fig.1 B). Purified placenta PDI is shown as control and migrated with the expected M r of ∼57. HT1080s1 and HT1080s2 clones secreted 3.6- and 4.2-fold more PDI than control cells, respectively, whereas PDI secretion in HT1080as1 and HT1080as2 clones was 62 and 47% that in control cells, respectively. It has been suggested that PDI secretion by cells may be a consequence of saturation of the KDEL retrieval receptor in the Golgi and intermediate compartments (11Yoshimoro T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15984-15990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Terada K. Manchikalapudi P. Noiva R. Jauregui H.O. Stockert R.J. Schilsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20410-20416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). If this was the case then other C-terminal KDEL-tagged proteins would also be expected to be secreted by cultured cells. To test this possibility, the presence of two other KDEL-tagged proteins, Grp78 (Bip) and Grp94, in the supernatant of control and the PDI-overexpressing clone was examined (Fig.4 B). Grp78 and Grp94 were not secreted by control HT1080 or HT1080s2 cells within the limits of detection, which implied that PDI secretion was a specific event and not simply “spillage” of PDI from the Golgi and intermediate compartments. Comparison of secreted PDI relative to cellular PDI content with the cellular content of Grp78/Grp94 (from Figs. 1 B and 4, A andB) indicated that if Grp78/Grp94 were secreted then the level of secretion was <5% of the level of PDI secretion. Dorneret al. (33Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Raney P. Haugejorden S. Green M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22029-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have similarly reported that PDI secretion was not associated with secretion of other KDEL-containing proteins. Thioredoxin is a 12-kDa redox active protein that can be secreted by cultured cells (34Rosen A. Lundman P. Carlsson M. Bhavani K. Srinivasa B.R. Kjellstrom G. Nilsson K. Holmgren A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PDI sense transfected cells contained ∼40% less thioredoxin than control of antisense transfected cells (Fig. 4 C). The reason for this is unknown but may reflect coordinated expression of PDI and thioredoxin. For instance, overexpression of thioredoxin reduced expression of glutaredoxin in Escherichia coli and vice versa (35Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodrı́guez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin was not secreted by control or transfected HT1080 cells within the limits of detection of the Western blot (not shown). Comparison of secreted PDI relative to cellular PDI content with the cellular content of thioredoxin (from Figs. 1 B and 4,A and C) indicated that if thioredoxin was secreted then the level of secretion was <10% of the level of PDI secretion. PDI associates with the cell surface after secretion (12Terada K. Manchikalapudi P. Noiva R. Jauregui H.O. Stockert R.J. Schilsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20410-20416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Yoshimoro T. Masaki R. Ogawa R. Tashiro Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine cell-surface associated PDI, HT1080 control and sense and antisense cells were labeled with either the membrane-impermeable amine-reactive reagent, SSB, or the membrane-impermeable thiol-reactive reagent, MPB. PDI contains two active site sulfhydryl groups in the common sequence WCGPCK which have a redox potential of −110 mV (3Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuitte M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and can be labeled with MPB (36Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, SSB-labeled PDI is a measure of total cell-surface PDI, whereas MPB-labeled PDI is a measure of reduced cell-surface PDI. HT1080 cell-surface SSB- or MPB-labeled proteins were collected on streptavidin-agarose, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with PDI polyclonal antibodies (SSB, Fig.5 A; MPB, Fig. 5 B). The results represent labeling of 5 × 105 HT1080 cells. SSB- or MPB-labeled placenta PDI is shown as control and migrated with the expected mass of ∼57 kDa. The amount of SSB- or MPB-labeled cell-surface PDI paralleled the PDI protein levels in cell lysates (see Fig. 1 B) and secreted PDI protein (see Fig.4 A). HT1080s1 and HT1080s2 clones contained 1.5- and 1.7-fold more total PDI on their surface than control cells, respectively, whereas total PDI levels on HT1080as1 and HT1080as2 clones were 90 and 67% that on control cells, respectively (Fig.5 A). A similar ratio was observed for reduced surface PDI levels (Fig. 5 B), although the absolute levels of reduced PDI were approximately one-third of the total PDI levels. This result implied that surface PDI was a mixture of reduced and oxidized forms, although the level of reduced PDI may have be underestimated if the efficiency of labeling by MPB was not optimal. By having demonstrated that over- or underexpression of PDI in HT1080 cells correlated with increase or decrease, respectively, in secretion and cell-surface levels of PDI, we were in the position to test whether PDI controlled the redox state of cell-surface protein thiols/disulfides. We used two different thiol-reactive reagents to examine this question, DTNB and MPB. Both of these reagents are membrane-impermeable and thiol-specific at neutral pH and have been used previously to assess cell-surface thiol status (27Balázs M. Matkó J. Szöllösi J. Mátyus L.

Despite the impressive ability of natural enzymes to catalyze a broad array of reactions and utilize diverse substrates, attempts to make even minor modifications in enzyme activity or substrate specificity have proven to be difficult. Efforts to change the properties of existing enzymes (1Wilks H.M. Hartt K.W. Feeney R. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.H.

Nature. 1998; 391: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have highlighted a limitation to enzyme design; in most cases, we can consider only amino acid residues that constitute the active site. Enzymes, however, exert their functions not only through the chemical properties of the side chains of the amino acid residues that contact substrates and cofactors. Residues distant from an active site may be important in holding the catalytic residues in their required orientations. Charge distribution throughout a whole enzyme molecule may facilitate substrate binding by electrostatically guiding the substrate into the active site. These ideas are consistent with the fact that enzymes are macromolecules composed of hundreds of amino acid residues. It has been difficult to demonstrate by protein engineering the importance of residues that are remote from the active site because the number of these residues is large and the contribution of each residue may be modest. It is also beyond our present understanding to predict a priori the effects of the mutations of remote residues on enzymatic activity through changes in the complex architecture of tertiary and/or quaternary structure. Although random mutagenesis and directed evolution have recently proven to be useful in addressing such problems in the rational redesign of enzymes (5Hermes J.D. Blacklow S.C. Knowles J.R. Proc.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT)1 is a homodimeric enzyme and catalyzes amino group transfer between acidic amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, and their corresponding 2-oxo acids (11$$Google Scholar). Each subunit has a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) molecule at the active center. The structure (12Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem.

Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) of AspAT have been studied extensively. AspAT from Escherichia colishows moderate activity for aromatic amino acids. The activity for β-branched amino acids, valine and isoleucine, is barely detectable and even lower than that for basic amino acids (15Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Several studies were previously done to increase the activity for basic or aromatic amino acids (16Cronin C.N. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Hayashi H. Kuramitsu S. Inoue Y. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These results imply that the substrate specificity of AspAT like many other enzymes cannot be easily manipulated by mutating one or a few active site residues. To alter the substrate specificity of AspAT toward β-branched amino acids, we established an experimental system based on directed evolution where mutant AspATs with higher activity for branched-chain substrates, especially valine and 2-oxovaline, evolve during successive rounds of selection (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, the selection system uses an auxotrophic E. coli strain, which is deficient in the gene for branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase. The higher the activity of a plasmid-encoded mutant AspAT for 2-oxovaline is, the faster the auxotrophic E. coli carrying the plasmid grows on a selection plate. After five rounds of the selection, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of mutant AspATs for β-branched substrates was increased about 105-fold. One of the mutant AspATs showing the highest activity (AV5A-7) was analyzed in detail (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The mutant had 13 amino acid substitutions, but interestingly, only one of the mutated residues seemed to interact directly with the substrate based on the three-dimensional structure of the wild-type AspAT. To elucidate the effects of these mutations on substrate binding, we set out to determine the three-dimensional structure of the mutant AspAT complexed with a β-branched substrate analog. The affinity of AV5A-7 for valine was, however, still too low (K m = 400 mm) to yield a crystal of such an enzyme-inhibitor complex. Here we describe the further improvement in both the catalytic efficiency and the K m value of AV5A-7 for valine. The affinity of a new mutant AspAT for valine is high enough to allow crystallization of a complex between the mutant enzyme and a valine analog. The crystal structure shows that the mutations in residues distant from the active site cause significant changes in the higher order structure of the enzyme, which influence substrate and cofactor binding. An auxotrophic E. colistrain, YJ103 (ΔilvE::kan), the selection medium, 5′ and 3′ primers used for the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the coding region of aspC, and the construction of the expression plasmid were reported previously (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first round of selection was done as follows. The coding region of the aspC gene containing the three mutations, Ser139 → Gly, Asn142 → Thr, and Asn297 → Ser, was subjected to DNA shuffling (6Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 9Zhang J.-H. Dawes G. Stemmer W.P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After a 45-h incubation at 37 °C, 116 colonies from a library of 5.6 × 107colonies were picked up, and a mixture of the plasmids was prepared. As for the second and third rounds of selection, the conditions were the same as those for the first round except the incubation time: the second round, a 40-h incubation, a library size of 7.9 × 107 colonies, and 136 colonies picked; the third round, a 28-h incubation, a library size of 2.8 × 107colonies, and 48 colonies picked. Among the 48 clones, 9 clones exhibiting the highest activity for 2-oxovaline were chosen, and the coding regions of the aspC genes were sequenced. The coding region of the mutant AspATs was subcloned into pUC18. The mutant enzymes were expressed in E. coli TY103 (20Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Hiromi K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6079-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is deficient in the AspAT gene, and purified as described (21Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Inoue K. Kagamiyama H. Hiromi K. Tanase S. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9673-96810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity for each substrate was measured at 25 °C by spectrophotometrically monitoring the single turnover reaction using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus (model SX.17MV) as described (15Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The buffer system was 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m KCl and 10 μm EDTA. The crystals of ATB17 complexed with isovalerate were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Three microliter drops containing 37 mg/ml protein were mixed with 1 μl of 0.2 m sodium isovalerate and 3 μl of the reservoir solution containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m Na·Hepes, pH 7.5. The drops were equilibrated against 0.5 ml of the reservoir solution at 20 °C. An x-ray data set was collected with a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator operated at 40 kV and 100 mA with monochromatized CuKα radiation at room temperature. The oscillation images were processed and reduced using a data processing software, Rigaku PROCESS (22Higashi T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 253-257Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement of the structure began with the structure of the wild-type AspAT 2The atomic coordinates for the crystal structure of the wild-type AspAT have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, code 1ART (12Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). (12Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J.

Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) with parameters derived by Engh and Huber (24Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar). After conventional positional refinement, simulated annealing using the slow cool protocol was performed. The models were improved by conventional positional refinement and the isotropicB-factor refinement, and manual rebuilding using Xfit (25McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar) on the omit map was calculated with the coefficients ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖. AfterR-factors were adequately lowered, water molecules were added to the models, and the structures were further refined. Sequence analysis of the mutant AspATs obtained from the previous selection showed that 5 of the 13 substitutions found in AV5A-7, Asn34 → Asp, Ile37 → Met, Ser139 → Gly, Asn142 → Thr, and Asn297 → Ser, were conserved among all of the mutants examined, and these substitutions were found to be functionally important (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The fact that one substitution (Val387 → Leu) that significantly increased the activity for β-branched substrates was unique to AV5A-7 (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), however, implied that the sequence space had not yet been fully searched. Despite this finding, the initial selection system appeared to have reached its limit after five rounds of selection, because further increases in the catalytic efficiency for β-branched substrates did not benefit the growth of the host E. coli cells under the most stringent selection conditions. In the present study, we used two different strategies to find additional beneficial mutations. In one approach, we added each of the 20 unique substitutions found in four selected mutant AspATs, AV5A-1, AV5B-1, AV5B-4, and AV5B-5 (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), to AV5A-7 one mutation at a time and assayed each new mutant for 2-oxovaline activity (data not shown). Two substitutions, Ser361 → Phe and Ser363 → Gly, were chosen in this manner. In a second strategy, directed evolution was once again employed. This time, however, the experiment was started from a mutant AspAT that had three substitutions, Ser139 → Gly, Asn142 → Thr, and Asn297 → Ser, to facilitate the evolution. After three rounds of selection, mutant AspATs that showed similar activity for 2-oxovaline to that of AV5A-7 were obtained, and the coding regions of 9 mutant AspATs were sequenced. Each mutant AspAT had 4–9 additional substitutions, and, again, Asn34 → Asp and Ile37 → Met were conserved in all the mutants. After adding each potential substitution one at a time to AV5A-7/Ser361 → Phe/Ser363 → Gly, 3 substitutions, Ala11 → Thr, Phe24 → Leu, and Ile353 → Thr, were chosen. One of the 13 substitutions of AV5A-7, Glu7 → Val, was mutated back to the wild-type sequence because the substitution was found to decrease the expression level of AspAT while not affecting the activity for β-branched substrates. The resulting mutant, ATB17, thus has 17 substitutions (Fig. 1 A), 11 of which are clearly functionally important. As for the other 6 substitutions, Lys41 → Asn, Lys126 → Arg, Ala269 → Thr, Ala293 → Val, Ser311 → Gly, and Met397 → Leu, of which the contribution to the total effect was 10–20% in AV5A-7, the importance of each substitution could not be determined (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Compared with AV5A-7, the k cat/K m values of ATB17 for branched-chain substrates are increased, whereas those for acidic 2-oxo acid substrates are decreased (TableI). In particular, theK m value for valine is decreased 76-fold to 5.5 mm. The k cat/K mvalue of ATB17 for valine or 2-oxovaline is increased >2.1 × 106 or 6.7 × 105-fold, respectively, and that for isoleucine or 2-oxoisoleucine is increased >6.0 × 104 or 5.4 × 105-fold, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type AspAT. ATB17 retains significant activity for acidic substrates. Although this activity could have been easily eliminated by a single mutation at Arg292 (see below and also Refs. 16Cronin C.N. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 17Hayashi H. Kuramitsu S. Inoue Y. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), none of the mutants examined had such mutations. Probably Arg292 was maintained simply because no selection pressure was applied to minimize the activity for acidic substrates or because acidic amino acids may serve as the amino group donors to 2-oxovaline in E. coli cells growing under the selection conditions.Table IKinetic parameters of AspATs for branched and acidic substratesSubstrateWTaData from Ref. 15, except for those for branched-chain 2-oxo acids (10).AV5A-7bData from Ref. 10.ATB17k catK mk cat/K mk catK mk cat/K mk catK mk cat/K ms−1m ms−1m−1s−1m ms−1m−1s−1m ms−1m−1l-Valine—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.<1 × 10−34642011012 (0.3)5.5 (0.4)2.1 × 103l-Isoleucine—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.<1 × 10−3—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.6.68.4 (1.3)140 (30)60l-Leucine—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.—cReactions did not show saturation kinetics in the substrate concentrations examined.2.41601201.3 × 103110 (8)15 (2)7.3 × 1032-OxovalinedAbbreviations used are: 2-oxovaline, 2-ketoisovaleric acid; 2-oxoisoleucine, dl-2-keto-3-methyl-n-valeric acid; 2-oxoleucine, 2-ketoisocaproic acid.5.7 × 10−31000.057283.87.4 × 10390 (2)2.4 (0.09)3.8 × 1042-OxoisoleucinedAbbreviations used are: 2-oxovaline, 2-ketoisovaleric acid; 2-oxoisoleucine, dl-2-keto-3-methyl-n-valeric acid; 2-oxoleucine, 2-ketoisocaproic acid.3.3 × 10−3520.063220484.6 × 103250 (6)7.3 (0.4)3.4 × 1042-OxoleucinedAbbreviations used are: 2-oxovaline, 2-ketoisovaleric acid; 2-oxoisoleucine, dl-2-keto-3-methyl-n-valeric acid; 2-oxoleucine, 2-ketoisocaproic acid.1.243281403.44.1 × 104320 (10)2.2 (0.2)1.5 × 105l-Aspartate5504.51.2 × 105220683.2 × 1039.2eParameters could not be determined experimentally because spectral changes were too small to obtain reliable parameters.

Open table in a new tab Standard deviations are in parentheses. During the purification of ATB17, we noticed that the color of the fractions containing the enzyme was orange, rather than yellow like the wild-type AspAT and AV5A-7. Thus, the absorption spectra of the purified AspATs were measured (Fig. 1 B). AspAT has absorption bands in the region 300–500 nm, which derive from the bound PLP molecule and are influenced significantly by amino acid residues interacting with PLP (11$$Google Scholar, 26Jenkins W.T. Sizer I.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2655-2656Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Yano T. Mizuno T. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1810-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The wild-type AspAT and AV5A-7 exhibit two major bands around 360 and 430 nm, whereas in ATB17 the latter band is red-shifted to 450 nm and has a broad shoulder above 500 nm. The differences in the relative intensity of the two bands between the wild-type and mutant AspATs show that the pK a of the imine nitrogen of the Schiff base formed between PLP and Lys258 (26Jenkins W.T. Sizer I.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2655-2656Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Yano T. Mizuno T. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1810-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is decreased in both mutant AspATs. These changes in the absorption spectra imply that the electronic distribution within the π-electron system of the bound PLP molecule is changed significantly by the mutations, although the nature of these changes is difficult to predict. Despite such drastic changes in the substrate specificity and absorption spectrum, only one of the mutated residues in ATB17 appears to be located at a position contacting the substrate, and none of them interact directly with PLP. The higher affinity of ATB17 for valine allowed us to crystallize ATB17 in the presence of an amino-free valine analog, isovalerate, to further investigate the effects of the mutations. The x-ray crystal structure of ATB17 complexed with isovalerate was solved at 2.4-Å resolution (TableII) and was compared with the wild-type AspAT complexed with an aspartate analog, maleate (Fig.2). Three features stand out in the gross structure of ATB17. First, the spatial arrangement of the two subunits of the dimer is altered. Second, the domain motion may be enhanced in ATB17. Third, two clusters of mutated residues are observed, one shown in green (Leu-24, Asp-34, Met-37, and Asn-41) and the other shown in red (Thr-353, Phe-361, Gly-363, Leu-387, and Leu-397) in Fig. 2. These findings may provide clues to elucidate how the non-active site mutations influence the substrate binding of AspAT and thus are further described below.Table IICrystallographic parametersParameterValueDiffraction dataSpace groupC2221Unit cell dimensionsa (Å)157.00b (Å)84.84c (Å)78.62Total reflections61,169Unique reflections17,348Completeness (%)98.6 (98.3)aHighest resolution bin given in parentheses.Resolution range (Å)75.0–2.4R merge (%)bR merge =Σ i‖I i − <I i>‖/Σi <I i> where I i is the intensity of an individual reflection and <I i> is the mean intensity of that reflection.5.6Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)10.0–2.4Number of reflections16,005Number of protein atoms3,091Number of water molecules134R cryst(%)cR cryst = 100 × Σ ‖F obs − F calc ‖/Σ‖F obs ‖, where F obs andF calc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.18.7R free(%)dR free is calculated in the same manner asR cryst with 10% of random reflections excluded from refinement.23.5Deviations from ideal geometry (rms)Bond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (°)1.4Improper angles (°)1.27Dihedrals (°)23.6a Highest resolution bin given in parentheses.b R merge =Σ i‖I i − <I i>‖/Σi <I i> where I i is the intensity of an individual reflection and <I i> is the mean intensity of that reflection.c R cryst = 100 × Σ ‖F obs − F calc ‖/Σ‖F obs ‖, where F obs andF calc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.d R free is calculated in the same manner asR cryst with 10% of random reflections excluded from refinement. Open table in a new tab The rearrangement of the two subunits in ATB17 is evident. When the large domain (residues 49–325) of one subunit of ATB17 was superimposed on that of the wild-type AspAT, the other subunits of the two enzymes overlapped poorly (deviated about 1 Å in the core region of the large domain) (Fig. 2). This difference in the subunit arrangement likely affects substrate binding because the active site is located at the subunit interface, although it is not known which mutations caused this subunit rearrangement. The structure of AspAT changes from an “open” to a “closed” conformation when the substrate binds to the enzyme (12Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Picot D. Jansonius J.N. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the ATB17-isovalerate structure, the domain closure is enhanced. The small domain of ATB17 comes closer to the active site compared with the corresponding domain of the wild-type AspAT. One of the clusters (Fig.2, green), of which Met-37 is the only residue interacting with isovalerate, is located at the lid of the active site which closes against the bound substrate. The other cluster (Fig. 2, red) is in the core of the small domain, except Leu-397, and may affect the domain motion given that these residues are located at the domain interface. Thus, these two clusters may influence in concert the domain motion. Detailed analysis may help us to understand how the two clusters of mutated residues cause the observed conformational changes. Fig.3 shows that the enzyme structure is changed especially around the two clusters. The Leu20–Ile33 loop (the lid of the active site) shifts toward the active site while maintaining the overall configuration of the loop structure (Fig.4 B). The average deviation is about 1.5 Å, but the deviation is larger around the tip of the loop than around its bottom. This cluster of mutations is located at the hinge-like region and thus may cause the shift of the loop. On the other hand, the largest deviation in the whole molecule is observed at the domain interface (Fig. 3, position 363, and Fig.4 C). The backbone of Gly363–Gly364has flipped toward the solvent side. The Ser361 → Phe substitution would cause a steric hindrance due to its phenyl side chain. The Ser363 → Gly substitution yields two consecutive glycine residues of which the flexible backbone would flip to release the unfavorable strain. The effects of these two substitutions are, however, not fully cooperative because each substitution independently increased the activity for 2-oxovaline when added to AV5A-7. Other changes observed in Fig. 4 C would have occurred to readjust the packing of the side chains surrounding the cluster of the mutated residues. All the above findings, including changes in the dimer interface, likely influence the substrate specificity of AspAT, but we cannot explain how these changes allow AspAT to accommodate β-branched substrates.Figure 4Close-up views of the active site and the two clusters of the mutated residues. The residues are colored as shown in Fig. 2. The structure of the ATB17-isovalerate complex is indicated by thick gray lines and that of the wild-type AspAT-maleate complex is indicated by thin purple lines. A, several water molecules are introduced into the active site of ATB17 (light blue spheres). One water molecule (WAT1) is located at almost the same position as a water molecule observed in the wild-type AspAT (a purple sphere). Arg292, Val293, and Ser297 belong to the other subunit of the dimer (asterisks). Band C, viewed from the same direction as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trp140 is thought to adjust the tilt of the PLP molecule during the course of catalysis by AspAT (11$$Google Scholar, 14Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Chiristen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In the ATB17-isovalerate structure, large conformational changes are observed in the Pro138–Thr142 loop (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 A). This loop contains two substitutions, Ser139 → Gly and Asn142 → Thr. Trp140 is moved toward the “bottom” of the active site, making more space in the substrate binding pocket. The indole ring of Trp140 is stacked against the pyridine ring of PLP by the hydroxyl group of Thr142, which is bulkier than the hydrogen atom at the corresponding position of the side chain of the original Asn142. The resulting tight interaction of the π election systems of the indole ring and PLP may in part explain the spectral changes observed in ATB17. Interestingly, one of the evolved mutants we reported previously (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), AV5B-4, had an isoleucine residue at position 142, which also has a bulky methyl group at Cβ of the side chain. Thus, the PLP molecule may be required to be pushed back by Trp140 for AspAT to bind β-branched substrates. The wild-type AspAT has two arginine residues, Arg292 and Arg386, that are essential for substrate binding. Arg292 interacts with the side chain carboxylate group of acidic substrates. The side chain of Arg292 of ATB17 protrudes into solvent, whereas that of the wild-type AspAT flips toward the active site interacting with the carboxylate group of maleate (Fig. 4 A). The same shift in the position of Arg292 was observed previously in the crystal structure of a mutant AspAT complexed with aromatic substrate analogs (28Malashkevich V.N. Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the difference in the position of Arg292 between the two enzymes is caused by the difference in the bound substrate analogs, dicarboxylic maleate and monocarboxylic isovalerate, rather than by the mutations of ATB17. Arg386is also an important residue of which the side chain interacts with the α-carboxylate group of all amino acid substrates. The orientation of the Arg386 side chain of ATB17 remains essentially unaltered despite the large conformational changes adjacent to Arg386 (Fig. 4, A and C). One of the side walls of the active site consists of the residues belonging to the other subunit (Fig. 4 A,asterisks). Thus, the changes in the subunit interface in ATB17 have caused deviations of these residues. This portion of the active site also contains two substitutions, Ala293 → Val and Asn297 → Ser. Although the functional importance of the Ala293 → Val substitution is not clear, the Asn297 → Ser substitution increased the activity of AV5A-7 for 2-oxovaline (10Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It was reported previously for the mutant AspAT with increased activity for aromatic substrates that the Asn297 → Ser substitution eliminates a structural water molecule which is held in place by the side chains of Ser296 and Asn297 in the wild-type AspAT, concomitantly introducing new water molecules (28Malashkevich V.N. Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Malashkevichet al. (28Malashkevich V.N. Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) proposed that this substitution makes space for the binding of bulky aromatic substrates. In our case, however, the side chain of isovalerate is much smaller than those of aromatic substrates, and, indeed, a water molecule (Fig. 4 A, WAT1) is re-introduced at almost the same position, constituting the side wall of the isovalerate-binding pocket together with the other newly introduced water molecules. We thus cannot explain how the Asn297 → Ser substitution increases the activity for valine. Met37 constitutes the upper wall of the isovalerate binding pocket and is the only mutated residue contacting isovalerate. The Ile37 → Met substitution would apparently benefit the binding of β-branched substrates by removing the steric hindrance between the γ-methyl groups of the Ile37 side chain and the bound substrate. To determine how important this substitution is, we mutated Met37 of ATB17 back to isoleucine. Thek cat/K m values of this revertant for valine and 2-oxovaline were decreased 4- and 2-fold, respectively; the k cat, K m, and k cat/K m values for valine were 15 ± 1 s−1, 30 ± 5 mm, and 500 s−1m−1, respectively, and those for 2-oxovaline were 31 ± 2 s−1, 1.8 ± 0.3 mm, and 1.7 × 104 s−1m−1, respectively. This shows that the Ile37 → Met substitution contributes only 5–10% to the total effect of all the mutations of ATB17 (calculated as follows: (1 − (RTln{(k cat/K m)ATB17/Met37 → Ile/(k cat/K m)WT})/(RTln{(k cat/K m)ATB17/(k cat/K m)WT})) × 100 (%)). The isolation of a mutant AspAT with a million-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency for a non-native substrate shows that directed evolution is a powerful technique for altering enzyme activity. Our present selection system could also be used to produce an enzyme with transaminase activity from that with an unrelated activity. The three-dimensional structure of a complex between the mutant AspAT and a substrate analog suggests that conformational changes in the enzyme are responsible for the alteration in the substrate specificity. Significantly, only one of the 17 mutated residues contacts the substrate directly. Several of the mutations that particularly enhance the activity for β-branched substrates are located >10 Å distance from the active site."

Spatial isolation of the cross-linkable blocks of oligobutadiene that were involved in this stitching reaction was achieved by self-assembly of the molecules that made up the clusters. Thermal activation of cross-linking yielded macromolecules (molecular weight of 70,000) with a narrow size distribution that was similar to that of the supramolecular clusters. The macromolecules obtained have an anisotropic shape (2 nanometers by 8 nanometers), as determined by electron microscopy and small-angle x-ray scattering, and form materials that exhibit a liquid crystalline state."

Proteolysis is fundamental for the normal functioning of multicellular organisms and plays key roles in a variety of processes such as development, physiology, defense and stress responses, and adaptation to the changing environment. In plants, despite the importance of all these processes and involvement of different classes of proteinases (Refs. 1Glazer A.N. Smith E.L. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 3.

A major task for research will be to determine which pathway of proteolysis is responsible for the degradation of particular proteins. The serine proteases are one of the best characterized groups of proteolytic enzymes in higher organisms. They can be grouped in six clans, of which one of the largest is the subtilisin-like clan (EC3.4.21.14) that includes over 200 different members. Despite this wealth of knowledge, very little is know about subtilisin-like proteases in plants. Recently, we and others have shown the existence of members of this clan in plants, including Arabidopsis(6Ribeiro A. Akkermans A.D.L. van Kammen A. Bisseling T. Pawlowski K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 789-794Google Scholar), tomato (7Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Tornero P.

Plant J. 1997; 12: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). According to a recent classification (11Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), the subtilisin-like proteases from plants can be grouped within the Pyrolysinsubfamily, which is highly related to the Kexin subfamily of proteases involved in the posttranslational processing of peptide hormones (12Barr P.J.

Comparative molecular, biochemical, and cellular studies indicate that the subgroup of plant subtilisin-like enzymes are characterized by the presence of a large polypeptide sequence insertion preceding the reactive Ser residue and/or long C-terminal extensions relative to all other subtilisin-like proteases. Furthermore, they were found to be glycosylated and to be secreted to the plant extracellular matrix (ECM) where they accumulated and presumably exert their biochemical function(s) by recognizing and processing pericellular substrates (7Tornero P.

We here describe the isolation and characterization of a genomic cluster comprised of four genes encoding different, but highly related, members of subtilisin-like proteases (named as P69A,P69B, P69C, and P69D). While the four clustered proteases exhibit a high degree of amino acid sequence identity, we show that they are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level, each showing a different expression pattern, either during normal plant development or following pathogenic attack. Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Rutgers andArabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants were grown at 22 °C in growth chambers programmed for a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle. Fully expanded leaves or rosette leaves were sprayed with SA (0.5 mm) or buffer alone (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2), and samples were taken for analysis after 48 h. Suspensions of Pseudomonas syringae strains (0.09 O.D.) were infiltrated locally in one part of the leaf. Control (mock) plants were injected similarly with the solution containing no bacteria. Samples were analyzed 24–48 h post-inoculation. A tomato genomic DNA library constructed in λ-EMBL3 was screened at 65 °C as described (14Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the radiolabeled p26 cDNA encoding the prepro sequence of the PR-P69 protein described previously (7Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The positive clones were isolated and characterized with the routine described previously (14Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis, quantification of the products, and reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR1 were conducted as described (8Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14412-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer pairs (50 pmol each), a1 + a2 (ATGGGATTCTT GAAAATCCTT + TCAACAAAAGTGCAATTGGACTTC), b1 + b2 (ATGGGATT CTTGAAAATCCTT + CCTAGGCAGACACAACTGCAAT), c1 + c2 (ATGGGAT TCTTGAAAATCCTT + TCATATCAATGTCCTCTCAAAGAG) and d1 + d2 (ATGGGATTCTTGAAAATT + TTATTCAGCAGACACTCTAACTGC), specific for the amplification of P69A, P69B, P69C, andP69D sequences, respectively, were used to amplify by PCR the in vitro synthesized single-stranded cDNA from the different mRNA sources in a Perkin-Elmer/Cetus DNA Cycler. PCR amplification was programmed as described before (8Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14412-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragments were visualized in agarose gels, or alternatively, they were hybridized with a radiolabeled p26 cDNA probe. The inability of each combination of primers to amplify the closely related P69 sequences was confirmed in control PCR reactions that included 10 ng of plasmid DNA containing each of the four P69 ORFs as template. Oligonucleotides GEN69a (5′-GCCCGGGGGCTTGCAAATGGTATAG-3′), GEN69b (5′-GCCCGGGGGCTAGCTAATACAACAAGTG-3′), GEN69c (5′-GCCCGGGGGCTGCAAATACAAGAAG-3′), and GEN69d (5′-GCC CCGGGTTGCTGGTATAGAGTAATTGG-3′) in combination with the T7 oligonucleotide served as primers for the incorporation of a synthetic SmaI restriction site in each promoter by site-directed mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). These primers introduced theSmaI site at positions −1 relative to the translation initiation sites in each gene. SmaI-BamHI fragments encompassing each of the P69 promoter regions were cloned upstream of the β-glucuronidase gene in pBI101.1 (16Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4032) Google Scholar) to generate plasmids pP69A::GUS,pP69B::GUS, pP69C::GUS, andpP69D::GUS. The resulting transcriptional fusions were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis using specific primers. The constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis plants byAgrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation. Transformants were selected on MS agar medium containing kanamycin, transferred to soil, and allowed to self. The transgenic lines were assayed for GUS activity by a fluorimetric assay or by an in situ assay using the colorigenic substrate X-gluc (16Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4032) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding the signal sequence and propeptide for the previously identified P69 protease was obtained from plasmid p26 (7Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and used as a radiolabeled probe to screen a tomato genomic library constructed in λ-EMBL3, and different clones were isolated. After a third round of screening and purification, three λ clones (λ-5, λ-2, and λ-3′) were finally selected for restriction analysis and sequencing. These analyses revealed that the genomic DNA inserts of the three λ clones were overlapping clones encompassing ∼41 kb of genomic DNA. Alignment of the genomic sequences revealed the presence of a tandem of four transcription units that were highly similar (Fig.1). The first one, from here on designated as P69A, was identical to the previously identified P69 cDNA contained in plasmid p26. The last one in the row, and designated as P69B, was identical to the previously reported cDNA clone p9 (8Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14412-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Between the P69A andP69B transcription units, two additional ones, designatedP69C and P69D, were identified. The four genes were intronless. While the nucleotide sequence homology for the four open reading frames was quite high (in the range of 75 to 85% identical), the comparison of the 5′ promoter regions (preceding the ATG initiation codon) or the 3′ region after the polyadenylation signal of each gene revealed no homology between them. However, in all cases, putative TATA boxes and CAAT boxes shortly upstream of the ATG initiation codon were observed (data not shown). As deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames, the P69A,B, C, and D genes encode polypeptides of 745 aa (78,990 Da; pI 6.17), 745 aa (78,990 Da; pI 6.71), 666 aa (70,680 Da; pI 5.26), and 747 aa (79,260 Da; pI 7.38), respectively (Figs. 2 and3).Figure 2Amino acid sequence alignment for the predicted P69 gene products.

The prosequence comprises a hydrophobic signal peptide at the extreme N terminus which, accordingly to von Heijne (17Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), is cleaved C-terminal of the conserved Ser-22 residue. In all cases, the signal peptide is followed by a 92-amino acid prosequence, which is a typical feature of proteases of the subtilisin family, and its cleavage is mandatory for the generation of the active protease from the inactive zymogen (18Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The putative N-terminal amino acid of the mature proteins is the conserved Thr-115, identified also by comparison with other plant subtilisin-like proteases (6Ribeiro A. Akkermans A.D.L. van Kammen A. Bisseling T. Pawlowski K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 789-794Google Scholar, 7Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The predicted mature enzymes thus contain 631, 631, 552, and 632 amino acids for the P69A, P69B, P69C, and P69D isoforms, respectively. Within the four mature proteins, the amino acid residues Asp-146, His-203, and Ser-532 (or Ser-531 for P69B and p69C), corresponding to the catalytic site (catalytic triad) essential for the enzymatic activity of subtilisin-like members to function as proteases, were identified (Fig. 2). Also the proteases of the four P69s in the cluster have an Asn residue (Asn-306, or Asn-305 for P69B and P69C) that has been found to be highly conserved in this position and that is catalytically important in the subtilisins (12Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar,13Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, sequences close to this Asn-306 are highly variable within the four P69s (Fig. 2). In all cases there is also an insertion of a long sequence (226 amino acids) between the stabilizing Asn-306 and the reactive Ser-532, relative to all other subtilisin-like proteases (11Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), in which these two residues are separated by much shorter distances. This displacement has also been observed in the three other subtilisin-like proteinases recently identified from plants (6Ribeiro A. Akkermans A.D.L. van Kammen A. Bisseling T. Pawlowski K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 789-794Google Scholar, 9Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taylor A.A. Horsch A. Rzepczyk A. Hasenkampf C.A. Daniel Riggs C. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and could represent a characteristic signature of the subtilisin enzymes from plants (Fig. 3). The differential expression pattern of the four P69 genes was initially determined by gene-specific RT-PCR reactions combined with Southern blot analyses. In vitro synthesized single-stranded cDNAs from mRNA samples of fully grown leaves from healthy and Pseudomonas syringaepv. syringae-infected tomato plants were assayed by PCR using sets of primers which were specific for each P69 gene member. Primer specificity was demonstrated in pilot experiments using each of the individually cloned gene as template in the PCR reaction (Fig. 4). Whereas P69AmRNAs accumulate to detectable levels in fully expanded leaves of healthy tomato plants, the P69D mRNAs accumulate in marginal amounts in the same leaf samples. Neither P69A norP69D were found to be induced over basal levels in leaves that were infected with P. syringae. Conversely, similar RT-PCR analysis with primers specific for the P69B gene and the P69C gene indicated that while the corresponding mRNAs were nearly undetectable in leaves from healthy control plants, a dramatic accumulation of the transcripts occurred in P. syringae-infected leaves (Fig. 4). To investigate in detail the spatial pattern of expression of the four P69 genes, each of the 5′ flanking promoter regions was fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in plasmid pBI101.1 to generate constructs pP69A::GUS, pP69B::GUS, pP69C::GUS, and pP69D::GUS (Fig.5). These constructs were introduced separately into Arabidopsis plants by transformation withA. tumefaciens, and a minimum of ten independent kanamycin-resistant transformants were generated for each construct. GUS activity was initially analyzed in plants grown under normal growth conditions and also after inoculation with the avirulent bacteriaP. syringae DC3000 (AvrRpm1) by a fluorimetric assay (16Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4032) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These assays revealed constitutive expression of GUS activity in the transgenic plants generated with constructP69A::GUS and P69D::GUS, whereas those harboring the P69B::GUS or theP69C::GUS cassette expressed GUS activity only upon bacterial infection (see below). These results were, to some extent, coincident with the RT-PCR studies shown above (Fig. 4). To study comparatively the distribution of GUS activity inplanta, the initial transgenic plants generated for each construct were selfed, and the kanamycin-resistant progeny was analyzedin situ using the chromogenic substrate X-Gluc (Fig.6). Expression of GUS activity driven by the P69A promoter was detected in the seedlings as well as in fully grown plants. As deduced from the tissue staining pattern, it seems as if the P69A gene is expressed in a general fashion in all organs of the plant, except in roots and in flower organs, where no GUS activity could be detected in any plant. Likewise, transgenic plants in which GUS expression was driven by theP69D promoter revealed that this is active predominantly in expanding cotyledons and leaves (Fig. 6). This expression was transient because it disappeared once the leaves or cotyledons had enlarged and matured. Interestingly, the P69D gene is also observed to be expressed in inflorescences, and more particularly, in stigmas. We still do not know whether or not this expression pattern in flowers is also transient. Conversely, no constitutive expression of the GUS gene driven by theP69B or P69C promoters could be detected in any of the transgenic plants generated (Fig. 6). However, in some of the P69C::GUS transgenic lines, we could detect GUS activity in discrete groups of cells (islands) that appeared sporadically, and with an unpredictable location, either in stems, roots or leaves (not shown). Induced expression was also analyzed in rosette leaves from transgenic plants before and after inoculation with P. syringae pv.tomato (Pst) strain DC3000 carrying the avrRpm1avirulence gene, which is recognized by the corresponding resistance gene in A. thaliana ecotype Col-0. Pst DC3000(avrRpm1) and causes a macroscopic hypersensitive response (HR) at the inoculation site. These studies revealed that GUS expression driven by either the P69B and P69Cpromoters was induced in the infected leaves. Induction occurred throughout the inoculated leaves and was not restricted to the site of inoculation where the HR became apparent (Fig.7). Conversely, in transgenic plants carrying P69A::GUS orP69D::GUS constructs, GUS expression was not induced during the course of infection. Because salicylic acid (SA) has been demonstrated to be a master regulatory molecule mediating most of the plant defense responses to challenging pathogens (19Enyedi A.J. Yalpani N. Silverman P. Raskin Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 879-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we tested whether or not SA could act as inducer of any of these genes. Spraying of healthy transgenicArabidopsis plants with a 0.5 mm solution of SA resulted in the induction of GUS activity only in plants harboring theP69B::GUS and P69C::GUStransgenes, and in a manner similar to that observed following bacteria inoculation (Fig. 7). These results further reinforce our consideration that the P69B and P69C gene pair is involved in pathogenic response of the plant to challenging pathogens, whereas theP69A and P69D pair is more related to development or to a basic biochemical function. In this work, we provide structural and functional information on a genomic cluster comprising four different members of a family of plant genes, which on the basis of amino acid sequence conservation and structural organization are related to the subtilisin-like protease clan (EC 3.4.21.14) (11Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The genomic cluster was identified by screening of a genomic DNA library from tomato plants with a partial cDNA probe for the previously identified pathogenesis-related PR-P69 protease (7Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (here renamed as P69A). The predicted primary structure of the four P69 proteases designated P69A, P69B, P69C, and P69D, indicate that all of them are synthesized as precursor proteins (preproenzyme) composed of three distinct domains: a 22-amino acid signal peptide, a 92-amino acid propolypeptide, and a mature polypeptide of variable length for each protease in the cluster. Within the mature polypeptides, the amino acid sequences surrounding Asp-146, His-203, and Ser-531 are the most salient features of all these proteases, which are identical to those of the catalytic sites (catalytic triad) of subtilisins (11Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Interesting also is the conservation of an insertion of a long sequence (226 amino acids) between the conserved Asn residue and the reactive Ser residues of the catalytic triad, relative to all other subtilisin-like proteases. The meaning of such a conserved displacement remains unknown, but its conservation suggests it may subserve important functions in regulating the properties of this subgroup of subtilases in plants. Comparative studies of the mode of expression by RT-PCR and by analysis of transgenic plants harboring independent promoter-GUS fusions for the four P69 genes indicate that they are regulated differently.P69A is transcribed at all stages of plant growth and in all organs except roots and flowers where the expression is absent. Likewise, P69D is also transcribed under resting conditions in emerging leaves, but its expression is transient. This transient expression pattern, which has been observed also in transgenic tobacco plants (data not shown), is presumably associated with the elongation processes in these organs because transcription is repressed once the leaves cease elongation. Although P69D is not expressed in roots, transcription is specifically recovered in flowers, and in the stigma in particular. Neither P69A nor P69D gene expression is induced over basal levels during pathogenesis. Conversely, although neither P69B or P69C show constitutive expression in any organ of plants grown under resting conditions, both are transcriptionally activated upon infection with avirulent bacteria, either in transgenic Arabidopsis plants or in tomato plants. This latter result is consistent with our previous observations that one member of this family, now identified as P69B on the basis of sequence identity, is coordinately induced with a set of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins associated with the defense response in tomato plants (7Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Vera P. Conejero V. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vera P. Conejero V. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 323-334Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the observation that the induced transcriptional activation of P69B and P69C is not restricted to the point of inoculation with the avirulent bacteria (Fig. 7), where the HR cell death and the induction of protective genes occur (22Dixon R.A. Lamb C.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 339-367Crossref Scopus (557) Google Scholar), but rather is extended throughout the afflicted leaf blade suggests that their induction is mediated by a long distance signaling process. Because the benzoic acid-derivative SA is one of the candidate signal molecules mediating long distance activation of plant defense reactions (19Enyedi A.J. Yalpani N. Silverman P. Raskin Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 879-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of SA to induce expression of these two pathogen-inducible genes. The result presented in Fig. 7 demonstrates that local application of SA to leaves promotes the transcription of both genes de novo. Thus, these results reconcile with the idea that proteases, and in particular members of the subtilisin-like family, are components of the general plant response to attacking pathogens. The differential expression profile found for these four P69genes indicate that different regulatory mechanisms have evolved to control the expression of these genes either during normal growth or under pathological situations. It remains to be demonstrated whether or not these differential expression patterns also imply different roles for the protein products. In this regard, it is tempting to speculate that the permanent expression of the P69A gene at the different stages of growth of the plant may suggest a housekeeping function for the P69A protein and that this function may be advantageously enhanced during processes of plant cell elongation and/or pathogenesis by supplementing with the other isoforms that may serve backup functions to the principal protease. It has been demonstrated in animal systems, where natural substrates for subtilisin-like proteases have been identified (12Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 13Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that when the different protease members of a family are removed from their biological context and assayed in vitro, many of these proteases are able to process the same substrates. This observation again raises the question of whether such a functional redundancy exists among the family members in vivo and how this might be regulated. One insight into defining functionality has been provided by examining the expression of the individual protease members (23Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). From such analysis, it has been shown that protease substrate specificity in vivo is influenced by restricting expression to particular tissues and also by compartmentalization of the individual enzymes to specific intracellular locations (24Seidah N.G. Day R. Hamelin J. Gaspar A. Collard M.W. Chrétien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be the case that a similar regulation also applies for the differentially regulated P69 protease isoforms under consideration as a likely explanation for delimiting redundant functions in vivo. Alternatively, we cannot disregard the possibility that each member functions separately by recognizing different substrate(s) and thus implies that both function and gene expression patterns evolved coordinately, but separately, for each P69 protease. Whatever the meaning of such complexity is, the diversification of either the regulation of gene expression or function for each member of the P69 clan would be in agreement with the polymorphism found for other unrelated gene families in higher plants, which arise from gene duplication events of a common ancestral gene (25Sharrock R.A. Quail P.H. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1745-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 26Liang X. Abel S. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11046-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). So far, only two protein substrates have been identified for these plant subtilisin-like proteases. One is systemin, the traveling peptide hormone mediating signaling processes during wound response in plants (27Schaller A. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11802-11806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the other is LRP (28Tornero P. Mayda M.E. Gómez M.D. Cañas L. Conejero V. Vera P. Plant J. 1996; 10: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), an extracellular matrix associated leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein that is part of a family of proteins that mediate molecular recognition and/or protein interaction processes (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Subtilisin-like enzymes have been shown to be secreted to the plant extracellular matrix (ECM) (30Vera P. Hernández-Yago J. Conejero V. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 119-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the consideration that the P69s may be mediating in pericellular processing/degradation events may indicate a role, similar to those in some animal systems (31Alexander C.M. Werb Z. Hay E. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 255-302Crossref Google Scholar, 32Chen W.-T. Curr. Opin.

The retinoblastoma protein (pRB)1 is a key regulator of the mammalian cell cycle. Through repression of the growth-promoting E2F transcription factors, pRB controls the transition from the G1 to the S phase (1Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). pRB function is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases, which phosphorylate pRB in a characteristic cell cycle-dependent manner (2Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In addition, pRB plays a pivotal role during development and differentiation. The multifunctional character of pRB has been demonstrated by targeted disruption of the retinoblastoma gene in mice. Homozygous mutant embryos die in utero and show abnormalities in hematopoiesis and neurogenesis (3Riley D.J. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Lee W.-H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Numerous ex vivo studies have established the importance of pRB in myocyte differentiation (4Walsh K. Perlman H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). pRB has been shown to interact physically and functionally with members of the myogenic MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (5Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), and pRB-deficient cells fail to undergo terminal myogenesis (6Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 441-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This included a defect in expression of late differentiation markers, reduced myoblast fusion, a failure to terminally withdraw from the cell cycle, and an increased incidence of apoptosis (6Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Science. 1994; 264: 1467-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 7Novitch B.G. Mulligan G.J. Jacks T. Lassar A.B. J.

These observations have also been seen in vivo when pRB is expressed at subphysiological levels (9Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J.D. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Adipocyte differentiation is a complex process regulated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and the adipocyte determination and differentiation-dependent factor-1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (ADD1/SREBP1) (10Brun R.P.

C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are induced very early during differentiation and have been shown to promote adipogenesis, possibly through induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ (13Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of C/EBPα is adipogenic in fibroblasts, and abrogation of C/EBPα expression blocks adipocyte differentiation (11Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). PPARs are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Ligands for PPARγ include the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione drugs and certain prostaglandin J2 derivatives (17Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J.

Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and addition of ligands to fibroblasts expressing PPARγ endogenously or ectopically induces or promotes adipose conversion (17Lehmann J.M.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). ADD1/SREBP1 is also induced early in the differentiation program and promotes adipogenesis (22Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of ADD1/SREBP1 was recently shown to induce the synthesis of an unidentified PPARγ activating ligand (23Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Adipocyte differentiation ex vivo requires growth arrest, usually obtained by growing cells to confluence. Following stimulation with adipogenic factors, density-arrested preadipocytes undergo several rounds of postconfluent cell divisions (clonal expansion), followed by terminal withdrawal from the cell cycle, expression of adipocyte markers, and accumulation of intracellular lipid (24Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21473-21478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The importance of pRB in adipocyte differentiation has been amply demonstrated. It was shown that the ability of a truncated simian virus 40 large T antigen to block adipocyte differentiation is dependent on its ability to sequester the pRB family (pRB, p107, p130) (25Higgins C. Chatterjee S. Cherington V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 745-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently it was demonstrated that lung fibroblasts from RB −/−mouse embryos are unable to undergo adipose conversion unless rescued by an RB transgene (26Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pRB was shown to physically interact with C/EBPs, promote the binding of C/EBPβ to its cognate DNA response element, and increase its transactivation capacity (26Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 27Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen-Kiang S. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The functional interaction with C/EBPβ suggests that pRB plays an important role early in the adipocyte differentiation program. Finally, regulated phosphorylation and expression of the three pRB family members during adipose conversion have recently been demonstrated (24Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21473-21478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Richon V.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10117-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, we used fibroblasts from normal andRB −/− mouse embryos to further characterize the importance and functions of pRB in adipocyte differentiation. We show that transactivation by PPARγ is not dependent on pRB. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) express PPARγ1 in the predifferentiated state, and the inability of pRB-deficient MEFs to differentiate is efficiently bypassed by addition of PPARγ ligands. The differentiatedRB −/− MEFs accumulate lipid and express adipocyte markers. Surprisingly, adipocyte differentiation ofRB −/− MEFs was found not to be accompanied by compensatory up-regulation of p107 and p130 expression, andRB +/+ as well as RB −/−MEFs effectively withdraw from the cell cycle following clonal expansion. The preparation of wild-type and RB −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) has been described previously (29Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). MEFs were grown in AmnioMax basal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 7.5% AmnioMax-C100 supplement, 2 mmglutamine, 62.5 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Medium was changed every other day. For differentiation, 2-day postconfluent cells (day 0) were treated with growth medium containing 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mmmethylisobutylxanthine (Aldrich), 5 μg/ml insulin (Boehringer Mannheim), and BRL49653 (0.5 μm unless otherwise indicated) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 2 days. From day 2, medium contained 5 μg/ml insulin and BRL49653 or vehicle. MEFs were not used beyond passage 10. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% bovine serum and differentiated as described (30Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-day postconfluent cells (day 0) were induced to differentiate with DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mmmethylisobutylxanthine, and 1 μg/ml insulin. After 48 h, medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml insulin, and the cells were subsequently fed every other day with DMEM containing 10% FBS. RB gene disruption via insertion of the hygromycin resistance gene in exon 19 was detected as described previously (29Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of genomic DNA from individual MEFs were used for PCR amplification. To detect disruption of RB alleles, the following upstream and downstream primers were used: CGATCTTAGCCAGACGAGCG(within the hygromycin resistance gene) and TGAGGCTGCTTGTGTCTGTG (within exon 19 ofRB). To detect wild-type RB alleles, the downstream exon 19 primer was used in combination with the following upstream primer: GACTAGGTGAAGGAATGCAGAG (within intron 18 ofRB). As a control, we amplified part of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene using the following primers: ATTGGGCGCCTGGTCAC and CCAGAGGGGCCATCCAC. Following a 10-min denaturation/activation of DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold, Perkin Elmer), 35 cycles were performed as follows: 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 20 s (62 °C for GAPDH), 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels. Dishes were washed in PBS and cells fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, followed by staining with Oil Red O for 1 h. Oil Red O was prepared by diluting a stock solution (0.5 g of Oil Red O (Sigma) in 100 ml of isopropanol) with water (6:4) followed by filtration. After staining, plates were washed twice in water and photographed.

The human cervix carcinoma cell line C33A was grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were transfected with the DC-Chol method as described (38Gao X. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested approximately 48 h after transfection. The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in cell lysates were determined by standard techniques. Plates were washed twice in TBS and cells were lysed on the plates by addition of an SDS sample buffer containing 2.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mm dithioerythritol, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (1/50 tablet per ml) (Boehringer Mannheim). Lysis of cells was immediately followed by 3 min of boiling. Lysates were subsequently treated with benzon nuclease (Merck). Whole cell extracts were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). One hundred μg of protein were loaded in each lane. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Micron Separation) using a Kem-En-Tec semidry blotter. Equal loading/transfer was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight in PBS (or TBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies was performed in PBS (or TBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1–2 h. After incubation with antibodies, membranes were washed in PBS (or TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20. PBS was used in all experiments except for those in which the mouse anti-human pRB antibody (G3–245, PharMingen) was used. Here, TBS was used instead. Other primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-human p107 (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-human p130 (Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-human TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-mouse aP2/adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) (kindly provided by David A. Bernlohr), rabbit anti-PPARγ antibody recognizing both PPARγ isoforms (kindly provided by Mitchell A. Lazar), and rabbit antibodies against mouse C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (kindly provided by M. Daniel Lane). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (DAKO). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for detection. Stripping of membranes was done by boiling for 5–10 min in water. Total RNA was purified as described (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The integrity of all RNA samples was confirmed by electrophoresis in denaturing formaldehyde-containing gels. Reverse transcriptions were performed in 25-μl reactions containing 1 μg of total RNA, 3 μg of random hexamers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.9 mm dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). Reactions were left 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. After cDNA synthesis, reactions were diluted with 50 μl of water and frozen at −80 °C. Multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed essentially as described (40Jensen J. Serup P. Karlsen C. Nielsen T.F. Madsen O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with minor changes. PCR was done in 25-μl reactions containing 1.5 μl of diluted cDNA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 40 μm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, 20 μmdCTP, 5 pmol of each primer, 1.25 units of Taq polymerase, and 1.25 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products). Reaction mixtures were denatured at 94 °C for 1 min. Denaturation was followed by 20 or 25 cycles (depending on the primers used) of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 90 s. All reactions contained the TBP primer set as an internal standard together with one or two additional primer sets. In reactions coamplifying PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, 10 pmol of the common 3′ primer was included. All reactions were performed with 25 cycles, except those containing the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) primer set for which 20 cycles were employed. Primers used were: C/EBPα, 5′-GAACAGCAACGAGTACCGGGTA, 3′- GCCATGGCCTTGACCAAGGAG (225 bp); GPDH, 5′-GTGGTACCCCATCAGTTCATTG, 3′-GTCCTTCAGGAGCTGTCCCTG (264 bp); PPARγ1, 5′-CACGTTCTGACAGGACTGTGT, 3′-CAGCAACCATTGGGTCAGCTC (288 bp); PPARγ2, 5′-CCAGAGCATGGTGCCTTCGCT, 3′-CAGCAACCATTGGGTCAGCTC (241 bp); TBP, 5′-ACCCTTCACCAATGACTCCTATG, 3′-ATGATGACTGCAGCAAATCGC (190 bp). Ten μl of each reaction were dried down and resuspended in formamide dye mix (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.2% bromphenol blue, 0.2% xylene cyanol) and loaded onto 0.4 mm, 8 m urea, 1× TBE, 6% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was for 3 h at 50 watts. Gels were dried and exposed overnight to phosphorimage storage screens. Screens were scanned on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). At the indicated time points, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) was added to the plates to a final concentration of 10 μm, and incubation was continued for 20 min. Cells were then harvested by trypsinization, washed in 0.9% NaCl, fixed in 75% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C until further analysis. Cells were treated with pepsin before incubation with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Becton Dickinson), followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (DAKO). Cells were RNase-treated and stained with propidium iodide before loading onto an Epics Profile I flow cytometer. Transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors is dependent on recruitment of coactivator proteins. pRB has recently been shown to modulate the activity of the thyroid hormone and glucocorticoid receptors by interaction with coactivators (41Chang K.-H. Chen Y. Chen T.-T. Chou W.-H. Chen P.-L. Ma Y.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Leng X. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9040-9045Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Singh P. Coe J. Hong W. Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Trip230 was shown to be a thyroid hormone receptor (TR) coactivator and a pRB-interacting protein (41Chang K.-H. Chen Y. Chen T.-T. Chou W.-H. Chen P.-L. Ma Y.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Leng X. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9040-9045Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). pRB was able to sequester Trip230 from TR, thereby down-regulating the activity of TR. Contrary to the effect on TR, pRB was found to potentiate glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated transactivation by direct interaction with hBrm (42Singh P. Coe J. Hong W. Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a previously identified GR coactivator (35Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). To examine whether the transcriptional activity of PPARγ was modulated by pRB, we analyzed the transactivation potential of full-length PPARγ2 in the human cell line C33A which does not express functional pRB. C33A cells have previously been used to demonstrate potentiation of GR transactivation by pRB (42Singh P. Coe J. Hong W. Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, PPARγ is transactivating the reporter in C33A cells (column 3), and addition of the high affinity PPARγ ligand BRL49653 further enhances its activity (column 4). Coexpression of pRB has little or no effect on either BRL49653-dependent or -independent transactivation by PPARγ (compare columns 3 and 7 and columns 4 and8). As expected, no effect on PPARγ transactivation was observed by coexpressing the nonfunctional pRB mutant pRB(H209) (compare columns 3 and 11 andcolumns 4 and 12). Since C33A cells express no hBrm (35Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), we wanted to rule out the possibility that pRB affected PPARγ transactivation via this coactivator. This appeared not to be the case, as we observed no effect on PPARγ transactivation by coexpression of hBrm, neither in the presence nor in the absence of pRB (data not shown). As a positive control, we tested the effect of pRB on E2F-mediated transactivation. Fig. 1 B shows that pRB represses basal reporter activity, probably by repressing endogenous E2F in C33A cells (compare columns 1 and3). Furthermore, E2F-1-induced transactivation of the reporter (column 2) was partially repressed by coexpression of pRB (column 4). The pRB mutant failed to repress either basal reporter activity or E2F-1-induced reporter activity (compare columns 1 and5 and columns 2 and 6). From these experiments, we conclude that transactivation by PPARγ is independent of pRB in C33A cells. The use of embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice with targeted disruptions of specific genes is a powerful tool in deciphering the importance and functions of proteins in cellular differentiation. By using lung fibroblasts from mouse embryos with targeted disruption of the RB gene, the importance of pRB in adipocyte differentiation was demonstrated (26Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). pRB and C/EBPs were shown to interact, and it was demonstrated that pRB potentiated transactivation by C/EBPβ (26Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 27Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen-Kiang S. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To further characterize the importance and function of pRB in adipose conversion, we examined the potential of different known adipogenic inducers to support adipocyte differentiation of fibroblasts from normal and RB −/− mouse embryos (29Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with MEFs from one wild-type (MEFA) and two pRB-deficient (ME3 and ME8) mouse embryos. Genotypes were validated by genomic PCR (Fig. 2 A), and the absence of pRB expression in RB −/− MEFs was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B) and immunostaining (data not shown). Using a standard differentiation protocol including treatment with dexamethasone, methylisobutylxanthine, and insulin (DMI treatment), only the RB +/+ MEFs differentiated to a significant degree (Fig. 3,A and B (a and c)). This is in agreement with previous results (26Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, we consistently observed some pRB-deficient cells accumulating lipid in response to the DMI treatment (Fig. 3 B, e). In one of theRB −/− MEFs (ME8), only a few cells accumulated lipid in response to standard inducers, whereas, in the other (ME3), approximately 1% of the cells accumulated lipid. By RT-PCR and Western blotting, we found that all three MEFs express PPARγ1 mRNA and protein in the predifferentiated state (see Fig.4). Therefore, we hypothesized that addition of a high affinity ligand for PPARγ might be able to bypass the block in adipose conversion imposed by the absence of pRB. Addition of BRL49653 to the standard differentiation medium efficiently promoted differentiation of RB −/− as well asRB +/+ MEFs (Fig. 3, A andB (b and d)). The ligand concentration needed to bypass the defective differentiation inRB −/− MEFs was in agreement with theK d of BRL49653 binding to PPARγ (17Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) in that differentiation was promoted with 50 nm BRL49653 (data not shown). Furthermore, even though predifferentiated MEFs express low levels of PPARδ and PPARα mRNA (data not shown), the concentration of BRL49653 use"
https://openalex.org/W2063441753,"To understand the molecular basis of granule release from platelets, we examined the role of vesicle-associated membrane protein, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 in α-granule secretion. A vesicle-associated membrane protein, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 were detected in platelet lysate. These proteins form a SDS-resistant complex that disassembles upon platelet activation. To determine whether these proteins are involved in α-granule secretion, we developed a streptolysin O-permeabilized platelet model of α-granule secretion. Streptolysin O-permeabilized platelets released α-granules, as measured by surface expression of P-selectin, in response to Ca2+ up to 120 min after permeabilization. Incubation of streptolysinO-permeabilized platelets with an antibody directed against vesicle-associated membrane protein completely inhibited Ca2+-induced α-granule release. Tetanus toxin cleaved platelet vesicle-associated membrane protein and inhibited Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion from streptolysinO-permeabilized platelets. An antibody to syntaxin 4 also inhibited Ca2+-induced α-granule release by approximately 75% in this system. These results show that vesicle-associated membrane protein, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 form a heterotrimeric complex in platelets that disassembles with activation and demonstrate that α-granule release is dependent on vesicle SNAP receptor-target SNAP receptor (vSNARE-tSNARE) interactions.

These granules contain many components that have been implicated in thrombosis and atherosclerosis, including adhesion molecules, coagulation factors, soluble mediators of inflammation, and growth factors (1Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Shattil S. Benz E.J. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 2 Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York1995: 1524-1535Google Scholar). α-Granule constituents are released from the platelet after platelet stimulation. Secretion of α-granules is tightly controlled to prevent unregulated release. Although there are many known signal transduction pathways that are activated concurrently with α-granule secretion, little is known regarding the mechanisms that lead directly to membrane fusion between granules and surface-connected membranes. Ultrastructural studies have shown that the α-granules of platelets are secreted primarily via fusion with the surface-connected open canalicular system (2Escolar G. White J.G. Blood Cells. 1991; 17: 467-495PubMed Google Scholar) after apparent centralization of granules and microtubule reorganization. Such observations have led to speculation that cytoskeletal reorganization is responsible for α-granule release. However, inhibition of actin polymerization (3Lefebvre P. White J.G. Krumwiede M.D. Cohen I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 194-204PubMed Google Scholar) or microtubule organization (4White J.G. Rao G.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1983; 112: 207-217PubMed Google Scholar, 5White J.G. Rao G.H. Blood. 1982; 60: 474-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) does not inhibit granule secretion. Furthermore, granule secretion and shape change can be dissociated under several experimental conditions (6Wheeler-Jones C.P. Saermark T. Kakkar V.V. Authi K.S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J.

Thus, α-granule secretion is not solely dependent on shape change, indicating that other mechanisms need to be explored to understand the molecular mechanisms of α-granule secretion. The study of the secretory machinery using cell-free systems and permeabilized cells has demonstrated the existence of a class of proteins, termed SNARE1proteins, that mediate vesicle secretion (9Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 10Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These proteins have been found to mediate vesicle secretion in essentially all organisms investigated, from yeast to human (9Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). SNARE family proteins have been found in numerous cell types including cells responsible for maintaining vascular integrity such as platelets (11Lemons P.P. Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leukocytes (12Mollinedo F. Lazo P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Three sets of SNARE proteins have been identified (16Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). vSNAREs are type II integral membrane proteins located on vesicles and oriented such that the majority of the protein resides within the cytosol. tSNAREs are membrane proteins that are associated with target membranes and are also oriented toward the cytoplasm. Soluble SNAREs are cytoplasmic proteins that associate with vSNARE-tSNARE complexes. Functional evaluation of these proteins has led to the SNARE hypothesis that states that interactions between vSNAREs and tSNAREs mediate vesicle fusion with target membranes (17Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Certain vSNAREs and tSNARES contain coiled-coil structures that bind in a parallel (18Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) manner to create a stable exocytotic core complex (19Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The soluble SNARE proteins that are subsequently recruited to this complex then mediate membrane fusion via a process that involves ATP hydrolysis (17Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Analysis of the components of the exocytotic core complex has demonstrated a large number of vSNARE and tSNARE isoforms. Such diversity may provide the specificity required to target vesicles to their appropriate destinations (20Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). vSNAREs include vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) 1 and 2 (also known as synaptobrevins 1 and 2) as well as cellubrevin. Isoform-specific expression of VAMP-1 and VAMP-2 has been demonstrated in a number of tissues (21Braun J.E. Fritz B.A. Wong S.M. Lowe A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5328-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nielsen S. Marples D. Birn H. Mohtashami M. Dalby N.O. Trimble M. Knepper M. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cellubrevin has been detected in both neuronal and nonneuronal tissue (24Volchuk A. Mitsumoto Y. He L. Liu Z. Habermann E. Trimble W. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 are tSNAREs that associate with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via a palmitoylation anchor. SNAP-23 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas SNAP-25 expression is somewhat more restricted (26Linial M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1781-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Syntaxins are a family of tSNARES with multiple isoforms (26Linial M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1781-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Specific tSNAREs will only bind to a limited number of vSNAREs (19Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Such restricted interaction of SNARE proteins is thought to form the basis for specificity of vesicle targeting. VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin interact to form the heterotrimeric complex that serves as a receptor for soluble SNARE proteins. Exocytosis proceeds through this complex. Understanding of the role of SNARE proteins in mediating vesicle secretion in mammalian cells is derived largely from studies in neuronal and neuroendocrine cell systems. To what extent the principles derived from these studies can be applied to platelet granule secretion is uncertain. Several fundamental differences exist between granule secretion by platelets and vesicle secretion by neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Platelets are anucleate cytoplasmic fragments derived from megakaryocytes. Although some α-granule proteins are acquired via both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis, the majority of α-granular proteins are incorporated during thrombopoiesis (27Harrison P. Cramer E.M. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In contrast, biogenesis of synaptic vesicles occurs de novo from newly synthesized proteins and from assembly of recycled vesicles (28Buckley K.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 139: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, platelets have a unique secretory pathway. Morphologic studies have shown that platelet granules are secreted primarily via fusion with the open canalicular system (1Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Shattil S. Benz E.J. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 2 Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York1995: 1524-1535Google Scholar). Such studies have also shown that platelet granules fuse with one another before exocytosis. However, platelet granule fusion with plasma membrane occurs only occasionally. In contrast, vesicles from neurons and neuroendocrine cells are exocytosed via fusion with plasma membrane exclusively. Whether the molecular mechanisms mediating vesicle-membrane fusion in platelets and cells of neural crest origin also differ is not well characterized. An exocytotic complex consisting of VAMP 2, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 has been found in several nonneuronal cell types. However, these individual components failed to form a heterotrimeric complex when co-incubated in vitro(29Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a previously published study failed to demonstrate some of the essential components of the exocytotic machinery (e.g. SNAP-25 and VAMP-2) in platelets (11Lemons P.P. Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the presence of an exocytotic core complex consisting of a VAMP, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 in platelet lysate and show that platelet vSNARE-tSNARE interactions mediate α-granule secretion from platelets. All buffer constituents and dextran sulfate-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates were purchased from Sigma. Sepharose 2B was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reduced streptolysin O (SL-O) was purchased from Murex (Dartford, UK). PE-conjugated AC1.2 anti-P-selectin antibody was purchased from Becton Dickinson. Micro-BCA protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce and used according to the manufacture's instructions. Serine-phenylalanine-leucine-leucine-arginine (SFLLR) was synthesized using solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer. Bovine brain homogenate was obtained from StressGene (Victoria, Canada). Human endothelial cell homogenate was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, Kentucky). All solutions were prepared using water purified by reverse-phase osmosis on a Millipore Milli-Q purification Water System. Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-VAMP-2 antibodies were obtained from StressGene (Victoria, Canada). The polyclonal antibody is directed against a 21-amino acid peptide fragment of human VAMP-2. The monoclonal antibody was raised against human synaptic vesicles and recognizes both VAMP-1 and VAMP-2. VAMP-1 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. S. W. Trimble. SNAP-23 antibody, obtained from Synaptic Systems (Gottingen, Germany), is a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal end of SNAP-23. Anti-syntaxin 4 antibody, purchased from Transduction Labs (Lexington, Kentucky), reacts specifically with syntaxin 4 and has no cross-reactivity with syntaxin 2. Anti-P-selectin cytoplasmic tail antibody, a gift from Dr. Michael Berndt, is a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against an 11-amino acid fragment of the P-selectin cytoplasmic tail (30Chong B.H.

Blood from healthy donors who had not ingested aspirin in the two weeks before donation was collected by venipuncture into 0.4% sodium citrate. Citrate-anticoagulated blood was centrifuged at 200 × g for 20 min to prepare platelet-rich plasma. Platelets were then purified by gel-filtration using a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated in PIPES/EGTA buffer (25 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 137 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.4). Final gel-filtered platelet concentrations were 1–2 × 108 platelets/ml. Gel-filtered platelets (20 μl) were incubated with 25 μm indicated dye in the presence or absence of 2 units/ml SL-O reduced with 5 mmdithiothreitol (1 μl). After a 15-min incubation, platelets were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (500 μl) and analyzed immediately for fluorescence. Results are expressed as the fluorescence of platelets exposed to SL-O divided by the fluorescence of unexposed platelets. A value of 1 represents no permeabilization. Gel-filtered platelets (20 μl) were exposed to 2 units/ml reduced SL-O. After the indicated amount of time, 5 mm MgATP was added to the reaction mixture at pH 6.4. We have previously demonstrated that maximal α-granule secretion occurs in permeabilized platelets at pH 6.4. 2Flaumenhaft, R., Furie, B., Furie, B. C.,J. Cell. Physiol., in press. After a 15-min incubation, Ca2+ was added to the reaction tube unless otherwise indicated. The amount of CaCl2 required to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm in the presence of 2 mm EGTA was calculated for each condition using a computer program (gift from Dr. P. J. Padfield) based on the algorithms described by Fabiato and Fabiato (32Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). After an additional 5-min incubation, PE-conjugated AC1.2 anti-P-selectin antibody (10 μl) was transferred to the reaction tube. Phosphate-buffered saline (500 μl) was added to the sample after a 15-min incubation, and the platelets were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry as described below. In experiments designed to determine the efficacy of various inhibitors, the inhibitor was added 45 min before the addition of MgATP. Tetanus toxin was activated with the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol. In experiments evaluating the presence of individual proteins in platelets, samples were heated to 100 °C before electrophoresis. In experiments evaluating SNARE protein complexes, 500 μl of resting platelets or platelets exposed to 100 μm SFLLR were pelleted and solubilized in 250 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE using either 10%, 12% gels, or 8%/15% discontinuous gels, immunoblotting, and enhanced chemiluminescence were carried out using standard protocols (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Densitometry was performed using Gelbase/Gelblot-Pro software on a MacIntosh PowerPC. Flow cytometry was performed on gel-filtered platelet samples using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Fluorescent channels were set at logarithmic gain. Ten thousand particles were acquired for each sample. A 530/30 band pass filter was used for FL-1 fluorescence, and a 585/42 band pass filter was used for FL-2 fluorescence. Platelet-associated fluorescein isothiocyanate was measured in the FL-1 channel. PE was measured in the FL-2 channel. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software on a MacIntosh PowerPC. To determine whether an exocytotic core complex consisting of VAMP, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 exists in platelets, we assayed for the presence of these proteins in platelet lysate. As illustrated in Fig.1, all three proteins are detected in platelet lysates subjected to immunoblotting. In these experiments, solubilized lysates were heated at 100 °C before loading onto the gel. The VAMP antibody used in this experiment was a polyclonal IgG directed against a peptide fragment of VAMP-2. This sequence is located in the SNAP-23/syntaxin binding domain, a region conserved among vesicle-associated membrane proteins (35Hao J.C. Salem N. Peng X.R. Kelly R.B. Bennett M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a). This antibody recognized a single protein in bovine brain lysates and in human platelet lysates. However, the VAMP species in bovine brain had a molecular mass of 18 kDa, whereas the VAMP species in platelets migrated on the gel with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa. The VAMP species in platelets was not recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific to VAMP-2 (11Lemons P.P. Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) nor by an antibody specific to VAMP-1 (data not shown). These results suggest the platelet VAMP is yet another VAMP isoform. The antibody to SNAP-23 is a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal end of SNAP-23. This antibody recognized a protein of approximately 23 kDa in both bovine brain and in human platelet lysates. The syntaxin 4 antibody is a monoclonal antibody raised against syntaxin 4. Proteins of approximately 34 kDa were detected by this antibody in both human endothelial cell and human platelet lysates. An SDS-resistant, heat-sensitive complex consisting of VAMP, SNAP-23, and syntaxin 4 has been described in neurons (36Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 37Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). To determine whether such a complex exists in platelets, platelet lysate was solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using the anti-VAMP-2, anti-SNAP-23, and anti-syntaxin 4 antibodies. A doublet of approximately M r 70,000 was recognized by antibodies directed against VAMP (Fig.2 a) and SNAP-23 (Fig.2 b). A band of approximately M r70,000 was also recognized by the anti-syntaxin antibody (Fig.2 c). As has been shown in neuronal tissue, the high molecular weight complex was not observed when platelet lysate was subjected to 100 °C (36Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 37Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Nonimmune antibody did not detect any bands in the platelet lysate. To determine whether disassembly of this complex occurred with platelet activation, platelets were exposed to SFLLR and subsequently assayed for the presence of the 70-kDa SDS-resistant, heat-sensitive complex. Disassembly of the complex was observed under these conditions upon platelet activation with SFLLR (Fig. 3). The amount of talin in the gels containing sample from resting and activated platelets was determined to assure equal protein content. The amount of talin present in each of the lanes did not vary by more than 10% (data not shown), indicating that differences in intensity of the 70-kDa band in resting samples compared with activated samples was not secondary to differences in protein loading. Activation of platelets upon exposure to SFLLR was confirmed by demonstrating increases in P-selectin surface expression in the SFLLR-exposed platelets using flow cytometry (data not shown). We next sought to determine whether the components of the exocytotic core complex serve a functional role in α-granule secretion. To access the platelet cytoplasm in whole, functional platelets with specific inhibitors of SNARE proteins such as antibodies and clostridial toxins, we exposed platelets to SL-O. SL-O was used for this purpose because it inserts preferentially into plasma membrane without permeabilizing granules; it creates stable, uniform pores, large enough to permit molecules of greater than 150 kDa into the cytoplasm. The efficacy of permeabilization was assessed by incubating SL-O-permeabilized platelets with fluorescent compounds of different molecular masses and quantitating the internalization of the compounds by flow cytometry (38Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Wiedmer T. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18424-18431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results depicted in Fig. 4 demonstrate that although incorporation of fluorescent compounds into SL-O-permeabilized platelets decreases with increasing molecular mass, incorporation of compounds as large as 260 kDa is significantly increased in permeabilized versusnonpermeabilized platelets. These results demonstrate that permeabilization with SL-O will allow antibodies and clostridial toxins access to the platelet cytoplasm. We next sought to determine whether platelets permeabilized with SL-O would secrete α-granules in response to Ca2+. In these experiments, platelets were permeabilized with SL-O and subsequently exposed to MgATP. Incubation of permeabilized platelets with MgATP has previously been shown to be necessary for Ca2+-stimulated secretion (39Patel S. Scrutton M.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After 15 min, platelets were exposed to either buffer alone, SFLLR, or Ca2+. Intact platelets were also exposed to buffer alone, SFLLR, or Ca2+. Platelets were then assessed for α-granule release by assaying for surface expression of P-selectin by flow cytometry.2SL-O-permeabilized platelets express P-selectin on their surface in response to Ca2+ (Fig.5). Ca2+-mediated α-granule release from SL-O-permeabilized platelets was approximately equivalent in degree to that elicited from intact platelets by exposure to SFLLR. In contrast, SFLLR failed to stimulate α-granule release from SL-O-permeabilized platelets (39Patel S. Scrutton M.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ca2+ failed to stimulate α-granule release from nonpermeabilized platelets (Fig. 5). Many SL-O-permeabilized systems lose the ability to secrete in response to Ca2+ as a function of time after permeabilization (40Padfield P.J. Panesar N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G647-G652PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether SL-O-permeabilized platelets lose their responsiveness to Ca2+ over time, we permeabilized platelets with SL-O and exposed them to Ca2+ at various times after permeabilization. SL-O-permeabilized platelets express P-selectin on their surface in response to Ca2+ up to 2 h after permeabilization (Fig. 6). There is no detectable loss of responsiveness to Ca2+ over this period. Furthermore, no spontaneous P-selectin expression was observed in SL-O-permeabilized platelets that were not exposed to Ca2+. Thus, SL-O-permeabilized platelets secrete α-granules in response to Ca2+, and this response is stable for at least 2 h. We next sought to determine whether platelet VAMP plays a role in mediating α-granule secretion. In these experiments, we incubated SL-O-permeabilized platelets with polyclonal anti-VAMP-2 antibody for 1 h before exposure to Ca2+. Anti-VAMP-2 antibody inhibits Ca2+-mediated P-selectin surface expression from SL-O-permeabilized platelets by greater than 95% (Fig. 7). In contrast, rabbit nonimmune IgG had no effect on Ca2+-mediated P-selectin surface expression. To determine whether an antibody directed at an α-granule membrane protein thought not to be involved in α-granule secretion affects secretion (41Mayadas T.N. Johnson R.C. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), we exposed SL-O-permeabilized platelets to a polyclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin (30Chong B.H. Murray B. Berndt M.C. Dunlop L.C. Brighton T. Chesterman C.N. Blood. 1994; 83: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody had no effect on Ca2+-induced P-selectin surface expression. This result argues that the P-selectin cytoplasmic tail is not involved in secretion despite its phosphorylation during activation (42Crovello C.S. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14590-14593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also suggests that an antibody directed at a α-granule surface protein will not nonspecifically interfere with secretion. Tetanus toxin cleaves VAMP family proteins specifically (43McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The next series of experiments were performed to determine the sensitivity of platelet VAMP to tetanus toxin. We exposed permeabilized platelets to tetanus toxin and assayed for VAMP by immunoblot analysis using the polyclonal anti-VAMP-2 peptide antibody. The VAMP family protein that is recognized by the polyclonal anti-VAMP-2 peptide antibody is sensitive to degradation by tetanus toxin (Fig.8 a). Tetanus toxin had no effect on VAMP from nonpermeabilized platelets. Given the observation that tetanus toxin degrades the VAMP family protein found in platelets, we sought to determine whether tetanus toxin would inhibit Ca2+-mediated α-granule secretion. In these experiments, SL-O-permeabilized platelets were exposed to 2 μm tetanus toxin for 1 h before exposure to Ca2+. Tetanus toxin inhibited Ca2+-mediated surface P-selectin surface expression by approximately 70% (Fig. 8 B). Dithiothreitol, which was used to reduce the tetanus toxin, had no significant effect on Ca2+-induced P-selectin surface expression. Tetanus toxin that had been inactivated by boiling for 10 min had no effect on α-granule secretion (data not shown). The effect of tetanus toxin was dose-dependent (Fig. 8 C). Syntaxin 4 is found in platelets (11Lemons P.P. Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to play a role in the regulated secretion of granules from hematopoietic cells (14Brumell J."

We previously identified a pyrimidine-rich 27-base-long protein-binding sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of TH mRNA that is associated with hypoxia-inducible formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex (hypoxia-inducible protein-binding site (HIPBS)). In this study, we show that HIPBS is an mRNA stabilizing element necessary for both constitutive and hypoxia-regulated stability of TH mRNA.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),1 the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, is expressed in specific populations of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems, in the neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla and carotid body, and in cultured cell lines such as the pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cell line. Regulation of TH gene expression at the level of gene transcription is well documented. Recently, there has been growing evidence that TH mRNA is also regulated at the level of mRNA stability. TH mRNA is a stable message with a half-life that varies from 9 to 16 h in various subclones of PC12 cells (1Summerhill E.M. Wood K. Fishman M.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1987; 2: 99-103Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Vyas S. Foucon-Biguet N. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Fossom L.H. Sterling C.R.

Brain Res. 1987; 2: 99-103Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and during stimulation of the protein kinase C pathway in PC12 cells (2Vyas S. Foucon-Biguet N. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the stability of TH mRNA does not change in PC12 cells during stimulation of TH mRNA expression by dexamethasone or forskolin (3Fossom L.H. Sterling C.R. Tank A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 898-908PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated substantial differences in basal TH mRNA turnover rates between different neuronal populations from as short a time as 6–7 h, in the dopaminergic neurons of the arcuate nucleus, to as long as 11–23 h, in the dopaminergic midhypothalamic neurons (4Maurer J.A. Wray S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4552-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TH mRNA is destabilized in the dopaminergic cells of the arcuate nucleus in a manner that corresponds to the rhythmic output displayed by these neurons (4Maurer J.A. Wray S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4552-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our laboratory demonstrated that hypoxia augments the stability of TH mRNA in PC12 cells (5Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a 27-base-long pyrimidine-rich sequence within the TH mRNA 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (1552–1578 bases of TH mRNA) that binds protein factors in a hypoxia-inducible manner (hypoxia-inducible protein-binding sequence (HIPBS)) in PC12 cells (6Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), catecholaminergic cells of the superior cervical ganglia, and the dopaminergic cells of the carotid body (8Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Paulding W.R. Beresh J.E. Kroll S.L. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 585-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that the optimal protein-binding site is represented by the motif (U/C)(C/U)CCCU within the pyrimidine-rich sequence, where the underlined cytidines are the core binding site (7Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This motif is conserved in TH mRNAs from different species. These results imply that formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with HIPBS may be involved in physiological regulation of TH mRNA stability in catecholaminergic cells. Thus, identification of the role of this element in the regulation of TH mRNA stability is critically important to further investigations in this area.In the present study, we investigated the role of HIPBS in regulating the stability of TH mRNA during normoxia and hypoxia. We show that HIPBS is a stabilizing element necessary for maintaining constitutive and hypoxia-regulated TH mRNA half-life. We also show that the HIPBS-binding protein is represented by two isoforms of a 40-kDa poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP, also known as αCP or hnRNPE (9Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4354-4357Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar)), and we demonstrate that expression of the PCBP1 isoform is induced by hypoxia in PC12 cells.DISCUSSIONThe major finding from this study is that HIPBS is an mRNA stabilizing element required for constitutive and hypoxia-regulated control of TH mRNA. A four-point mutation that abolished the protein-binding site within the full-length TH mRNA resulted in a 2-fold destabilization of the mutated mRNA and a corresponding 2-fold decrease in mRNA steady-state levels. In addition, mutation of HIPBS abolished the O2-dependent regulation of TH mRNA stability. We further demonstrated that a short fragment of the TH 3′-UTR containing the HIPBS was sufficient to confer augmented mRNA stability on the heterologous mRNA, which in turn resulted in augmented steady-state levels of the chimeric mRNA and derived protein. Importantly, the mutated HIPBS conferred destabilization to chimeric CAT-TH mRNA. The decrease in the half-life because of the mutation in the protein-binding site was very similar for both the chimeric CAT-TH mRNA or full-length exogenous TH mRNA.Interestingly, whereas HIPBS is a necessary element for the O2-dependent stabilization of TH mRNA in the context of the full-length TH mRNA and whereas it binds a protein factor in a hypoxia-inducible manner, HIPBS alone is not sufficient to confer hypoxic regulation to the CAT mRNA. Neither are the full-length 3′- and 5′-UTRs of TH mRNA. This result is similar to previously published data regarding hypoxic regulation of VEGF mRNA stability (13Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In that study, the full-length 3′-UTR of VEGF mRNA did not confer hypoxic regulation on the heterologous mRNA (13Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that additional necessary regulatory elements are located within the coding region of hypoxia-regulated mRNAs. Work is in progress to identify these additional elements in TH mRNA.Sequences similar to that in TH mRNA were reported to regulate the stability of other mRNAs. First, the stability of the erythroid-specific α2-globin mRNA is regulated by three short cytidine-rich repeats similar to the TH protein-binding motif (14Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a pyrimidine/cytidine-rich sequence within the collagen α1(I) mRNA is involved in the regulation of the stability of this mRNA and forms a similar ribonucleoprotein complex with protein factors (15Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Liebhaber S.A. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in these elements destabilize globin and collagen α1(I) mRNAs. In our study, however, we show not only that the mutations destabilize TH mRNA but also that the short fragment of mRNA containing the protein-binding site is capable of conferring increased mRNA stability to a heterologous mRNA.The increased expression of chimeric CAT-TH mRNA was accompanied by a corresponding increase in expression of functional protein (data not shown), an indication that translation of the chimeric mRNA was most likely not affected. This observation is important because pyrimidine-rich sequences binding similar protein factors were reported to regulate translation (12Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Standart N. Thiele B.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).Analysis of the RNA·protein complexes after UV light cross-linking and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of one major broad 50–55-kDa complex. This finding extends and complements the results of our previous study (6Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which we detected two TH mRNA·protein complexes: the major 74- and a minor 53-kDa complex. We currently view the 50–55-kDa complex as the major one. The importance of this complex became clear only after competition with poly(U), which blocked protein binding at 80 kDa, and after analysis of complexes formed specifically with HIPBS oligoribonucleotide in comparison with the complexes formed with the longer TH transcript. Thus, the 80-kDa complex most likely represents nonspecific binding of protein factors to sequences other than HIPBS fragments within the 162-base-long TH transcript. The 50–55-kDa complex should correspond, after subtracting the molecular mass corresponding to the 28 bases of RNA (8 kDa), to the protein factor with an approximate molecular mass of 42–47 kDa.In view of the strong affinity of the binding proteins for poly(C) RNA, poly(C) RNA-agarose was used to purify the protein. A similar procedure was used previously to purify the protein factor binding to the cytidine-rich elements in α2-globin mRNA (9Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4354-4357Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, we purified the 40-kDa poly(C)-binding protein that corresponds to PCBP (12Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar), also known as αCP (9Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4354-4357Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or hnRNPE (17Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar,18Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), as identified by the specific antibodies. The eluate from the poly(C)-agarose restored fully formation of the complex with HIPBS RNA or the TH transcript in the binding reactions. This finding differs from previously reported data showing that the poly(C)-eluted proteins did not restore formation of the complex associated with α2-globin stability element and was thus considered necessary but not sufficient for the complex formation (10Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, formation of the globin-associated complex seems to require additional protein factors such as AUF1 (hnRNPD) protein (19Kiledjian M. DeMaia C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far we did not find any evidence for the presence of AUF protein in the HIPBS-associated complex. 2M. F. Czyzyk-Krzeska, unpublished results. The protein-binding motifs within the TH and α2-globin mRNAs show some potentially important differences. Whereas the essential PCBP-binding motifs are very similar in the two mRNAs (11Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), in the case of TH mRNA the binding motif is located in the middle of a long pyrimidine-rich sequence, and in the case of α2-globin mRNA the short binding motifs are separated by purine-rich sequences. This difference may affect the constitution of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with the protein-binding motifs and result in RNA-specific regulation of mRNA stability.Interestingly, we measured an approximately 2-fold induction in expression of PCBP1 but not PCBP2 in cytoplasmic extracts obtained from hypoxic cells. That corresponds to the similar enrichment of PCBP1 in the electroeluates from the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed with the hypoxic protein extracts and to the quantitative increase in the complex formation. This difference results from an absolute enrichment for PCBP1, as similar increases were measured using total cellular lysates, and immunocytochemistry did not show any intracellular translocation in the PCBP1content.2 This difference in the hypoxic inducibility of the two isoforms supports the observation that although PCBP1 and PCBP2 have high degrees of sequence homology, they show some specific functional differences, such as efficiency of interacting with AUF1 protein (19Kiledjian M. DeMaia C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or efficiency to regulate poliovirus translation (12Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism by which binding of PCBP to the HIPBS element regulates mRNA stability, especially in the context of increased TH mRNA stability during hypoxia, is presently unknown. A possible mechanism would be protection of a nuclease cleavage site within the region associated with HIPBS in the TH mRNA. Protein binding to the wild-type sequence may protect this site from nuclease activity. When protein binding is prevented by mutation, the site becomes accessible to cleavage, resulting in a rapid degradation of mRNA. The fact that a fragment of TH mRNA containing mutated HIPBS confers decreased mRNA stability to the chimeric mRNA may favor such a possibility. On the other hand, formation of the complex associated with the globin mRNA stability element indicates its potential role in stabilization via the poly(A) tails (20Morales J. Russell J.E. Liebhaber S.A J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6607-6613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Russell J.E. Morales J. Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate this possibility, a determination of the length of poly(A) tails of TH mRNA during normoxia and hypoxia is under way. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),1 the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, is expressed in specific populations of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems, in the neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla and carotid body, and in cultured cell lines such as the pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cell line. Regulation of TH gene expression at the level of gene transcription is well documented. Recently, there has been growing evidence that TH mRNA is also regulated at the level of mRNA stability. TH mRNA is a stable message with a half-life that varies from 9 to 16 h in various subclones of PC12 cells (1Summerhill E.M. Wood K. Fishman M.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1987; 2: 99-103Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Vyas S. Foucon-Biguet N. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Fossom L.H. Sterling C.R. Tank A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 898-908PubMed Google Scholar). It is enhanced during differentiation of neuroblastoma cells (1Summerhill E.M. Wood K. Fishman M.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1987; 2: 99-103Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and during stimulation of the protein kinase C pathway in PC12 cells (2Vyas S. Foucon-Biguet N. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the stability of TH mRNA does not change in PC12 cells during stimulation of TH mRNA expression by dexamethasone or forskolin (3Fossom L.H. Sterling C.R. Tank A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 898-908PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated substantial differences in basal TH mRNA turnover rates between different neuronal populations from as short a time as 6–7 h, in the dopaminergic neurons of the arcuate nucleus, to as long as 11–23 h, in the dopaminergic midhypothalamic neurons (4Maurer J.A. Wray S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4552-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TH mRNA is destabilized in the dopaminergic cells of the arcuate nucleus in a manner that corresponds to the rhythmic output displayed by these neurons (4Maurer J.A. Wray S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4552-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory demonstrated that hypoxia augments the stability of TH mRNA in PC12 cells (5Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a 27-base-long pyrimidine-rich sequence within the TH mRNA 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (1552–1578 bases of TH mRNA) that binds protein factors in a hypoxia-inducible manner (hypoxia-inducible protein-binding sequence (HIPBS)) in PC12 cells (6Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), catecholaminergic cells of the superior cervical ganglia, and the dopaminergic cells of the carotid body (8Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Paulding W.R. Beresh J.E. Kroll S.L. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 585-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that the optimal protein-binding site is represented by the motif (U/C)(C/U)CCCU within the pyrimidine-rich sequence, where the underlined cytidines are the core binding site (7Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This motif is conserved in TH mRNAs from different species. These results imply that formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with HIPBS may be involved in physiological regulation of TH mRNA stability in catecholaminergic cells. Thus, identification of the role of this element in the regulation of TH mRNA stability is critically important to further investigations in this area. In the present study, we investigated the role of HIPBS in regulating the stability of TH mRNA during normoxia and hypoxia. We show that HIPBS is a stabilizing element necessary for maintaining constitutive and hypoxia-regulated TH mRNA half-life. We also show that the HIPBS-binding protein is represented by two isoforms of a 40-kDa poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP, also known as αCP or hnRNPE (9Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4354-4357Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar)), and we demonstrate that expression of the PCBP1 isoform is induced by hypoxia in PC12 cells. DISCUSSIONThe major finding from this study is that HIPBS is an mRNA stabilizing element required for constitutive and hypoxia-regulated control of TH mRNA. A four-point mutation that abolished the protein-binding site within the full-length TH mRNA resulted in a 2-fold destabilization of the mutated mRNA and a corresponding 2-fold decrease in mRNA steady-state levels. In addition, mutation of HIPBS abolished the O2-dependent regulation of TH mRNA stability. We further demonstrated that a short fragment of the TH 3′-UTR containing the HIPBS was sufficient to confer augmented mRNA stability on the heterologous mRNA, which in turn resulted in augmented steady-state levels of the chimeric mRNA and derived protein. Importantly, the mutated HIPBS conferred destabilization to chimeric CAT-TH mRNA. The decrease in the half-life because of the mutation in the protein-binding site was very similar for both the chimeric CAT-TH mRNA or full-length exogenous TH mRNA.Interestingly, whereas HIPBS is a necessary element for the O2-dependent stabilization of TH mRNA in the context of the full-length TH mRNA and whereas it binds a protein factor in a hypoxia-inducible manner, HIPBS alone is not sufficient to confer hypoxic regulation to the CAT mRNA. Neither are the full-length 3′- and 5′-UTRs of TH mRNA. This result is similar to previously published data regarding hypoxic regulation of VEGF mRNA stability (13Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In that study, the full-length 3′-UTR of VEGF mRNA did not confer hypoxic regulation on the heterologous mRNA (13Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that additional necessary regulatory elements are located within the coding region of hypoxia-regulated mRNAs. Work is in progress to identify these additional elements in TH mRNA.Sequences similar to that in TH mRNA were reported to regulate the stability of other mRNAs. First, the stability of the erythroid-specific α2-globin mRNA is regulated by three short cytidine-rich repeats similar to the TH protein-binding motif (14Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a pyrimidine/cytidine-rich sequence within the collagen α1(I) mRNA is involved in the regulation of the stability of this mRNA and forms a similar ribonucleoprotein complex with protein factors (15Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Liebhaber S.A. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in these elements destabilize globin and collagen α1(I) mRNAs. In our study, however, we show not only that the mutations destabilize TH mRNA but also that the short fragment of mRNA containing the protein-binding site is capable of conferring increased mRNA stability to a heterologous mRNA.The increased expression of chimeric CAT-TH mRNA was accompanied by a corresponding increase in expression of functional protein (data not shown), an indication that translation of the chimeric mRNA was most likely not affected. This observation is important because pyrimidine-rich sequences binding similar protein factors were reported to regulate translation (12Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Standart N. Thiele B.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Ostareck D.H.

Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).Analysis of the RNA·protein complexes after UV light cross-linking and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of one major broad 50–55-kDa complex. This finding extends and complements the results of our previous study (6Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which we detected two TH mRNA·protein complexes: the major 74- and a minor 53-kDa complex. We currently view the 50–55-kDa complex as the major one. The importance of this complex became clear only after competition with poly(U), which blocked protein binding at 80 kDa, and after analysis of complexes formed specifically with HIPBS oligoribonucleotide in comparison with the complexes formed with the longer TH transcript. Thus, the 80-kDa complex most likely represents nonspecific binding of protein factors to sequences other than HIPBS fragments within the 162-base-long TH transcript. The 50–55-kDa complex should correspond, after subtracting the molecular mass corresponding to the 28 bases of RNA (8 kDa), to the protein factor with an approximate molecular mass of 42–47 kDa.In view of the strong affinity of the binding proteins for poly(C) RNA, poly(C) RNA-agarose was used to purify the protein. A similar procedure was used previously to purify the protein factor binding to the cytidine-rich elements in α2-globin mRNA (9Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4354-4357Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, we purified the 40-kDa poly(C)-binding protein that corresponds to PCBP (12Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar), also known as αCP (9Kiledjian M.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), as identified by the specific antibodies. The eluate from the poly(C)-agarose restored fully formation of the complex with HIPBS RNA or the TH transcript in the binding reactions. This finding differs from previously reported data showing that the poly(C)-eluted proteins did not restore formation of the complex associated with α2-globin stability element and was thus considered necessary but not sufficient for the complex formation (10Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, formation of the globin-associated complex seems to require additional protein factors such as AUF1 (hnRNPD) protein (19Kiledjian M. DeMaia C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far we did not find any evidence for the presence of AUF protein in the HIPBS-associated complex. 2M. F. Czyzyk-Krzeska, unpublished results. The protein-binding motifs within the TH and α2-globin mRNAs show some potentially important differences. Whereas the essential PCBP-binding motifs are very similar in the two mRNAs (11Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), in the case of TH mRNA the binding motif is located in the middle of a long pyrimidine-rich sequence, and in the case of α2-globin mRNA the short binding motifs are separated by purine-rich sequences. This difference may affect the constitution of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with the protein-binding motifs and result in RNA-specific regulation of mRNA stability.Interestingly, we measured an approximately 2-fold induction in expression of PCBP1 but not PCBP2 in cytoplasmic extracts obtained from hypoxic cells. That corresponds to the similar enrichment of PCBP1 in the electroeluates from the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed with the hypoxic protein extracts and to the quantitative increase in the complex formation. This difference results from an absolute enrichment for PCBP1, as similar increases were measured using total cellular lysates, and immunocytochemistry did not show any intracellular translocation in the PCBP1content.2 This difference in the hypoxic inducibility of the two isoforms supports the observation that although PCBP1 and PCBP2 have high degrees of sequence homology, they show some specific functional differences, such as efficiency of interacting with AUF1 protein (19Kiledjian M.

Both immunocytochemistry and immunoblots with anti-PV100 antibodies showed that <10-kDa proteins and the 50-kDa vicilin-like protein were accumulated in the vacuoles. To identify the mature proteins derived from PV100, soluble proteins of the vacuoles were separated, and their molecular structures were determined. Mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing showed that two Cys-rich peptides, three Arg/Glu-rich peptides, and the vicilin-like protein were produced by cleaving Asn-Gln bonds of PV100 and that all of these proteins had a pyroglutamate at their NH2 termini. To clarify the cleavage mechanism, in vitro processing of PV100 was performed with purified vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE). Taken together, these results suggested that VPE was responsible for cleaving Asn-Gln bonds of a single precursor, PV100, to produce multiple seed proteins. It is likely that the Asn-Gln stretches not only provide cleavage sites for VPE but also produce aminopeptidase-resistant proteins. We also found that the Cys-rich peptide functions as a trypsin inhibitor. Our findings suggested that PV100 is converted into different functional proteins, such as a proteinase inhibitor and a storage protein, in the vacuoles of seed cells.

In higher plants, proprotein precursors of most seed proteins are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and are then transported to protein storage vacuoles in maturing seed cells (1Akazawa T.

We have succeeded in isolation of the vesicles from maturing pumpkin seeds and have shown that they contained a large amount of precursors of various seed proteins, including 11S globulin and 2S albumin (7Hara-Nishimura I. Shimada T. Hatano K. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, these vesicles were designated precursor-accumulating (PAC)1vesicles. Recently, we have found that the PAC vesicles contain a type I integral membrane protein with epidermal growth factor-like motifs and have shown that the membrane protein binds to peptides derived from the 2S albumin precursor (8Shimada T. Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The membrane protein of the PAC vesicles might function as a sorting receptor for seed protein precursors to the vacuoles.Just after arriving at the vacuoles, the precursor proteins are converted into their respective mature forms by proteolytic cleavages (6Hara-Nishimura I.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1555-1562PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that the plant vacuoles are classified into two types, protein storage vacuoles in seeds and lytic vacuoles in vegetative organs. A VPE-mediated processing system similar to that in protein storage vacuoles is involved in maturation of vacuolar proteins in lytic vacuoles (15Hara-Nishimura I. Kinoshita T. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 668-674Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Vegetative VPE might be responsible for conversion of inactive precursor into their mature active proteins, such as proteinase inhibitors and hydrolytic enzymes (15Hara-Nishimura I. Kinoshita T. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 668-674Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, it is likely that seed VPE also plays a role in the activation of some functional proteins in seeds.Each of most precursor proteins is composed of a functional domain and an NH2- and/or COOH-terminal propeptide(s), except for a precursor protein of proteinase inhibitors of tobacco that is processed into five homologous inhibitors and an NH2-terminal propeptide (16Atkinson A.H. Heath R.L. Simpson R.J. Clarke A.E. Anderson M.A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 203-213PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is not known whether multiple vacuolar proteins with distinct functions are derived from a single precursor. In this study, we demonstrated that a 100-kDa component of the PAC vesicles (PV100) is converted into multiple proteins with a pyroglutamate at their NH2 termini by cleaving Asn-Gln bonds of PV100 by the action of VPE, after arrival at protein storage vacuoles.

https://openalex.org/W2163746433,"Ameloblasts secrete amelogenins on the pre-existing enamel matrix glycoproteins at the dentine-enamel junction. The hypothesis that amelogenins may interact with enamel matrix glycoproteins is tested by hemagglutination of purified, native (porcine) and recombinant murine amelogenins (rM179 and rM166) and hemagglutination inhibition with sugars. Amelogenin agglutination of murine erythrocytes was specifically inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), chitobiose, and chitotetraose and by ovalbumin with terminal GlcNAc. The GlcNAc affinity was confirmed by dosimetric binding of rM179 with [14C]GlcNAc, specific binding in relation to varying concentrations of GlcNAc, Scatchard plot analysis and competitive inhibition with cold GlcNAc. The hemagglutination activity and [14C]GlcNAc affinity were retained by the NH2-terminal tyrosine-rich (TRAP) but not by the leucine-rich peptide, LRAP (a polypeptide sharing 33 amino acid residues of TRAP), or by the C-terminal 13 residue polypeptide of (rM179). Since TRAP but not the 33-residue sequence of the TRAP shared by LRAP bound to [14C]GlcNAc, we inferred that the GlcNAc binding motif was located in the 13-residue tyrosyl C-terminal domain of TRAP (PYPSYGYEPMGGW), which was absent from LRAP. [14C]GlcNAc did indeed bind to this amelogenin tyrosyl motif peptide but not when the tyrosyl residues were substituted with phenylalanine or when the third proline was replaced by threonine. Significantly, this latter modification mimics a point mutation identified in a case of human X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta. The tyrosyl motif sequence showed a similarity to the secondary GlcNAc-binding site of wheat germ agglutinin."

Allergy is a result of an inappropriate immune response in persons with a genetic predisposition or atopy. At least 20% of the population in the industrialized countries suffer from different forms of allergies (1Miyamoto T. Godard P. Bousquet J. Michel F.B. Advances in Allergology and Clinical Immunology (. The Parthenon Publishing Group, Carnforth, UK1992: 343-347Google Scholar). The development of allergy is a multistep process, and the mechanisms leading to sensitization, production of IgE antibodies, and allergic diseases are complex and not fully understood. However, allergies arise in response to certain otherwise innocuous proteins, allergens. The list of denominated allergens contains more than 170 proteins from different species (2Liebers V. Sander I. Van Kampen V. Raulf-Heimsoth M. Rozynek P. Baur X. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1996; 26: 494-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These proteins are structurally and functionally a heterogeneous group, including hydrolytic enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, and transport molecules, but there are also a number of proteins without a known function (3Stewart G.A. Thompson P.J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1996; 26: 1020-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One group of proteins, which has been found recently to include several animal allergens, is the lipocalin family (4Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Recognition of a protein by IgE antibodies and by receptors on the T helper type 2 lymphocytes is a critical requirement for allergenicity. The receptor of T helper type 2 cells recognizes allergens as processed linear peptides in association with major histocompatibility class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (5Schwartz R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1985; 3: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IgE antibodies bind on the surface of the allergen molecules and therefore the binding sites or B-cell epitopes are often conformational and thus dependent on the three-dimensional structure. The allergic reaction is triggered by the binding of an allergen to IgE molecules on mast cells. The cross-linking of mast cell-bound IgE molecules by an allergen postulates that the allergenic protein contains more than one B-cell epitope. During the past few years, the primary structure of a large number of different allergens has been resolved, and the three-dimensional structures of some allergens have also been determined by using x-ray diffraction or NMR. To date, the coordinates of seven different allergenic proteins are available at the Brookhaven Data Bank (TableI). Four of the proteins are from plants: Birch pollen Bet v 1 (6Gajhede M. Osmark P.

Open table in a new tab Dimensions of β-lactoglobulin are calculated for a monomer. The three-dimensional structures of allergens are important in understanding the molecular basis of allergenicity. Structural information in relation to the information on B-cell and T-cell epitopes is also necessary for a rational strategy to design effective, safe recombinant derivatives of allergenic proteins for specific immunotherapy. In this study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the major bovine dander allergen Bos d 21 at 1.8-Å resolution. The structure of Bos d 2 is compared with other allergenic proteins within the lipocalin protein family. We also make a general comparison between currently released allergen structures in an attempt to find features shared by these molecules. The crystals of recombinant Bos d 2 were grown at 20 °C by the hanging drop method as described (13Rautiainen J. Auriola S. Rouvinen J. Kauppinen J. Zeiler T. Novikov D. Virtanen T. Mäntyjärvi R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Bos d 2 crystallized in a space group P212121 with cell dimensionsa = 37.0, b = 55.6, c = 77.2 Å containing one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The native data set was collected at room temperature with an R-AXIS IIc imaging plate using CuKα radiation and processed with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (14.Otwinowski, Z., Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing, Sawyer, L., 1993, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK.Google Scholar). The native data set consisted of 14,230 unique reflections (redundancy 2.9) up to 1.8-Å resolution with anR-merge of 6.6%. Bos d 2 is homologous with two lipocalins in which three-dimensional structures have been determined. Its identity to the odorant-binding protein (PDB code 1OBP) is 26% and to the major mouse urinary protein (1MUP) 20%. Because of the low identity, some heavy atom derivatives were sought. One data set obtained from a crystal soaked overnight in 10 mm Hg(OAc)2 showed a single heavy atom site in the difference Patterson map. Using one mercury site, the single isomorphous replacement map was calculated with both hands using the program XtalView (15McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Both maps showed positions of protein molecules in the unit cell but no other details. The molecular replacement calculations were performed with the program AMoRe (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Because the odorant-binding protein is a dimer and part of its structure has swapped, it was not used. Therefore, the major murine urinary protein 1MUP without the ligand was used as a search model. The rotation function was calculated between the data at 8 and 4 Å, and a 22-Å integration radius was used. This resulted in eight peaks, which were 3.9–4.0 ς above the mean. The first 20 peaks from the rotation function were used in the translation search at 4–10-Å resolution. The fifth and sixth solution from the rotation function produced peaks 18.1 and 15.1 ς above the mean, respectively. The rigid body refinement resulted in an R factor of 52.1% for both solutions. The solutions are partially overlapping so that one part of the β-sheet of the search model is common to the solutions and the rest are not. When comparing the solutions with the both hand single isomorphous replacement maps we found that the first solution overlapped with one of the single isomorphous replacement maps. In consequence, this model was used as a starting model in the structure determination. The building of the model was performed with the program O and the refinement with the program X-PLOR (17Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). The initial refinement with the mouse urinary protein against the Bos d 2 data resulted in the crystallographic R factor of 39.3% and free Rfactor of 54.2%. The residues of the model were then gradually replaced by the residues of Bos d 2, and after several cycles of manual rebuilding, simulated annealing refinement and addition of water molecules the R factor dropped to 18.4% and the freeR factor to 23.2%.

Allergy (Cph.). 1994; 49: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), to the solid-phase rBos d 2 or nBos d 2 was examined by the ELISA technique as described previously (19Zeiler T. Taivainen A. Rytkönen M. Rautiainen J. Karjalainen H. Mäntyjärvi R. Tuomisto L. Virtanen T. J. Allergy Clin.

First, six 10-fold dilutions of each protein preparation (0.001–100 μg/ml) were allowed to react with a predetermined dilution of an antibody in a test tube for 30 min at 37 °C. The inhibited antibody as well as the uninhibited control antibody were then transferred into the wells of a microwell plate. In IgE inhibitions, the ELISA procedure was completed using rabbit anti-human IgE (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark; A0094), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako; E0432) and Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories). In the inhibitions of mAbs, the bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako; P161). The color reaction was developed, and optical density values were measured at 450 nm. The values are the means of two replicate wells calculated after subtracting the reagent blank value. Skin prick tests were performed according to Nordic recommendations (20Frandsen P. Backman A. Cato-Arntzen F. Sjöholm I. Busk M. Larhammar H. Registration of Allergen Preparations: Nordic Guidelines, NLN Publication No. 23. Nordic Council on Medicines, Uppsala, Sweden1989: 1-34Google Scholar) on the forearm of cow-asthmatic patients in duplicate with nBos d 2 and rBos d 2. Five 10-fold dilutions (0.02–200 μg/ml) of each preparation were used with appropriate controls. After 15 min, the wheals were marked and the diameters were measured. Recombinant Bos d 2 (rBos d 2) was produced in Pichia pastoris and crystallized as described earlier (13Rautiainen J. Auriola S. Rouvinen J. Kauppinen J. Zeiler T. Novikov D. Virtanen T. Mäntyjärvi R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To ascertain that the observations made on the relationship between the allergenicity and the structure of the rBos d 2 were valid, we characterized the immunoreactivity of rBos d 2 by the ELISA inhibition technique and skin prick tests. In the ELISA inhibition, the capacity of rBos d 2 or natural Bos d 2 (nBos d 2) to inhibit the binding of serum IgE of four allergic patients to the allergens was tested as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All sera gave identical results, showing that rBos d 2 was as effective an inhibitor per weight unit as nBos d 2 (Fig. 1). The complete inhibition of the binding of the two monoclonal antibodies revealed that the two different epitopes recognized by these antibodies were intact. The relevance of rBos d 2 as an allergen was further confirmed within vivo skin prick tests in ten patients. Again, the results showed (Fig. 2) that rBos d 2 was as effective as nBos d 2, indicating that rBos d 2 was recognized by IgE antibodies on the effector cells leading to cross-linking, release of mediators, and to positive skin prick tests. In preliminary experiments with two Bos d 2-specific T-cell clones (19Zeiler T. Taivainen A. Rytkönen M. Rautiainen J. Karjalainen H. Mäntyjärvi R. Tuomisto L. Virtanen T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1997; 100: 721-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), rBos d 2 also induced stimulation identical to that caused by nBos d 2 (results not shown). The results described above showed that structural characteristics responsible for the clinically relevant, conformational B-cell epitopes were present in the rBos d 2. One of the aims when modified allergens are designed for immunotherapy is to reduce allergic side effects by minimizing the IgE binding capacity. Once the structural sites in the molecule critical for B-cell epitopes have been localized, this can be achieved by recombinant DNA technology. The three-dimensional structure of rBos d 2 was determined by using x-ray diffraction at 1.8-Å resolution and then refined to a crystallographic R factor of 18.4%. The structure was solved with a molecular replacement technique by using the mouse urinary protein 1MUP as a search model. The refined model contains 150 residues (7–156) and 76 water molecules. A short N-terminal region of the protein was disordered and was not included in the model. The structure is monomeric with no glycosylation or other observable post-translational modifications. Previous molecular weight determinations by ion trap mass spectrometry suggested that the N-terminal residue appears either as glutamine or as pyrrolidone carboxylic acid. Because the first six N-terminal residues were not visible, the existence of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid could not be verified by the crystal structure analysis. The final electron density was of good quality except in the two loops B-C and C-D, which indicated disorder in the crystal and resulted in high B factors. The side chains for two residues, Arg17 and Leu117, were built using two conformations. Bos d 2 is clearly a member of the lipocalin protein family sharing all the structural elements characteristic of other lipocalins (4Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The central β-barrel is composed of eight antiparallel β-strands (A–H) with (+1)8 topology forming a continuous hydrogen-bonded flattened barrel. The structure also contains a short β-strand (I), a 310-helix between strands A and B, an α-helix between strands H and I, and a C-terminal 310-helix (Fig.3 A). The electron density unambiguously showed the existence of two disulfide bridges. Cys44–Cys48 is located in the loop between strands B and C. Cys63–Cys154is located between the N terminus of the β-strand D and C terminus of the protein, a structure shared by other proteins in the lipocalin protein family, for example, 1MUP. Of lipocalins with known three-dimensional structures, 1MUP (11Böcskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E.V. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B.C. North A.C.T. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and odorant-binding protein (1OBP) (21Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have the highest sequence identities with Bos d 2, 20 and 26%, respectively. The structures of the three proteins were compared with the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). We obtained an root mean square deviation of 1.645 Å for 138 Cα atoms of 1MUPand 1.623 Å for 129 Cα atoms of 1OBP. These values are close to those reported between the insect biliverdin-binding protein and the human retinol-binding protein of the lipocalin protein family, namely 1.65 Å for 97 Cα atoms (23Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 44-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For comparison, the root mean square deviation of 1.557 Å for 144 Cα atoms is obtained when the crystal structure of Bos d 2 and the model based on comparative modeling (24.Santa, H., Saarela, J. T. A., Laatikainen R., Rautiainen J., Virtanen T., Rytkönen, M., and Mäntyjärvi, R.J. Protein Chem. 17, 663–668.Google Scholar) are compared. The biological function of Bos d 2 is currently unknown. There is only indirect evidence of the biological function of Bos d 2 (25Rautiainen J. Rytkönen M. Syrjänen K. Pentikäinen J. Zeiler T. Virtanen T. Mäntyjärvi R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 101: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, most proteins in the lipocalin family are ligand-binding proteins capable of binding and transporting small hydrophobic molecules. The VOIDOO program was used to calculate the molecular surface of the protein and detect possible cavities (26Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). A flat cavity was found inside the protein, and its size would approximately correspond two small fused rings, as in indan. Because a recombinant protein was used in the study, the ligand binding cavity was only occupied by two water molecules. The ligand binding pocket is usually formed by a number of hydrophobic residues. However, the striking feature of Bos d 2 is the existence of hydrophilic residues in the pocket (Fig.4). An important residue is Glu115, in which the first carboxylate oxygen makes hydrogen bonds with Tyr39 and Thr100. The second carboxylate oxygen is hydrogen-bonded with two water molecules. The second important hydrophilic residue in the pocket is Asn37 with the side chain amino group hydrogen-bonded to the main chain carbonyl of Pro34 and the side chain oxygen hydrogen-bonded to the same water molecule as Glu115. These two hydrogen bonds from Glu115 and Asn37 to the water molecule are well oriented geometrically. Because both residues are hydrogen bond acceptors, it is plausible to suggest that the endogenous ligand of Bos d 2 contains a heteroatom(s), which can donate two hydrogen bonds. One such group could be the charged nitrogen with two hydrogen atoms. Many recently characterized animal allergens have been found to be members of the lipocalin family. Examples of such allergic proteins are mouse Mus m 1 (27Lorusso J.R. Moffat S. Ohman Jr., J.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1986; 78: 928-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), bovine Bos d 5 (β-lactoglobulin) (28Ball G. Shelton M.J. Walsh B.J. Hill D.J. Hosking C.S. Howden M.E.H. Clin.

Alzari P.M. David B. Dandeu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32951-32959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures are only available for Mus m 1 and Bos d 5, but their allergenic properties have not been discussed in terms of structure. The best known allergens of the lipocalin family exist as monomers. Mus m 1 was reported to be a dimer in the crystal but when observing the packing of the molecules it is difficult to believe that it is a true dimer. On the other hand, the dimeric structure of β-lactoglobulin is well characterized. In this protein, the longer β-strand I forms an important part of the dimer interface containing a number of hydrogen bonds. The protein exists as a dimer at neutral pH but as a monomer at acidic pH. Four of the allergens, Bla g 4, Can f 1, Can f 2, and Equ c 1, have putativeN-glycosylation sites (Fig.5). These sites are located on the protein surface between β-strands A and B, and between β-strands B and C, and in β-strand D. The main unifying features of allergenic lipocalins are the three-dimensional structure and the transport function. Therefore, the relationship between the structure and B-cell epitopes could reveal valuable information on the determinants of allergenicity of lipocalins. Three different methods have been used to map B-cell epitopes: the use of polypeptide fragments of allergenic proteins, mutagenesis of allergenic proteins, and investigation of surfaces of protein models, e.g. by mapping homologous residues. Generally, much less is known about B-cell (conformational) epitopes than T-cell (sequential) epitopes. We have reported earlier that the C-terminal part of Bos d 2 is important for IgE binding (19Zeiler T. Taivainen A. Rytkönen M. Rautiainen J. Karjalainen H. Mäntyjärvi R. Tuomisto L. Virtanen T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1997; 100: 721-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Among the other lipocalin allergens, B-cell epitopes have been characterized only for β-lactoglobulin (Bos d 5) by using peptide fragments. Ballet al. (28Ball G. Shelton M.J. Walsh B.J. Hill D.J. Hosking C.S. Howden M.E.H. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1994; 24: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) determined that polypeptide 97–108 inhibited the antibody binding of native β-lactoglobulin. This fragment is composed mainly of β-strand G and the preceding loop. Many residues of this fragment would be inside the core in the native protein structure, and it is questionable whether this kind of short fragment would have a native extended β-strand conformation. Because the knowledge of B-cell epitopes of lipocalin allergens is very limited, we have used another method to probe the properties of these molecules. First, a multiple amino acid sequence alignment was carried out for seven proteins with the program GeneWorks (Fig. 5). Despite the probable structural similarity, the identity between the sequences was very low, showing only the two identical residues, Gly14 and Trp16 (Bos d 2 numbering), of the main conserved segment of the lipocalin family. The computer program used also estimates a penalty or a “cost,” a number from 0 to 9 for alignment; 0 represents strongest similarity and 9 weakest. These values are shown in the Fig. 5 for each residue and are also mapped on the surface of Bos d 2 (Figs. 3, B and C). A resemblance between the molecules can be observed in several areas of the surface. These areas include the α-helix, N- and C-terminal ends of β-strand A, and the loop between β-strands C and D. Some well conserved charged residues can be found in these areas, especially on the surface of the α-helix (Glu126 and Glu129). It would be interesting to continue the analysis to other, nonallergenic lipocalins, but problems would arise, because we do not know if these molecules are potential allergens or not. However, we can conclude that surprisingly many characterized allergens belong to the lipocalin family. These allergens are predominantly monomeric molecules. Some, but not all, are glycosylated, which would indicate that glycosylation is not a common critical determinant of allergenicity in lipocalins. We have identified surface residues of high similarity between lipocalin allergens. These regions would be suitable targets for mutational studies in the development of new preparations for allergen immunotherapy. In the past few years, the three-dimensional structures of allergens of other families have also been determined. The coordinates for four plant and one mite allergen are available at the Brookhaven Data Bank (Table I). The major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 contains a seven-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, which wraps around a long α-helix. The structure also contains two shorter α-helices. The biological function of Bet v 1 is unknown (6Gajhede M. Osmark P. Poulsen F.M. Ipsen H. Larsen J.N van Neerven R.J. Schou C. Løwenstein H. Spangfort M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The second birch pollen allergen, Bet v 2, is a profilin and partly resembles Bet v 1, since it also has a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, but it has a slightly different strand order and helix positions (7Fedorov A.A. Ball T. Mahoney N.M. Valenta R. Almo S.C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mouse ear cress profilin Ara t has a similar structure to birch pollen profilin Bet v 2 (8Thorn K.S. Christensen H.E.M. Shigeta Jr., R. Huddler Jr., D. Shalaby L. Lindberg U. Chua N.H. Schutt C.E.

Major mite allergen Der f 2 is a single domain β-protein with an immunoglobulin fold, and it has been suggested that it is related to the antibacterial defense system (10Ichikawa S. Hatanaka H.

Only preliminary structural data have been published for timothy grass pollen Phl p 2 (9Fedorov A.A. Ball T. Valenta R. Almo S.C. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is composed of an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel, thus resembling lipocalins, but the connection between the β-strands is clearly different. Knowledge of the B-cell epitopes of these allergens is also very limited. Peptides have been used to study the IgE binding of Bet v 2. In particular, it has been suggested that N- and C-terminal fragments are important for binding (7Fedorov A.A. Ball T. Mahoney N.M. Valenta R. Almo S.C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Nishiyama et al. (32Nishiyama C. Fukada M. Usui Y. Iwamoto N. Yuuki T. Okumura Y. Okudaira H. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have studied Der f 2 by using site-directed mutagenesis. They have found that two small areas on the opposite faces of the protein are important for IgE binding. One area is composed of polar or charged residues and the other of more hydrophobic residues. When comparing the available allergen structures, it is easy to note that they are composed mainly of β-structures. Der f 2 and Phl p 2 contain only β-structures, whereas lipocalins, Bet v 1, and profilins also have some helices. Because the experimental knowledge of B-cell epitopes is very limited, it is not possible to suggest any structural motif or sequence pattern common to all allergenic proteins. Therefore we have compared dimensions and shapes of available allergenic molecules. Since many molecules seemed to be a bit flat, we calculated ellipticity for molecules (Fig. 6, TableI). The shortest dimension for these molecules is on average 34 Å, the middle dimension 37 Å, and the longest dimension 44 Å. When looking at the picture, it is evident that these allergens appear to have similar dimensions. Islam et al. (33Islam S.A. Luo J. Sternberg M.J.E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) defined the ellipticity to be the ratio between the longest ellipsoidal axis and the shortest. These allergens are only slighly elliptical (ratio 1.3). Islam et al. (33Islam S.A. Luo J. Sternberg M.J.E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have calculated the ellipticity for most single domain proteins to range from 1.25 to 2.25, which would suggest that these allergens should be considered more spherical than elliptical."

The channel is activated by direct binding of G-protein Gβγsubunits. The GIRK1 subunit is atypical in the GIRK family in having a unique (∼125-amino acid) domain in its distal C terminus. GIRK1 cannot form functional channels by itself but must combine with another GIRK family member (GIRK2, GIRK3, or GIRK4), which are themselves capable of forming functional homotetramers.

Physiological changes in a cell membrane's permeability to potassium (K+) ions are in large part mediated by integral membrane K+-selective channels. Alteration of K+ flux is a critical mechanism for controlling cell excitability in the heart, nervous system, and exocrine tissues. The inward rectifier K+ channels (IRKs)1 contain two transmembrane domains in contrast to the six transmembrane domains of their voltage-gated K+ channel relatives (see Refs. 1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin.

Like the Shaker family of K+ channels, IRKs have the characteristic K+ ion selectivity filter sequence (GYG) in their pore domain. Inward rectifiers conduct K+ions inwardly better than in the outward direction due to intracellular block of the channel pore by Mg2+ ions (4Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) and polyamines (5Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. J. Gen.

IKACh is a unique inwardly rectifying potassium current activated by hormones and neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh), somatostatin, and adenosine, via stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (6North R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 13-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACh released from the vagus nerve binds and activates muscarinic M2 receptors located on cardiac pacemaker cells. M2 receptors selectively couple to the pertussis toxin-sensitive class (Gi/Go) of heterotrimeric G-proteins composed of α- and βγ-subunits. It is the Gβγ subunits that activate IKACh and hyperpolarize the cell, thereby slowing heart rate (4Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E.

The cloning of GIRK1, the first identified GIRK (G-protein-activated inwardlyrectifying K+ channel) subunit, represented the first step toward characterizing native IKACh (9Kubo Y. Reuveny E.

The GIRK1 cDNA was believed to represent native atrial IKACh, since oocytes co-injected with GIRK1 and muscarinic M2 receptor cRNAs displayed ACh-dependent inwardly rectifying K+ currents (9Kubo Y.

However, biochemical purification of GIRK1 subunits from native cardiac atrial tissue revealed that GIRK1 subunits physically associate with a closely related inward rectifier K+channel subunit, GIRK4, to form the native cardiac IKAChchannel (11Krapivinsky G.

The GIRK4 subunit plays a pivotal role in Gβγ-mediated activation of IKACh, since mutation of specific amino acids located within residues 216–248 of GIRK4 either altered the potency of Gβγ or abolished entirely the Gβγactivation of GIRK1/GIRK4 mutant channels (18Krapivinsky G.

GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are also modulated by phosphorylation (19Kim D. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), intracellular Na+ ions (20Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and mechanical stress. Furthermore, the Gβγ-mediated activation of GIRK1/GIRK4 may require the presence of the rare membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (21Huang C.-L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

Stuhmer W. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3559-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the GIRK2 gene results in at least four distinct GIRK2 mRNAs, GIRK2-1, GIRK2A, GIRK2B, and GIRK2C, which differ in the length and amino acid sequence of amino and carboxyl domains (24Kobayashi T.

Coexpression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits in Xenopus oocyte or mammalian cell expression systems such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or COS-7 cells results in Gβγ-dependent K+ currents that are identical to IKACh (11Krapivinsky G.

Like native IKACh, GIRK1/GIRK4 heterotetramers manifest single channels with 1–2-ms open times and a ∼35-pS conductance (11Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). CHO or COS-7 cells expressing only GIRK1 subunits do not display any IKACh-like channel activity (11Krapivinsky G.

Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) despite high levels of protein expression and formation of homotetramers (12Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although expression of GIRK1 alone in Xenopus oocytes results in a low level of IKACh-like channel activity, this activity has been attributed to the presence of an endogenous oocyte GIRK homologue termed GIRK5 (XIR; Ref. 34Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). CHO cells, COS-7 cells, orXenopus oocytes expressing GIRK4 homotetramers do give rise to Gβγ-activated inwardly rectifying K+channels with atypical, small amplitude single channels that have yet to be observed in native cells (11Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 33Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, isolated cardiac atrial cells from GIRK4 knockout mice do not display any detectable IKACh channel activity (8Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a critical role for GIRK4 in the expression of IKACh channels in heterologous cells and in vivo. We previously showed that GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits display dramatically different localization patterns in permeabilized COS-7 cells with GIRK4 being localized to the cell surface, whereas GIRK1 localized to the cytoskeleton (35Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using an extracellular epitope tag on GIRK1, we demonstrate that GIRK1 requires association with GIRK4 for cell surface localization. GIRK4 associates with GIRK1 either during or shortly after subunit synthesis and allows appropriate glycosylation of GIRK1 subunits to a form seen in native atrial tissue. We created chimeras of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits that localize to the cell surface to identify potential domains involved in the differential localization of the subunits. Specifically, chimeras containing the C-terminal tail of GIRK1 were retained inside the cell, while chimeras containing the C terminus of GIRK4 were expressed at the cell surface. Using deletion analysis of GIRK4, we narrowed down the region of GIRK4 required for cell surface localization of GIRK1/GIRK4 heterotetramers to amino acids 375–399. The importance of GIRK4's role in cell surface localization and processing of heterotetrameric IKACh is underscored by the absence of mature glycosylation and the intracellular localization of GIRK1 in dissociated atrial myocytes from GIRK4 knockout mice. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were plated at 2 × 106cells/100-mm dish 1 day prior to transfection. COS-7 cells were transfected using either Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) or TransIT LT-1 (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI). CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CHO cells were plated at 40% confluence onto glass coverslips and transfected with channel cDNAs and tracer amounts of pGREEN-Lantern (Life Technologies) as a marker to identify transfected cells. Construction and characterization of the C-terminally tagged rat GIRK1-AU5 and rat GIRK4-AU1 epitope-tagged subunits has been described (35Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Flag epitope sequence (DYKDDDDK) was introduced into the putative extracellular region of the GIRK1-AU5 cDNA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the site elimination method (Transformer Mutagenesis;CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) between amino acids 114 and 115 of GIRK1 to create the GIRK1-Flag cDNA. To eliminate GIRK1N-linked glycosylation, the N119D mutation was introduced into the GIRK1-Flag to produce the GIRK1(N119D)-Flag cDNA. GIRK1(N119D)-Flag subunits displayed similar functional properties as wild type GIRK1 subunits when coexpressed with the GIRK4 subunit (data not shown). Truncation of GIRK1 at amino acid 373 was performed by introduction of the 6-amino acid epitope AU5 (TDFYLK) followed by a TGA stop codon and a unique XbaI site by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). A 332-base pair PmlI/XbaI fragment derived from the PCR product was subcloned into the wild type-containing pCDNA3-GIRK1 vector and sequenced. The GIRK4:GIRK1-(373–501) chimera was created by introduction of a unique NotI site at the C terminus of GIRK4 and at amino acid 373 of GIRK1. A 417-base pairNotI/ApaI fragment from GIRK1 was subcloned into theNotI/ApaI site of pCDNA3-GIRK4-AU1. A cDNA encoding amino acids 373–501 followed by the Flag epitope was created by PCR. The PCR-based strand overlap extension method was used to create chimeras between GIRK1 and GIRK4 within the pore domain: GIRK1-(1–141):GIRK4-(148–419), GIRK1:GIRK4-pore and GIRK4-(1–119):GIRK1-(114–501), GIRK4:GIRK1-pore. A second pair of chimeras was generated just after the end of the second transmembrane domain: GIRK1-(1–194):GIRK4-(200–419), GIRK1–194:GIRK4–200 and GIRK4-(1–200):GIRK1-(194–501), GIRK4–200:GIRK1–194. The chimeric PCR products were TA-cloned using topoisomerase into the pCNDA3.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). GIRK4 deletion constructs were generated using the site elimination method described above by introducing the AU1 epitope followed by a stop codon after the indicated amino acid in Fig. 8. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes containing 25-mm coverslips prior to transfection. Thirty-six to 48 h following transfection, the coverslips were transferred to PBS supplemented with 0.5 mm each of CaCl2 and MgCl2 (PBS C/M) and washed three times in PBS C/M at room temperature. The cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by three 5-min washes with PBS. The cells were incubated in PBS supplemented with Triton X-100 (0.2%) and 3% bovine serum albumin (0.2 μm filtered; PBSTB) for 45 min to both permeabilize cells and block nonspecific binding sites. Triton X-100 was eliminated from the PBSTB solution in experiments designed to detect cell surface subunits containing the extracellular Flag epitope. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBSTB to the concentrations indicated in the figure legends and incubated sequentially for 1 h at room temperature. Following each incubation, the cells were washed four times for 15 min each with 3 ml of PBSTB/coverslip. Mouse atrial myocytes were isolated as described previously (8Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Coverslips with dissociated mouse atrial cells were processed as described above except that the GIRK1-specific antifusion protein antibody anti-Csh (11Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) was used at 2 μg/ml and a goat anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) was used for detection. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Aqua-polymount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) and viewed using a Zeiss LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope. Single channel recordings were performed in the inside-out configuration, in symmetrical 140 mmK+ solution (118.5 mm KCl, 5 mmKOH/EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKOH/HEPES, pH 7.2, adjusted with concentrated HCl). The pipette resistance was 2–5 megaohms. The holding potential was −80 mV. The currents were amplified using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and stored on a VCR tape after filtering at 5 kHz (four-pole low pass Bessel filter). The signal was then digitally sampled at 50 kHz frequency and stored on a computer hard disk using pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). While no further filtering has been performed for kinetic andnP o analysis, data displayed in Fig. 5 have been low pass-filtered at 2 kHz frequency with an eight-pole Bessel filter. For each patch, nP o has been determined from 10-s data segments before and after the addition of Gβγto the bath (final Gβγ concentration 20 nm). pClamp6 software was used for data analysis. Mean open time was determined from idealized tracings using custom-made software written in TurboPascal. We chose this method for comparing the wild type and truncated channel rather than exponential fitting because most of the patches contained multiple simultaneous channel openings. Membranes from single 100-mm dishes of transiently transfected COS-7 cells were prepared as described below. Endoglycosidase F or H (Boehringer Mannheim) treatment was performed on equal amounts of membranes from COS-7 according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure at 37 °C for 14 h. Control samples not containing endoglycosidase enzymes were incubated in parallel. The membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation, and the pellet was solubilized by incubation at 55 °C for 20 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with GIRK1-specific polyclonal antibodies. Channel subunits were immunoprecipitated using either the AU5 or AU1 antibody in experiments assessing the effect of GIRK4-AU1 coexpression on the extent of mature glycosylation of GIRK1. Proteins eluted from the Gammabind-G-Sepharose were separated on a 11% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry blotting apparatus for 40 min at 15 V. GIRK1 and GIRK4 proteins were identified by Western blotting with a mixture of GIRK1 and GIRK4-specific affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence method for detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Atrial membranes were prepared by first manually dissecting away atria from three wild type or GIRK4 knockout mice. Tissue was homogenized by three 30-s bursts of a Polytron homogenizer in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was brought to 700 mm KCl and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS, and protein levels were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The equivalent of 200 μg of atrial membrane protein was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and solubilized in 1× SDS-sample buffer. Twenty-five μg of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated membrane protein from wild type or GIRK4 knockout mice was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride followed by Western blotting. Western blots were performed sequentially using the anti-Csh (11Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), anti-GIRK1-(436–501) (Alamone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), or KGAN2–216 directed against amino acids 1–22 of GIRK1 (11Krapivinsky G. Gordon E. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The GIRK4 antibody was raised against amino acids 404–418 in the C terminus. The GIRK4 antibody showed no cross-reactivity to recombinant GIRK1, GIRK2-1, or GIRK3 (data not shown). For pulse-labeling experiments, single 100-mm dishes of COS-7 cells cotransfected with GIRK1-AU5 and GIRK4-AU1 subunits were methionine-deprived for 2 h followed by metabolic labeling with 50 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 5, 15, 30, or 60 min. At each time point, the cells were cooled on ice and washed twice with PBS and then lifted from the dish with PBS, 5 mm EDTA. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed on ice by drawing the cell pellet through a 23-gauge needle 10 times in 5 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0 (5:5:5) supplemented with 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin protease inhibitor mixture. A crude particulate fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was detergent-solubilized by drawing the pellet through a 27-gauge needle 10 times in 750 μl of 1% CHAPS, 10 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in aprotinin protease inhibitor mixture. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g for 1 h. Samples were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of Gammabind-G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for 4 h by adding a 1:200 dilution of centrifuged ascites fluid for either the AU1 or AU5 monoclonal antibodies (Babco, Richmond, CA) or a 10 μg/ml final concentration of M2 anti-Flag antibody (Sigma) and 10 μl of Gammabind-G-Sepharose. The Gammabind-G-Sepharose was washed twice at 4 °C with 750 μl of solubilization buffer, twice with 750 μl of solubilization buffer containing 0.2% CHAPS for 3 min each, and once quickly with solubilization buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Gammabind-G-Sepharose-bound proteins were eluted with 1× nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer at 55 °C for 20 min. For steady state labeling experiments assessing the association of GIRK1(Δ374–501)-AU5 with the GIRK4-AU1 subunit, cells were incubated overnight with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation as described above. Samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. Expression of GIRK1 subunits alone in mammalian cells (CHO or COS-7) fails to produce detectable IKACh-like channel activity in either whole-cell recordings or inside-out patches, while GIRK4 subunits produce Gβγ-activated single channels with short (atypical) duration and variable amplitude (11Krapivinsky G.

Our previous studies identified strikingly different localization patterns for individually expressed epitope-tagged GIRK1-AU5 and GIRK4-AU1 subunits in COS-7 cells (35Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We postulated that the differences in functional expression of GIRK1 versus GIRK4 subunits could be due to the inability of GIRK1 to be trafficked to the cell surface. To test this hypothesis, we inserted the Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) into the putative extracellular domain of GIRK1(GIRK1-Flag) between amino acids 114 and 115. This GIRK1-Flag subunit should be detectable by the anti-Flag antibody in nonpermeabilized cells only when it is present at the cell surface. TheN-linked glycosylation consensus sequence at position 119 was eliminated by an N119D mutation to prevent potential obstruction of the epitope by nearby sugar moieties. The GIRK1(N119D)-Flag subunit gave currents similarly to wild type GIRK1 when coexpressed with GIRK4 in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Nonpermeabilized COS-7 cells expressing the GIRK1(N119D)-Flag subunit did not display any specific immunofluorescence staining (Fig.1 A) compared with pCDNA3 transfected controls, (GIRK1(N119D)-Flag, 142 ± 71 cells;n = 5 coverslips; versus pCDNA3, 139 ± 27 cells; n = 4 coverslips).

Our laboratory has utilized the GT1–7 cell line to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for glucocorticoid regulation of GnRH gene expression. Glucocorticoids have been implicated in physiological regulation of GnRH, as stress-related reproductive disorders and high cortisol levels in women have been associated with reductions in circulating luteinizing hormone (15Berga S.L.

Neuroendocrinology. 1992; 56: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), provides additional support for the notion that glucocorticoids exert direct effects on GnRH gene expression. The GT1–7 cell line also contains functional GRs that, in the presence of glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone, repress GnRH promoter activity (7Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Dong K.W. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).

The fact that GR and Oct-1 co-occupy the distal nGRE (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) of the mouse GnRH promoter suggests that functionally relevant interactions between GR and Oct-1 may not be limited to solution as observed in other studies. We therefore have examined whether GR interacts directly with DNA-bound Oct-1. We show here that purified GR indeed can associate with Oct-1 bound to the GnRH distal nGRE. This provides the first evidence of glucocorticoid repression of transcription that is mediated by the tethering of GR to a DNA-bound transcription factor. We furthermore show that the nature of Oct-1 interactions at the distal nGRE influences transcriptional repression, not only by glucocorticoids, but also by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Thus, alternative conformational states of Oct-1, which are dictated by precise DNA contacts made at different binding sites, may influence the assembly of multi-protein complexes that impart unique regulatory properties upon linked promoters. DNA fragments containing 3446 base pairs of the mouse GnRH promoter (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were mutagenized to create a consensus Oct-1 binding site at the distal nGRE using the protocol supplied in the in vitro mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The primer used for the mutagenesis, 5′-GCTAAGATTTGCATGACCAGG-3′, contained nucleotide changes at base pairs −206 and −207 of the mouse GnRH promoter, to generate a consensus Oct-1 binding site at the mouse GnRH distal nGRE. The GnRH nGRE mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The mouse GnRH promoter containing either the wild type GnRH distal nGRE or the consensus Oct-1 binding site linked to the luciferase reporter gene (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z.

The GnRH promoter deletion to base pair −471 was then blunt-ended and ligated to generate the −471mGnRH-Luc. GT1–7 cells were grown as described previously (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmid DNA along with 5 μg of herring sperm DNA carrier were transfected into GT1–7 cells on 60-mm dishes using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (25Chandran U.R.

The precipitate was allowed to sit on the cells for 12–16 h, after which the cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and refed with fresh medium. The cells were then treated with either 10−6m dexamethasone or 100 ng/ml TPA (Sigma) where indicated. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity (Luciferase kit, Promega, Madison, WI) using the same amount of total protein from each of the plates. The mean luciferase activity for each construct was determined from at least five independent experiments. The luciferase activity between controls and after dexamethasone or TPA treatment was compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The percent change in luciferase activity generated by wild type and mutant reporters was compared using the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Either commercially available BuGR2 monoclonal antibody or clone 57 polyclonal antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Neshanic Station, NJ) was used to detect GR in protein-DNA complexes. The antibody against Oct-1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biologicals (Santa Cruz, CA). The sequences of L7, L73M, and L7M oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 1. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and then hybridized to their complementary strands to generate double-stranded probes. Nuclear extracts from GT1–7 cells were prepared as described previously (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 0.05 μm32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (L7 or L7M) was incubated with 1× gel shift buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50% glycerol, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) in a 15-μl reaction volume with 5 μg of GT1–7 cell nuclear extract for 15 min at room temperature. To resolve protein-DNA complexes, the reaction mix was run on native 10% polyacrylamide (75:1) gels in 1× TBE (Tris borate, EDTA) buffer. Gels were electrophoresed in 1× TBE at 180 V for approximately 30 min. For competition assays, unlabeled double-stranded competitor DNA was incubated with GT1–7 nuclear extract for 10 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. For supershift assays with BuGR2 monoclonal GR antibody, 1 μl of BuGR2 was first incubated with GT1–7 extract for 10 min at room temperature, after which the radiolabeled probe was added. The incubation was then continued for another 15 min. For supershift assays with the Oct-1 polyclonal antibody, probe and nuclear extract were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, after which the antibody was added. The incubation at room temperature was continued for an additional 30 min. For EMSAs with purified Oct-1, 0.05 μm32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with 1× Oct-1 gel shift buffer (4% glycerol, 20 mmHepes-KOH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml BSA), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). and 2 μl of purified Oct-1 for 15 min at room temperature. For supershift assays. 2 μl of Oct-1 antibody was added and the incubation continued for an additional 15 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved as described above. For EMSAs with purified Oct-1 and purified rat GR (32Warren B.S. Kusk P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11434-11440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), 0.05 μm32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated in 1× Oct-1 gel shift buffer (see above), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA, 2 μl of purified Oct-1, and 0.5 μl of purified GR. The reaction was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then 5 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved as described above. 0.05 μm32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (L7 or L7M) was incubated with 1× Oct-1 gel shift buffer in a 15 μl reaction volume with 5 μg of GT1–7 cell nuclear extract for 15 min at room temperature. Sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was then added at increasing concentrations (1.25–5 ng/ml) and the reaction incubated for another 10 min on ice. To resolve protein-DNA complexes, the reaction mix was run on native 10% polyacrylamide (75:1) gels in 1× TBE buffer. Gels were electrophoresed in 1× TBE at 180 V for approximately 30 min. Oct-1 was either purified from HeLa cells using established methods (33Murphy S. Pierani A. Scheidereit C. Melli M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 1071-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or from aDrosophila cell (S2) expression system (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). In the latter case, FLAG epitope-tagged full-length human Oct-1 was purified as described (35Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed by sonication, and the supernatant from a 11000 × gcentrifugation incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The M2 agarose was washed five times and the bound protein eluted by incubation with the FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The eluate was concentrated on a Centricon-30 centrifugal concentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA), and aliquots were frozen at −140 °C. Previous results from our laboratory showed that Oct-1 present in GT1–7 cell nuclear extracts binds to the mouse GnRH distal nGRE in vitro (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As the Oct-1-containing complex formed on this nGRE appeared to contain multiple proteins, we wished to determine whether Oct-1 binding to this site required GT1–7 cell-specific nuclear factors. Oct-1 was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract by a combination of wheat germ agglutinin chromatography and DNA affinity chromatography as described previously (33Murphy S. Pierani A. Scheidereit C. Melli M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 1071-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The purity of the Oct-1 preparation was confirmed by silver staining, which showed a single protein band (data not shown). The DNA binding activity of the purified Oct-1 protein was tested using a consensus Oct-1 binding site (29Kutoh E. Strömstedt P.-E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) oligonucleotide (i.e. L73M) that was derived from the GnRH distal nGRE (Fig.1). The 23-base pair L73M and 55-base pair L7M oligonucleotides (hereafter designated “consensus Oct-1 site”) contain two nucleotide substitutions at the Oct-1 homology sequence in the GnRH distal nGRE. As shown in Fig.2 A (lane 2), purified Oct-1 binds strongly to the consensus Oct-1 site. Oct-1 binding to this sequence is not competed effectively by the distal GnRH nGRE (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), suggesting that Oct-1 binds to the consensus Oct-1 site more strongly than to the GnRH distal nGRE. Oct-1 binding to the consensus site is competed by excess cold consensus site oligonucleotide (data not shown) and is completely inhibited by the inclusion of an Oct-1 antibody in the binding reaction (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). The inability of the GnRH distal nGRE to compete with the consensus Oct-1 site for Oct-1 binding was not surprising, given the limited homology of the Oct-1 sequence in this nGRE to a consensus Oct-1 site (Fig. 1). Specifically, the Oct-1 binding site in this element has only a 5/8 match on the bottom strand and 6/8 match on the top strand to a consensus Oct-1 binding site. Nonetheless, as shown in Fig.2 B (lane 2), purified Oct-1 also binds the distal GnRH nGRE oligonucleotide L7, although with lower affinity than to the nGRE mutant containing a consensus Oct-1 site. A 250-fold molar excess of the consensus Oct-1 site effectively competes for binding with the distal nGRE (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). As shown previously, a 250-fold molar excess of the distal nGRE is not able to compete for binding with the consensus Oct-1 site (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). The fact that the protein-DNA complex formed on the distal nGRE contains Oct-1 and not a contaminant in our Oct-1 preparation was confirmed by the ability of an Oct-1 antibody to prevent the formation of an Oct-1·nGRE complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Thus, Oct-1 has the capacity to interact directly with the GnRH distal nGREin vitro, i.e. in the absence of other GT1–7 nuclear proteins. The binding of purified Oct-1 to the GnRH distal nGRE generates a single protein-DNA complex, which is indistinguishable in its electrophoretic mobility from the complex formed on the consensus Oct-1 site. When crude GT1–7 cell nuclear extract was used, multiple distinct protein-DNA complexes formed on the distal nGRE (Fig.3 A, lane 3). Previously, we showed that one multi-protein DNA complex formed on this nGRE (i.e. complex C1-L7) contains Oct-1 and GR (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the consensus Oct-1 site oligonucleotide was incubated with GT1–7 cell nuclear extract, only a single protein-DNA complex was formed (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). As expected from our previous studies with purified Oct-1 (see Fig. 2), the distal nGRE did not effectively compete with the consensus Oct-1 containing oligonucleotide for binding of Oct-1 present in the GT1–7 cell nuclear extract (data not shown). A comparison of the competitive strength of the wild type nGREversus the consensus Oct-1 sequence for GT1–7 nuclear extract binding revealed that the apparent affinity of GT1–7 nuclear extract for the consensus Oct-1 sequence is approximately 10-fold higher than for the GnRH distal nGRE (data not shown). Furthermore, the Oct-1 containing C1-L7M protein-DNA complex, formed on the consensus Oct-1 site had a slightly increased electrophoretic mobility as compared with the Oct-1-containing complex, C1-L7, formed on the distal nGRE (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 4 and3). This apparent migration difference, although small, was noted in multiple EMSAs performed with these oligonucleotides using different GT1–7 cell nuclear extract preparations (data not shown). These large complexes migrate slowly through the 10% polyacrylamide gels and are difficult to resolve. However, we were able to resolve the distal nGRE-protein complex, C1-L7, and the consensus Oct-1 site-protein complex, C1-L7M, on a lower percentage gel (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). As will be shown below, this differential migration most likely reflects the fact that GR is present within the multi-protein C1-L7 complex, but not the C1-L7M complex (see Fig. 3 C). In addition to Oct-1, one multi-protein complex formed on the distal nGRE when using GT1–7 cell nuclear extracts also includes GR (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether GR is also present in the complex formed at the mutant nGRE possessing a consensus Oct-1 binding site, we added the BuGR2 anti-GR antibody to a binding reaction containing the mutant nGRE and GT1–7 cell nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 3 C(lanes 1 and 2), BuGR2 does not supershift the complex formed on the consensus Oct-1 binding site. Thus, increasing the affinity of Oct-1 binding site by mutation of the GnRH distal nGRE alters the recruitment of GR into a multi-protein complex formed on this site with GT1–7 cell nuclear proteins. GRs contained within a multi-protein complex on the distal nGRE do not bind DNA directly at this site (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The only GT1–7 cell nuclear protein that we have established is directly bound to the distal nGRE is Oct-1 (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Does GR bind Oct-1 in this complex and does GR distinguish between Oct-1 bound at either a consensus site Oct-1 site or the distal nGRE? GR and Oct-1 have been shown to interact in vitro in the absence of DNA. In fact, it has been postulated that repression of histone H2b promoter activity by glucocorticoids is brought about by the sequestration of Oct-1 by GR in solution (29Kutoh E. Strömstedt P.-E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although GR and Oct-1 can bind simultaneously in vitro to two distinct sites on the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV LTR; Ref. 23Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar), GR and Oct-1 have never definitively been shown to interact with each other while DNA-bound. In order to reveal whether GR and Oct-1 can co-occupy the GnRH distal nGRE in vitro, we performed EMSAs with this nGRE using purified preparations of rat GR (32Warren B.S. Kusk P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11434-11440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Oct-1. As shown in Fig.4 (lanes 1 and2), an Oct-1·nGRE complex (i.e. complex C1-L7) formed in vitro was supershifted (i.e. complex S1-L7) by the addition of purified GR to the binding reaction. The supershift occurs only when purified GR is added to Oct-1 and not when another protein fraction from the GR purification procedure is incubated with Oct-1 (data not shown). We also tested the ability of purified GR and Oct-1 to bind to the mutant nGRE possessing a consensus Oct-1 binding site. The binding of Oct-1 to the consensus Oct-1 binding site oligonucleotide (complex C1-L7M) is also supershifted by the addition of GR (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and4), but this supershift (complex S1-L7M) is much less pronounced than the GR supershift of the Oct-1·wild type nGRE complex (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 4). Therefore, GR appears to interact differently with Oct-1 depending upon the context of the Oct-1 binding site. It is surprising that purified GR interacts with Oct-1 at the consensus site since GR was not part of the protein complex formed at the consensus Oct-1 binding site in EMSAs with GT1–7 nuclear extract (see Fig. 3 C). This may be due to differences in the relative ratios of GR and Oct-1 in EMSAs with purified proteins versus GT1–7 nuclear extract. Thus, GR can interact with DNA-bound Oct-1 in vitro, particularly at the wild type GnRH distal nGRE. Altering the sequence of the Oct-1 recognition site within the nGRE may affect GR interactions with DNA-bound Oct-1, but additional characterization of these ternary Oct-1·GR·DNA complexes is required to fully address this issue. POU domain proteins such as Oct-1 exhibit some flexibility in their interaction with target DNA sites (36Huang C.C. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Misra V. Walker S. Yang P. Hayes S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such diversity in sequence recognition allows for the recruitment by Oct-1 of unique transcriptional coactivators (37Misra V. Walker S. Yang P. Hayes S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This selectivity is dictated, in part, by the ability of Oct-1 to adopt different conformations at different binding sites (37Misra V. Walker S. Yang P. Hayes S. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since GR interactions with Oct-1 in vitro were altered upon conversion of the distal GnRH nGRE to a consensus Oct-1 site, we set out to examine whether Oct-1 conformation was indeed distinguishable at these two sites. Purified Oct-1 bound to either an nGRE or a consensus Oct-1 site was subjected to a limited trypsin digestion (38Kusk P. John S. Fragoso G. Michelotti J. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31269-31276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Wood J.R. Greene G.L. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and resulting protein-DNA complexes examined by EMSAs. As shown in Fig.5 A, treatment with increasing amounts of trypsin resulted in the appearance of trypsin-resistant fragments on both the L7 and L7M probes. However, Oct-1 bound at these different DNA elements exhibited a differential sensitivity to trypsin. Complexes labeled 1 and 2 represent intact Oct-1 bound to the L7 and L7M probes (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 8). When bound to the consensus Oct-1 site, predominant trypsin-resistant Oct-1-DNA complexes, i.e.designated a–e (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9–12) were observed, while at the nGRE, a different set of trypsin-resistant Oct-1·DNA complexes, i.e. Aand B (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and6), were noted. Complexes A and B on the distal nGRE exhibit different electrophoretic mobilities than complexes d and e on the consensus Oct-1 oligonucleotide.

GAG assembly occurs at serines followed by glycines (SG), but not all SG are utilized. Seven SG motifs are distributed in five CD44 exons, and in this paper we identify the HS and CS assembly sites that are utilized in CD44. Not all the CD44 SG sites are modified. The SGSG motif in CD44 exon V3 is the only HS assembly site; this site is also modified with CS. HS and CS attachment at that site was eliminated by mutation of the serines in the V3 motif to alanine (AGAG). Exon E5 is the only other CD44 exon that supports GAG assembly and is modified with CS. Using a number of recombinant CD44 protein fragments we show herein that the eight amino acids located downstream of the SGSG site in V3 are responsible for the specific addition of HS to this site. If the eight amino acids located downstream from the first SG site in CD44 exon E5 are exchanged with those located downstream of the SGSG site in exon V3, the SG site in E5 becomes modified with HS and CS. Likewise if the eight amino acids found downstream from the first SG in E5 are placed downstream from the SGSG in V3, this site is modified with CS but not HS. We also show that these sequences cannot direct the modification of CD44 with HS from a distance. Constructs containing CD44 exon V3 in which the SGSG motif was mutated to AGAG were not modified with HS even though they contained other SG motifs. Thus, a number of sequence and structural requirements that dictate GAG synthesis on CD44 have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2032799979,"β-Lactamases are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics to render them inactive. The β-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) of Streptomyces clavuligerus, is a potent inhibitor of several β-lactamases, including the TEM-1 enzyme (K i = 0.6 nm). Evidence from the TEM-1/BLIP co-crystal suggests that two BLIP residues, Asp-49 and Phe-142, mimic interactions made by penicillin G when bound in the active site of TEM-1. To determine the importance of these two residues, a heterologous expression system for BLIP was established in Escherichia coli. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change Asp-49 and Phe-142 to alanine, and inhibition constants (K i) for both mutants were determined. Each mutation increases the K i for BLIP inhibition of TEM-1 β-lactamase approximately 100-fold. To address how these two positions effect the specificity of β-lactamase binding, K i values were determined for the interaction of wild-type BLIP, as well as the D49A and F142A mutants, with two extended spectrum β-lactamases (the G238S and the E104K TEM variants). Positions 104 and 238 are located in the BLIP/β-lactamase interface. Interestingly, the three BLIP proteins inhibited the G238S β-lactamase mutant to the same degree that they inhibited TEM-1. However, wild-type BLIP has a higher K i for the E104K β-lactamase mutant, suggesting that interactions between BLIP and β-lactamase residue Glu-104 are important for wild-type levels of BLIP inhibition. β-Lactamases are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics to render them inactive.

These drugs act by inhibiting bacterial penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)1 that are essential for the synthesis of the bacterial peptidoglycan layer (1Tomasz A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1979; 33: 113-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Several resistance mechanisms have evolved in bacteria to protect them from the lethal effects of β-lactam antibiotics. β-Lactamase imparts resistance to the β-lactams by hydrolyzing the amide bond in the four-membered β-lactam ring (2Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Genes encoding β-lactamases may be found on plasmids, transposons, and on the bacterial chromosome (2Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 3Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There are four classes of β-lactamases (classes A-D), categorized by their primary sequence homology. β-Lactamase-mediated resistance has increased because of selective pressure from widespread use of β-lactam antibiotics and is now a serious threat to antibiotic therapy (7Petrosino J. Cantu III, C. Palzkill T. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 323-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TEM-1 β-lactamase, encoded by the bla TEM-1gene, is among the most prevalent plasmid-encoded β-lactamases found in Gram-negative bacteria (8Wiedemann B. Kliebe C. Kresken M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1989; 24: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The name TEM is derived from the name of the patient carrying the pathogen from which the enzyme was isolated (9Jacoby G.A. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It efficiently hydrolyzes penicillins and most cephalosporins (2Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). However, it is a poor catalyst for hydrolysis of the newer third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftazidime, that were designed to circumvent TEM-1-mediated inactivation. In addition to developing new drugs that are unable to be cleaved by β-lactamase, another method to counter the hydrolytic activity of this enzyme has been to administer β-lactamase inhibitors, such as sulbactam and clavulanic acid. Use of an inhibitor along with an existing β-lactam antibiotic is an effective means to treat various β-lactamase producing bacterial pathogens (10Parker R.H. Eggleston M. Infect. Control. 1987; 8: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Clavulanic acid was originally found as a metabolite of the Gram-positive soil bacteriumStreptomyces clavuligerus and, today, is one of the most commonly used β-lactamase inhibitors. β-Lactamase-mediated resistance has been exacerbated by the fact that specific mutations in TEM-1 β-lactamase enable the enzyme to hydrolyze the newer third-generation antibiotics (11Medeiros A.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: S19-S45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 1991; 35: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). These evolved β-lactamases, called extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), provide clinically relevant levels of resistance to even the most recently developed β-lactams. Furthermore, other mutants have been found with substitutions that allow β-lactamase to avoid inactivation by the β-lactamase inhibitors (13Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Swaren P. Lefevre F. Masson J.-M. Prome J.-C. Samama J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18240-18245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A similar result has been observed with SHV-1 β-lactamase, another class A enzyme that is 68% identical to TEM-1 β-lactamase (7Petrosino J. Cantu III, C. Palzkill T. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 323-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, a β-lactamase mutant (TEM-50) has been recovered from clinical isolates with both types of mutations, enabling β-lactamase to hydrolyze extended spectrum antibiotics and avoid inactivation by inhibitors (14Sirot D. Recule C. Chaibi E.B. Bret L. Croize J. Chanal-Claris C. Labia R. Sirot J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1322-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1990, the β-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) was isolated from S. clavuligerus culture supernatants (15Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BLIP is a 165-amino acid protein in its secreted form and is a potent inhibitor of TEM-1 β-lactamase (K i = 0.6 nm) (16Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). BLIP is able to inhibit several β-lactamases, as well as weakly inhibit a penicillin-binding protein (PBP) from Enterococcus faecalis (16Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence and crystal structure of BLIP have been determined, as well as the co-crystal with TEM-1 β-lactamase (16Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The BLIP crystal structure shows that the protein has a novel fold with two similar domains. The BLIP mechanism of inhibition appears to be two-fold. At 2636 Å2, the surface area of the enzyme/inhibitor interface is one of the largest known for protein/protein complexes as BLIP essentially clamps over the active site of β-lactamase (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, an aspartic acid residue at position 49 of BLIP aligns itself in the active site pocket and forms strong hydrogen bonds with four catalytic residues of β-lactamase. Furthermore, a phenylalanine at position 142 of BLIP appears to mimic the benzyl group of the β-lactam antibiotic penicillin G (PenG) and further stabilizes the inhibitory complex (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The result is potent inhibition of TEM-1 β-lactamase. The ongoing problem of targeting bacteria with antimicrobial agents able to circumvent ESBL-mediated antibiotic inactivation creates a need for new potent inhibitors of β-lactamases. The ability to engineer BLIP to tightly bind the ESBLs and PBPs would aid in the design of effective new antimicrobials. New protein-protein interactions found to be effective in inhibiting β-lactamases and PBPs could be duplicated by a peptide inhibitor or synthetic compound designed to mimic the interactions. It would be easier to perform such studies with BLIP if the inhibitor could be expressed in a more manageable genetic and molecular system, such as Escherichia coli. This report describes the efficient expression of functional BLIP in E. coli and the use of this system to determine the importance of residues Asp-49 and Phe-142 for BLIP inhibition of TEM-1 β-lactamase, two extended spectrum TEM-1 mutants, and the SHV-1 β-lactamase. E. coli XL1-Blue (recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR17, supE44, relA1, lac,(F′ proAB, lacI q lacZDM15,Tn10(tetr))) was used to propagate plasmid DNA (Stratagene, Inc.). E. coli RB791 (= strain W3110lacIQL8) was used to express BLIP and the D49A and F142A BLIP mutants (18Brent R. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4204-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 19Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTP123 is a cmpramps derivative of pTrc 99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (see Fig. 1). It was created by ligating the HincII cassette from pKRP10 into BsaI- digested pTrc 99A (20Reece K.S. Phillips G.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TheBsaI site was filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA Polymerase I prior to ligation. This cloning step inserts a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene into the rrnBT1T2 transcriptional terminators and part of the β-lactamase gene encoded by pTrc 99A. As a result, functional β-lactamase is not expressed, and potential difficulty in BLIP purification because of binding of endogenous β-lactamase is avoided. The cat gene in pTP123 is in the same orientation as thetrc promoter. A 6-histidine (6XHis) tag was first inserted between the β-lactamase signal sequence and the BLIP coding sequence of pG3-BLIP (21Huang W. Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The internal mutagenic PCR primer sequences are: BLIPHIS-1 (a top strand primer), 5′-CACCACCACCACCACCACGCGGGGGTGATGACCGGGGCGAAG-3′; and BLIPHIS-2 (a bottom strand primer), 5′-CGCGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTCTGGGTGAGCAGCAAAAACAGGAAGGCA-3′. The external PCR primers used to amplify the construct are: PD-bla1 (top strand, N-terminal), 5′-CGGGGAGCTCGTTTCTTAGACGTCAGGTGGC-3′; and MALBLI-2 (bottom strand C-terminal), 5′-GGGAAATCTAGATTATACAAGGTCCCACTGCCG-3′. ASacI site in PD-bla1 and a XbaI site in MALBLI-2 allowed the PCR product to be cloned into SacI- andXbaI-digested pTP123 following treatment of the vector with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The finalSacI/XbaI fragment contains, from 5′ to 3′, the TEM-1 β-lactamase constitutive promoter, the TEM-1 β-lactamase signal sequence, and a 6XHis tag at the N terminus of BLIP followed by the mature BLIP coding sequence. The sequence of this clone was confirmed by the dideoxy chain-termination method and was named pGR32 (Fig. 1). The positioning of this construct in pTP123 allows the N-terminal His-tagged BLIP to be expressed either under the TEM-1 β-lactamase constitutive promoter or by induction of the trc promoter with IPTG. The 6XHis tag facilitates the purification of BLIP using an appropriate nickel- or cobalt-based affinity column, while the β-lactamase signal sequence enables BLIP to be transported to the periplasmic space, thus eliminating the need to isolate whole cell extracts for BLIP purification. Construction of the BLIP D49A and F142A mutants was accomplished by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). PD-bla1 and MALBLI-2 were used as external primers in these mutagenesis reactions. The internal top and bottom primers for constructing the D49A mutant are: BP-D49A (top), 5′-CGGGGGCACGCGGCAGGGGCTTACTACGCCTACGCCACC-3′; and D49A (bottom), 5′-GGTGGCGTAGGCGTAGTAGGCCCCTGCCGCGTGCCCCCG-3′. The internal top and bottom primers for constructing the F142A mutant are: BP-F142A (top), 5′-GGTTACTCGTCGACGGGGGCTTACCGAGGCTCGGCGCA-3′; and F142A-BOT (bottom), 5′-GTGCGCCGAGCCTCGGTAAGCCCCCGTCGACGAGTAACC-3′. PD-bla1 and MALBLI-2 were used to amplify the full-size mutagenized product. Both mutagenic PCR products were cloned intoSacI/XbaI-digested and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated pTP123. The plasmid containing the D49A mutant was named pJP128, and the plasmid containing the F142A mutant was named pJP129. The DNA sequence of each mutant was confirmed by the dideoxy chain-termination method. Plasmids pGR32, pJP128, and pJP129 were transformed into E. coliRB791 by electroporation. An overnight culture of each was grown shaking in 40 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C in the presence of 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The 40 ml of overnight culture were used to inoculate 2 liters of LB medium containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The bacteria was then grown shaking at 25 °C until A 600 = 1.2. For induction of BLIP, 3 mm IPTG was added to each culture, and the cultures were then allowed to grow an additional 5 h. Following the 5-h induction, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 15 ml of sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl). The cells were then sonicated in two batches, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. The soluble protein in the supernatant was purified over a 4-ml TALON column (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer instructions. A 4 mm imidizole wash step was utilized to remove protein from the column which bound less tightly than the His-tagged BLIP. BLIP was eluted using an elution buffer consisting of 50 mm imidizole added to the sonication buffer (pH 8.0). Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE to estimate purity and yield (Fig. 2). Approximately 500 μg of >90% pure BLIP could be isolated for every two liters of culture using this strategy. Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed to calibrate a Bradford assay for determining BLIP and β-lactamase concentrations (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Wild-type β-lactamase and the G238S and E104K extended spectrum mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (24Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22538-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The location of the two extended spectrum mutations, with respect to Asp-49 and Phe-142 of BLIP, is shown in Fig.3. Varying concentrations of BLIP were incubated with 1 nm β-lactamase for 2 h at 25 °C. 2 nm of the β-lactamase were used in the G238S studies. The enzyme-inhibitor incubation was done in 0.05 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following the 2-h incubation, which is sufficient time to achieve binding equilibrium in a small volume, cephaloridine was added at a concentration of at least 10-fold lower than the K mof the β-lactamase being tested (e.g. wild-type TEM-1 β-lactamase has a K m of approximately 700 μm for cephaloridine, therefore 70 μmcephaloridine was added to the TEM-1/BLIP incubation). The final volume for the reaction was 0.5 ml. Hydrolysis of cephaloridine was monitored at A 260 on a Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficient used for cephaloridine was Δε = 10,200m−1 cm−1 (24Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22538-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plots of the concentration of free β-lactamase versus inhibitor concentration were fit by nonlinear regression analysis to Equation 1, where [E free] is the concentration of active β-lactamase calculated from the measured velocity and the activity and concentration of uninhibited β-lactamase, [Eo] is the total β-lactamase concentration, and [Io] is the total inhibitor concentration (25Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22129-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the equation, apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (K i*) were determined. Efree=[Eo]−[Eo]+[Io]+Ki *−([Eo]+[Io]+Ki *)2−(4[Eo][Io])2Equation 1 To determine whether the histidine tag affects BLIP inhibitory activity and to test the activity of the BLIP mutants against TEM-1, the ESBLs, and SHV-1 β-lactamase, an inhibitor assay was developed using the cephalosporin cephaloridine as a substrate. Wild-type or mutant BLIP was incubated with a target for 2 h, which is sufficient time to achieve equilibrium. After the 2-h incubation, cephaloridine (at a concentration 10-fold less than the cephaloradine K m for the β-lactamase being tested) was added. Monitoring the hydrolysis of cephaloridine at a concentration below K m allowed the concentration of uninhibited β-lactamase to be determined without shifting the binding equilibrium. The concentration of free β-lactamase was calculated from the cephaloridine activity in the presence of a given quantity of BLIP, the cephaloridine activity in the absence of BLIP, and the known molar concentration of β-lactamase being used. Fitting the data obtained when incubating varying concentrations of wild-type, His-tagged BLIP with 1 nm TEM-1 β-lactamase resulted in aK i of 0.11 nm(Fig. 4, TableI). This value compares reasonably well with the previously reported value of 0.6 nm found with BLIP purified from S. clavuligerus (16Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and suggests that the N-terminal 6XHis tag has little effect on the binding of the inhibitor to the TEM-1 enzyme.Table IInhibition constants (Ki) for wild-type BLIP and the D49A and F142A mutants with TEM-1, G238S, E104K, and SHV-1 β-lactamasesBLIPβ-lactamaseTEM-1G238SE104KSHV-1Wild-type0.11 ± .0010.07 ± .01140 ± 51000 ± 70D49A8.3 ± 0.69.4 ± 0.81500 ± 52NDF142A33 ± 0.555 ± 4240 ± 15NDAll values are expressed in nm.

ND, value not determined. To determine whether wild-type BLIP has similar affinity for extended spectrum β-lactamases, the K i of BLIP for two representative ESBLs was determined. The G238S β-lactamase mutation is found in many extended spectrum enzymes (26Du Bois S.K. Marriott M.S. Amyes S.G.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1995; 35: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This single mutation increases the catalytic efficiency of β-lactamase for the third generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime approximately 70- and 40-fold, respectively (27Venkatachalam K.V. Huang W. LaRocco M. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23444-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E104K mutation, likewise, has been found in many extended spectrum β-lactamase variants (26Du Bois S.K. Marriott M.S. Amyes S.G.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1995; 35: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This mutation increases the catalytic efficiency of β-lactamase approximately 50-fold for ceftazidime and 10-fold for cefotaxime (28Petit A. Maveyraud L. Lenfant F. Samama J.-P. Labia R. Masson J.-M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both Gly-238 and Glu-104 are located at the binding interface of BLIP and β-lactamase (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Wild-type BLIP was found to have aK i of 0.07 nm for G238S, and aK i of 140 nm for E104K (Figs. 5 and6, Table I). These values suggest that the G238S mutation has little effect on the binding of wild-type BLIP to β-lactamase, whereas the E104K mutation interferes with binding in such a way that the K i increases 1000-fold.Figure 6Determination of wild-type and mutant BLIPK i values for E104K β-lactamase. BLIP inhibitory activity is expressed as the remaining concentration of free β-lactamase at varying inhibitor concentrations. E104K concentration is 1 nm, and the cephaloridine concentration is 70 μm for all experiments. The apparentK i was determined as in Fig. 4. Filled circles, wild-type BLIP; open circles, D49A; and filled squares, F142A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The x-ray structure of the BLIP·TEM-1 β-lactamase complex shows that BLIP residues Asp-49 and Phe-142 mimic portions of the β-lactam PenG when bound to β-lactamase (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This structural mimicry suggests that these residues maintain important interactions in the inhibitory complex. To determine the contribution of these amino acids to inhibition of TEM-1 β-lactamase and extended spectrum-hydrolyzing β-lactamases, the D49A and F142A mutants were constructed. The K i of each was determined with TEM-1, E104K, and G238S β-lactamases (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6; Table I). Both the D49A and F142A mutants exhibited an approximately 100–300-fold increase in K i compared with wild-type BLIP inhibition of TEM-1 β-lactamase. The D49A mutant inhibits TEM-1 with a K i of 8.3 nm, whereas the F142A mutant inhibits with a K i of 33 nm. To ascertain whether these mutations affect inhibition in an additive manner, the D49A/F142A double mutant was constructed. However, we were unable to express the double mutant under the same strategy used with wild-type BLIP and the other single amino acid mutants. The interactions of the wild-type, D49A, and F142A BLIP inhibitors with the ESBLs show that BLIP binds G238S with similar strength as that of wild-type TEM-1, but binds E104K weakly. The K ivalues found for D49A and F142A mutants with G238S β-lactamase were similar to the K i values found for the BLIP mutants binding TEM-1. The D49A BLIP mutant inhibited G238S with aK i of 9.4 nm. Therefore, as with TEM-1, the D49A mutation reduced inhibition 100-fold. Likewise, the F142A BLIP bound G238S β-lactamase approximately 800-fold weaker, with aK i of 55 nm. The fact that these two substitutions in BLIP have a similar effect on theK i values for the TEM-1 and G238S β-lactamases suggests that BLIP inhibits G238S in much the same way it inhibits TEM-1. Further experiments showed that Asp-49 and Phe-142 do not contribute to the binding of E104K β-lactamase as they do to the binding of TEM-1 and G238S. The K i of BLIP D49A with E104K β-lactamase is 1.5 μm, which is only a 10-fold increase compared with that of the wild-type BLIP interaction with E104K. This suggests that BLIP residue Asp-49 is not as critical to inhibition of E104K β-lactamase as it is to the other enzymes tested. This observation is even more pronounced with the BLIP F142A substitution in that there was little change from the wild-type BLIPK i with the BLIP F142A mutant inhibiting E104K (K i (F142A) = 240 nm). Therefore, in contrast to their effect on TEM-1 and G238S binding, the D49A and F142A substitutions do not have as detrimental an effect on theK i for E104K β-lactamase. The amino acid sequence of SHV-1 is 68% identical to TEM-1 β-lactamase (7Petrosino J. Cantu III, C. Palzkill T. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 323-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). How this similarity corresponds to structure homology is unknown as the crystal structure of SHV-1 β-lactamase has not yet been solved. Both the TEM-1 and SHV-1 enzymes hydrolyze a similar profile of penicillins and cephalosporins. It is not clear whether the homology between the two enzymes implies that BLIP should inhibit both equally well. It may be that even slight differences in the three-dimensional structure of SHV-1 compared with TEM-1 would effect BLIP binding considerably. These issues were addressed by performing an additional inhibitory assay with wild-type BLIP and SHV-1 β-lactamase. SHV-1 was purified to greater than 90% homogeneity (data not shown) and was bound to increasing concentrations of wild-type BLIP. The K i of BLIP for SHV-1 was found to be 1.0 μm, 9,000-fold higher than what was found for TEM-1 (Fig. 7, Table I). Therefore, the high degree of identity between these enzymes does not translate to similar binding properties by BLIP. The development of novel inhibitors for β-lactamases as well as penicillin-binding proteins would provide new options for the treatment of bacterial infections. As β-lactamases are believed to have evolved from PBPs, it is conceivable that minor changes in the structure of BLIP could enable it to bind and inhibit PBPs (29Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frere J.-M. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has already been observed that wild-type BLIP weakly inhibits PBP5 fromEnterococcus (16Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Understanding how the amino acid sequence of BLIP encodes its tight binding affinity for certain β-lactamases, and its weaker affinity for PBPs, would facilitate the development of novel inhibitors with potent activity for the ESBLs and for the PBPs. The identification of amino acids most responsible for inhibition and those critical for binding specificity will pinpoint the residues that need to be targeted for engineering BLIP mutants with higher inhibitory activity for different β-lactamases and PBPs. The crystal structure of the BLIP·TEM-1 complex suggests that two BLIP amino acids, Asp-49 and Phe-142, are critical for the inhibition of TEM-1 through interactions in the active site pocket (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, the BLIP amino acids that bind the 99–112 loop of β-lactamase (Ser-35, Phe-36, Ser-39, His-41, His-45, Ala-47, Gly-48, Tyr-50, Tyr-53, Ser-71, Glu-73, Lys-74, Ser-113, Gly-141, Tyr-143, Trp-150, Trp-112, Arg-160, Trp-162) represent the majority of the surface interactions between the two proteins (2636 Å2 is buried at the intermolecular surface) (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These residues are the primary candidates for mutational analysis to distinguish whether “hot spots” consisting of a subset of these amino acids are involved in specificity and binding or if all of these residues contribute to the binding of BLIP to TEM-1 β-lactamase. The first step in being able to identify amino acids important for BLIP specificity and inhibitory activity is to develop an expression system to produce functional BLIP. BLIP expressed in its native S. clavuligerus produces large quantities of protein, whereas expression in another Streptomyces species,Streptomyces lividans, produces limited quantities of BLIP (15Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pradakar A.S. Petrich A.K. Leskiw B.K. Aidoo K.A. Jensen S.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Successful expression of soluble BLIP in E. coliwould facilitate the study of BLIP mutants and would also allow protein engineering techniques to be performed. Histidine-tagged proteins are able to be purified in a relatively simple manner, while usually maintaining the native activity of the tagged protein. Therefore, an expression system centered around an N-terminal 6XHis-tagged BLIP was constructed. Expression is directed by the inducible trc promoter, and a cat gene is inserted into the β-lactamase gene of the plasmid to avoid possible complex formation during purification of BLIP (Fig. 1). This system enabled BLIP to be purified to >90% homogeneity in one step (Fig. 2). Wild-type His-tagged BLIP was found to have a K i of 0.11 nm. This value is slightly lower than the previously calculated value of 0.6 nm for BLIP isolated from S. clavuligerus (16Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This difference could be attributed to the manner in which the K i was calculated, and confirms that the N-terminal His tag has no effect on BLIP binding. Once expression of functional BLIP was achieved, the roles of BLIP residues in the inhibition of different targets could be determined. The crystal structure of BLIP with TEM-1 β-lactamase shows that Asp-49 of BLIP makes strong hydrogen bond contacts with four conserved residues in the TEM-1 active site pocket: Ser-130, Lys-234, Ser-235, and Arg-244 (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These four amino acids are involved in the binding and catalysis of β-lactam antibiotics and are conserved in all class A β-lactamases. Mutation of the aspartic acid to an alanine removes the carboxylate moiety that serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the four active site TEM-1 residues. Elimination of the carboxylate reduced the inhibitory activity of BLIP approximately 100-fold, indicating residue Asp-49 does make an important contribution to BLIP inhibition of TEM-1 β-lactamase. The crystal structure also leads to the prediction that Phe-142 is also important for inhibition of TEM-1 β-lactamase (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Phe-142 is in contact with β-lactamase residues Glu-104, Tyr-105, Asn-170, Ala-237, Gly-238, and Glu-240 in the complex. As in the case of Asp-49, most of these residues are either conserved in class A β-lactamases or are involved in catalysis. It was also found that in other protein complexes, such as between human growth hormone and its receptor, the most critical interactions are hydrophobic (31Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Therefore, the contribution of Phe-142 to binding and inhibition was examined. The F142A substitution removes the hydrophobic side chain that mimics the benzyl group in PenG from the TEM-1·PenG complex. This change also increases the K i approximately 100-fold, which suggests that the interactions mediated by Phe-142 are important for inhibitor binding, and that they are similar in magnitude to the contributions made by Asp-49. The D49A/F142A double mutant was constructed to test additivity between these two residues, but the protein was not expressed. The ability of wild-type BLIP and the D49A and F142A mutants to inhibit two extended spectrum β-lactamase mutants was also examined. G238S, the β-lactamase mutation found in TEM-19, and E104K, the mutation found in TEM-17, were the two representative extended spectrum mutants tested with BLIP and the BLIP mutants (26Du Bois S.K. Marriott M.S. Amyes S.G.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1995; 35: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The prevalence of the G238S and E104K substitutions in many of the extended spectrum β-lactamases makes these two single mutants ideal candidates for study. Interestingly, wild-type BLIP, D49A, and the F142A BLIP mutant each inhibited G238S at similar levels to that which they inhibited wild-type TEM-1 β-lactamase. According to the crystal structure, the only contact made with Gly-238 of TEM-1 is by Phe-142. The fact that no change in the inhibition profile was observed between the β-lactamase enzymes suggests that this contact between Gly-238 and Phe-142 is not critical for BLIP binding and inhibition. If this interaction played a role in BLIP inhibition, then replacement of the glycine side-chain at position 238 of TEM-1 would have resulted in an increasedK i with wild-type BLIP. However, the possibility that the substituted serine at position 238 makes new interactions with BLIP, and corrects exactly for the loss of interaction with Phe-142, cannot be excluded. In contrast to BLIP binding to G238S, significant changes in the inhibitory profile were observed when E104K was used as the target β-lactamase. Wild-type BLIP inhibited E104K approximately 1000-fold worse than for TEM-1, suggesting that the interactions made between BLIP and Glu-104 are critical for wild-type levels of activity. This result indicates that some, or all, of the BLIP residues interacting with Glu-104 (BLIP-Glu-73, Lys-74, Phe-142, and Tyr-143) are making important interactions. However, results from the BLIP F142A/β-lactamase E104K binding experiment suggest that the lysine substitution at position 104 of β-lactamase disrupts critical interactions made by Phe-142 of BLIP. This disruption of the BLIP Phe-142 interaction with β-lactamase results in the pronounced loss of inhibition observed with the E104K enzyme. It is apparent from this study that while BLIP residues Asp-49 and Phe-142 are critical for wild-type BLIP inhibitory levels, the D49A and F142A variants still bind TEM-1 β-lactamase with nanomolar affinity. Therefore, other interactions must also contribute to the strong levels of inhibition observed. The identification of the epitopes responsible for the remaining binding energy will facilitate the engineering of tighter, smaller inhibitors for these β-lactamases. Determination of the K i of BLIP with SHV-1 β-lactamase shows that even though TEM-1 and SHV-1 are both class A β-lactamases and are 68% identical, the interactions which make BLIP a tight inhibitor of TEM-1 are not conserved with SHV-1. Although no crystal structure is available for SHV-1, the level of identity between TEM-1 and SHV-1 suggests that both enzymes share a similar protein fold. However, the fact that BLIP is a poorer inhibitor of SHV-1 shows that small differences between the β-lactamases are significant with respect to BLIP binding.

Several families of adhesion molecules contribute to the mechanical stability of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (1Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 155-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that, in addition to their mechanical properties, adhesion molecules function to initiate cytoplasmic signaling cascades (reviewed in Refs. 2Doherty P. Smith P. Walsh F.S. Persp. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 4: 157-168PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yamada K.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev.

Gallatin W.M. Immunol. Res. 1998; 17: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The role of these cascades in initiating changes in gene transcription is well described for certain extracellular stimuli such as growth factors (7Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar,8Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), but little is known about the nuclear events that result from cell adhesion molecule binding. The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM)1 is a member of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig) superfamily of adhesion molecules, and it contains five Ig repeats and two repeats similar to the type three domains in fibronectin (FN) (9Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M. Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). N-CAM mediates adhesion predominantly through homophilic binding that appears to involve all of the Ig domains (10Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Ranheim T.S. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4071-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). During development, N-CAM affects cell migration, neurite outgrowth, and target recognition (reviewed in Refs. 1Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 155-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 12Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In the adult, N-CAM is expressed at synaptic junctions and is thought to modulate synaptic function (reviewed in Refs. 14Fields D. Itoh K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar and 15Rose S.P.R. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1996; 90: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); moreover, its promoter appears to be activated in response to neural stimulation (16Holst B.D. Vanderklish P.W. Krushel L.A. Zhou W. Langdon R.B. McWhirter J.R. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2597-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In response to neural injury, N-CAM can inhibit the proliferative response by astrocytes (17Krushel L.A. Sporns O. Cunningham B.A. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4323-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and promote axonal regeneration (18Martini R. J. Neurocytol. 1994; 23: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 19Daniloff J.K. Shoemaker R.S. Lee A.F. Strain G.M. Remsen L.G. Rest. Neurol.

The cellular processes affected by N-CAM homophilic binding are likely to require alterations in gene transcription. In support of this notion, N-CAM interactions at the cell surface of neurons (21Mauro V.P. Wood I.C. Krushel L. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2868-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and astrocytes (22Crossin K.L. Tai M.-H. Krushel L.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2687-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have been shown to alter gene expression. The identification of transcription factors activated by N-CAM should therefore aid in the elucidation of intracellular signaling pathways and genes that are regulated by cell adhesion. Our previous studies have indicated that N-CAM homophilic binding inhibits proliferation of neonatal astrocytes in vitro (23Sporns O. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and adult astrocytes in vivo after injury (17Krushel L.A. Sporns O. Cunningham B.A. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4323-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These studies also revealed that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a transcription factor activated by steroid binding, plays a role in N-CAM-mediated signaling (22Crossin K.L. Tai M.-H. Krushel L.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2687-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Krushel L.A. Tai M.-H. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2586-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For example, N-CAM binding to astrocytes led to activation of reporter constructs driven by two copies of a consensus glucocorticoid response element (22Crossin K.L. Tai M.-H. Krushel L.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2687-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, the GR antagonist RU-486 partially blocked the activities of N-CAM. These studies support the hypothesis that N-CAM binding to astrocytes results in alterations in transcription factors leading to changes in gene transcription. To explore this hypothesis further, we have begun to search for changes in other transcription factors in astrocytes and neurons that are altered in response to N-CAM binding. In addition to its ability to bind DNA, the GR can also bind other transcription factors, including NF-κB, and thereby alter their transcriptional properties (25McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 26Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). NF-κB was originally identified as a transcription factor that was constitutively bound to the enhancer region in the light chain gene in B lymphocytes (27Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) but was subsequently found in other cells in a latent state bound to IκB. External stimuli such as cytokines induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB allowing for the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 28Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar and29Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB has recently been found in both neurons and glia (reviewed in Ref. 30O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, NF-κB is activated by cytokines in response to neural injury (31Perez-Otano I. McMillian M.K. Chen J. Bing G. Hong J.S. Pennypacker K.R. Glia. 1996; 16: 306-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in neurons, NF-κB is activated in response to neural activity (32Meberg P.J. Kinney W.R. Valcourt E.G. Routtenberg A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 33Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The protein has been located at the synapse (35Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and NF-κB may therefore function as an important signaling molecule in the nervous system. In the present study, we examined whether N-CAM binding altered NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Addition of N-CAM reagents to primary cultures of neonatal rat cerebellar granule neurons or forebrain astrocytes led to increased DNA binding of the NF-κB proteins p50 and p65. This DNA binding was correlated with an increase in transcriptional activation of both a synthetic NF-κB reporter construct and an IκB-α promoter construct that contains an NF-κB DNA-binding site. NF-κB/DNA binding did not affect the ability of N-CAM to inhibit astrocyte proliferation. The present findings, together with previous results, suggest that multiple pathways are stimulated after N-CAM homophilic binding, resulting in differential gene transcription and different cellular behaviors. Purified N-CAM, N-CAM recombinant proteins, and N-CAM antibodies were described previously (11Ranheim T.S. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4071-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Krushel L.A. Tai M.-H. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NF-κB antibodies for EMSA supershift analysis and for Western blots were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuron-specific enolase were obtained from Dako. BAY 11-7082 and BAY 11-7085 were obtained from Biomol. The NF-κB-luc reporter construct (36Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Mercedes Rincon. The IκB-α reporter construct was made by producing a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to base pairs −87 to +22 of the porcine IκB-α gene (37de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) with HindIII andXho restriction sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. This was cloned into pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The IκB mutant construct which contains a deletion of the base pairs encoding the first 36 amino acids (38Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Dean Ballard. The NF-κB oligonucleotides representing the NF-κB DNA binding sequence 5′ GGG GAC TTT CCC for EMSA were produced on an oligonucleotide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and annealed. The EGR and OCT double-stranded oligonucleotides and the NF-κB mutant double-stranded oligonucleotide in which the G (underlined above) was replaced by C were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Primary cultures of astrocytes were obtained from the forebrains of postnatal day 3–4 rats as described (23Sporns O. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry of the cells demonstrated that greater than 98% of the cells were positive for the glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein and less than 2% were reactive with markers for oligodendrocytes, microglia, and fibroblasts. Neurons were obtained from the cerebella of postnatal days 3–4 rats as described (39Schousboe A. Meier E. Drejer J. Hertz L. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). The neurons were plated on laminin-coated substrates in 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM overnight and then the media was replaced with Neurobasal media (Life Technologies, Inc.) and B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nuclear extracts were prepared from astrocytes and neurons as described (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as described (41Holst B.D. Goomer R.S. Wood I.C. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22245-22252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary astrocytes were electroporated after 7–10 days in vitro as described previously (22Crossin K.L. Tai M.-H. Krushel L.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2687-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Neurons were electroporated immediately after isolation from neonatal animals. Each suspension of cells was electroporated with 5 μg of a luciferase reporter construct, 5 μg of CMV-β-gal, and in some experiments, 5 μg of IκB-mut or 5 μg of pcDNA3. The cells were plated in 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM, and after overnight incubation the medium was changed to DMEM (astrocytes) or to Neurobasal/B27 (neurons). After 2 days for the astrocytes and 8 h for the neurons, N-CAM, IL-1β, TNF-α, or LPS were added. After 16–20 h the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as previous described (22Crossin K.L. Tai M.-H. Krushel L.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2687-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates in 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM overnight. The media were changed to serum-free media for 48 h, after which additions of reagents to the cells was done. Four h later, [3H]thymidine was added (10 μCi/ml) for an additional 16 h. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured as described previously (23Sporns O. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Differential display analysis was carried out using total RNA from untreated or Ig III-treated astrocytes and cerebellar neurons isolated as described previously (22Crossin K.L. Tai M.-H. Krushel L.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2687-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR reaction conditions were previously described (42Pompeiano M. Cirelli C. Tononi G. Lydic R. Molecular Regulation of Arousal States. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998: 157-165Google Scholar) using H-T11G as the anchored 3′ primer and AP5 as the 5′ arbitrary primer (43Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell P. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR products were resolved on a 6% acrylamide/urea gel using the Genomyx sequencer that has been optimized for differential display. Dried gels were exposed overnight to x-ray film, and bands of interest were cut from the gel, reamplified by PCR using the same primers used for the differential display, and sequenced using Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To investigate the effects of N-CAM on NF-κB/DNA binding, astrocytes derived from neonatal rat forebrains were cultured for 6 h in the presence of one of three different N-CAM reagents: N-CAM (5 ng/ml) purified from early postnatal rat brain, the recombinant third Ig domain (Ig III) of N-CAM (10 μg/ml), or a polyclonal antibody against N-CAM (500 μg/ml). Nuclear extracts were obtained from these cells after treatment and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus NF-κB-binding site. Two DNA-protein binding complexes were observed in extracts from astrocytes treated with each of the three N-CAM reagents (Fig.1 A). In contrast, extracts from untreated astrocytes showed little or no DNA binding. In all cases, the binding was prevented in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe (Fig. 1 A, right) but not by an oligonucleotide containing a mutation in the NF-κB DNA-binding site (Fig. 2). Recombinant proteins corresponding either to the two fibronectin repeats in N-CAM or to fibronectin repeats 8–10 of the fibronectin protein itself (which contains the RGD cell binding tripeptide) did not affect the formation of NF-κB DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that N-CAM binding to the astrocyte cell surface increased the formation of NF-κB-DNA binding complexes.Figure 2NF-κB/DNA binding peaks within 6 h of Ig III treatment in both astrocytes and neurons. Nuclear extracts obtained from astrocytes (A) and cerebellar granule neurons (B) treated with Ig III (10 μg/ml) (+) for 1–24 h were compared with extracts from untreated control cultures (−) incubated for the same times. Inclusion of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide, but not of an oligonucleotide in which the consensus DNA-binding site was mutated, abolished DNA protein binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The levels of other transcription factor-DNA complexes were not altered in the presence of N-CAM. EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from untreated astrocytes or astrocytes treated with Ig III or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and labeled oligonucleotide probes corresponding to consensus DNA elements recognized by either the octamer (OCT) or early growth response (EGR) transcription factor families. The OCT sequence is a binding site for the POU homeodomain octamer family (reviewed in Ref. 44Scholer H.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and the EGR sequence is a binding site for members of the EGR gene family, which are immediate early response genes (reviewed in Ref. 45Beckmann A.M. Wilce P.A. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 477-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The high level of protein complexes with the OCT oligonucleotide probe observed in the untreated astrocyte extracts did not change upon addition of Ig III or bFGF (Fig.1 C). In contrast the DNA-protein complex formed with the EGR consensus sequence was only marginally detectable in the untreated and Ig III-treated cells but increased dramatically in the bFGF-treated extracts (Fig. 1 D). The combined results demonstrate that the increase in NF-κB-DNA complexes by N-CAM is due to the binding of the N-CAM Ig domains and not the FN repeats and that N-CAM binding activates NF-κB but not all transcription factors. To determine the levels of NF-κB/DNA binding over time, nuclear extracts were obtained from astrocytes or early postnatal cerebellar granule neurons that had been treated with Ig III for 1–24 h. Increased NF-κB/DNA binding in astrocytes was observed as early as 1 h after addition of Ig III (Fig. 2 A). The levels of NF-κB-DNA complexes were maximal around 6 h and remained at high levels for 24 h. Three separate NF-κB complexes were observed. At the later time points, it was difficult to differentiate between the two fastest migrating bands, but it appeared that the fastest migrating band was absent after 16 h of N-CAM treatment. In cerebellar granule neurons (Fig. 2 B), addition of Ig III also increased NF-κB/DNA binding. Higher basal levels of NF-κB/DNA binding were observed in untreated neurons as compared with astrocytes. Nevertheless, addition of N-CAM produced an increase in NF-κB binding 1 h after treatment, and this binding was maximal after 3 h. As in astrocytes, three different NF-κB binding complexes were observed in neurons, and the levels of the fastest migrating complex decreased after 16 h. Therefore, in both astrocytes and neurons, the addition of N-CAM increased the binding activity of NF-κB in a time-dependent manner. The NF-κB complex in mammals is comprised of homodimers and heterodimers from a group of five different proteins (28Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the NF-κB proteins were used to supershift components of the complex in astrocytes and neurons that were treated with Ig III for 6 h (Fig.3, A and B). An antibody to p50 shifted almost all of the NF-κB binding complexes in both astrocytes and neurons. In astrocytes, the p65 antibody supershifted the slower migrating complex but only slightly diminished the intensity of the fastest moving complex. In neurons, the p65 antibody supershifted all three NF-κB complexes. Antibodies directed to the remaining NF-κB proteins did not supershift any of the NF-κB binding complexes. Similar supershift results were observed after treatment of astrocytes and neurons with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the NF-κB-DNA complexes in both astrocytes and neurons are comprised primarily of p50 and p65 proteins. To examine whether the increased levels of nuclear NF-κB binding activity led to concomitant increases in transcription, two different NF-κB reporter constructs were used. A luciferase reporter construct containing two tandem consensus NF-κB DNA-binding sites upstream of a minimal Fos promoter (36Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar) (NF-κB-luc) was transfected into astrocytes. Addition of Ig III or agents known to stimulate NF-κB activity, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and LPS, all produced significant increases in luciferase activity from the NF-κB reporter construct (Fig. 4 A). Addition of either bFGF or a recombinant protein encoding the two fibronectin type three repeats of N-CAM did not activate NF-κB (data not shown). The activation of NF-κB is dependent on the dissociation of the NF-κB proteins from the inhibitory IκB proteins in the cytoplasm (reviewed in Ref. 28Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation of two amino-terminal sites in IκB-α, the IκB-α protein dissociates from the complex and is then degraded (28Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). However, a form of IκB-α with the amino terminus deleted does not dissociate and therefore prevents NF-κB nuclear translocation (38Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection of NF-κB-luc and an IκB-α construct having the amino-terminal 36 amino acids deleted (IκB-mut) (38Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prevented the response to Ig III and to the other reagents in astrocytes (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the basal level of activity was also substantially decreased. In cerebellar neurons, addition of N-CAM, LPS, IL-1β, or TNF-α stimulated luciferase expression from the NF-κB-luc construct (Fig.4 B). The basal level of NF-κB-driven luciferase activity was higher in neurons as compared with astrocytes, and both the basal level as well as the further induction of luciferase activity were abolished when the IκB-mut was co-transfected with NF-κB-luc. These results together suggest that N-CAM binding stimulates NF-κB-dependent transcription in both astrocytes and neurons. One of the genes transcribed in response to NF-κB activation is IκB-α. A luciferase construct (IκB-α-luc) containing a portion of a native gene that contains an NF-κB-binding site, the porcine IκB-α promoter (−87/+22) (37de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), was transfected into both astrocytes (Fig. 5 A) and neurons (Fig. 5 B). Addition of N-CAM as well as LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α increased luciferase activity from this construct, and the increase was abolished when IκB-mut was co-transfected. These results suggest that N-CAM binding can induce transcription of genes containing NF-κB sites in their promoters. The activation of the IκB-α reporter construct suggested that IκB-α gene transcription may be up-regulated after the addition of N-CAM. To examine differential gene expression following N-CAM treatment, primary cultures of astrocytes and cerebellar granule neurons were treated with Ig III for 6 h or remained untreated. The RNA was obtained from these cells and subjected to differential display analysis. The level of numerous mRNAs showed changes in their expression levels after treatment with Ig III (data not shown). Two bands that were expressed at a higher level in both N-CAM-treated astrocytes and neurons (Fig.6, arrows) were sequenced and shown to encode IκB-α. This result is consistent with the observed ability of N-CAM binding to activate the IκB-α promoter/reporter construct and further demonstrated that the transcription of the endogenous IκB-α gene was up-regulated in response to N-CAM binding. In non-neural cells, increased IκB-α transcription occurs following the degradation of IκB proteins (28Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 29Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Western blot of extracts obtained from astrocytes or neurons treated with Ig III for 1–24 h was performed to determine the expression levels of IκB-α protein (Fig. 7, arrows). A transient decrease in the level of IκB-α protein was seen in astrocytes at 1 h following addition of Ig III and between 3 and 6 h in neurons (see Fig. 2). The blots were also incubated with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 7 A, arrowhead) or neuron-specific enolase (Fig. 7 B, arrowhead) to demonstrate equivalent protein loading for each condition.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that survives in all nucleated cells by creating a unique membrane bounded compartment called the parasitophorous vacuole (reviewed in Ref. 1Silverman J.A. Joiner K.A. Kaufman S.H.E. Host Response to Intracellular Pathogens. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 313-338Google Scholar). Like all Apicomplexan parasites, T. gondii contains three morphologically distinct secretory organelles: rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules (DG).1 The protein content of these organelles, the temporal regulation of their secretion, and the eventual localization within the infected cell of proteins secreted from the organelles are all different. T. gondii, therefore, represents an interesting model for analysis of the differential control of secretion from morphologically distinct secretory compartments. DG in T. gondii contain a homogeneous dense core and are similar in morphology to dense matrix granules in exocrine and neuroendocrine cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 293-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DG exocytosis involves a putative fusion event with either the parasite plasma membrane or the inner membrane complex (a patchwork of closely opposed flattened vesicles located beneath the plasma membrane). In contrast to micronemes and rhoptries, which discharge their contents only at the time of cell invasion (3Carruthers V.B. Sibley D.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 114-123Google Scholar, 4Perkins M. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 28-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Sam-Yellowe T.Y. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 308-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the kinetics of DG exocytosis are less well defined. The tacit assumption (based largely on their morphology) has been that DG release is also a regulated process. We and others have described a burst of DG exocytosis shortly after invasion (3Carruthers V.B. Sibley D.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 114-123Google Scholar, 6Dubremetz J.F. Achbarou A. Bermudes D. Joiner K.A. Parasitol. Res. 1993; 79: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but exocytosis of DG proteins also continues during the prolonged intracellular residence of the parasite (6Dubremetz J.F. Achbarou A. Bermudes D. Joiner K.A. Parasitol. Res. 1993; 79: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Sadak A. Fortier B. Leriche J.A. Camus D.

Parasitol. 1991; 45: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Spontaneous release of DG proteins from extracellular parasites is also observed (9Sibley L.D. Niesman I.R. Asai T. Takeuchi T. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and this release may be augmented by the addition of heat-inactivated serum (10Darcy F. Deslee D. Santoro F. Charif H. Auriault C. Decoster A. Duquesne V. Capron A. Parasite Immunol. 1988; 10: 553-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the limited information available, DG exocytosis exhibits characteristics of both a regulated and a constitutive process. Several common themes operate for dense matrix granule secretion in most higher eukaryotic cells. A rise in intracellular calcium generally triggers the final fusion event with the plasma membrane (11Holz R.W. Senyshyn J. Bittner M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 635: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). An ATP-dependent priming step precedes the calcium-dependent event (12Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). To date, however, the identification of these molecules in pathogenic protozoa has been largely limited to monomeric GTPases of the Rab family. Functional analyses of their participation in granule exocytosis has not been reported. Experiments in the nonpathogenic ciliate, Paramecium (28Fraga D. Hiurichsen R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 147: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Peterson J.B. J. Protozool. 1991; 38: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), have identified Rab proteins on secretory vesicles and a SNARE-like molecule that complements a secretion mutant (30Skouri F. Cohen J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We recently reported that foreign soluble reporter proteins (Escherichia coli β-lactamase (BLA) and alkaline phosphatase) stably expressed in T. gondii are routed quantitatively to DG (31Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that DG are a constitutive rather then regulated secretory organelle. Our observation raised several key questions. Is DG release constitutive or regulated? If DG release is regulated, what are the triggers for release? What is the protein machinery controlling DG docking and fusion? Is the protein secretory machinery conserved between T. gondii and higher eukaryotes? We have addressed these questions by following the release of both an endogenous DG marker (GRA3) and the secreted recombinant reporter protein BLA in intact and streptolysin O-permeabilized extracellular parasites. Our results demonstrate that DG markers are released constitutively in a calcium-independent fashion, via the participation of the NSF/SNAP/SNARE/Rab machinery. While calcium-independent constitutive release of soluble proteins from a dense matrix granule is unusual, the protein machinery mediating release in T. gondii is broadly conserved with that in higher eukaryotic cells. The following buffers were used. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) was supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4.

AISS+ buffer consisted of AISS supplemented with 1× minimum essential medium essential and nonessential amino acids, 1× minimum essential medium vitamins, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Both buffers contained leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, chymostatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at final concentrations of 5 μm, 1 μm, 5 μm, 100 μg/ml, and 1 mm, respectively. PBS/Tween 20/BSA contained 0.15m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.25% BSA, pH 7.2. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Paranitrophenyl phosphate was used as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase, and nitrocefin was used for β-lactamase (Becton Dickinson Co., Cockeysville, MD). Streptolysin O was obtained from Murex Diagnostic Ltd. (Dartford, United Kingdom). Recombinant bovine Rab-GDI (stock of 2 mg/ml in HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS (Pierce), and 50% glycerol (v/v)) (32Ayad N. Hull M. Mellman I.

A monoclonal antibody to GRA3 (T62H11), rabbit polyclonal anti-GRA3 antiserum, an anti-ROP2,3,4 monoclonal (T34A7), and rabbit anti-ROP2,3 antiserum described previously (33Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Puijalon O.M. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 947-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from J. F. Dubremetz (Villeneuve d'Ascq, France). Rabbit polyclonal anti β-lactamase antiserum was obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). The RH strain of T. gondii and a stable transgenic clone of the RH strain, expressing the soluble foreign secretion reporter BLA were described earlier (31Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A stable transgenic clone of the RH strain expressing a cytosolic form of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (34Striepen B. He C.Y. Martajt M. Soldati D. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 328-338Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was used to assess cytosol leakage from the parasites permeabilized with SLO. A clone of the RH strain stably expressing the cytosolic marker E. coli β-galactosidase (35Seeber F. Boothroyd J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was obtained from J. Boothroyd (Stanford, CA). Parasites were maintained in monolayers of either Vero or HFF cells. Extracellular parasites were harvested, washed, and counted as described previously (9Sibley L.D. Niesman I.R. Asai T. Takeuchi T. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In some experiments, extracellular parasites were incubated in calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (dissociation buffer) on ice for 30 min to remove network material adhered to parasites (36Sibley L.D. Krahenbuhl J.L. Adams G.M.W. Weidner E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After this incubation, parasites were washed twice with ice-cold AISS buffer and resuspended in the same buffer for secretion assays. In several experiments, HBSS buffer was used in place of AISS. Secretion by extracellular parasites was determined by incubating 0.4–1 × 108 parasites/ml (total of 3 ml) in various buffers at 37 °C. Glucose was essential for maximum secretion (secretion was reduced by 50% less in buffer without glucose; data not shown). All assays were performed in prechilled Eppendorf tubes previously coated with BSA (1 mg/ml) to prevent parasites adhesion. Before transferring parasite suspensions from ice to 37 °C for the secretion assay, 500 μl of parasite suspension was removed and processed as the time 0 reading. The rest of the parasite suspension was incubated at 37 °C in a water bath. After 15, 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation, 500 μl of the parasite suspension was removed and centrifuged at 760 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet intact parasites. The pellet was set aside, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. GRA3 in both the 7000 × g supernatant and the pellet were determined by antigen capture sandwich ELISA (see below) and by immunoblot, as described previously (37Ossorio P.N. Dubremetz J.F. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15350-15357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BLA activity was measured as described below. An ELISA was developed to measure GRA3 and ROP2,3 released from extracellular parasites in secretion assays. Plates (Linbro/Titertek) were coated with 50 μl of monoclonal anti-GRA3 (T62H11) diluted 1:1000 in 0.05 m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed four times with PBS/Tween 20/BSA. In initial experiments, whole parasite lysates were tested to validate the assay. A dose-response relationship was observed between the lysate from the increasing number of parasites and OD for GRA3 (data not shown). To measure GRA3 released by intact parasites, supernatant derived from 108 parasites/ml was diluted 1:5 with PBS/Tween 20/BSA, and 100 μl (2 × 106 parasite equivalents) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The plates were washed six times, and 100 μl of rabbit anti-GRA3 or a control antiserum (1:2000) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were washed, incubated for an additional 2 h with 100 μl of rabbit anti-goat IgG (Fc)-alkaline phosphatase (Promega) (1:4000 in PBS/Tween 20/BSA), washed again, and developed with 200 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate for 45 min followed by the addition of 50 μl of 3 m NaOH. Plates were read at 550 nm in a Titertek Multiskan ELISA reader, and OD values for each sample were calculated by subtracting the average of triplicate wells with rabbit anti-GRA3 from the average of triplicate wells that received normal rabbit serum. Rhoptry protein secretion was determined by coating plates with a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-ROP2,3,4 monoclonal antibody T34A7. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ROP2,3 (1:2000) was used as the detection antibody. Assay conditions were as for GRA3. Total GRA3 and ROP2,3 in the parasite pellet were determined by lysing parasites (108/ml) in a French press cell at 10,000 p.s.i. The parasite lysate was centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 10 min. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the 12,500 × gsupernatant were prepared in PBS/Tween 20/BSA, and cellular GRA3 and ROP2,3 were quantitated as above. Standard curves for GRA3 and ROP2,3 were generated by plotting net ODversus parasite number. The percentage release of GRA3 and ROP2,3 in the supernatant during secretion were calculated from the standard curve. BLA in the parasite supernatant as well as in the pellet was determined by the method described earlier (38O'Callaghan C.H. Morris A. Kirby S.M. Shingler A.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Parasite supernatant (4 × 107parasites/ml) diluted 2-fold with AISS buffer and 20 μl was added to each well of a 96-well plate. The reaction was developed by adding 180 μl of nitrocefin mix (0.2 mm nitrocefin, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5% Me2SO, pH 7.0) for 30 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of 50 μl of 3m NaOH. Plates were read at 492 nm in an ELISA reader, and the OD values for each sample were calculated by subtracting the average of duplicate wells with supernatant derived from RH parasites and wells with substrate only. In preliminary experiments, a linear relationship was observed between BLA release and parasite number (data not shown). The enzymatic activity of released BLA was not affected by treatment with dithiothreitol, indicating that the oxidation-reduction state of the enzyme did not influence BLA activity (39Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. Methods. 1998; 13: 103-111Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). BLA activity in the pellet was substantially lower than in the supernatant, regardless of whether parasites were lysed in TX-100 or in the French press cell. Mixing experiments of pellet and supernatant indicated that there was an inhibitor of BLA activity in the parasite pellet (data not shown). Therefore, total released BLA was determined by immunoblot. β-Galactosidase activity in the supernatant as well as in the parasite pellet from β-galactosidase-expressing parasites was determined as described previously (35Seeber F. Boothroyd J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Secretion was measured during incubation of extracellular parasites at 4 and 15 °C, or with 10 mmsodium azide (NaN3) at 15 °C for 15 min, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The effect of serum on DG secretion by extracellular parasites was determined by adding 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum to AISS buffer.

The influence of extracellular calcium on DG secretion was further tested by either adding exogenous Ca2+(2 mm) to AISS buffer or by chelating Ca2+ with either 5 mm EGTA or 500 μm MAPTA-AM in AISS buffer. The influence of the oxidation/reduction state was tested by adding 10 mm glutathione at reduced to oxidized ratios of 60:1, 30:1, and 1:1 to AISS buffer. The released DG proteins were measured at 0 and 60 min postincubation by ELISA for GRA3 and by enzyme assay for BLA. The results are expressed as percentage of release and calculated with 100% being the amount of DG proteins released in AISS buffer. In most cases, there was no significant alteration in release of either GRA3 or BLA in comparison with AISS buffer. MAPTA-AM inhibited secretion of both BLA and GRA3 by 35 ± 5% and 34 ± 3%, respectively (*, p ≤ 0.05). DG secretion was also significantly lower (**, p < 0.01) in the presence of vitamins and amino acids. The results of GRA3 release in HBSS are shown in Fig. 1 and therefore not included here. Unlike DG secretion, release of the rhoptry protein ROP2 from nonpermeabilized parasites was negligible (<1%) in any of the buffer conditions tested (not shown).a The data represent the mean ± S.D. of four experiments done in triplicate except in a few cases where only a single experiment was performed.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Following liberation from host cells, nonpermeabilized parasites were incubated under conditions reflecting an extracellular environment (high Na+, low K+, high Ca2+, oxidizing, low ATP; HBSS) and conditions reflecting an intracellular environment (low Na+, high K+, low Ca2+, reducing, high ATP; AISS) or with other conditions, including added ARS, ATPγS, GTPγSADP, AMP, cAMP, cGMP, and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).

Unlike DG secretion, release of the rhoptry protein ROP2 from nonpermeabilized parasites was negligible (<1%) in any of the buffer conditions tested (not shown). Permeabilization of extracellular parasites with SLO was done using modifications of a described protocol (40Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Extracellular parasites were washed two times with ice cold potassium acetate buffer containing glucose (115 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmglucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH) and then incubated with 100 μl of 1 unit/ml of SLO for 10 min at 4 °C. The suspension was transferred to 37 °C and incubated for 2 min, and then parasites were pelleted at 760 × g for 5 min. Supernatant was removed and saved to measure released BLA during the permeabilization step. The parasite pellet was gently suspended in ice cold potassium acetate buffer, washed two times, and resuspended to 4 × 107 parasites/ml. Permeabilized parasites were immediately used for secretion assays at 37 °C. BLA secretion was also monitored from control parasites, which were treated similarly at every step without the presence of SLO. Parasite permeabilization was assessed by incubating organisms with 4 μg/ml propidium iodide for 5 min at room temperature, and the percentage of parasites positive for nuclear staining was quantitated by fluorescence microscopy. Release of lactate dehydrogenase as a cytosolic marker from parasites could not be quantitated with accuracy, due to contamination with host cell lactate dehydrogenase. Therefore, a stable transgenic clone of parasites expressing a cytosolic GFP marker (34Striepen B. He C.Y. Martajt M. Soldati D. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 328-338Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was treated with SLO. The percentage loss of GFP fluorescence, immediately after permeabilization and following continued incubation at 15 °C for 1 h, was determined by measuring the fluorescence of parasites at 490 nm and emission of 510 nm in a fluorimeter and compared with total GFP in nonpermeabilized parasites treated in a similar fashion in the absence of SLO. The GFP release from SLO-permeabilized parasites was also assessed by phase and by fluorescence microscopy. Extracellular parasites were washed two times with cold potassium acetate-EGTA (5 mm) buffer and permeabilized with SLO in the same buffer, and then various concentrations of free calcium (0–100 μm final concentration) were added in the presence or absence of an ATP-regenerating system (ARS; 2 mm NaATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 40 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The concentrations of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the buffer were calculated using the software program of Foehr and Warchol (Ulm, Germany). Alternatively, parasites were permeabilized with SLO in potassium acetate buffer containing no EGTA and then preincubated with or without MAPTA-AM (50 μm final concentration) in the presence or the absence of ARS at 0 °C for 15 min followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min for secretion to occur. The influence of N-ethylmaleimide on DG secretion was carried out by preincubating both SLO-permeabilized as well as nonpermeabilized parasites with or without 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 15 min at 0 °C. Excess NEM was removed by washing parasites two times with ice-cold potassium acetate buffer. Following NEM treatment, both nonpermeabilized and permeabilized parasites (treated with or without NEM) were suspended in potassium acetate buffer with or without ARS (2 mm MgATP was used in place of Na+ATP in the ARS mixture) and incubated at 37 °C for secretion to occur. The effect of NSF on DG secretion was determined by incubating SLO-permeabilized parasites with 10 μg/ml recombinant hamster NSF, or with the catalytically inactive N domain of NSF (10 μg/ml) at 0 °C for 1 h before switching to 37 °C for secretion to occur. Prolonged incubation of parasites at 0 °C was used due to the large size of full-length NSF (76"

However, the mechanisms responsible for this association between PLD activity and the actin cytoskeleton are unknown. We utilized a cell-free system from U937 promonocytes to test the hypothesis that stimulation of PLD results in stable association of the activated lipase with the detergent-insoluble membrane skeleton. Plasma membrane and cytosol were incubated ± guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), followed by re-isolation and extraction of the washed membranes with octyl glucoside. The detergent-insoluble fraction derived from membranes incubated with GTPγS (DIFGTPγS) exhibited 22-fold greater PLD activity than that derived from control membranes (DIF0), when both were assayed in the presence of GTPγS. The DIF contained PLD1, RhoA, and ARF, and the level of each was increased by GTPγS in a dose-dependent manner. The DIF also contained F-actin, vinculin, talin, paxillin, and α-actinin, consistent with its identification as the membrane skeleton. The physiologic relevance of these findings was demonstrated by a similar increase in DIF-associated PLD activity after stimulation of intact U937 cells with opsonized zymosan.

Activation of phospholipase D (PLD)1 results in the generation of the lipid second messengers, phosphatidic acid (PA) and diglycerides, and has been linked to multiple physiologic processes, including secretion, vesicle trafficking, mitosis, and meiosis (1Exton J.H.

In phagocytic leukocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils), activation of PLD is coupled to the major antimicrobial responses of phagocytosis, generation of reactive oxidants, and granule secretion (1Exton J.H.

The mechanisms that regulate PLD and the means by which its lipid products function in such diverse physiologic processes are beginning to be elucidated. Two mammalian PLD genes designated PLD1 and PLD2 have recently been cloned (5Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

PLD1 is regulated by low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) of the ARF and Rho families and by protein kinase C (1Exton J.H. Physiol.

The mechanisms that regulate PLD2 are undefined, but this isoform is unaffected by the activators of PLD1. The relations between these PLD isoforms and the various PLD activities demonstrated in diverse cells and tissues requires further study. Several lines of evidence suggest that PLD may be functionally associated with the actin-based microfilament cytoskeleton. First, many of the physiologic processes in which activation of PLD is believed to play an important role also require rearrangements of the cytoskeleton, including motility, secretion, and cell division (1Exton J.H.

Fifth, the downstream effectors of PLD modulate actin microfilament dynamics. PA stimulates the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate via activation of phosphoinositide 4- and 5-kinases (20Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

These observations suggest a functional association between PLD and the actin cytoskeleton. The objective of this study was to determine whether stimulation of GTP-binding proteins results in stable association of PLD activity with the F-actin-containing membrane skeleton of U937 promonocytes. Unless otherwise stated, materials were from previously published sources (26Dubyak G.R. Schomisch S.J. Kusner D.J. Mingsheng X. Biochem.

U937 promonocytic leukocytes maintained at 37 °C, 7.5% CO2 in Iscoves medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, were washed in H/S buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (27Kusner D.J.

After removal of undisrupted cells and nuclei by centrifugation at 900 × g, the cavitate was layered over 50% sucrose and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (cytosol) was re-centrifuged at 225,000 ×g and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. The membrane fraction at the sucrose interface was pelleted at 225,000 ×g for 60 min, resuspended in H/K buffer, and homogenized with a Tenbroeck tissue grinder. This membrane fraction was enriched in plasma membrane (defined by the presence of virtually all of the human major histocompatibility class I antigens in a total lysate, data not shown) and was utilized for all subsequent studies. Because this fraction also contained the Golgi marker β-COP, it will be referred to as the “plasma membrane-enriched” or “membrane” fraction, for simplicity. The more dense fraction, which sedimented through the 50% sucrose, was enriched in the primary granule marker CD63 and was not utilized in this study. Protein concentrations in membrane and cytosolic fractions were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). 75 μg of the membrane fraction was incubated with 100 μg of cytosol ±GTPγS (1–100 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in H/K buffer in a volume of 100 μl. Membranes were re-isolated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min, washed twice with H/K, and resuspended in same (29Kusner D.J. Dubyak G.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Washed membranes prepared from incubation with cytosol in the absence of GTPγS are designated Mo, whereas those prepared in the presence of GTPγS are referred to as MGTPγS. Substrate vesicles containing phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate:phosphatidylcholine (molar ratio of 16:1.4:1) with 10 μCi/sample [3H]DPPC were prepared by sonication for 10 min at 25 °C (31Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). 100 μm GTPγS was included in each sample, and 1.5% ethanol was added to permit detection of the PLD-specific transphosphatidylation product, phosphatidylethanol (PEt). Reactions were terminated at 60 min by the addition of 500 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Lipids were extracted, dried under N2, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an ethyl acetate:isooctane:acetic acid (9:5:2, v/v) solvent system (26Dubyak G.R. Schomisch S.J. Kusner D.J.

PEt and PA were identified by comigration with purified standards, [3H]PEt and [3H]PA cpm were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry, and counts were normalized for the total amount of 3H-labeled phospholipid in each experiment. 3H cpm co-migrating with PEt were determined for each set of samples in the absence of ethanol, and these background counts were subtracted from each data point. Moand MGTPγS, prepared as noted above, were incubated with 0.5% octyl glucoside in H/K for 30 min on ice. The detergent-insoluble pellets were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed twice in H/K with 0.5% octyl glucoside, and resuspended in H/K buffer without detergent. The detergent-insoluble fraction prepared from Mo is designated DIF0, whereas that derived from MGTPγS is referred to as DIFGTPγS. The PLD activities of DIFGTPγSand DIF0 were assayed with [3H]DPPC vesicles, as noted above, followed by quantitation of [3H]PEt and [3H]PA. DIFs were also prepared from MGTPγSand Mo by extraction with 1% sodium cholate or 1% Triton X-100, and the PLD activities associated with these detergent-insoluble preparations were determined in an identical manner. In separate experiments, the direct effects of each detergent on membrane-associated PLD activity were assessed by incubation of 100 μg of MGTPγS with varying detergent concentrations (0.02–2.0%) in H/K buffer at 37 °C for 60 min, followed by quantitation of [3H]PEt. In experiments utilizing C3 exotoxin from Clostridium botulinum, freshly prepared membrane and cytosol were incubated in H/K buffer with 1 μg/ml C3 exotoxin, 20 μm nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), 5 mm thymidine for 30 min at 30 °C, as described (32Kuribara H.

After the 30-min incubation, 100 μm GTPγS or an equivalent volume of buffer was added, and the resultant membrane (Mo, MGTPγS, MGTPγS + C3) and detergent-insoluble fractions (DIF0, DIFGTPγS, DIFGTPγS + C3) were prepared and analyzed for PLD activity. Control incubations were conducted both in the absence of C3 exotoxin alone, as well as without C3, NAD, and thymidine, and both sets of controls showed very similar results. 108 U937 cells (107/ml) in H/K buffer were incubated with 75 μg/ml β-escin in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTPγS for 15 min at 37 °C (29Kusner D.J. Dubyak G.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cell preparations were pelleted at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed in H/K buffer, and subjected to N2 cavitation under the conditions noted above. Plasma membrane-enriched fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation of the cavitate over 50% sucrose. After washing in H/K buffer, membranes were incubated with 0.5% octyl glucoside for 30 min at 4 °C. The detergent-insoluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation, washed, and assayed for PLD activity with [3H]DPPC vesicles. 108 U937 cells (107/ml) in Iscoves medium, 10% fetal bovine serum were washed and resuspended in H/S buffer. Zymosan was opsonized in 25% serum, as described previously (12Kusner D.J. Hall C.F. Schlesinger L.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and incubated with U937 cells for 15 min at 37 °C at a particle/cell ratio of 10:1. Incubations were terminated by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in H/K buffer then disrupted by N2 cavitation, and membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described above. The PLD activity of membrane and octyl glucoside-insoluble fractions from cells incubated with complement-opsonized zymosan (COZ), designated MCOZ and DIFCOZ, respectively, were compared with those derived from cells treated with buffer alone (M0, DIF0) by determination of [3H]PEt production from [3H]DPPC vesicles. Lipid phosphorus content of membrane and detergent-insoluble fractions were determined by the ashing procedure of Ames (34Ames B.N. Neufeld E. Ginsburg Methods in Enzymology. 8. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1966: 115-118Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were ashed in Mg(NO3)2 in ethanol, solubilized in 0.5m HCl, and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 25 °C, Ames colorimetric reagent (34Ames B.N. Neufeld E. Ginsburg Methods in Enzymology. 8. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1966: 115-118Google Scholar) was added, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h then cooled to 25 °C, andA 820 nm was determined. Quantitation was performed by reference to a standard curve derived from KH2PO4 solutions of known concentration. Membrane, cytosolic, and detergent-insoluble fractions from U937 cells were prepared as above. 5 × 106 cell equivalents of the membrane or DIF or 100 μg of cytosol were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (27Kusner D.J. Schomisch S.J. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19973-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 12.5% gels were utilized for analysis of RhoA and ARF, whereas 9% gels were used for detection of PLD, vinculin, talin, α-actinin, paxillin, and actin. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Western blotting, with detection via horseradish peroxidase-coupled 2° Ab and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was performed as described (27Kusner D.J. Schomisch S.J. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19973-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data from each experimental group were subjected to an analysis of normality and variance. Differences between experimental groups composed of normally distributed data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test. Nonparametric evaluation of other data sets was performed with the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test (12Kusner D.J. Hall C.F. Schlesinger L.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We utilized a cell-free system from U937 promonocytic leukocytes to study GTP-binding protein-dependent stimulation of PLD activity. Undifferentiated U937 cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and subjected to sucrose density centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plasma membrane-enriched and cytosolic fractions were incubated in the presence or absence of GTPγS, followed by re-isolation and washing of the membrane fraction. The PLD activity of these membranes was then determined in the presence of GTPγS by quantitation of [3H]PEt formation from DPPC-labeled mixed lipid vesicles in the presence of 1.5% ethanol (31Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Membranes that had been incubated with cytosol in the absence of GTPγS (Mo) exhibited little basal or GTPγS-dependent PLD activity upon subsequent isolation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, incubation of membrane and cytosolic fractions in the presence of GTPγS resulted in stable association of PLD activity with the re-isolated, washed membrane fraction (MGTPγS), which was 21-fold greater than that of Mo. We have previously reported a similar GTPγS-dependent membrane PLD activity utilizing U937 cells labeled in endogenous lipids with [3H]oleic acid (29Kusner D.J. Dubyak G.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The PLD activity of MGTPγS closely approximated the maximal GTPγS-dependent PLD activity in permeabilized U937 cells or in the complete cell-free system of membranes + cytosol (29Kusner D.J. Dubyak G.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this GTPγS-dependent association of PLD activity with the membrane fraction involves an interaction with the actin-based membrane skeleton. Mo and MGTPγS were subjected to extraction with 0.5% octyl glucoside, and the detergent-insoluble fractions were washed twice in octyl glucoside-containing buffer, resuspended in detergent-free buffer, and then assayed for PLD activity in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS. The detergent-insoluble fraction from Mo (DIF0) exhibited very little PLD activity in response to GTPγS (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the detergent-insoluble fraction from MGTPγS(DIFGTPγS) demonstrated significant PLD activity, which was 20-fold greater than that of control (DIF0). The PLD activity of DIFGTPγS accounted for approximately 60% of the total GTPγS-dependent PLD activity of the membrane fraction (MGTPγS). In contrast to DIFGTPγS, the octyl glucoside-soluble fraction from MGTPγSexhibited relatively little PLD activity when assayed versus[3H]DPPC-labeled vesicles, which accounted for only 17% of the total PLD activity of MGTPγS (range 15–19%,n = 3). Incubation of MGTPγS and DIFGTPγS with [3H]DPPC vesicles in the absence of ethanol resulted in significant production of [3H]PA compared with Mo and DIF0, respectively ([3H]PA cpm/1053H cpm in phospholipid: MGTPγS 5176 ± 548, Mo 265 ± 21,p < 0.001; DIFGTPγS 2478 ± 123, DIF0 58 ± 8 3H cpm, p < 0.001, n = 5 for each). To confirm that PA generation by MGTPγS and DIF GTPγS was because of PLD, membrane and octyl glucoside-insoluble fractions were incubated in various concentrations of ethanol, and PA and PEt levels were determined. Both MGTPγS and DIFGTPγSdemonstrated inverse production of PA and PEt, which was dependent on the concentration of ethanol (0 −1.5%, v/v), as predicted by the transphosphatidylation capacity of PLD (data not shown). Analysis of the kinetics of PLD activity of MGTPγS and DIFGTPγS demonstrated generation of PEt within 1 min of the addition of ethanol and linear production of PEt throughout the 60-min course of the assay (data not shown). To determine whether GTPγS induces the association of PLD with the DIF in a more complex experimental system, we utilized U937 cells permeabilized with β-escin (26Dubyak G.R. Schomisch S.J. Kusner D.J. Mingsheng X. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Kusner D.J. Dubyak G.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). U937 cells in H/K buffer were incubated with 75 μg/ml β-escin in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTPγS for 15 min at 37 °C. Permeabilized cell preparations were pelleted by centrifugation then washed in buffer followed by N2 cavitation and isolation of membranes. Preparation of the octyl glucoside-insoluble fractions was performed exactly as for the cell-free system, described above. The octyl glucoside-insoluble fraction from permeabilized cells treated with GTPγS (DIFPGTPγS) contained 2.2-fold greater PLD activity than the corresponding detergent-insoluble fraction from control cells incubated with β-escin alone (DIFP0) (range 2.0–2.3, p < 0.01, Fig.2 A). The PLD activity of DIFPGTPγS accounted for approximately 45% of the total PLD activity of the plasma membrane fraction from permeabilized cells, MPGTPγS. These results indicate that activation of GTP-binding proteins in permeabilized cells results in elevated PLD activity in the DIF, similar to that demonstrated in the cell-free system. The decreased PLD activity of DIFPGTPγS (632 ± 47 3H cpm) compared with the DIF derived from the cell-free system, DIFGTPγS (3263 ± 3293H cpm) may be because of several factors, including decreased activation of GTP-binding proteins, decreased access of PLD to the exogenous substrate vesicles, and/or inclusion of a second detergent (β-escin), which may directly decrease PLD activity. To further evaluate the potential physiologic relevance of DIF-associated PLD activity, we determined the effects of stimulation of intact U937 cells with a receptor-dependent agonist, COZ. U937 cells were incubated with COZ (at a particle/cell ratio of 10:1) or H/S buffer control for 15 min at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by sedimenting the cells at 3000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, followed by resuspension in H/K buffer and disruption by N2 cavitation. Membrane fractions from control (M0) or COZ-treated cells (MCOZ) were extracted with 0.5% octyl glucoside, and the detergent-insoluble fractions (DIF0 and DIFCOZ, respectively) were isolated, washed, and resuspended in H/K buffer. The PLD activity of DIFCOZ was 2.0-fold greater than the octyl glucoside-insoluble fraction from control cells, DIF0(range 1.9–2.2, p < 0.01, Fig. 2 B). Therefore, a physiologic stimulus, COZ, that binds to complement receptors on the plasma membrane resulted in stable association of PLD activity with the DIF, which was qualitatively similar to that produced by GTPγS in permeabilized cells or in the cell-free system. The level of PLD activity of DIFCOZ (437 ± 32 3H cpm) approximated that of DIFPGTPγS (derived from permeabilized cells, 632 ± 47 3H cpm). Because the cell-free assay provided the greatest level of DIF-associated PLD activity and was most accessible to experimental manipulations, further characterization of the association of PLD activity with the detergent-insoluble fraction was performed with this system. To serve as a basis for more detailed characterization of the GTPγS-dependent association of PLD activity with the membrane and detergent-insoluble fractions, we determined the chemical composition of these fractions. The protein contents of M, M0, and MGTPγSwere very similar (Table I). After extraction with 0.5% octyl glucoside, approximately 35–40% of the protein content of M0 and MGTPγS remained in the detergent-insoluble fractions, DIF0 and DIFGTPγS. In contrast to their similar protein levels, the membrane and octyl glucoside-insoluble fractions contained significantly different levels of phospholipid, measured as nmol of lipid phosphorus via the ashing procedure of Ames (34Ames B.N. Neufeld E. Ginsburg Methods in Enzymology. 8. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1966: 115-118Google Scholar). The inclusion of GTPγS in the initial incubation of membrane and cytosol resulted in an 18% increase in lipid phosphorus in MGTPγScompared with M0 (p < 0.01,n = 3) (Table I). We hypothesize that this GTPγS-dependent increase in membrane phospholipid content was because of stimulation of de novo synthesis, because the lipid phosphorus conten"

An upper stem of five perfectly paired bases is separated from a lower stem by a single cytosine on the 5′ side or by a cytosine preceded by two nucleotides with one unpaired nucleotide on the 3′ side.

However, none of these alternative IREs was detected in naturally occurring mRNAs to date.Here we devised a method to enrich IRE-containing mRNAs by using recombinant human IRP-1 as an affinity matrix (Fig. 1). We then constructed an enriched cDNA library from mouse liver mRNA and screened it for IREs by RNA-protein band shift assays. This revealed a clone with strong homology to plant glycolate oxidase (GOX, or short-chain α-hydroxy acid oxidase, EC 1.1.3.15). In plants, this enzyme participates in the glyoxylate cycle and catalyzes the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate. An IRE-like sequence was found in the 3′ UTR of the mouse mRNA and analyzed with respect to its possible involvement in iron-dependent, post-transcriptional regulation. RNA-binding proteins play a central role in RNA processing, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, localization, translation, or stability. This makes it desirable to identify all the targets of a given RNA-binding protein. Because many RNA recognition elements cannot be identified by hybridization or predicted with certainty by search programs, we developed an experimental approach based on the interaction between an RNA-binding protein and its target RNAs. As a model system we are investigating the iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP-1 and IRP-2),1 which become active in iron-deprived cells and bind with high affinity to structural RNA motifs, the iron-responsive elements (IREs) (1Leibold E.A.

In mammals, four subunits have been cloned, named α1, α2, β1, and β2. We have identified a novel soluble guanylyl cyclase isoform from the nervous system of the insectManduca sexta that we have named M. sextaguanylyl cyclase β3 (MsGC-β3). It is most closely related to the mammalian β subunits but has several features that distinguish it from previously identified soluble cyclases. Most importantly, MsGC-β3 does not need to form heterodimers to form an active enzyme because guanylyl cyclase activity can be measured when it is expressed alone in COS-7 cells. Moreover, this activity is only weakly enhanced in the presence of the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside. Several of the amino acids in rat β1 subunits, previously identified as being important in heme binding or necessary for nitric oxide activation, are substituted with nonsimilar amino acids in MsGC-β3. There are also an additional 315 amino acids C-terminal to the catalytic domain of MsGC-β3 that have no sequence similarity to any known protein.

The intracellular messenger cGMP mediates a wide variety of cellular and physiological processes. It functions as the primary messenger in visual transduction (1Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 2Fain G.L. Mathews H.R. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 378-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is an important regulator in vascular smooth muscle and kidney function (3Lincoln T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 479-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and has been implicated in a number of forms of neuronal plasticity (5Arancio A. Kandel E.R. Hawkins R.D. Nature. 1995; 376: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Linden D.J. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5098-5105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hartell N.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes that regulate the synthesis of cGMP fall into two major classes: the cytoplasmically localized, soluble guanylyl cyclases and the membrane associated, receptor guanylyl cyclases (4Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Soluble guanylyl cyclases are obligate heterodimers composed of an α and a β subunit. Two α (α1 and α2) and two β (β1 and β2) subunits have been cloned from mammalian tissues (8Koesling D. Herz J. Gausepohl H. Niroomand F. Hinsch K.D. Mulsch A. Böhme E. Schultz G. Frank R.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The active heterodimer requires and binds heme as a prosthetic group and can be potently activated by the gaseous messenger, nitric oxide (NO)1 (14Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). The soluble cyclases are found in the cytosol of cells, although the mammalian β2 subunit has a consensus isoprenylation site, suggesting that it might be associated with membranes. The receptor guanylyl cyclases, by contrast, are integral membrane proteins with transmembrane and extracellular domains (4Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We have been using the insect Manduca sexta as a model system to study cGMP regulation and have previously shown that a neuropeptide, eclosion hormone, is a potent stimulator of cGMP levels in the central nervous system (15Morton D.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 814: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the eclosion hormone-stimulated cGMP increase suggested that eclosion hormone might activate a NO-insensitive, soluble guanylyl cyclase (15Morton D.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 814: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Morton D.B. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Morton D.B. Giunta M.A. J.

Physiol. 1995; 165: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify the pathway for eclosion hormone-stimulated cGMP levels, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify guanylyl cyclases from Manduca nervous tissue. This approach has yielded a number of different guanylyl cyclases. We have previously described the cloning and expression characteristics of theManduca homologues of the α1 and β1 subunits, named MsGC-α1 and MsGC-β1 (19Nighorn A. Gibson N.J. Rivers D.M. Hildebrand J.G. Morton D.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7244-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning and preliminary characterization of a novel β subunit, MsGC-β3. This new subunit shows significant basal activity when expressed alone and shows only modest stimulation in the presence of NO. The rearing and staging of M. sexta(Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) has been described previously (17Morton D.B. Giunta M.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1522-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from prepupalM. sexta abdominal central nervous systems using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was generated from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended in 40 μl of water. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed against the amino acid sequences DVYKVETI (CCRAAIARRCARTAICKNGGCAT) and MPRYCLFG (GAYGTITAYAARGTIGWIACNAT). These sequences are in the catalytic domain (Fig. 1) and are highly conserved in both receptor and soluble guanylyl cyclases. PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 1 μl of cDNA, 200 pmol of each degenerate primer, 2 mmMgCl2, 1× PCR buffer II (Perkin-Elmer), all four deoxynucleotides at 200 μm, 12.5 μCi of [35S]dATP, and 2 units of Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer). Thirty cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s were performed. The resulting PCR products were analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and bands below 235 base pairs, the expected size of receptor cyclases, were cut out, eluted, reamplified, T/A cloned into pCRII (InVitrogen), and manually sequenced. cDNA libraries were constructed from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from prepupal abdominal central nervous systems. Oligo(dT)-primed, double-stranded cDNA was generated using a Superscript Choice cDNA construction kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that the reverse transcription reaction was performed in a thermocycler at 37 °C for 15 min followed by a slow rise to 50 °C over the subsequent 45 min. Adapted cDNA was then ligated into EcoRI-cut Lambda-ZAPII (Stratagene) and packaged using Gigapack Gold III (Stratagene) packaging extract. The library was screened using nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), hybridized, and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Manual DNA sequencing was performed using Sequenase kit, Version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Most sequencing was carried out at an automated sequencing facility running an ABI model 377 sequencer. Sequence analysis was performed using Geneworks (Intelligenetics) DNA analysis software, and protein sequence alignments used the ClustalW program through the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher. The open reading frame of MsGC-β3 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and an 8-μg aliquot was transfected into a 10-cm dish of COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three days after transfection, the cells were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell extracts were assayed for guanylyl cyclase activity by monitoring the conversion of [α-32P]GTP to [32P]cGMP as described previously (20Wilson R. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, the production of cGMP was linear with respect to time. To assay cGMP levels in intact COS-7 cells, cells were plated onto 24-well plates, and each well was transfected with 0.2 μg of each plasmid. After 3 days, the cells were incubated in saline (composition: NaCl (120 mm), KCl (5.4 mm), CaCl2 (1.8 mm), Tris-HCl (25 mm) and glucose (15 mm), pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a further 5 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The saline was then removed, and the cells were lysed with ethanol:1 m HCl (100:1). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was lyophilized, redissolved in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.2, and assayed for cGMP content with a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (NEN Life Science Products). Ten μg of total RNA was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose (1%) gel and blotted onto Zetaprobe membrane (Bio-Rad). The blot was UV cross-linked, dried, and hybridized overnight at 42 °C with a hybridization solution consisting of 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 32P-labeled probe at 106 cpm/ml. Probes were generated by random priming of a gel-purified fragment, containing the entire open reading frame, as a template. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent, and 5-μg aliquots were treated with DNaseI (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 37 °C. cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript RT in 20 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. The cDNA was diluted to 40 μl with water, and PCR was performed in 20 μl containing 1 μl of cDNA, 200 pmol of each primer, 2 mm MgCl2, PCR buffer II (Perkin-Elmer), all four deoxynucleotides at 200 μm each, and 2 units of Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer). Thirty cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 66 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s were performed. Products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The primers for MsGC-β3 and MsGC-α1 were designed and checked for false hybridization to other guanylyl cyclases, using Oligo 4.0 (Molecular Biology Insights). The primers for MsGC-α1 were TCACTGCTGTGTTCCGAT and ATAGAAGGCCGTGGTCTT, corresponding to nucleotides 5012–5029 and 5621–5638 that are located in the 3′-untranslated region. The primers for MsGC-β3 were AAGAGAGGTAGCCCGCCA and CATCATTCGCCAGTTGTC corresponding to amino acids REVARH (149–154) and DNWRMM (314–319). A glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing amino acids 178–940 of MsGC-β3 was made by ligating theMunI/SalI fragment of SGC4 and theSalI/XbaI fragment of SGC25 (see Fig. 1) into the GST fusion vector, pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), digested withEcoRI and XbaI. The resulting GST-MsGC-β3 fusion protein was purified using glutathione-coupled Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sent to HTI Bio-Products (Ramona, CA) for antibody production. Antisera were screened using Western blots of COS-7 cells transfected with MsGC-β3 and affinity purified using GST-MsGC-β3 coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells or nervous tissue was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mixture, Boehringer Mannheim) and SDS sample buffer added (final concentrations: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.6% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% glycerol and 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue). The proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Primary antisera were used at 1:100 for whole sera or 1:10 for affinity purified antisera and detected using 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory) and visualized with chemoluminescence and a digital imaging system (ChemiImager, Alpha Innotech). Using RT-PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers, we isolated cDNA fragments of a variety of different guanylyl cyclases from the abdominal central nervous system of M. sexta. Two of these have been described previously (19Nighorn A. Gibson N.J. Rivers D.M. Hildebrand J.G. Morton D.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7244-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), appear to be the Manduca homologues of the mammalian soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits, α1 and β1, and have been named MsGC-α1 and MsGC-β1, respectively. In the course of this earlier study, we isolated an additional cDNA fragment that also had high sequence similarity to mammalian β subunits. Using this fragment, we screened a cDNA library and isolated five overlapping cDNA clones. These clones, when sequenced and compared, could be combined to form a cDNA construct of 5271 base pairs (Fig.1 A). The size of this cDNA construct approximately matched the 5.1-kb band seen on Northern blots (see Fig. 4 A). This composite clone has an open reading frame of 940 amino acids, beginning with a consensus ribosome binding site. There are multiple stop codons in all frames both 5′ and 3′ to this open reading frame. The translated N terminus of this clone also shows a significant level of identity to other cloned β subunits of guanylyl cyclases suggesting that this construct represents the full-length sequence of MsGC-β3. Using a unique BamHI site, a composite clone was created from clones SGC4 and SGC25, which contained the entire open reading frame. Both strands of this composite clone were analyzed and the resulting sequence placed into GenBankTM under accession number AF064514. This clone was then used for further expression studies. BLAST analysis of the protein encoded by the open reading frame showed that it was most similar to β subunits of soluble guanylyl cyclases. The most closely related sequence was a Caenorhabditis elegans clone (GenBankTM accession number 1109803, Ref. 20Wilson R. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Of previously identified and characterized guanylyl cyclases, it had the most similarity to vertebrate β1 subunits, with a 37% overall sequence identity to the rat β1 subunit compared with 29% sequence identity to the rat β2 subunit (TableI). This is, however, much lower than the 59% identity seen between MsGC-β1 and rat β1 (Ref. 19Nighorn A. Gibson N.J. Rivers D.M. Hildebrand J.G. Morton D.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7244-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and TableI). In addition, the newly identified Manduca sequence has a 315 amino acid region C-terminal to its catalytic domain that is not present in any other guanylyl cyclase of any species cloned to date. The C. elegans clone also has a C-terminal extension but has very low similarity to the Manduca sequence (Table I). BLAST analysis of the 315-amino acid sequence from the Manducasequence did not reveal any significant similarity to any other sequence in the data base. The clone does not appear to be theManduca homologue of a β2 subunit, and as it has novel features not seen in previously cloned and characterized guanylyl cyclases, we propose to name this cyclase MsGC-β3. Fig. 1 Bshows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of MsGC-β3 with theC. elegans sequence, MsGC-β1, and the rat β1 subunit.Table IComparison of amino acid identities in the functional domains of Manduca, a C. elegans gene (GenBank™ accession number 1109803; Ref. 20Wilson R. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar) and rat α and β subunitsMsGC-β3 versus C. elegansMsGC-β3versus rat β1MsGC-β3 versus rat β2MsGC-β3 versus MsGC-β1MsGC-β1aData from Ref. 19. versus rat β1MsGC-α1aData from Ref. 19. versus rat α1%Heme binding393717355016Dimerization483427307263Catalytic403940406655C-terminal7Overall (excluding C terminus)403729365935The three different domains have been defined in a variety of studies (22Wilson E.M.

Several different functional domains have been identified in mammalian soluble guanylyl cyclases (21Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24871-24875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Wilson E.M. Chinkers M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These consist of the N-terminal putative heme-binding domain, a putative dimerization domain (based on analogy with receptor guanylyl cyclases), and the C-terminal catalytic domain. Table I shows the percentage of amino acid identities in these domains when MsGC-β3 is compared with other β subunits. The level of sequence identity in the catalytic domain is very similar (∼40%) whether MsGC-β3 is compared with the C. elegans gene, rat β1, rat β2, or MsGC-β1. MsGC-β3 is most similar, however, to the C. elegans gene and the rat β1 subunit in its heme-binding and dimerization domains. Although MsGC-β3 is similar to rat β1, the degree of similarity is considerably lower (< 40%) compared with the sequence identities seen when MsGC-β1 is compared with rat β1 or when MsGC-α1 is compared with rat α1(50–72%). These comparisons again suggest that MsGC-β3 is a novel β subunit and not a Manduca homologue of an identified vertebrate guanylyl cyclase. Further analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence for MsGC-β3 reveals a number of other novel features. Several studies of mammalian guanylyl cyclases, using sequence comparison and mutational analysis, have identified 23 amino acids proposed to be involved in heme binding, NO activation, and/or dimerization (23Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foester J. Malkewitz J.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14668-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These residues are marked in Fig. 1 B, and the sequence alignment shows that six of these residues are not conserved in MsGC-β3, and five of those six are also substituted in the C. elegans gene (although with different substitutions). Most notable of these are the cysteines found in positions 78 and 214 in rat β1, which are absent in both MsGC-β3 and the C. elegans gene and are replaced with valine and glutamic acid, respectively, in MsGC-β3. Friebe et al.(23Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have shown that mutating these cysteines to serines in the rat β1 subunit produces a guanylyl cyclase that, when co-expressed with a wild-type α1 subunit, has detectable (but low) basal activity in the presence of manganese but cannot be activated by NO. Interestingly, histidine-105 (position based on rat β1 sequence), which has been suggested to be the axial ligand for heme binding and also shown to be required for NO-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity (24Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foester J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), is present in MsGC-β3 and the C. elegans gene. The high degree of similarity between MsGC-β3 and the C. elegans gene suggests that it is also a novel β subunit and could also be considered a β3 subunit. MsGC-β3 has a C-terminal 315-amino acid domain that is not present in any other guanylyl cyclase. This region shows no significant similarity to any other protein in the data base. A search for protein motifs revealed that there are a number of possible protein phosphorylation sites within this C-terminal domain, and a potential C-terminal isoprenylation site was also found. Interestingly, the rat β2 subunit also has a potential C-terminal isoprenylation site, although the modification has not yet been demonstrated in vivo (4Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). None of the phosphorylation sites are conserved in the C. elegansgene, nor is the isoprenylation site. To examine the enzyme properties of MsGC-β3, we subcloned its open reading frame into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. We then transiently transfected this construct into COS-7 cells, either alone or in combination with plasmids containing the otherManduca-soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits. Cell extracts were then assayed for guanylyl cyclase activity in the presence or absence of SNP as a NO donor (Fig. 2). As guanylyl cyclases have been shown to vary in their activity depending on whether magnesium or manganese is present (26Tremblay J. Gerzer R. Hamet P. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1988; 22: 319-383PubMed Google Scholar), we tested each cell extract in the presence of each metal ion. In the presence of magnesium, only cells co-transfected with both MsGC-α1 and MsGC-β1 showed guanylyl cyclase activity above that seen for cells transfected with control plasmid. As reported previously, this activity could be stimulated by SNP (19Nighorn A. Gibson N.J. Rivers D.M. Hildebrand J.G. Morton D.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7244-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MsGC-β3 showed no guanylyl cyclase activity when expressed alone, and it did not appear to form an active heterodimer when co-expressed with either MsGC-α1 or MsGC-β1. In the presence of manganese, cells co-transfected with MsGC-α1 and MsGC-β1 showed higher basal and lower SNP-stimulated activity when compared with cell extracts assayed in the presence of magnesium. This is a similar result to the enzymatic activity of mammalian soluble guanylyl cyclases (23Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with only MsGC-β3 and assayed in the presence of manganese, we detected significant basal guanylyl cyclase activity above that seen in cells transfected with control plasmid. We did not, however, detect any stimulation of activity in the presence of SNP. This suggests that MsGC-β3 does not need to form heterodimers to form an active guanylyl cyclase and that this active enzyme is NO-insensitive. When MsGC-β3 was co-expressed with either MsGC-α1 or MsGC-β1, the total guanylyl cyclase activity present in the cell extracts was less than when MsGC-β3 was expressed alone and a small but significant increase in activity was detected in the presence of SNP. It is not clear whether this increase was due to the formation of low levels of NO-sensitive heterodimers. COS-7 cells transfected with control plasmid alone also showed a small increase in guanylyl cyclase activity in the presence of SNP, presumably due to the expression of low levels of endogenous soluble guanylyl cyclase. Friebe et al. (23Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) report that mutant β subunits, missing either cysteine-78 or cysteine-214, show a substantial reduction in their ability to form NO-sensitive heterodimers. NO sensitivity was restored, however, by reconstitution with heme. TableII shows that this does not occur with MsGC-β3. We transfected COS-7 cells with either MsGC-β3 alone or MsGC-β3 together with MsGC-α1. We then assayed the cell extracts for guanylyl cyclase activity after incubation with 5 μmhematin and 100 μm dithiothreitol. In neither case did we see an increase in NO-stimulated activity. By contrast, when cells transfected with MsGC-α1 together with MsGC-β1 were treated in a similar fashion, heme reconstitution did increase the NO-stimulated activity, presumably because some endogenous heme was lost during cell homogenization.Table IIIncubation with hematin does not affect MsGC-β3 activityTransfectionNo addition5 μm hematin/100 μmDTTControl100 μm SNPControl100 μm SNPpcDNA3.1NDaND, not detectable.2.80 ± 1.90—bNot determined.—bNot determined.MsGC-β30.64 ± 0.132.11 ± 0.080.51 ± 0.112.33 ± 0.74MsGC-β3 + MsGC-α10.50 ± 0.261.40 ± 0.16ND1.70 ± 0.08MsGC-α1 + MsGC-β11.11 ± 0.1823.4 ± 0.281.05 ± 0.1128.5 ± 1.05COS-7 cells were transiently transfected and assayed 3 days later for guanylyl cyclase activity in the presence of 4 mM Mg2+.

Guanylyl cyclase activity is expressed as pmol of cGMP formed/min/mg of protein and represents the mean ± S.E. of assays carried out in triplicate. These experiments suggest that MsGC-β3 either does not bind heme, or binds it in such a manner that renders the cyclase NO-insensitive. Recently, a compound, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), has been identified as a potent inhibitor of mammalian guanylyl cyclases (27Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar). It appears to act as a heme site inhibitor, inhibiting activity by irreversible oxidation of the heme group (28Schrammel A. Behrends S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether ODQ could inhibit MsGC-β3 by assaying guanylyl cyclase activity of transfected COS-7 cell extracts in the presence of different concentrations of ODQ (Fig. 3). ODQ has an IC50 of 0.72 μm for inhibiting mammalian soluble guanylyl cyclase (28Schrammel A. Behrends S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar), yet 100 μm had no inhibitory effect on MsGC-β3. As a control for the effectiveness of ODQ, we also assessed its effects on Manduca NO-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase (Fig. 3). These results showed that 100 μm ODQ inhibited Manduca NO-sensitive activity by 95% with an IC50 of 2.9 μm. Interestingly, basal activity of the Manduca NO-sensitive cyclase showed no sensitivity to ODQ. This is in contrast to the mammalian enzyme, which showed 80% inhibition of basal activity in the presence of 30 μm ODQ (28Schrammel A. Behrends S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus of MsGC-β3 contains a potential isoprenylation site (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether MsGC-β3 is membrane-associated, we separat"

A variant cell line (Tao) having ∼10% of the AHR content of 1c1c7 cells also arrested following exposure to C2-ceramide, but did not undergo apoptosis. Modulation of 1c1c7 and Tao AHR contents by transfection ofAhr antisense and sense constructs, respectively, confirmed the relationship between AHR content and susceptibility to C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis. C2-ceramide also induced the apoptosis of an AHR-containing cell line lacking the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein. AHR ligands (i.e. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and α-naphthoflavone) neither induced apoptosis nor modulated the development of apoptosis in C2-ceramide-treated 1c1c7 cultures. AHR content did not affect staurosporine- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)1 is a ligand-activated transcription factor (1Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 3Nebert D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Numerous xenobiotics, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), are ligands of the AHR. In many tissues and cell lines, the non-liganded AHR appears to be a cytosolic protein (4Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 45: 428-438Google Scholar, 5Reiners Jr., J.J. Jones C.L. Hong N. Clift R. Elferink C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Upon binding TCDD, the AHR translocates to the nucleus where it forms a dimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein. AHR/ARNT heterodimers interact with specific enhancer sequences in target genes designated dioxin-responsive elements, and stimulate the transcriptional activation of such genes (1Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev.

Many of the biological processes initiated by TCDD can be attributed to this transcriptional activation of target genes (1Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). In general, the cellular functions of the AHR have been defined or inferred from comparisons of the effects of ligands of the AHR in wild type and AHR-deficient or null cell lines or mice (1–3,6–11). Such approaches have delineated the need for the AHR in mediating the teratogenic, immunomodulating, cytostatic, and apoptotic activities of TCDD, and the role of the AHR in TCDD-initiated, transcriptional activation of several phase I and II genes involved in biotransformation (1Hankinson O.

Cell Res. 1996; 226: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, studies employing exogenous ligands do not address the issue of whether the AHR, in the absence of exogenous ligand, has other cellular functions. Recent studies, performed in the absence of exogenous ligand, have implicated a role for the AHR in cell cycle progression. These studies used murine hepatoma 1c1c7 and Tao cells, the latter being an AHR-deficient variant derived from the 1c1c7 line (12Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The doubling time of Tao cells is considerably longer than parental 1c1c7 cells due to a prolongation of G1, but can be shortened by the introduction of anAhr expression construct (12Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Conversely, introduction of an Ahr antisense expression construct into 1c1c7 cells increases cell doubling times due to a lengthening of G1. This inverse relationship between AHR content and cell doubling times has also been observed with rat hepatoma 5L and BP8 cells, the latter being an AHR-deficient variant derived from 5L cells (11Weib C. Kolluri S.K. Kiefer F. Göttlicher M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). An unresolved issue in these studies is whether the observed AHR-dependent effects were ARNT-dependent and mediated by an endogenous AHR ligand. Apoptosis is a physiological process that entails the programmed death of a cell. It plays a critical role during development and in the maintenance of tissue and organ homeostasis (13Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar, 14Scott D.W. Grdina T. Shi Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2352-2356PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, disregulation of processes controlling apoptosis often contribute to the development of neoplasia. Apoptosis is also the process by which many genotoxic and chemotherapeutic drugs exert their cytotoxic effects. Several studies implicate the AHR as having a role in influencing or mediating apoptotic processes. For example, immunohistochemical analyses of embryonic tissues show that AHR expression is developmentally regulated and occurs independently of ARNT expression in regions undergoing remodeling, a process that involves apoptosis (15Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Perdew G.H. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Abbott B.D. Probst M.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similarly, resting T cells express very low levels of the AHR (17Lawrence B.P. Leid M. Kerkvliet N.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Crawford R.B. Holsapple M.P. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 52: 921-927Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Upon mitogenic stimulation they enter the cell cycle, divide, and subsequently undergo apoptosis (19Chrest F.J. Buchholz M.A. Kim Y.H. Kwon T.-K. Nordin A.A. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Su X. Zhou T. Yang P. Wang Z. Mountz J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4198-4208PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the AHR is markedly increased following such stimulation, and the kinetics of expression parallel the onset of apoptosis (17Lawrence B.P. Leid M. Kerkvliet N.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,18Crawford R.B. Holsapple M.P. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 52: 921-927Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although the role of the AHR in the above examples is speculative, there are at least two examples in which the AHR protein has been clearly associated with an apoptotic process. The first of these entails the thymic atrophy seen in AHR+/+ mice, but not AHR null mice, following exposure to TCDD (9Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Toxicol Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 21Kamath A.B. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The second example relates to the fibrosis and reduced liver size seen in AHR null mice (6Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S.T. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt J.V. Su G.H.-T.

Recent studies suggest that these phenotypic traits reflect the autocrine production by AHR null hepatocytes of a cytokine (e.g. transforming growth factor-β) that causes hepatocyte apoptosis (22Zaher H.

Presumably, absence of the AHR facilitates conditions that lead to the activation of latent transforming growth factor-β (22Zaher H. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Letterio J. Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Ceramide is an endogenous lipid generated by either de novobiosynthesis or sphingomyelinase degradation of sphingomyelin (23Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem.

Intracellular levels of ceramide are elevated by a variety of stimuli/agents that induce apoptosis, including Fas ligand engagement of CD95, ionizing radiation, ultraviolet radiation, chemotherapeutic and genotoxic chemicals, and several cytokines (23Hannun Y.A.

It has been reported to be a modulator of immune cell differentiation, mitochondrial respiration, inflammation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and the stress response (23Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

Furthermore, ceramide has several structural features which suggest that it might be an AHR ligand. Specifically, structure-activity analyses suggest that the AHR preferentially binds aromatic, hydrophobic planar molecules, and has a binding site with dimensions of ∼6.8 × 13.7 Å (30Gillner M. Bergman J. Cambillau C. Alexandersson M. Fernström B. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 44: 336-345Google Scholar, 31Kafafi S.A. Said H.K. Mahmoud M.I. Afeefy H.Y. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although not aromatic, ceramide is a hydrophobic molecule. The amide group, which serves as the link between ceramide's two acyl chains, imparts a planar conformation on the molecule in which the axes of the two acyl chains lie parallel to one another (32Pascher I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overall dimensions of some ceramide molecules do not dramatically differ from those of some AHR ligands (e.g. 4 × 20 Å for palmitoyl ceramide (C16); Ref. 33Shah J. Atienza J.M. Duclos Jr., R.I. Rawlings A.V. Dong Z. Shipley G.G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current studies evolved from a preliminary characterization of ceramide as a putative AHR ligand. As an approach we examined the transcriptional activation of Cyp1a1 in AHR-containing (1c1c7) and AHR-deficient (Tao) cells treated withN-acetylsphingosine, a cell-permeable analog of ceramide. Although initial studies did not support the hypothesis being tested, we noted a pronounced difference in the viability of the two cell lines following ceramide exposure. 2R. E. Clift and J. J. Reiners, Jr., unpublished observations. In the current investigation, we determined whether manipulation of the AHR contents of cells of the 1c1c7 lineage could modulate susceptible to ceramide-induced apoptosis, and two additional inducers of apoptosis: staurosporine and doxorubicin (23Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 34Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Susceptibility of the various 1c1c7 variant lines to ceramide-induced apoptosis correlated directly with cellular AHR contents, but was independent of the presence of a functional ARNT protein. In contrast, AHR content did not influence susceptibility to staurosporine- or doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis. These findings implicate a novel role for AHR in ceramide-mediated apoptosis that is independent of its functioning as an ARNT-associated transcription factor. α-Naphthoflavone, doxorubicin, and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma. TCDD was the gift of Dr. S. Safe (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX).N-Acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C2-ceramide) and dihydro-N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (DHC2-ceramide) were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). Ac-DEVD-AMC and 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) were obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Aldrich, respectively. Geneticin, α-minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The murine hepatoma 1c1c7, BPrc1, Tao, WCMV, WARV, TCMV, and TAHR cell lines were obtained from Dr. J. Whitlock, Jr. (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). The origins and characterizations of these cell lines have been described in detail (12Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 35Miller A.G. Israel D. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol.

All cell lines were cultured at 32 °C in α-minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The TCMV, TAHR, WCMV, and WARV lines were maintained in medium containing 500 ng/ml Geneticin. Analyses of a chemical's cytostatic/cytotoxic effects were performed with cultures initially seeded at a density of 5–20 × 104 cells/60-mm dish in 3 ml of medium. The following day cultures were treated with either solvent (Me2SO or ethanol), ceramides (dissolved in Me2SO or ethanol), or TCDD, α-naphthoflavone, doxorubicin, or staurosporine (dissolved in Me2SO). At various times after treatment, culture medium was lightly sprayed over the culture surface to dislodge loosely attached cells, which were transferred to a centrifuge tube. Attached cells were removed with a 0.25% trypsin-EDTA mixture and added to the centrifuge tube. In some instances the pooled cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were counted with a hemacytometer. Viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Each sample was counted a minimum of three times. Cells were plated at a density of ∼1 × 106/100-mm culture dish in 10 ml of medium. Two days after plating, cultures were treated with either solvent or chemicals of interest. At various times after treatment, cells were dislodged into the culture medium with a cell scraper, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPi, and 10 mm NaPPi), quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. On the day of assay, lysates were thawed on ice, homogenized for 20 s (PT 1200 Polytron, Kinematica, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. Supernatant fluids were kept on ice until assayed by a modified version of a protocol supplied by the provider of Ac-DEVD-AMC (PharMingen). Assays were performed at room temperature and initiated by the addition of 100 μl of supernatant fluid to 1.9 ml of protease assay buffer (final concentrations: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC). AMC release was monitored with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. A standard curve created with AMC was used to convert fluorescence intensity into picomoles of product produced in the presence of supernatant fluids. Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Caspase activities are reported as nanomoles of AMC released/min/mg of protein of supernatant fluid. Initial characterization studies demonstrated that substrate cleavage was linear with time and directly proportional to the amount of protein in the assay.2 Cells were plated at ∼1.5 to 2 × 106/100-mm dish in 10 ml of medium. Cultures were treated 1 day later with solvent or chemicals. At various times after treatment, the culture medium was removed and the cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, aspirated dry, and stored at −70 °C. Non-adherent cells in the culture medium were recovered by centrifugation and also stored at −70 °C. Adherent cells were lysed in the plates by addition of 5 ml of 4m guanidine isothiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% sarkosyl. Lysates were transferred to the tubes containing pellets of non-adherent cells. Lysates were extracted with 5 ml of Tris-equilibrated phenol (pH >7.6) plus 1 ml of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (49:1). After centrifugation for 1 h at 6500 ×g at 4 °C, the aqueous phase was transferred to new tubes. Nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of an equal volume of isopropanol and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0 (TE), 0.1% SDS, and 40 μg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C, for 1 h. After successive extractions with Tris-equilibrated phenol (pH >7.6):chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), DNA was precipitated by the addition of 1/50 volume of 5 m NaCl and 2 volumes of 95% EtOH. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in TE (∼10 μl per 1 × 106 cells), and quantified by spectrophotometry. DNAs were mixed with ethidium bromide (80 ng/ml) and separated on 2% agarose, 1× TAE gels. DNA was visualized under UV light and recorded with a IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Nucleosomal ladders were visualized with exposures of ∼2 s. Briefer exposures (≤1/15 s) were used to visualize high molecular weight DNA. Total cellular RNA was isolated according to the acidic phenol extraction method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63183) Google Scholar). RNA was resolved on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes as described previously (5Reiners Jr., J.J. Jones C.L. Hong N. Clift R. Elferink C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The probes used for the detection of CYP1A1 and 7 S RNAs, and the conditions used for hybridization have been described in detail (38Schöller A. Hong N.J. Bischer P. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol.

Carcinog. 1997; 19: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were used for the preparation of cellular extracts, separation of proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, and immunodetection of the AHR with an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody to the murine AHR protein (provided by Dr. A. Poland while at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Antigen-immunoglobulin conjugates were detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and recorded on x-ray film. A variety of cell types commit to, and undergo apoptosis upon exposure to N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), a cell-permeable analog of ceramide (23Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar,39Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Exposure of 1c1c7 cultures to varying concentrations of C2-ceramide resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of cell proliferation (Fig. 1 A). Concentrations ≥30 μm completely suppressed cell division (Fig.1 A), enhanced cell permeability to trypan blue (Fig.1 C), and caused dramatic morphological changes. Specifically, within 4–6 h of exposure to ≥30 μmC2-ceramide, the cells began to vacuolate, and by 12–16 h had shrunken, as had the nuclei.2 DNA fragmentation and the development of nucleosomal ladders, a characteristic of late stage apoptotic cells, were detected within 16 h of C2-ceramide treatment (Fig. 1 E) and preceded alterations in membrane permeability to trypan blue (Fig. 1, compareC and E). Tao cells were derived from 1c1c7 cells and have been reported to contain normal amounts of ARNT protein, but only 10% of the AHR protein content of 1c1c7 cells (12Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 36Whitlock Jr., J.P. Galeazzi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 980-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data present in thetop panel of Fig. 2confirm the markedly different AHR contents of the 1c1c7 and Tao cell lines. These differences were also reflected in how the two cell lines responded to TCDD. Although steady state CYP1A1 mRNA levels were elevated above basal levels in both cell lines following TCDD exposure, the induced CYP1A1 mRNA contents of 1c1c7 cells were severalfold greater than those observed in its AHR-deficient counterpart (bottom panel of Fig. 2). Tao cells grew considerably slower than 1c1c7 cells (Fig. 1, compareA and B). Proliferation of Tao cells, like the parental 1c1c7 line, was completely suppressed by exposure to concentrations of C2-ceramide ≥30 μm (Fig.1 B). However, the killing effects of anti-proliferative concentrations of C2-ceramide were muted in Tao cells (Fig.1 D). Specifically, the kinetics of killing were slower and the absolute level of killing was much less than that seen in parental 1c1c7 cells (Fig. 1, compare C and D). Indeed, ∼30% of C2-ceramide-treated Tao cells were viable after even 4 days of treatment (n = 3 experiments).2 Furthermore, at comparable loadings of DNA, nucleosomal ladders were not detected in Tao cells following 48 h (Fig. 1, compare E and F), or even 72 h of exposure to C2-ceramide.2 Ma and Whitlock (12Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar) recently reported the characterization of a series of cell lines derived by transfection of 1c1c7 and Tao cells withAhr antisense and sense expression constructs, respectively. Transfection of 1c1c7 cells with an Ahr antisense construct gave rise to a cell line designated WARV having AHR contents similar to those measured in Tao cells (top panel of Fig.2). Conversely, transfection of Tao cells (also called AhR-D; Ref. 12Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with an Ahr sense expression vector gave rise to a cell line designated TAHR having AHR contents similar to that seen in 1c1c7 cells (Fig. 2). The AHR contents of 1c1c7 and Tao cells stably transfected with just the vector (resulting lines are designated WCMV and TCMV, respectively) were very similar to the contents of the corresponding parental cells (Fig. 2). The responsiveness of the four engineered cell lines to TCDD, as monitored by measuring steady state CYP1A1 mRNA contents 6 h after treatment, also correlated with cellular AHR contents (bottom panel of Fig. 2). We used these lines to further examine the relationship between AHR content and susceptibility to ceramide-induced apoptosis (Fig.3). The sensitivity of WCMV cells to C2-ceramide was virtually identical to the parental line (compare Fig. 1, A and C, with Fig. 3,A and E). However, WARV cells were markedly less sensitive to C2-dependent killing, as judged by trypan blue staining (Fig. 3, compare E and F) and DNA laddering (Fig. 3, I and J). Conversely, TAHR cells were more susceptible to C2-ceramide-induced killing and DNA fragmentation than the TCMV cell line (Fig. 3, compareG with H, and K withL). The data presented in Fig. 3 merit two additional comments. First, manipulation of AHR contents modulated cell doubling times. AHR-deficient variant lines (WARV and TCMV) grew much slower than the engineered cell lines (WCMV and TAHR) expressing wild type AHR levels (Fig. 3, compare A, B, C, andD). These results are similar to those reported by Ma and Whitlock (12Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Second, irrespective of AHR content, proliferation was arrested in all four engineered cell lines following exposure to 30 μm C2-ceramide (Fig. 3, A–D). The studies reported in Figs. 1 and 3 were performed with cultures grown at 32 °C in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum (our standard conditions; Ref. 38Schöller A. Hong N.J. Bischer P. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 944-954PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies were performed with cultures grown in variable amounts of FBS, or at 37 °C.2The concentration-response curves were influenced by the amount of serum present in the culture medium. Decreasing media serum concentrations decreased the amount of ceramide required to achieve cell killing. Increasing the culturing temperature to 37 °C"

The eight-membered rings of the CCT double torus consist usually of eight distinct but related (∼30% identity) gene products, CCTα, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, -ζ, -η, and -θ (11Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In yeast, these eight subunits are encoded by essential genes, and mutations in individual subunits lead to defects in the functioning of the cytoskeleton, most commonly manifested as arrest in mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 12Stoldt V.

In addition to assisting folding of newly synthesized tubulins and actins, the CCTα subunit appears to be a component of the centrosome and essential for nucleated microtubule assembly from this organelle (16Brown C.R. Doxsey S.J. Hong-Brown L.Q. Martin R.L. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 824-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). That this process can take place in a permeabilized cell system, in the absence of protein synthesis, suggests that CCTα at least may also be involved in facilitating the polymerization of fully folded tubulins; which, if any, other CCT subunits are required remains to be determined. Indeed, whether CCT subunits always and only exist in cells as components of a single type of 20 S oligomeric particle or whether free subunits and assemblies of variable subunit composition have some functional roles is not yet resolved. We have presented data that support the latter possibility (17Roobol A. Holmes F.E. Hayes N.V.L. Baines A.J. Carden M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar).In view of the close functional relationship between CCT subunits and the synthesis and assembly of tubulins, it seemed appropriate to determine whether CCT subunits could be detected as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). MAPs are defined operationally as proteins that copurify with tubulins to a constant stoichiometry during microtubule assembly (18Sloboda R.D. Rudolph S.A. Rosenbaum J.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 19Murphy D.B. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 72: 2696-2700Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Several MAPs appear to fulfill structural roles in microtubule function, e.g. by modulating the stability of microtubules and by forming side-arm structures important for maintaining the integrity of the cytoskeleton (e.g. Refs. 20Amos L.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Such structural MAPs commonly promote the in vitro assembly of tubulin into microtubules. Other MAPs are more transiently associated with the microtubule, such as the ATP-driven motor molecules kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, which are required for the microtubule-based motility so critical for the functioning and proliferation of eukaryotic cells (23Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 317: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 24Shpetner H.S. Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The association of these latter MAPs with microtubules is often detected only in vitro when microtubules are polymerized in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog such as AMPPNP (25Lasek R.J. Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 316: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, a number of stringent experimental criteria have been developed over the years by which a protein may be defined as a MAP. Two of these criteria, copolymerization through temperature-dependent cycles of microtubule assembly and disassembly (18Sloboda R.D. Rudolph S.A. Rosenbaum J.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 19Murphy D.B. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 72: 2696-2700Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and copurification with Taxol-assembled microtubule protein prepared and extracted under carefully defined centrifugation conditions (26Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), have been used in this investigation of the association of CCT subunits with microtubules.Initially, we detected CCT subunits in standard mammalian brain MAP preparations and have since examined in more detail the CCT content of MAPs in the P19 cell line. This pluripotent mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line has the ability to differentiate into a variety of phenotypes (27Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 342-348Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to us, in view of the presence of CCT subunits in standard brain MAP preparations, is the neuronal differentiation pathway that is induced by aggregation in the presence of submicromolar levels of retinoic acid. The use of this cell line, in conjunction with the plant alkaloid Taxol (28Schiff P.B. Horowitz S.B. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3247-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) to induce microtubule assembly, permitted a much greater flexibility in experimental conditions, including microtubule polymerization in the absence of added nucleotide. We report here that CCT subunits do indeed copurify with microtubules. The subunit proportions of the microtubule-associated CCT subunits differ from those in the parental tissue/cell lysate and from those in the bulk 20 S chaperonin particles purified therefrom. These microtubule-associated CCT subunits are not assembled in a chaperonin-sized particle. We discuss the possible role free CCT subunits may play in the molecular chaperone activities of the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin and identify a conserved sequence in CCT subunits that may contribute to their binding to microtubules.DISCUSSIONIn pilot studies to confirm and extend the findings of Brownet al. (16Brown C.R. Doxsey S.J. Hong-Brown L.Q. Martin R.L. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 824-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we observed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, both CCTα and CCTζ as components enriched at the centrosome (data not shown) and, by immunoblotting, CCT components in brain MAP preparations. This report addresses the basic question of whether or not CCT subunits are MAPs. Some CCT subunits certainly do fulfill the generally accepted biochemical criteria for defining proteins as MAPs. The association of CCT subunits with microtubules is, in several ways, similar to that between microtubules and the hsc/hsp70 family of molecular chaperones (37Napolitano E.W. Pachter J.S. Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 101: 1323-1331Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Green L.A.D. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 310: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Neither molecular chaperone (CCT nor hcs70) is quantitatively removed from cell extracts by assembling microtubules (Ref. 38Green L.A.D. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15210-15215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this report). Immunofluorescence detection of both chaperones produces diffuse staining in the cytoplasm (9Lewis V.A.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3541-3545PubMed Google Scholar) rather than a microtubular fibrous staining exhibited by antibodies to some of the structural MAPs (e.g. MAP4 in Ref. 46Bulinski J.C. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or the punctate, vesicular cytoplasmic staining reported for the motor protein kinesin (e.g. Ref. 47Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Neither CCT subunits nor hcs70 stimulates tubulin assembly in vitro (Ref. 38Green L.A.D. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15210-15215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this report); and finally, both chaperones are dissociated from microtubules by ATP (Refs. 38Green L.A.D. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15210-15215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 40Bloch M.A. Johnson K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3541-3545PubMed Google Scholar and this report), although we found CCT subunits to be more readily displaced than hsc70. We therefore conclude that certain CCT subunits behave as MAPs in a similar way to members of the hsc/hsp70 family that are already classified as MAPs (37Napolitano E.W. Pachter J.S. Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 101: 1323-1331Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Green L.A.D. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 310: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The presence of partially denatured tubulin molecules in standard microtubule preparations might be expected to attract the attentions of molecular chaperones, particularly the CCT chaperonin, and this could explain their behavior as MAPs. However, the tubulin/actin folding activity of CCT is understood to require the 20 S chaperonin particle containing all eight CCT subunits (6Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumacher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Stoldt V. Rademacher F. Kehren V. Ernst J.F. Pearce D.A. Sherman F.

Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The data in this present report suggest that removal of the tubulin COOH termini (residues 439–451 and 434–445 for α- and β-tubulins, respectively) (48Redeker V. Melki R. Prome D. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) by subtilisin generates a form of tubulin that is indeed recognized as a folding substrate for the CCT chaperonin containing all eight subunits. Dobrynski et al. (49Dobrynski J.K. Sternlicht M.L. Farr G.W. Sternlicht H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15870-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have similarly reported that in vitro translation of β-tubulin mRNA lacking 27 residues from the COOH terminus causes arrest of the resulting polypeptide on the CCT complex. Thus, the presence ofselected CCT subunits in MAP preparations possibly points to functions of some CCT subunits in association with microtubules other than, or in addition to, those undertaken by these subunits when they are incorporated into the core 20 S chaperonin particle. Indeed, we have shown here that the CCT subunits associated with microtubules appear to be free subunits or microassemblies rather than 20 S oligomeric CCT, although from their fractionation position in sucrose gradients, it seems more likely that these microtubule-associated CCT subunits are actually free subunits rather than the microassemblies described by Liou and Willison (42Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).The dissociation constants for the binding of selected CCT subunits to polymerized tubulin are <0.1 μm (e.g. Fig.5 f). Since the concentration of CCT in the cytosol is between 1 and 2 μm (9Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 50Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 51Frydman J. Nimmersgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), there should be significant CCT subunit binding to microtubules in the cell, even if only 5% of CCT is in the form of free subunits (42Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); we have more recent evidence, however, that in cells, the proportion of CCT in the form of free subunits is likely to be substantially >5%. 2A. Roobol and M. J. Carden, manuscript in preparation. The low stoichiometry of CCT subunit binding to microtubules is not without precedent among MAPs (for example, the STOP protein (52Job D. Rauch C.T. Fischer E.H. Margolis R.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Restriction of binding to a specific subset of tubulin molecules, e.g. GTP-tubulin or some post-translationally modified tubulin, could explain the low stoichiometry observed. At present, we can only speculate on the functions of these free CCT subunits. The observation that most are associated only with polymerizing tubulin may indicate a role for these subunits in facilitating tubulin polymerization in the intracellular environment, a role already suggested by the requirement for CCTα in centrosome-nucleated microtubule growth (16Brown C.R. Doxsey S.J. Hong-Brown L.Q. Martin R.L. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 824-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the association of CCT subunits with microtubules may relate to microtubule-based transport or motility, a function already suggested for microtubule-associated hsc70 (38Green L.A.D. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15210-15215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).If some CCT subunits can associate with microtubules in a way other than via the proposed subunit apical domains that recognize unfolded protein substrates including tubulins (50Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), what region of the subunits might bind to microtubules? Using synthetic oligonucleotides devised for the purpose of probing Tetrahymena genomic libraries for MAP-encoding sequences, Soares et al. (53Soares H. Penque D. Mouta C. Rodrigues-Pousada C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29299-29307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified the gene encoding the Tetrahymena ortholog of CCTγ. They defined a motif (-(P/A)GGG-) common to the microtubule-binding repeats of tau and MAP2 and to some CCT subunits. TableI is an alignment of murine CCT subunit sequences (11Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) compared with this conserved motif in MAPs, and it should be noted that, in the sequences for CCTβ and CCTε, the P/A preceding the triple G is replaced by tyrosine. This nonconservative substitution could explain the weaker association of these two subunits with microtubules when compared with the other subunits. Since the analysis by Kim et al. (50Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and our own modeling studies 3H. C. Whitaker, M. Lobell, and M. J. Carden, unpublished data. locate this (P/A)GGG motif near the ATP-binding site hinge region, conformation changes in the CCT subunits consequent to ATP hydrolysis could well affect accessibility of this motif for binding to microtubules. However, the synthetic peptide VPGGGA did not compete with CCT subunits for binding to microtubules (data not shown), and so if this motif is involved in CCT subunit association with microtubules, other as yet unidentified regions of the CCT subunits must also be required for binding to occur. Alternatively, as we noted with polymerization of pure tubulin in the presence of purified CCT, certain polypeptides in these CCT preparations other than CCT subunits were quite strikingly concentrated into assembling microtubules (Fig. 5). It is quite plausible that some of these proteins, which may be naturally associated with the CCT chaperonin, are the actual mediators of interactions between CCT subunits and microtubules.Table IMAP sequence motif implicated in microtubule binding is present in some CCT subunitsCCTαVPGGGAVECCTβVYGGGCSECCTγVPGGGASECCTδIAGGGAPECCTɛVYGGGAAECCTζVPGAGAVECCTηVAGGGAIECCTθVPGGGATEMAP2VPGGGMAP4VPGGGTauVPGGGThe VPGGG motif present in MAP2, MAP4, and tau sequences (54Bulinski J.C.

Open table in a new tab Molecular chaperones are a diverse group of proteins that assist the correct folding and intracellular targeting of newly synthesized polypeptides (1Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can modulate the oligomerization and polymerization of folded native proteins (e.g. Ref. 2Lingappa J.R. Martin R.L. Wong M.L. Ganem D. Welch W.J. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The chaperonins are a family of molecular chaperones that are characterized by their oligomeric structure, namely a double torus of ∼60 kDa subunits (3Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) enclosing a central cavity within which the folding substrate may be sequestered (4Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P.

Chaperonin-assisted protein folding proceeds by ATP-driven, alternating cycles of substrate binding and release, ultimately resulting in a native, or near-native, protein that is no longer recognized by the chaperonin (7Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R.

The cytosolic chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT)1 is the only known chaperonin in the cytosol of eukaryotes (9Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 10Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K. Willison K. Yaffe M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The eight-membered rings of the CCT double torus consist usually of eight distinct but related (∼30% identity) gene products, CCTα, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, -ζ, -η, and -θ (11Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In yeast, these eight subunits are encoded by essential genes, and mutations in individual subunits lead to defects in the functioning of the cytoskeleton, most commonly manifested as arrest in mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 12Stoldt V. Rademacher F. Kehren V. Ernst J.F. Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 523-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is bothin vivo (10Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) evidence that major substrates of the cytosolic chaperonin are tubulins and actins. In addition to assisting folding of newly synthesized tubulins and actins, the CCTα subunit appears to be a component of the centrosome and essential for nucleated microtubule assembly from this organelle (16Brown C.R. Doxsey S.J. Hong-Brown L.Q. Martin R.L. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 824-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). That this process can take place in a permeabilized cell system, in the absence of protein synthesis, suggests that CCTα at least may also be involved in facilitating the polymerization of fully folded tubulins; which, if any, other CCT subunits are required remains to be determined. Indeed, whether CCT subunits always and only exist in cells as components of a single type of 20 S oligomeric particle or whether free subunits and assemblies of variable subunit composition have some functional roles is not yet resolved. We have presented data that support the latter possibility (17Roobol A. Holmes F.E. Hayes N.V.L. Baines A.J. Carden M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the close functional relationship between CCT subunits and the synthesis and assembly of tubulins, it seemed appropriate to determine whether CCT subunits could be detected as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). MAPs are defined operationally as proteins that copurify with tubulins to a constant stoichiometry during microtubule assembly (18Sloboda R.D. Rudolph S.A. Rosenbaum J.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 19Murphy D.B. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 72: 2696-2700Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Several MAPs appear to fulfill structural roles in microtubule function, e.g. by modulating the stability of microtubules and by forming side-arm structures important for maintaining the integrity of the cytoskeleton (e.g. Refs. 20Amos L. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 72: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Kim H. Binder L.I. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22Matus A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Such structural MAPs commonly promote the in vitro assembly of tubulin into microtubules. Other MAPs are more transiently associated with the microtubule, such as the ATP-driven motor molecules kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, which are required for the microtubule-based motility so critical for the functioning and proliferation of eukaryotic cells (23Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 317: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 24Shpetner H.S. Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The association of these latter MAPs with microtubules is often detected only in vitro when microtubules are polymerized in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog such as AMPPNP (25Lasek R.J. Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 316: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, a number of stringent experimental criteria have been developed over the years by which a protein may be defined as a MAP. Two of these criteria, copolymerization through temperature-dependent cycles of microtubule assembly and disassembly (18Sloboda R.D. Rudolph S.A. Rosenbaum J.L. Greengard P. Proc."

In most of mammalian and avian chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, the glycosaminoglycan chains bear sulfate at position 4 or 6 of N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The ratio of chondroitin 4-sulfate/chondroitin 6-sulfate has been reported to vary with the development of animals (10Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A. Suzuki S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13245-13251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfation of positions 4 and 6 of GalNAc residue was shown to be catalyzed by different sulfotransferases (15Habuchi O. Miyashita N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST)1 and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST). Characterization of the purified sulfotransferases and molecular cloning of these cDNAs are basically important to reveal the functional roles of these chondroitin sulfate isomers. We have purified C6ST from the culture medium of chick chondrocytes (16Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned the cDNA (17Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol.

Unexpectedly, the purified C6ST was found to catalyze not only chondroitin but also keratan sulfate (18Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura J. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and sialyl N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides (19Habuchi O. Suzuki Y. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We previously observed that C4ST was also secreted to the culture medium of chick chondrocytes (20Habuchi O. Tsuzuki M. Takeuchi I. Hara M. Matsui Y. Ashikari S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1133: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but the purification of C4ST from the culture medium of chick chondrocytes has been hampered by the presence of an excess amount of C6ST. Unlike chick chondrocytes, rat chondrosarcoma cells were reported to synthesize chondroitin 4-sulfate as a major component (21Oegema T.R. Hascall V.C. Dziewiatkowski D. J. Biol.

The Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cell line RCS-LTC was shown to display a stable, differentiated, chondrocyte-like phenotype (24Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S.

We investigated whether C4ST was secreted from the chondrosarcoma cells, and found that C4ST, but not C6ST, was actively secreted from these cells. We report here the purification and characterization of C4ST from the serum-free culture medium of the chondrosarcoma cells. The following commercial materials were used: H235SO4 was from DuPont NEN; chondroitinase ACII, chondroitinase ABC, chondroitin sulfate A (whale cartilage), chondroitin sulfate C (shark cartilage), dermatan sulfate (pig skin), heparan sulfate (bovine kidney), completely desulfatedN-resulfated heparin (CDSNS-heparin), ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-6S, ΔDi-4S, ΔDi-diSD, ΔDi-diSB, and ΔDi-diSE were from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan); Partisil SAX-10 was from Whatman; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Life Tech Oriental, Tokyo, Japan); Cosmedium-001 (a commercial serum-free culture medium developed for the culture of hybridoma, which contains human transferrin and bovine insulin as growth factors) was from Cosmo-Bio (Tokyo, Japan); Hanks' solution was from Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan); trypsin (from bovine pancreas, type III), penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, 3′,5′-ADP, unlabeled PAPS, 3′,5′-ADP-agarose, and molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE and gel chromatography were from Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan); recombinant N-glycanase was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA); Hiload Superdex 30 HR 16/60, fast desalting column HR 10/10, and heparin-Sepharose CL-6B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Toyopearl HW-55 Superfine was from Tosoh (Tokyo, Japan); Matrex gel red A (cross-linked 6% agarose with covalently coupled dye) was from Amicon Inc. (Beverly, MA). [35S]PAPS was prepared as described (25Delfert D.M. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chondroitin (squid skin) was prepared previously described (26Habuchi O. Miyata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate (bovine cornea) was generously gifted from Seikagaku. Partially desulfated dermatan sulfate was prepared from pig skin dermatan sulfate according to the method of Nagasawa et al. (27Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J. Biochem. 1995; 86: 1323-1329Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Solvolysis with dimethyl sulfoxide was carried out at 100 °C for 60 min. The degree of the desulfation was calculated as 83% from the proportion of ΔDi-0S to the total unsaturated disaccharides formed after chondroitinase ABC digestion. When the desulfated dermatan sulfate was digested with chondroitinase ACII, the yield of ΔDi-0S was only 5% of the total unsaturated disaccharides formed after chondroitinase ABC digestion (see Fig. 10, B and C). Chondroitin sulfate E (squid cartilage), which was eluted with 1.5 mNaCl from DEAE-Sephadex A-50, was prepared as described (28Habuchi O. Sugiura K. Kawai N. Suzuki S. J. Biol.

Volume of the medium was 10 ml. The medium in which the cells were plated consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium adjusted to pH 7.4 containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5 μg/ml insulin, and cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. The medium was changed every other day. When the cells grew to confluence, they were treated with Hanks' solution containing 0.1% trypsin and 0.1% collagenase, and replated to the 200 10-cm dishes at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/dish in the same medium. On day 6, the cells were grown to 5.2 × 106 cells/dish, and thereafter, the culture medium was replaced with Cosmedium-001. The culture of chondrosarcoma cells in Cosmedium-001 was continued for 4 days, and the spent culture medium was recovered on days 2 and 4. For determining the sulfotransferase activity contained in the cell layer, the cell layer was scraped in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 msucrose and 0.5% Triton X-100, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The resultant supernatant fraction was used as the cell layer extract. The culture of chondrosarcoma cells using 200 10-cm dishes described above was carried out three times. The spent medium was pooled and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. To the supernatant solution the following materials were added to final concentrations indicated: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 3 μm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 μmpepstatin A). The pooled medium containing these additives was designated the buffered medium fraction and stored at 4 °C until purification was started. All operations were performed at 4 °C. The buffered medium fraction prepared as above (4.7 liters obtained from 200 10-cm dishes) was applied to a column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (2.2 × 28 cm) equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol). The column was washed with 1000 ml of 0.15 mNaCl in buffer A. The absorbed materials were eluted with 1000 ml of buffer A containing 0.4 m NaCl. 10-ml fractions were collected. The heparin-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography was carried out three times, and the 0.4 m NaCl fractions were combined. Half of the combined fraction from Step 1 was applied to a Matrex gel red A column (2.2 × 9.5 cm) equilibrated with 0.4 m NaCl in buffer A. The column was eluted stepwise with 200 ml of buffer A containing 0.4 m NaCl, 200 ml of buffer A containing 0.75m NaCl, and 200 ml of buffer A containing 1 mguanidine hydrochloride. All C4ST activity was eluted in the 1m guanidine fractions. The fractions containing C4ST activity were pooled and dialyzed against 0.05 m NaCl in buffer A. Chromatography on Matrex gel red A was repeated once more, and dialyzed solution was combined. To the combined dialyzed solution 10% Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 2%. The dialyzed fraction from Step 2 containing 2% Triton X-100 was applied to a 3′,5′-ADP-agarose column (1.2 × 11 cm) equilibrated with modified buffer A containing 0.05 m NaCl. The composition of modified buffer A was the same as that of buffer A, except that the concentration of Triton X-100 was increased to 2%. The column was washed with 150 ml of the modified buffer A containing 0.05m NaCl. The sulfotransferase activity was eluted with 150 ml of modified buffer A containing 0.1 mm 3′,5′-ADP. The fractions containing sulfotransferase activity were pooled and applied to the second heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column. The fraction containing the sulfotransferase activity from Step 3 was applied to a column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (0.9 × 6.7 cm) equilibrated with 0.05 m NaCl in buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml of 0.05 m NaCl in buffer A. The absorbed sulfotransferase was eluted with 25 ml of buffer A containing 0.4m NaCl. The collected fraction was dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.05 m NaCl. The purified enzyme was stored at −20 °C. C4ST and C6ST activity were assayed by the method described previously (16Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.25 μg of protamine chloride, 0.1 μmol of dithiothreitol, 25 nmol (as glucuronic acid) of chondroitin, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (∼5.0 × 105 cpm), and enzyme in a final volume of 50 μl. For determining the activity for various glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin was replaced with 25 nmol (as galactosamine for chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and desulfated dermatan sulfate or as glucosamine for heparan sulfate, CDSNS-heparin, and keratan sulfate) of glycosaminoglycans. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. After the reaction was stopped, 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated by the precipitation with ethanol followed by gel chromatography with a fast desalting column as described previously, and radioactivity was determined. For determining C6ST and C4ST activity, 35S-labeled chondroitin was digested with chondroitinase ACII, and the radioactivity of unsaturated disaccharides (ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-6S) separated with paper chromatography was counted. The chondroitinase ACII-digested materials were also analyzed with HPLC using a Whatman Partisil 10-SAX column as described below. 1 unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount required to catalyze the transfer of 1 pmol of sulfate/min. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins in SDS was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions as described (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected by silver stain or Coomasie Brilliant Blue. A Toyopearl HW-55 column (1.4 × 99 cm) was equilibrated with a buffer containing 2 m NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol (buffer B). 0.8 ml of sample was applied to the column and eluted with buffer B. 1.2-ml fractions were collected. A Superdex 30 16/60 column was equilibrated with 0.2m NH4HCO3. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. 1-ml fractions were collected. On the analysis of the desulfated dermatan sulfate and chondroitinase ACII-digested desulfated dermatan sulfate, the eluates were monitored with absorption at 232 nm and with orcinol color reaction using glucuronic acid as a standard (30Brown A.H. Arch. Biochem. 1946; 11: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). Paper chromatography was performed on Toyo 51A paper using a solvent system, 1-butanol/acetic acid/1 m NH3(2:3:1, by volume). Regions containing unsaturated disaccharides on the paper chromatogram were visualized under a UV lamp and excised, and the radioactivity was determined. Separation of the degradation products formed from 35S-labeled chondroitin and35S-labeled desulfated dermatan sulfate after digestion with chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC was carried out by HPLC using a Whatman Partisil 10-SAX column (4.5 mm × 25 cm) equilibrated with 35 mm KH2PO4. The column was developed with gradient elution as shown in Fig. 7. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the column temperature was 40 °C. 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (31Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Protein assay reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad. The protein concentration of the second heparin-Sepharose CL-6B fraction was too low to be determined directly; therefore, samples were concentrated as described previously (16Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of 3′,5′-ADP-agarose fraction was not shown in Table I, because the high concentration of Triton X-100 in the 3′,5′-ADP-agarose fraction hampered the accurate determination of protein.Table IPurification of chondroitin 4-sulfotransferaseStepVolumeTotal activityaOne unit of activity is defined as 1 pmol/min sulfate transferred to position 4 of GalNAc in squid skin chondroitin under standard assay conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Total proteinSpecific activityPurificationml10−4 × unitsmg10−5 × units/mg-foldBuffered medium14,20029.79840.0031.0Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B95015.976.00.0217.0Matrex gel red A19513.939.80.03511.73′,5′-ADP-agarose613.8NDbND, not determined.NDNDSecond heparin-Sepharose CL-6B251.80.0315.81920a One unit of activity is defined as 1 pmol/min sulfate transferred to position 4 of GalNAc in squid skin chondroitin under standard assay conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows sulfotransferase activity contained in the spent culture medium and cell layer when chondrosarcoma cells were cultured in Cosmedium-001 for 10 days. The level of C4ST activity secreted to the serum-free medium was decreased rapidly. On day 4 in the serum-free medium, the activity of C4ST in the medium dropped to 48% of the initial activity. In contrast, C4ST activity retained in the cell layer was nearly constant during the whole culture period. The decrease in C4ST activity in the medium during the culture in the serum-free medium seems not to be caused by cell death or cell detachment from the dish, because the cellular protein increased gradually during 10-day culture in the serum-free medium. Unlike C6ST from the culture medium of chick chondrocytes (20Habuchi O. Tsuzuki M. Takeuchi I. Hara M. Matsui Y. Ashikari S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1133: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), secretion of C4ST was not stimulated by the addition of ascorbate to the serum-free medium (data not shown). When35S-labeled chondroitin formed after incubation with the spent medium or the extracts from the cell layer was separated with paper chromatography, small radioactivity was observed at the position of ΔDi-6S, but this radioactivity was not attributable to ΔDi-6S, because no radioactivity was detected at the retention time of ΔDi-6S when the chondroitinase ACII digests were separated with HPLC (Fig.2). The small peak observed at ∼23 min in HPLC has not been identified yet. C6ST activity thus could not be detected both in the culture medium and in the cell layer. C4ST was purified to apparent homogeneity ∼1900-fold over the specific activity of the pooled spent culture medium. TableI summarizes the purification of the sulfotransferases from 14.2 liters of the buffered medium fraction. As observed in most of glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase, C4ST was also absorbed to heparin-Sepharose CL-6B. A large volume of the buffered medium fraction was efficiently concentrated with the heparin-Sepharose CL-6B step. C4ST bound to Matrex gel red A was not eluted with 0.75 m NaCl and eluted with 1 mguanidine hydrochloride. At this step, C4ST was still stable in 1m guanidine hydrochloride. Stability of C4ST in 1m guanidine hydrochloride, however, decreased as the purity of the enzyme increased. Fig. 3 shows the elution pattern of sulfotransferase from 3′,5′-ADP-agarose. Unlike C6ST from the culture medium of chick chondrocytes, efficient absorption of C4ST to 3′,5′-ADP-agarose was achieved only in the presence of 2% Triton X-100. Because the high concentration of Triton X-100 disturbed further analysis of the purified C4ST, the concentration of the detergent was decreased to 0.1% during the second heparin-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. 3′,5′-ADP, which is a strong inhibitor of the sulfotransferase, was also removed from the purified sample after the second heparin-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. The final fraction was used for the later experiments as the purified C4ST fraction. The different purified fractions of C4ST were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and stained with silver nitrate stain (Fig.4, lanes 1–4). For the routine analysis of the purified C4ST with SDS-PAGE, we removed 2-mercaptoethanol from the sample buffer to avoid an artifact of silver staining. A broad protein band of 50 kDa was predominantly stained in the second heparin Sepharose CL-6B fraction, and a weaker protein band of 54 kDa was also detected (Fig. 4, lane 4). When the purified C4ST was treated with sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and stained with Coomasie Brilliant Blue, two protein bands of 60 and 64 kDa were detected (Fig. 4, lane 5). The protein bands of 50 and 54 kDa disappeared after N-glycanase digestion, and protein bands of 33 kDa as a major band and 35 kDa as a minor band appeared (Fig. 4, lane 7), indicating that the purified protein contained N-linked oligosaccharides. A protein band of 70 kDa also appeared after N-glycanase digestion (Fig. 4, lane 7). This protein band seems to be a dimer formed from the deglycosylated 35 kDa protein. To confirm that the protein bands observed in SDS-PAGE corresponded to C4ST, the purified C4ST was applied to a Toyopearl HW-55 column, and elution profiles of the C4ST activity and protein were determined (Fig.5). The protein bands of 50 and 54 kDa appeared almost exclusively when the peak fractions (tubes 43 and 44 in Fig. 5 A) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 B). The molecular mass of the peak fraction determined from the elution position in the Toyopearl HW-55 chromatography was 50 kDa, which agreed well with molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE. These results suggest that C4ST may behave as a monomer. A small part of C4ST activity was also observed around tubes 31–38 in the Toyopearl HW-55 chromatography (Fig. 5 A), but only the protein bands of 50 and 54 kDa were faintly detected in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). These observations suggest that C4ST may tend to aggregate as observed previously in chick C6ST (16Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Toyopearl HW-55 gel chromatography of chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase.

Other sulfhydryl compounds such as 2-mercaptoethanol and reduced glutathione also showed a stimulatory effect on C4ST activity (data not shown). Optimum pH was ∼7.2 (Fig. 6 B). The K mfor PAPS was 2.7 × 10−7m (Fig.6 C). C4ST was activated not only with protamine but also with various metal ions such as Ca2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+. When added at 5 mm, Ca2+ was most effective among these ions. Mg2+ was less effective. Co2+, which was activated C6ST (18Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura J. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was inhibitory. The purified C4ST was less stable than the purified C6ST from the culture medium of chick chondrocytes; after 4 months at −20 °C, the activity of the purified C4ST was decreased to ∼20% of the original activity. For determining acceptor specificity, the purified C4ST was incubated with different glycosaminoglycans in the presence of varying amounts of protamine chloride. Fig.7 shows that the purified C4ST was able to transfer sulfate to chondroitin and desulfated dermatan sulfate. Slight activity was observed when chondroitin sulfate A and chondroitin sulfate C were used as acceptors. Dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate E, heparan sulfate, and CDSNS-heparin did not serve as acceptors. Optimum protamine concentration was varied with the kind of glycosaminoglycans used as acceptors. The lowest optimum concentration was observed for chondroitin (Fig. 7). To determine"
https://openalex.org/W2023769806,"Many cell-free hemoglobin solutions designed as oxygen-carrying therapeutics produce a hypertensive effect in animals. The response is likely due to oxidation of nitric oxide by hemoglobin. Since the site of oxidation may lie outside the vascular compartment, we tested the hypothesis that polymerization of hemoglobin, rHb1.1, by glutaraldehyde would attenuate the hypertensive response. Two products of the cross-linking reaction were isolated, a glutaraldehyde-derivatized monomer (mono-glxrHb) and a glutaraldehyde cross-linked polymer (poly-glxrHb), and evaluated for their effects on systemic hemodynamics in conscious rats. Administration of rHb1.1 caused a mean arterial pressure elevation of approximately 20 mm Hg and an increase in total peripheral resistance of approximately 30%. Administration of mono-glxrHb induced changes in mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance that were significantly diminished relative to those observed with rHb1.1. Poly-glxrHb elicited a mean arterial pressure response that was further reduced compared with that obtained with mono-glxrHb and a change in vascular resistance that was the same as the response to mono-glxrHb. These results suggest that rHb peripheral vasoconstriction elicited by rHb1.1 is significantly attenuated by glutaraldehyde modification of the hemoglobin monomer and that the effect of glutaraldehyde polymerization is likely due to surface modification and/or intramolecular cross-linking, rather than an increase in molecular size. Many cell-free hemoglobin solutions designed as oxygen-carrying therapeutics produce a hypertensive effect in animals. The response is likely due to oxidation of nitric oxide by hemoglobin. Since the site of oxidation may lie outside the vascular compartment, we tested the hypothesis that polymerization of hemoglobin, rHb1.1, by glutaraldehyde would attenuate the hypertensive response. Two products of the cross-linking reaction were isolated, a glutaraldehyde-derivatized monomer (mono-glxrHb) and a glutaraldehyde cross-linked polymer (poly-glxrHb), and evaluated for their effects on systemic hemodynamics in conscious rats.

Hemoglobin-based Red Cell Substitutes. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1992Google Scholar)). Recombinant technology was employed to genetically cross-link the α-globins to form a di-α-globin and thereby prevent dissociation. In addition, theP 50 was increased by substitution of Lys for Asn at the β108 position. The resultant hemoglobin molecule, rHb1.1,1 is a stabilized pseudotetramer of 64 kDa with a P 50 of 32 mm Hg (8Looker D. Abbott-Brown D. Cozart P. Durfee S. Hoffman S. Mathews A.J. Miller-Roehrich J.

Solutions of rHb1.1 and other hemoglobins have been shown to have vasoactive properties (9Gulati A. Sharma A.C. Burhop K.E.

Nitric oxide (NO), an important mediator of vasodilation and other physiological processes (13Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar), is known to react rapidly with the oxyHb (14Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) forming metHb(Fe3+) and NO3− or to bind to deoxyHb, essentially scavenging the NO and causing vasoconstriction. Scavenging of NO by hemoglobin is thought to contribute to the hypertensive response observed with many cell-free hemoglobin solutions in intact animals (15Barve A. Sen A.P. Saxena P.R. Gulati A.

Pharmacol. 1994; 24: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that genetic modification of the distal heme pocket to reduce the rate of NO scavenging, measuredin vitro, can essentially eliminate the hemoglobin-induced pressor response (21Doherty D.H. Doyle M.P. Curry S.R. Vali R.J. Fattor T.J. Olson J.S. Lemon D.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although an interaction between cell-free hemoglobin and NO seems clear, the site at which NO scavenging occurs (e.g.intravascular or interstitial) is unknown. Several researchers have suggested that hemoglobin must leave the vascular space to cause constriction through an NO-mediated mechanism (22Abassi Z. Kotob S. Pieruzzi F. Abouassali M. Keiser H.R. Fratantoni J.C. Alayash A.I. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 603-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Gould S.A. Moss G.S. World J.

Direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is scant. However, larger polymerized hemoglobins are known to have longer vascular retention times (25DeVenuto F. Zegna A. J. Surg. Res. 1983; 34: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Keipert P. Minkowitz J. Chang T.M.S. Int. J. Artif. Organs. 1982; 5: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Sehgal L.R. Gould S.A. Rosen A.L. Sehgal H.L. Moss G.S. Surgery. 1984; 95: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they are less likely to leave the vascular space. Such findings indicate that it might be possible to decrease the vasoactive properties of hemoglobin by making the hemoglobin molecule larger, thereby preventing extravasation into the interstitium and blocking NO-induced oxidation. Glutaraldehyde polymerization of hemoglobin is well known and produces a multitude of cross-linked species, e.g. dimers, trimers, tetramers, and larger species (28MacDonald S.L. Pepper D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 287-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mixtures of these polymerized hemoglobins have been reported to exhibit minimal vascular responses (29Gould S.A. Sehgal L.R. Rosen A.L. Sehgal H.L. Moss G.S. Ann. Surg. 1990; 211: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but none of the glutaraldehyde-treated monomeric species have been purified to investigate their associated vasoactive properties. We tested the hypothesis that the size of rHb1.1 can have a direct impact on its hemodynamic properties. We report here results of a series of experiments in which we compared the hemodynamic responses of underivatized recombinant hemoglobin (rHb1.1) and glutaraldehyde-polymerized rHb1.1 (poly-glxrHb). To account for possible effects of intramolecular cross-linking and/or surface modification by glutaraldehyde without a change in size, we also examined the responses to glutaraldehyde-derivatized monomeric rHb1.1 (mono-glxrHb). Recombinant hemoglobin was produced at Somatogen as described by Looker et al. (8Looker D. Abbott-Brown D. Cozart P. Durfee S. Hoffman S. Mathews A.J. Miller-Roehrich J. Shoemaker S. Trimble S. Fermi G. Komiyama N.H. Nagai K. Stetler G.L. Nature. 1992; 356: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The hemoglobin was polymerized with glutaraldehyde (Sigma, grade I) according to the following methods. rHb1.1 (150 mg/ml in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mmsodium chloride) was deoxygenated in a 1-liter round-bottom flask by passing humidified nitrogen gas over the hemoglobin solution while mixing in a Rotovap (Brinkman Instruments) for 6 h at 10 °C. Following deoxygenation, the hemoglobin was capped with a white rubber septum, and a 10% solution of deoxygenated glutaraldehyde in deionized water was added to a final molar ratio of 8 mol of glutaraldehyde per mol of hemoglobin. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, deoxygenated sodium cyanoborohydride (126 mg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide was added to a final molar ratio of 10 mol of sodium cyanoborohydride per mol of glutaraldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The solution was diluted to 2 liters with buffer (5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 and 150 mm sodium chloride) and diafiltered with a Pellicon diafiltration system (Millipore) against 10 volumes of the same buffer. The solution was stored at −80 °C until purified by size exclusion chromatography. Polymerized hemoglobin was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography through a 7.5-liter Sephacryl S200 column followed by a 7.5-liter Sephacryl S300 column each equilibrated with 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The isolated monomeric rHb fractions from multiple chromatography runs were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of 200 ml using the Pellicon diafiltration apparatus. The oxidized hemoglobin was reduced by addition of sodium dithionite to deoxygenated mono-glxrHb until the methemoglobin concentration was <2%. Reaction by-products were removed by rechromatographing the solutions on the 7.5-liter Sephacryl S200 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.9, at 4 °C. Endotoxin was removed by rechromatographing the hemoglobin on a 500-ml Superose-Q ion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.9, at 4 °C. After loading, the column was washed with 2 volumes of loading buffer, and the hemoglobin was eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 6.5, at 4 °C. The purified mono-glxrHb and poly-glxrHb were each diafiltered against 10 volumes of 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and concentrated to 50 mg/ml. Aliquots were filtered through pyrogen free 0.2-μm filters (Gelman Sciences) and stored at −80 °C in 15-ml polypropylene tubes. The purified hemoglobins were analyzed for methemoglobin and endotoxin as described below. Methemoglobin was less than 10% and endotoxin was less than 1 e.u./ml. Deoxygenated rHb1.1 (145 mg/ml in 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 at 23 °C) was reacted with glutaraldehyde (preparation described previously) at a 7:1 molar ratio of glutaraldehyde:hemoglobin for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of sodium borohydride (152 mg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, at a 4:1 molar ratio borohydride:glutaraldehyde. The solution was incubated an additional 15 min at room temperature and then diafiltered against 15 volumes of deoxygenated 20 mm Tris, pH 9.0, at 8 °C. The glutaraldehyde-treated hemoglobin was applied to a Superose-Q ion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a ratio of 50 g of hemoglobin per 1 liter of resin. The column was washed with 2 volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 9, at 8 °C followed by 12 volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, at 8 °C. The poly1-glxrHb was eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 8 °C, diafiltered against 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and concentrated to 94 mg/ml. Aliquots were filtered through pyrogen-free 0.2-μm filters (Gelman Sciences) and stored at −80 °C in 15-ml polypropylene tubes. The purified hemoglobins were analyzed for methemoglobin and endotoxin as described below. Methemoglobin was less than 10% and endotoxin was less than 1 e.u./ml. Glutaraldehyde-polymerized hemoglobin with a molecular mass range between 200 and 1000 kDa was isolated from the reaction mixture used for preparing mono-glxrHb. The desired molecular mass range polymerized hemoglobin was isolated by size exclusion chromatography, reduced with dithionite, and endotoxin removed as described previously for the mono-glxrHb. Methemoglobin content in hemoglobin samples was determined using the method described by Evelyn and Malloy (30Evelyn K.A. Malloy H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1938; 126: 655Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Bacterial endotoxin content in hemoglobin samples was determined using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (Pyrotell Inc.). P 50 andn max were determined using a hemox analyzer as described by Hoffman et al. (31Hoffman S.J. Looker D.J. Roehrich J.M. Cozart P.E. Durfee S.L. Tedesco J.L. Stetler G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) at 37 °C and pH 7.40 in 50 mm HEPES (free acid) and 150 mm NaCl. Autooxidation rates of the hemoglobins were determined at 37 °C by the methods described by Brantleyet al. (32Brantley Jr., R.E. Smerdon S.J. Wilkinson A.J. Singleton E.W. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6995-7010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris·hydrochloride (pH 8.3 at 37 °C), 10 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 150 nm superoxide dismutase, 150 nm catalase, and equilibrated with 1 atm of oxygen. The hemoglobin concentration was 50 μm in heme. The rates of NO-induced oxidation were determined at 20 °C using stopped-flow rapid mixing techniques as described by Eich et al. (33Eich R.F. Li T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R. Aitken J.F. Mathews A.J. Johnson K.A. Smith R.D. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6976-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Briefly, hemoglobin (0.2–1 μm) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was mixed with a solution containing dissolved NO and the formation of metHb monitored at 402 nm. Tryptic mapping was performed as described by Lippincott et al. (34Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Analysis of purified hemoglobins from other batches demonstrated similar results (data not shown). SDS-PAGE was performed based on the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206971) Google Scholar). Aliquots (5 μg) were diluted with 2 volumes of SDS sample buffer (Novex Corp.) containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol and heated at 65 °C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on an 8–16% polyacrylamide gradient Tris·glycine gel for 2.5 h at 120 V. The gel was stained in Coomassie Blue and then destained with a solution of 40% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, and 50% water. Destained gels were digitized using an IS-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The molecular mass distribution of the glutaraldehyde cross-linked hemoglobin was monitored using high performance size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected in tandem with a Superose 6 column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) mounted on a HP1090 HPLC system (Hewlett-Packard) and equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8. The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. SEC molecular weight standards were obtained from Sigma. Samples were prepared by precipitation with ice-cold acid/acetone as described by Witkowska et al.(36Witkowska H.E. Bitsch F. Shackleton C.H.L. Hemoglobin. 1993; 17: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Lippincott et al. (34Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pellets were solubilized in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 20% acetonitrile at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Reverse phase HPLC analyses were performed using a Zorbax C3 analytical column (0.46 × 25 cm) mounted on an HP1090 HPLC system (Hewlett-Packard). The oven temperature was maintained at 40 °C. Solvent A is 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B is 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The column was equilibrated in 65% solvent A, 35% solvent B. Following sample injection the column was maintained at the starting conditions for 5 min and then ramped to 51% solvent A, 49% solvent B over 45 min. Mass spectrometry was performed as described by Lippincott et al. (34Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using a Finnigan Mat LCQ with an HP1090 HPLC on the front end to run reverse phase separations prior to analysis. Dynamic light scattering was performed using a Nicomp 370 Submicron Particle Sizer equipped with a 40-milliwatt HeNe laser. Data were collected and averaged over 10 min and analyzed using the C370 version 12 software program provided by Particle Sizing Systems (Santa Barbara, CA). Samples were passed through 0.2-μm filters prior to analysis. The oncotic pressures of hemoglobins used in this study were measured in vitrodirectly in a colloid osmometer (model 4420, Wescor, Logan, UT). The oncotic pressures were measured at the final hemoglobin concentrations used for injection into the animals. All surgical and experimental procedures were approved by the Somatogen Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, 250–350 g) were used for all experiments. The animals were chronically instrumented with pulsed Doppler flow probes on the ascending aorta for cardiac output measurement and with indwelling arterial and venous catheters as described previously (37Doyle M.P. Walker B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R1114-R1122PubMed Google Scholar) for blood pressure measurement and hemoglobin infusion. For all experiments, the animals were studied in a conscious, resting state. On the day of the experiment, each rat was placed in a Plexiglas experimental chamber that was of sufficient size (25 × 15 × 12.5 cm) to allow free movement. The chamber was flushed continuously with fresh air, and fresh bedding covered the chamber floor. The catheters and Doppler flow probe leads were fed through the top of the chamber, and both catheters were opened and flushed with sterile, heparinized saline. The arterial catheter was connected to a pressure transducer for arterial pressure measurement, and the venous catheter was connected to a syringe containing hemoglobin or human serum albumin (HSA, Baxter Healthcare Corp.). HSA was used as a negative control with the assumption that it does not consume NO. Since the molecular mass and concentration of HSA (66.5 kDa, 50 mg/ml) were virtually the same as those of rHb1.1 and mono-glxrHb, it served as a comparator for the mass and volume of protein solution administered. The flow probe leads were connected to a modified high velocity module (HVPD, Crystal Biotech, Northborough, MA) that was used in the autotracking mode at a pulse repetition frequency of 125 kHz to avoid detection of spurious, aliasing signals (38Gardiner S.M. Compton A.M. Bennett T. Hartley C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H448-H456PubMed Google Scholar). Arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output were continuously recorded at sampling frequency of 50 Hz using a Windaq data acquisition system (Dataq Instruments, Columbus, OH) and a 160-MHz Pentium computer (Compaq). After sufficient time for acclimatization to the experimental surroundings and recording of base-line data (generally 30–60 min), hemoglobin or HSA was infused at a rate of 0.5 ml/min until a dose of 350 mg/kg was administered (less than 3 min). Hemodynamic data were collected continuously for 90 min following completion of the infusion. At the end of the 90-min data collection period, phenylephrine (3 μg/ml) was infused at a rate of 6 μg/kg/min for 2 min to verify proper catheter placement and provide a qualitative indication of the vascular responsiveness of each animal. Data were collected for an additional 15 min. Animals that did not exhibit a brisk response to phenylephrine were not included in subsequent analysis (<5% occurrence). Each animal received only a single dose of hemoglobin or HSA. In order to determine the hemoglobin concentrations in plasma following administration and during the period of hemodynamic measurement, another set of rats was instrumented with venous catheters using the methods described above. After 2–3 days of recovery, the rHb1.1, mono-glxrHb, and poly-glxrHb were again administered to conscious rats by intravenous infusion (350 mg/kg, 0.5 ml/min). At time points of 0, 30, 60, 120 min post-administration, the animals were physically immobilized, and blood samples (0.3–0.4 ml) were obtained by tail vein transection. The blood was collected in heparinized tubes, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to obtain plasma samples. Hemoglobin concentration in the plasma was determined using the analytical technique of Tentori and Salvati (39Tentori L. Salvati A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Custom-designed software was used to process the raw hemodynamic data. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output values were determined by averaging data over 30-s intervals every 5 min prior to and for 30 min following hemoglobin administration. Thereafter, 30-s averages were obtained every 10 min until the end of the experiment. All data shown are mean ± S.E. Both mean arterial pressure and heart rate are expressed as the change from base line. Base-line values were calculated as the average of the data collected for 30 min prior to hemoglobin or HSA administration. Cardiac output is expressed as percent change from base line. Total peripheral resistance was calculated from mean arterial pressure and cardiac output and is also expressed as percent change from base line. To facilitate statistical comparisons of the hemodynamic responses to several molecules, the data from 10- to 90-min post-administration were averaged for each animal to obtain an “overall” response. The infusion generally required up to 3 min to complete, and the animals were frequently active for another 2–3 min. By 10 min post-infusion, the animals had returned to their control, resting state. Therefore, data from the 5-min time point were excluded from the overall response calculation to avoid potential inclusion of hemodynamic changes due to activity. The overall response data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. A monomeric and two polymeric glutaraldehyde-modified recombinant hemoglobins were prepared for testing in rat hemodynamic studies. The polymerization reactions were quenched with either cyanoborohydride or borohydride. Cyanoborohydride is a Schiff base-specific reducing agent (40Geoghegan K.F. Cabacungan J.C. Dixon H.B.F. Feeney R.E. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1981; 17: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and borohydride can reduce both Schiff bases and aldehydes (41March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1977Google Scholar). Both reducing agents were equally effective in quenching the reactions as analyzed by SEC (data not shown). The mono-glxrHb was purified from the polymer mixture by preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to 91% purity with the remainder being dimeric hemoglobin as assessed by analytical SEC (Fig. 1 B). The molecular mass of the mono-glxrHb fraction (TableI) based on comparison with globular protein standards corresponded to an apparent molecular mass of 51 kDa and a diameter of 8.6 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering. Purified rHb1.1 (molecular mass = 64.4 kDa) also showed an apparent mass of 51 kDa (Fig. 1 A) although its diameter was 7.3 nm, less than that observed for mono-glxrHb. Large scale purification of polymeric hemoglobin was accomplished using ion-exchange chromatography to fractionate the hemoglobin polymers. The majority of cross-linked hemoglobins greater than 1000 kDa flowed through the column at pH 9.0 and were discarded. Lowering the buffer pH to 7.6 caused elution of the monomeric hemoglobin along with some dimeric and trimeric hemoglobins which eluted over a number of column volumes (data not shown). An additional decrease in the buffer pH to 7.4 caused elution of the polymeric hemoglobin fraction of interest. The SEC profile of poly1-glxrHb is shown in Fig. 1 C. This fraction contained less than 1% as monomeric rHb, ∼7% dimeric rHb, and ∼15% trimeric rHb with the majority ranging from 200 to 1000 kDa (Table I). Approximately 14% of the polymers were greater than 1000 kDa. The apparent diameter was 15.8 nm as measured by dynamic light scatte"

The predicted protein sequence of the new isoform, designated a2, consists of 854 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 98,010 Da; it has approximately 50% identity to the original isoform (a1) we described (Peng, S.-B., Crider, B. P., Xie, X.-S., and Stone, D.K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 17262–17266). Sequence comparison indicates that the a2 isoform is the bovine homologue of a 116-kDa polypeptide identified in mouse as an immune regulatory factor (Lee, C.-K., Ghoshal, K., and Beaman, K.D. (1990) Mol. Immunol. 27, 1137–1144). The bovine a1 and a2 isoforms share strikingly similar structures with hydrophilic amino-terminal halves that are composed of more than 30% charged residues and hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal halves that contain 6–8 transmembrane regions. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that isoform a2 is highly expressed in lung, kidney, and spleen. To determine the possible role of the a2 isoform in vacuolar proton pump function, we purified from bovine lung a vacuolar pump proton channel (VO) containing isoform a2. This VO conducts bafilomycin-sensitive proton flow after reconstitution and acid activation, and supports proton pumping activity after assembly with the catalytic sector (V1) of vacuolar-type proton translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) and sub-58-kDa doublet, a 50–57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer required for V-ATPase function. These data indicate that the a2 isoform of the 116-kDa polypeptide functions as part of the proton channel of V-ATPases.

Vacuolar-type proton translocating ATPases (V-ATPases)1 are widely distributed in eukaryotic cells where they are found in most organelles. In addition, these proton pumps are localized to plasma membranes of epithelia, macrophages, and specialized polarized cells. V-ATPases have been shown to control osteoclast-mediated bone reabsorption and renal acidification and are thereby involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and the systemic acidosis of uremia (1Stone D.K. Xie X.S. Kidney Int. 1988; 33: 403-413Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Alpern R.A. Stone D.K. Rector F.C. Brenner B.M. Rector F.C. The Kidney.

Key to understanding the regulation of these diversely distributed proton pumps is a basic investigation of the structure of the enzymes and delineation of the roles of the individual subunits in pump function. The primary structures of V pump subunits, as well as the overall subunit composition and quartenary structures of the holoenzyme, are highly conserved through species as evolutionarily diverse as Archaebacteria, Caenorhabditis elegans, andHomo sapiens. In its simplest form, the V pump ofEnterococcus hirae is composed of 11 subunits, some of which are homologues of the subunits of the V-type proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles of bovine brain (4Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, V-ATPases resemble F1FO-type ATP synthases in that they are complex hetero-oligomers with two functional domains: an ATP-hydrolytic sector (V1 or VC) that is peripheral to the membrane, and a transmembranous proton channel (VO or VB). The V1 domain of the V pump of clathrin-coated vesicles consists of essential, core subunits of 70, 58, 40, 34, 33, 14, and 10 kDa, designated A, B, C, D, E, G, and F, respectively. In addition, a key regulatory element, the sub-58-kDa doublet (SFD), consists of polypeptides of 57 and 50 kDa, activates V1 and functionally couples ATP hydrolysis to proton flow through the transmembranous sector, VO (5Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 278: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Separation of V1 from VO results in marked changes in the functions of these two domains. Although native holoenzyme hydrolyzes MgATP at a rate 3-fold higher than CaATP, isolated V1 hydrolyzes ATP only in the presence of Ca2+; Mg2+, in fact, inhibits ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by V1 (7Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the proton channel, VO, is closed after separation from V1, and requires incubation at an acidic pH to restore proton flow, which is inhibitable by bafilomycin A1, a V-ATPase specific inhibitor (8Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the subunit composition of V1 is now well defined, there are conflicting reports regarding the components of VO. All investigators find a 17-kDa polypeptide (subunit c), as well as a 39-kDa subunit in VO preparations. In addition, the VO component of the proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles contains a 116-kDa polypeptide, and a polypeptide of this mass, or a smaller homologue, has been demonstrated in most V-pump preparations. The function of the 116-kDa subunit is not defined, but its predicted structure consists of 6–8 transmembranous sectors, suggesting that it may function similar to subunit a of FO. Additional structural complexity exists in V-ATPases in the form of subunit isoforms. Two forms of subunit A (9Puopolo K. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Subunit G, a recently identified subunit that is required for ATP hydrolysis, has two isoforms that differ in tissue distribution and function (14Crider B.P. Andersen P. White A.E. Zhou Z. Li X.

Most recently, we have demonstrated that the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides of SFD are isoforms resulting through alternative mRNA splicing (7Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, three forms of the c subunit of VO have been shown to be required for V-pump function in yeast (15Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anrakau Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The 116-kDa subunit of VO, the subject of this investigation, appears to have the greatest degree of isoform diversity of all V-pump components. This diversity arises through two mechanisms. First, alternative splicing of mRNA results in two forms of the subunit prevalent in brain (a1 isoform). This alternative splicing results in changes within a predicted protease sensitivity motif (PEST site, a region enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, or threonine residues), implying differences in the biological half lives of the two isoforms (16Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17262-17266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, higher organisms have separate genes that encode distinct isoforms of the 116-kDa subunit. In yeast, two such genes, designated VPH1 (20Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and STV1 (21Bauerle C. Ho M.-N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encode proteins with amino acid sequence homology to the mammalian 116-kDa polypeptide. Cumulative evidence suggests that three separate genes encode forms of the 116-kDa subunit in mammalian species. In addition to the a1 isoform of bovine brain, a related homologue has been identified in murine T cells, and a third form in human osteoclasts. Although interspecies comparison of primary sequence complicates this point, it is notable that the sequence divergence between these bovine, murine, and human forms of the 116-kDa subunit greatly exceeds the divergence observed in all other pump subunits. Moreover, recent experiments have demonstrated three distinct genes encoding 116-kDa isoforms in chicken. 2J. Mattsson, X. Li, S. B. Peng, P. Andersen, B. Crider, L. Lundberg, D. K. Stone, and D. Keeling, manuscript in preparation. Of these putative forms of the 116-kDa subunit, the isoform isolated from murine T cells has not been identified as a V pump component. In fact, the cDNA encoding this subunit was isolated by a strategy designed to identify novel immune regulatory factors. To investigate the function of this isoform and to determine its relationship to V pump function, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding this isoform of the 116-kDa subunit. It shares only 50% identity to the 116-kDa subunit of bovine brain that we described previously, but has 91.6% identity to the 116-kDa isoform of murine T cells. The two polypeptides have strikingly similar structure, with hydrophilic amino-terminal halves that are composed of >30% charged residues and hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal halves that contain 6–8 transmembrane regions. The new isoform, designated a2, copurifies with vacuolar proton channel from lung. Reconstitution experiments demonstrate that it is associated with functional VO, indicating that it is a genuine isoform of the 116-kDa subunit of V pumps.

Deoxyinosine (I) was used in the third position of some codons with a degeneracy of two or more. λZAP phage DNA from amplified bovine brain cDNA library was purified by standard procedure (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used as a template for PCR, which was performed with 20 pmol of each primer and 1 μg of purified λZAP DNA. PCR products of 0.3 kb were cloned into pCR 2.1 vector using a TA cloning kit from Invitrogen. The positive colonies from TA cloning were analyzed by DNA sequencing, and a 0.3-kb insert was excised with EcoRI digestion, purified by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis, and used to screen a bovine brain cDNA library. A bovine brain cDNA library in λZAP (insert size, >2.0 kb), transfected intoE. coli, XLI-Blue-MRF′, was screened with the 0.3-kb PCR product that had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation. Screening of 2 × 106 individual phages was performed using a double-lift procedure wherein plaques were transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes for 5 min in each lift. The membranes were prehybridized for at least 4 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS. Hybridization was performed at 50 °C overnight with the same solution plus labeled probe, which was added at a concentration of 5–10 × 105 cpm/ml of hybridization solution. The membranes were then washed for 15 min at room temperature first with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, then with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and finally for 30 min at 55 °C with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 24–48 h. Duplicate positive clones were cored and rescreened through one or more cycles until purified colonies were obtained. Inserts of all positive clones were excised and cloned into pBluescript with the helper phage R408, as described (10Peng S.-B. Zhang Y. Crider B.P. White A.E. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27778-27782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis, and DNA sequencing reactions were performed using a Model 377 ABI PRISM DNA sequencer and the manufacturer's reagents. All positive clones were sequenced in both orientations using M13 reverse, M13 (−21), and sequence-specific oligonucleotides as primers. DNA and protein data base analysis was performed using PC/GENE-based programs. Poly (A+) RNA (2 μg/lane) from different bovine tissues was denatured and fractionated by 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a Zeta-probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad). After baking at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h, the membrane was prehybridized for 4 h at 50 °C in a solution consisting of 50% formamide, 1.5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, and 0.5 mg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA. A 0.6-kb cDNA fragment encoding the NH2-terminal portion of isoform a2was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation and added to the hybridization solution at a concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml of solution. Hybridization was then carried out at 50 °C overnight. The membrane was sequentially washed for 15 min at room temperature with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, respectively. A final wash was carried out at 60 °C for 30 min with 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS, and autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 3–5 days. Isoform a1-specific (CVLRRQYLRRKHLGT) and a2-specific (CGTIPSFMNTIPTKET) peptides were synthesized based upon the deduced protein sequences, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and utilized for immunization of a New Zealand White rabbits to generate polyclonal antibodies, as described (23Peng S.-B.

The preparations of antibodies directed against the 70-kDa (subunit A) and 39-kDa subunits have been previously reported. For Western blot analysis, protein samples were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters. Immunodetection was performed using immune serum at a 1:5000 dilution and an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL Western blotting system. Microsomes were prepared from bovine lung by using the buffer solution and initial steps used to prepare clathrin-coated vesicles from bovine brain. Briefly, bovine lung (1 kg) was homogenized in a Waring blender in 2 liters of Buffer A, consisting of 100 mm MES (pH 6.5), 3 mm azide, 1 mmEGTA, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 1 h. The final crude, microsomal pellet was utilized for isolation of vacuolar proton pump and VO, as follows. Membrane pellet (5 ml) was resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A with 1% C12E9 (polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 180,000 ×g for 1 h, the resulting pellet was resuspended in Buffer A containing 1% sodium cholate. Centrifugation was repeated, and the final pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 1% Zwittergent 3–16, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant (3 ml) was loaded on two 13-ml, linear (15–30%) glycerol gradients prepared in Buffer G, consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05% C12E9, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 180,000 ×g for 22 h at 4 °C, fractions of 1 ml were harvested from the bottom of the tube, subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and proton pumping and/or proton channel activity analysis. For further purification, the peak fractions were combined, concentrated with a Millipore Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter unit, and separated by a second 15–30% glycerol gradient centrifugation that was performed as described above. Clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared from batches of 30 bovine brains, and V pump was solubilized with 1% C12E9 and purified to a specific activity of 14–16 μmol of Pi × mg protein−1 × min−1, as described (24Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V1 and SFD were prepared as reported (7Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol.

Reconstitutions of vacuolar proton pump and proton channel (VO) were performed by the freeze-thaw, cholate-dilution method using liposomes prepared from pure lipids. Stock solution of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol at a mass ratio of 4.32:2.76:0.2:2.7 were prepared as described (25Xie X.-S. Tsai S.-J. Stone D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8913-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Typically, 100 μl (0.5–0.8 mg of protein/ml) of purified proton pump or VO, was mixed with 3 mg of liposomes and 26 μl of reconstitution buffer consisting of 6% sodium cholate, 30% glycerol, 600 mm KCl, 6 μl of 600 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 mm MgCl2. The mixture was frozen in liquid N2 for 2 min and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Proteoliposomes were diluted with 6 ml of 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA (dilution buffer); concentrated by centrifugation at 110,000 × gfor 1 h at 15 °C; and then resuspended with 50 μl of dilution buffer for proton transport assays described below. Acid activation of the latent proton conductance of reconstituted VO was performed as described (5Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by incubation of 5 μl of proteoliposomes containing VO with 2 μl of 0.5 m MES (pH 5.0) for 1 h on ice. Proteoliposome acidification was assessed by the measurement of acridine orange quenching in an SLM-Amino DW2-C dual wavelength spectrophotometer as ΔA492–540 (24Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gluck S. Kelly S. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9230-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes containing proton pump or VO were diluted into 1.6 ml of assay buffer, consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium-Tricine (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 6 μm acridine orange. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (final concentration, 1.3 mm) and/or valinomycin (1 μm), and were terminated by the addition of 1.6 μg of the proton ionophore bis(hexafluoroacetonyl) acetone, as indicated in the legends to the figures. Holoenzyme was reassembled with 3 pmol each of V1, VO, and SFD, which were mixed with 280 μg of lipid and 10 mm MES. The mixture was then incubated overnight at room temperature. The reassembled holoenzyme was reconstituted into liposomes for assessment of proton pumping as described above. Two degenerate primers, designed to match two conserved regions of the 116-kDa subunits, were used in polymerase chain reactions to generate 0.3-kb DNA fragments from a bovine brain cDNA library, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The PCR products were cloned into pCR 2.1 vector using a commercial TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and 25 positive clones were selected and sequenced. Among them, two groups of DNA sequences were obtained. The sequences of the first group (23 clones) exactly matched the a1 isoform sequence we have described (17Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17262-17266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining two clones had sequences that were identical to one another, but they encoded a protein with a predicted amino acid sequence different from that of the a1 isoform of the 116-kDa polypeptide. The 0.3-kb insert from the second group of TA clones was used to screen a bovine brain cDNA library in λZAP. 2 × 106individual bacteriophages were screened, yielding six positive clones, designated B2-2, B9-1, B17-1, B26-1, B31-1, and B34-1. DNA sequencing demonstrated that clone B31-1 contained the full coding region, clone B2–2 lacked coding region for 9 amino acids at the 5′-end, and the other clones had inserts of 1.5–2.5 kb. All of the clones had identical sequences in overlapping regions. The full sequence of clone B31–1 includes a 2565-base pair open reading frame and untranslated regions of 174 and 1703 base pairs at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively Translation of the open reading frame of clone B31–1 predicts an 854-amino acid polypeptide with calculated molecular mass of 98,010 Da, which is close to the mass of 96,301 Da of isoform a1. Three potential N-glycosylation sites are present at residues 43, 157, and 505. The calculated isoelectric point is 5.89. This isoform shares 50% identity with the a1 isoform that we described previously (16Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1982; 157: 105-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) analysis reveals that the two isoforms have strikingly similar structures, with two characteristic domains: a hydrophilic amino-terminal half that is composed of more than 30% charged residues, and a highly conserved and hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal half that contains 6–8 transmembrane regions. Data base searches demonstrated that isoform a2 shares 91.6% identity at the amino acid level with mouse J6B7, a putative immune regulatory protein from T cells (19Lee C.-K. Ghoshal K. Beaman K.D. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). As shown, particularly high levels of conservation were observed in predicted transmembranous sectors. The tissue distribution of mRNA encoding the a2 isoform was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Although two transcripts of approximate sizes of 3.4 and 5.4 kb were detected in all tissues (brain, heart, kidney, lung, and spleen), the absolute and relative abundances differed between tissues. High levels of expression were found in the kidney, lung and spleen, whereas the brain had very low levels of a2 transcripts (Fig.2). To determine the relationship of the cloned cDNA to the 116-kDa component of vacuolar proton pump, we generated isoform a1-, and a2-specific, anti-peptide antibodies based on predicted amino acid sequence. As shown in Fig.3, lane 3, the a2-specific antibody reacts with a minor portion of the 116-kDa band of highly purified bovine brain vacuolar proton pump, indicating the presence of isoform a2 in V-ATPase complex. The same enzyme reacts heavily with isoform a1 specific, anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 3, lane 2). This suggests that isoform a1 is the major form and a2 is the minor form of the vacuolar proton pump in the brain, which is in good accord with the results of Northern blot analysis we obtained in this study (Fig. 2) and in previous investigations (17Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17262-17266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas these findings are highly suggestive that the a2 isoform is present in subpopulation V-type proton pumps in bovine brain, the co-purification of the a1and a2 isoforms precluded any direct investigation of whether the a2 isoform was associated with a functional proton pump. We therefore sought to find an alternative tissue source highly enriched in the a2 isoform. As demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in Fig. 2, mRNA for isoform a2is present in high copy number in lung. We therefore attempted to isolate proton pump from bovine lung using the solubilization and purification procedure we developed for the V-type proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles of bovine brain. Microsomes were prepared from freshly harvested bovine lung by homogenization and a differential centrifugation. For comparative purposes, freshly harvested bovine brain was processed identically. However, testing of V-pump activities in the two microsomal preparations revealed that the vesicles from lung had only 150 the specific activity of the vesicles from bovine brains, as assessed by ATP generated acridine orange quenching. To determine whether this relatively low activity was due to an intrinsic proteolysis of the pump from lung, we tested several different solutions for microsomal preparation. These included variances in pH from 6.5 to 7.5 and inclusion of proteinase inhibitors. The same results, however, were obtained. Moreover, C12E9, the detergent routinely utilized for the solubilization of the V pump of clathrin-coated vesicles, was ineffective in solubilizing bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity from lung microsomes. Numerous detergents were tested and we ultimately determined that the V-ATPase of lung was optimally solubilized with Zwittergent 3–16. Subsequently, purification of intact V pump was attempted by our standard protocol, which includes hydroxylapatite chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. Repeated attempts at purification, however, resulted in minuscule amounts of pump that migrated to the usual position in glycerol gradient centrifugation (data not shown).

Limited trypsinolysis and mutational analysis of recombinant Gαt/Gαi1 determined that two cysteines are the major fluorescent labeling sites, Cys210, located in the switch II region, and Cys347 at the C terminus. Mutants with serines replacing Cys210 (Chi6a) and Cys347 (Chi6b) were single fluorescently labeled with lucifer yellow (LY), while a double mutant (Chi6ab) was no longer labeled. When Chi6b was labeled with LY on Cys210, AlF4− caused a 220% increase in LY fluorescence, indicating that the fluorescent group at Cys210 is a reporter of conformational change in the switch II region. Chi6a labeled at Cys347 also showed an AlF4−-dependent increase in LY fluorescence (91%), indicating that Gα activation leads to a conformational change at the COOH terminus. Preactivation of the protein with AlF4− before labeling led to a decreased incorporation of LY into Cys347suggesting that Gα activation buries Cys347. This COOH-terminal conformational change may provide the structural basis for communication between the GDP-binding site on Gα and activated receptors, and may contribute to dissociation of activated Gα subunit from activated receptor.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are activated by seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors and relay signals to downstream effectors, including cellular enzymes and ion channels. Upon agonist binding, receptors become activated and in turn interact with G proteins and catalyze GDP release from G protein α subunits. After the release of GDP, the Gα subunit, together with Gβγ subunits, remains in a tight complex with the receptor, which dissociates when GTP binds to the empty Gα subunit. Both the GTP-bound Gα subunit and the Gβγ subunit complex are then capable of regulating a variety of effectors on the intracellular face of the plasma membrane. The binding of Gα and Gβγ subunits is restored when the intrinsic GTPase activity in the Gα subunit hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP.In order to have a reliable method for studying the conformational changes in G proteins, we developed a fluorescent monitor because fluorescence is easily detectable and responsive to local environmental change. Cysteines are highly reactive and can be labeled with a variety of Cys-directed fluorescent groups. We determined the cysteines that are accessible to sulfhydryl-specific fluorescence labeling on Gα subunits and characterized the fluorescence changes on Gα when different sites are labeled. We replaced those accessible cysteines with serine to make a functionally cysteineless mutant in which to place additional cysteines at sites where we would like to monitor conformational changes or interaction with other proteins.To study structural changes in Gαt upon its activation, we used the functional derivative of Gαt, Gαt/Gαi1 chimera (Chi6) in which residues 216–294 of Gαt were replaced with the corresponding residues 220–298 from Gαi1. Chi6 can be conveniently expressed in Escherichia coli, and it was shown to have a similar rate of rhodopsin-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange as Gαt does, implying that its receptor and Gβγ binding properties are Gαt-like (1Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Chi6 in complex with Gβ1γ1 has been solved and revealed an identical geometry with wild type, native Gαt (2Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). High expression levels of this protein inE. coli provided us milligram amounts of pure protein for biochemical and fluorescent studies as well as ease in constructing Gα mutants.Lucifer yellow, an environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe, was selected because it is a good reporter of local changes. We previously used this probe as a reporter of the binding of the inhibitory subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase to Gαt(3Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Eight cysteines were found by cDNA sequencing of αt (5Yatsunami K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4316-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In 1988, by using125I-N-(3-indo-4-azidophenylpropionamido-S-(2-thiopyridyl)cysteine (125I-ACTP),1 a cross-linking reagent, Dhanasekaran et al. (6Dhanasekaran N. Wessling-Resnick M. Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17942-17950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Cys210 and Cys347 were the major reactive cysteines. Here, we show that the major labeling sites for LY are located on Cys210 and Cys347 in Gαt/Gαi chimeras. Also, we show that single labeling at either Cys210 or Cys347 can be used to report the local conformational changes around the labeled sites. As expected, Cys210 in the switch II region reports an AlF4−-dependent activating conformational change. Unexpectedly, there is also an AlF4−-dependent conformational change at Cys347, which may be important for allosteric communication between receptor binding and GDP-binding sites on the molecule.DISCUSSIONKnowledge of the functional structure of heterotrimeric G proteins has been greatly advanced with the solution of the crystal structure of all their subunits (2Lambright D.G.

Thus, other biochemical or biophysical methods are needed to further define the structural features of this region and understand its role in mediating receptor interaction and receptor induction of GDP release.In this report, we have developed an approach of sensitive real-time monitoring of the structural changes in Gα using targeted fluorescent labeling of single surface-exposed cysteine residues. Our studies have identified the labeling sites of LY on Gαt/Gαi1 chimera (Chi6), characterized each labeled protein and, most importantly, shown the existence of a previously unsuspected conformational change in the COOH terminus of Gα upon activation.The existence of two negative charges in LY and the mild conditions used for labeling Chi6 with LY allowed us to resolve differently modified proteins by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2). The labeling sites on Gα identified in this report, Cys210and Cys347, confirms the studies of Dhanasekaran et al. (6Dhanasekaran N. Wessling-Resnick M. Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17942-17950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who found that Cys347 is highly accessible and Cys210 is partially accessible to 125I-ACTP, when this cross-linking reagent was used to label Gαt.All mutants were properly folded and functional as judged by several criteria: first, all mutants had an increased Trp fluorescence upon addition of AlF4− indicating that they all have GDP bound and undergo conformational changes. Second, all mutants activated with AlF4− had similar affinity to Pγ when compared with Chi6 (1Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which was in the range of 1 μm. Third, the cleavage patterns of tryptic digestion were identical in Chi6 and Chi6a and therefore it can be concluded the mutant chimeras were properly folded during expression.Our data clearly show that LY at Cys210 is a reporter of conformational change of the switch II region. The fluorescence of LY attached to Cys210 (Chi6a-LY) increases significantly (220%) in the presence of AlF4−. However, the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of Cys210-LY (Chi6b-LY) under similar conditions underwent only 1.2% change, which is much less than 50% change in Trp fluorescence for the unlabeled mutant. But Chi6b-LY protein does indeed undergo switch II region conformational change upon binding of AlF4− as judged by acquisition of high affinity for Pγ. An explanation for a decreased Trp fluorescence change in Cys210-LY may be that the fluorescent group at Cys210 increases local hydrophobicity in the environment of Trp207 that causes an increase in Trp fluorescence in the GDP-bound state of Gα. Upon addition of AlF4−, switch II moves and adopts the conformation of active Gα subunit, as Trp207 does. However, the increased hydrophobicity of Trp207 in the new environment is not much more than that created by the LY group, so that it does not result in a regular change of intrinsic fluorescence.The solvent-accessible surface area of Cys210 decreased 68.6% in the activated form of Gαt. This calculation matches well with our finding that the labeling efficiency at Cys210 dropped 77.8% in the presence of AlF4−. Thus, Cys210 of Chi6b becomes partially protected from LY labeling in the presence of AlF4−, reflecting these changes in accessibility. The method is thus clearly useful for monitoring known conformational changes.The conformational changes seen at the COOH terminus of Gα are the first indications that the GTP-dependent or activation-dependent conformational switch may extend to this region of the molecule. Several facts support the existence of those environmental changes around the COOH terminus. First, the fluorescence of LY at Cys347-LY (Chi6a-LY) increases by more than 91% in the presence of AlF4− and can be reversed by 10 mm EDTA. There is no nonspecific interaction between LY and AlF4− since in the presence of free LY, no fluorescence change was observed by addition of sodium fluoride and AlCl3 (data not shown). Second, the efficiency of Cys347 labeling with LY for Chi6a is significantly reduced with addition of AlF4−, suggesting that surface exposure and reactivity of this residue is decreased as a result of protein activation. To test whether a fluorescent tag on a cysteine in a part of the molecule that is known to have no conformation change upon activation, Chi6ab, with both reactive cysteines changed to serines, was mutated to replace Val301 with cysteine. There was no AlF4−-dependent fluorescent change in the resultant mutant, Chi6ab-Cys301-LY (data not shown). Thus the fluorescence change is not seen in regions known not to change conformation. Third, these effects are very similar to those we observed for Cys210 in Chi6b, which is an indicator of the known conformational change of switch II region. Thus, we can conclude that it is likely that a change in conformation does exist at or near the COOH terminus of Gα upon activation or more precisely in the GDP-AlF4− form. The comparison of the kinetics of fluorescence changes monitored by LY to the fluorescent changes monitored by Trp207 for Chi6a-LY upon addition of AlF4− shows that they have similar time course (Fig. 4 C). This analysis implies that the structural change at the COOH terminus is rate limited by the relatively slow movement of the switch II region upon binding of AlF4−. Dhanasekaran et al.(1988) also proposed that conformational changes could be transmitted between domains containing Cys347 and Cys210 in Gαt because the photoactivation of the phenylazide moiety of 125I-ACTP labeled at Cys347 caused an insertion to the 12-kDa fragment (residues Arg204-Arg310), which contains Cys210. Our data suggest that LY-bound Cys347is in a more hydrophobic environment in GDP-AlF4− than in the GDP-bound Gα. Another observation is the Cys347 is the major labeling site for Chi6 and the labeling of Cys347 reduces the labeling efficiency of Cys210, which confirms the result suggested in 125I-ACTP labeling study (6Dhanasekaran N. Wessling-Resnick M. Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17942-17950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads us to speculate that the COOH terminus of Gα does not interact with the α2/β4 loop in Gα-GDP form, but in the active conformation the α2/β4 loop and COOH terminus of Gα move closer.What is the nature of this COOH-terminal conformational change? According to the crystal structure of Gα-GTPγS (12Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), in two out of three molecules in the asymmetric unit, the final eight residues are disordered and not visible while in a third molecule, the COOH-terminal residues 343–349 of Gαt can be seen. The residues 343–349 make van der Waals contacts with residues 212–215 of the α2/β4 loop. It is not clear whether this is a crystal packing artifact or an indication of one possible orientation of the COOH terminus.In Gαt, Asn343 is the last residue that is consistently seen. It is ∼10 Å from the α2/β4 loop which is part of Switch II. Two possibilities exist: 1) the conformation of the COOH-terminal region changes upon activation, 2) the COOH terminus itself does not undergo a conformational change, but its environment changes. For example, the disordered COOH-terminal region including Cys347 is close to the α2/β4 loop and in the active conformation a binding pocket for the COOH terminus opens up near the switch II region such that Cys347 becomes more buried. In either case, the protection from fluorescent labeling by preactivation, and the activation-dependent fluorescent change indicates an important communication between the GDP binding pocket and the COOH terminus of the protein.The COOH-terminal conformational change that was detected in this study is of significant interest because of the implications for receptor interaction mechanisms. The COOH terminus of Gα is known to be a key determinant of the fidelity of receptor activation (19West Jr., R.E. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lui T. Lin T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14428-14430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since known receptor-binding regions on Gα are distant from the GDP-binding site, it is likely that an allosteric mechanism triggers GDP release (24Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It appears from a number of studies that mutations at the COOH terminus of Gα proteins can both regulate specific receptor interaction and affect GDP affinity (24Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P.

These data suggest that the COOH terminus may be a key relay for communication between the activated receptor and the GDP binding pocket. The activation-dependent conformational change reported here thus suggests specific regulation of receptor affinity by the status of the guanine nucleotide bound in the binding pocket. It is known that when receptor, ligand, and G protein are bound, GDP release leads to a high affinity “ternary complex” which only slowly dissociates without guanine nucleotide binding (33Iyengar R.

It is possible that an activation-dependent conformational change at the COOH terminus of Gα might lead to a lowered receptor affinity and dissociation from the ternary complex. Currently, it is thought that dissociation of activated G protein from receptor is secondary to the GTP-dependent dissociation of Gα from Gβγ. This concept has not been rigorously tested, however. Future studies will test the notion that the COOH-terminal conformational change after GTP binding is a component of G protein dissociation from an activated receptor.Site-specific Cys-directed fluorescent groups could be reporters for conformation changes in various regions of Gα. For example, they could probe conformational changes in other regions of the Gα subunit like the NH2 terminus, which was not resolved in crystal structures of either the free Gα GDP form (11Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) or the GTPγS form (12Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 14Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Also, they could be used to monitor protein-protein interaction, such as Gα interaction with receptors, Gβγ, and effectors. Future studies will explore these possibilities. Heterotrimeric G proteins are activated by seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors and relay signals to downstream effectors, including cellular enzymes and ion channels. Upon agonist binding, receptors become activated and in turn interact with G proteins and catalyze GDP release from G protein α subunits. After the release of GDP, the Gα subunit, together with Gβγ subunits, remains in a tight complex with the receptor, which dissociates when GTP binds to the empty Gα subunit. Both the GTP-bound Gα subunit and the Gβγ subunit complex are then capable of regulating a variety of effectors on the intracellular face of the plasma membrane. The binding of Gα and Gβγ subunits is restored when the intrinsic GTPase activity in the Gα subunit hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP. In order to have a reliable method for studying the conformational changes in G proteins, we developed a fluorescent monitor because fluorescence is easily detectable and responsive to local environmental change. Cysteines are highly reactive and can be labeled with a variety of Cys-directed fluorescent groups. We determined the cysteines that are accessible to sulfhydryl-specific fluorescence labeling on Gα subunits and characterized the fluorescence changes on Gα when different sites are labeled. We replaced those accessible cysteines with serine to make a functionally cysteineless mutant in which to place additional cysteines at sites where we would like to monitor conformational changes or interaction with other proteins. To study structural changes in Gαt upon its activation, we used the functional derivative of Gαt, Gαt/Gαi1 chimera (Chi6) in which residues 216–294 of Gαt were replaced with the corresponding residues 220–298 from Gαi1. Chi6 can be conveniently expressed in Escherichia coli, and it was shown to have a similar rate of rhodopsin-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange as Gαt does, implying that its receptor and Gβγ binding properties are Gαt-like (1Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Chi6 in complex with Gβ1γ1 has been solved and revealed an identical geometry with wild type, native Gαt (2Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). High expression levels of this protein inE. coli provided us milligram amounts of pure protein for biochemical and fluorescent studies as well as ease in constructing Gα mutants. Lucifer yellow, an environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe, was selected because it is a good reporter of local changes. We previously used this probe as a reporter of the binding of the inhibitory subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase to Gαt(3Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ho and Fung (4Ho Y.-K. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol.

Eight cysteines were found by cDNA sequencing of αt (5Yatsunami K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4316-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In 1988, by using125I-N-(3-indo-4-azidophenylpropionamido-S-(2-thiopyridyl)cysteine (125I-ACTP),1 a cross-linking reagent, Dhanasekaran et al. (6Dhanasekaran N. Wessling-Resnick M. Kelleher D.J.

Here, we show that the major labeling sites for LY are located on Cys210 and Cys347 in Gαt/Gαi chimeras. Also, we show that single labeling at either Cys210 or Cys347 can be used to report the local conformational changes around the labeled sites. As expected, Cys210 in the switch II region reports an AlF4−-dependent activating conformational change. Unexpectedly, there is also an AlF4−-dependent conformational change at Cys347, which may be important for allosteric communication between receptor binding and GDP-binding sites on the molecule.

We have used this information to generate artificial proteoglycans containing the extracellular domain of the cell adhesion protein lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3) (CD58) and CD44 motifs modified with CS or a combination of CS and HS.

In addition, the glycosaminoglycan-modified artificial proteoglycan is capable of binding the chemokine RANTES (regulated uponactivation, normally T cellexpressed and secreted) and delivering it to human T cells, resulting in enhanced T cell activation. These data demonstrate that artificial proteoglycans can be engineered with functional domains that have enhanced activity by codelivering glycosaminoglycan-binding molecules. The artificial proteoglycans were also used as a model system to explore the glycosaminoglycan binding properties of basic-fibroblast growth factor and the chemokine RANTES.

Van Seventer G.A. Siraganian R. Wahl L. Shaw S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2457-2463PubMed Google Scholar). The exons encoding the CD44 gene can be variably spliced to give rise to multiple protein isoforms (13Jackson D.G. Buckley J. Bell J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4732-4739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis R.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of these CD44 isoforms can be tissue-specific, developmentally regulated, and/or regulated by cell activation. Most of these isoforms arise from the variable splicing of exons encoding polypeptide fragments located in the extracellular region of CD44, downstream of the hyaluronan binding domain (16Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The function of these variably spliced domains is largely unexplored; however, a number of interesting observations have been made. For example, it has been shown in a rat model of tumor metastasis, that a previously nonmetastatic cell line can be rendered aggressively metastatic following the overexpression of CD44 variants containing variably spliced exon V6 (17Arch R. Wirth K. Hofmann M. Ponta H. Matzku S. Herrlich P. Zoller M. Science. 1992; 257: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 18Günthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zöller M. Haußmann I.

It has also been shown that changes in the pattern of glycosylation of CD44 resulting from the addition of variably spliced exons, which are modified extensively withO-linked carbohydrates, can modulate the hyaluronan binding activity of CD44 (19Bennett K.L.

In addition, different CD44 isoforms are modified with different glycosaminoglycan (GAG)1 polymers, including HS (21Brown T.A. Bouchard T. St. John T. Wayner E. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).

Today. 1993; 14: 111-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that HS-modified CD44 isoforms may play a role in the binding and presentation of HS-binding chemokines (26Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). We and others had reported previously that CD44 isoforms containing variably spliced exon V3 are modified with HS (21Brown T.A. Bouchard T. St. John T. Wayner E. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These studies were extended to show that the HS is added to the SGSG motif in CD44 exon V3. This site can also be modified with CS. We showed that CS is added to at least one of the SG motifs located in CD44 exon E5. In addition, we identified sequences in exon V3 required for HS assembly (see accompanying paper (46Greenfield B. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Piepkorn M. Wolff E.A. Aruffo A. Bennett K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2511-2517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). HS assembly was supported in exon E5 when eight amino acids from exon V3 were inserted into exon E5. This ability to introduce a HS assembly site into a protein led to the idea that recombinant artificial proteoglycans could be created to deliver heparin-binding proteins to sites of interest. We generated such artificial proteoglycans and used a model of T cell costimulation to analyze their activity. T cells are activated through the T cell receptor by foreign antigens presented by antigen presenting cells in the context of major histocompatibility complex. However, this signal alone is not sufficient to induce a proliferative activation response. Accessory molecules expressed on the surface of T cells (such as CD2) provide a requisite second signal (costimulation signal) by binding to their respective ligands on antigen presenting cells, resulting in T cell activation and proliferation (29Kanner S.B. Damle N.K. Blake J. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2023-2029PubMed Google Scholar, 30Van Seventer G.A. Newman W. Shimizu Y. Nutman T.B. Tanaka Y. Horgan K.J. Gopal T.V. Ennis E. O'Sullivan D. Grey H. Shaw S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The T cell molecule CD2 binds to lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3), which is expressed on antigen presenting cells, including B cells, memory T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. The combination of an antigen binding to the T cell receptor and ligation of LFA-3 to CD2 on the T cell surface results in costimulation and subsequent proliferation of T cells. The stimulation of T cells can also be augmented by the presence of growth factors or chemokines (31Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhao X.M. Byrd V.M. McKeehan W.L. Reich M.B. Miller G.G. Thomas J.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3904-3911PubMed Google Scholar). We designed a recombinant artificial proteoglycan with dual costimulatory activity. The dual activity stems from LFA-3 (which binds CD2 on T cells) and from GAG-modified CD44 exon V3 (which binds growth factors and chemokines). This artificial proteoglycan provides a system to study the interaction of growth factors and chemokines with GAGs and ultimately can be used as a means of directing the levels and types of chemokines and growth factors to induce a particular physiological effect. In this manuscript, we characterize the functional domains of this artificial proteoglycan and use it as a test system to extend our knowledge regarding the GAG binding characteristics of the chemokine RANTES. In addition, we demonstrate the in vitro activity of the artificial proteoglycan in a model of T cell activation. The LFA-3-Rg construct has been described previously (29Kanner S.B. Damle N.K.

Samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, heated for 10 min at 95 °C in sample buffer containing SDS with β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed on 8–16% Tris/glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Gels were fixed, soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and then analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).

Goat anti-sera specific for b-FGF or RANTES (R & D Systems) at 1 μg/ml was incubated for 1 h, followed by donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 1:10,000 for 1 h. Chromogen-Substrate solution (Genetic Systems Corp., Seattle, WA) was added to the wells for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.0 nH2SO4, and the ratio of the absorbance at 450–630 nm was read. Inhibition of b-FGF or RANTES binding was tested by treating LFA-3/V3wt-Rg-coated wells with heparitinase or chondroitin ABC lyase (ICN) at concentrations of 0.07 unit/ml and 3.3 units/ml, respectively (in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm NaOAc and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8), 1 h at 43 °C, before proceeding with the assay as described above. Results are expressed as the mean value of triplicate wells ± S.D. The tetanus toxoid-reactive human T cell (Th1) clone, H1.2, and theDermatophagoides pteronyssinus-reactive human T cell (Th2) clone, 2DP.21, were tested for their ability to proliferate in the presence of recombinant human RANTES (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) in the presence or absence of immobilized anti-CD3 mAb and/or LFA-3/V3wt-Rg or LFA-3-Rg alone (31Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar). These clones have been shown previously to be chemokine-reactive by their ability to induce migration and facilitate adhesion to endothelial cells and extracellular matrix proteins. 2D. Taub, unpublished data. These clones were stimulated at 2-week intervals with either tetanus toxoid (10 μg/ml) or D. pteronyssinus (1:100 dilution), and autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (irradiated at 1500 rads) were added to the culture as feeder cells. The T cell clones were only utilized in proliferation studies upon resting and were found to be free of contaminating feeder cells. Ninety-six well microtiter plates were coated 24 h in advance with either control mouse IgG or anti-CD3 mAb (10 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of LFA-3/V3wt-Rg or LFA-3-Rg (10 μg/ml) in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.9. After incubation, the plates were blocked by adding 200 μl of culture medium to each well and then incubating the plates for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Again, after incubation, the plates were gently washed (four times) with culture medium until the pH was approximately 7.2. Recombinant human RANTES diluted in culture medium was then added to the coated plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. (The C-C chemokine, RANTES, was purchased from PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ. Endotoxin levels were performed on each lot of chemokine used in these studies using a Limulus Lysate assay and were found to possess <0.1 ng of lipopolysaccharide/ml of chemokine.) Control wells containing culture medium in place of RANTES were incubated in the same manner. The plates were then gently washed with culture medium. Purified human T cell clones were placed at 2 × 104 cells/well on the coated plates and then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, the plates were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for an additional 18–24 h. The plates were then harvested and counted on a liquid scintillation counter. The results are expressed as the mean number of counts/min ± S.D. All of the costimulation experiments were performed blinded. Proteoglycans such as CD44 capture, concentrate, and present GAG-binding proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, to specialized receptors. Via this mechanism, proteoglycans play a key role in regulating the activity of these GAG-binding proteins. Therefore, the ability to generate artificial proteoglycans would result in a novel class of recombinant proteins, which could be used to direct the activity of GAG-binding proteins in vitroand in vivo. In the accompanying paper (46Greenfield B. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Piepkorn M. Wolff E.A. Aruffo A. Bennett K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2511-2517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that a Rg fusion protein containing CD44 exon V3 supports CS and HS assembly and that the proteoglycan is able to bind b-FGF. We also showed that CD44 exon E5 only supports CS assembly. In addition, it was shown that the GAG assembly specificity of exon V3 and E5 could be manipulated by exchanging the eight amino acids that followed the SGSG sequence in CD44 exon V3 with the eight amino acids that followed the first SG sequence in exon E5. Using the knowledge of the sequence requirement that determines the specificity of GAG assembly, we decided to test whether we could generate artificial proteoglycans with a GAG-modified CD44 motif for delivering growth factors and chemokines. We initiated our investigation on the preparation of artificial proteoglycans by generating an LFA-3 (CD58) recombinant fusion protein. LFA-3 was chosen for two reasons: first, it is a very well characterized single chain type I membrane protein; and second, it is a ligand for the T cell antigen CD2 and has an easily measurable costimulatory activity. The binding of a monoclonal antibody directed to CD3 (which is complexed with the T cell receptor) mimics antigen binding in the context of major histocompatibility complex to the T cell surface and induces proliferation of the T cells. This, in combination with the ligation of LFA-3 to CD2, results in costimulation and enhanced proliferation of T cells (29Kanner S.B. Damle N.K. Blake J. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2023-2029PubMed Google Scholar). The chemokine RANTES is also capable of providing a costimulatory signal in combination with anti-CD3 antibody, which results in enhanced T cell proliferation (31Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar). The interactions between these T cell signaling molecules and their natural ligands are represented in Fig.1 A. A model of the corresponding signaling pathways, which could be activated by an artificial proteoglycan consisting of LFA-3 combined with GAG-modified CD44 (indicated by V3wt), is shown in Fig.1 B. To generate a GAG-modified LFA-3 Rg fusion protein, the sequence coding for CD44 exon V3 (wild type) was placed between the LFA-3 extracellular domain and the Rg domain, thereby creating LFA-3/V3wt-Rg (Fig. 2). Analysis of the GAG modification on LFA-3/V3wt-Rg is shown in Fig.3, left panel. Digestion with a combination of heparitinase and chondroitin ABC lyase is required for GAG removal (apparent molecular mass 100–220 kDa), indicating that this proteoglycan is modified with both CS and HS. Retention of a small amount of the radiolabel is observed and is due to keratan sulfate and possibly other oligosaccharide modification of the CD44 (33Piepkorn M. Hovingh P. Bennett K.L. Aruffo A. Linker A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Figure 3Left panel, the chimeric LFA-3 protein containing CD44 exon V3 is modified with CS and HS. Right panel, the LFA-3 protein containing CD44 mutant V3 exon,V3E5/8aa, is modified with CS. [35S]NaHSO4-labeled LFA-3/V3wt-Rg or LFA-3/V3E5/8aa-Rg protein was recovered from the supernatant of COS cell transfectants, purified, and divided equally into four aliquots. One aliquot was left untreated, and the others were digested for 1 h with heparitinase, chondroitin ABC lyase, or with both enzymes. The proteins were then resolved by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by radiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we explored the possibility of generating an artificial proteoglycan, which was modified with CS but not HS. This was done by constructing a chimeric gene containing a sequence encoding the CD44 V3 exon with the eight amino acids derived from CD44 exon E5, which is modified with only CS (V3E5/8aa, see accompanying paper (46Greenfield B. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Piepkorn M. Wolff E.A. Aruffo A. Bennett K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2511-2517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). The resulting fusion protein, LFA-3/V3E5/8aa-Rg (Fig. 2), is modified exclusively with CS (Fig. 3, right panel). These findings demonstrate that inclusion of the CD44 derived V3E5/8aa domain results in a CS-modified proteoglycan. We further analyzed the activity of the GAG-modified LFA-3 artificial proteogycan by studying its ability to bind growth factors and chemokines. The binding activities of various growth factors and chemokines to heparin and heparan sulfate have been explored extensively (22Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 25Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Shaw S. Immunol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In particular, the binding of RANTES to intact extracellular matrix has been shown to be mediated by HS (37Gilat D. Hershkoviz R. Mekori Y.A. Vlodavsky I. Lider O. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of b-FGF and RANTES to bind the artificial proteoglycan LFA-3/V3wt-Rg (modified with HS and CS) or an LFA-3-Rg control (not modified with HS or CS) was examined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4 A, b-FGF binds to LFA-3/V3wt-Rg in a concentration-dependent manner and does not bind to LFA-3-Rg. The binding to LFA-3/V3wt-Rg is abolished by pretreatment with heparitinase but not chondroitin ABC lyase (Fig. 4 B), indicating the binding of b-FGF is mediated by HS and not CS. The chemokine RANTES was also tested for binding to the artificial proteoglycans. Like b-FGF, RANTES shows binding to LFA-3/V3wt-Rg and not to LFA-3-Rg (Fig.5 A). However, a different and unexpected pattern of binding emerged when RANTES was tested with enzyme-treated LFA-3/V3wt-Rg. Neither heparitinase nor chondroitin ABC lyase treatment alone reduces RANTES binding; however, a combination of the two enzymes eliminates binding to the GAG-modified protein (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that while b-FGF binds only HS-modified CD44, RANTES is capable of binding both CS- and HS-modified CD44. The binding of a monoclonal antibody directed to CD3 (which is complexed with the T cell receptor) mimics antigen binding on the T cell surface, and in combination with the ligation of LFA-3 to CD2, results in costimulation and subsequent proliferation of the T cells (29Kanner S.B. Damle N.K. Blake J. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2023-2029PubMed Google Scholar). This experimental model was used to test whether inclusion of the CD44-V3 domain and its GAG modification altered the CD2 binding and costimulatory properties of LFA-3. The ability of LFA-3/V3wt-Rg to drive Th1 and Th2 cell proliferation in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb showed that inclusion of the CD44-derived sequences and GAG modification does not affect the ability of the LFA-3 moiety to bind CD2 and engage its costimulatory function (Fig.6). The above experiments demonstrate that a recombinant artificial proteoglycan can be generated with two independent functional domains. Next we tested whether the two domains can act in concert to enhance a biological activity. Studies have demonstrated that soluble chemokines exert a costimulatory effect on T cell activation and proliferation if added in combination with the proper T cell stimulus (31Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the chemokine RANTES is capable of stimulating human T cell proliferation in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb. To further test the artificial proteoglycan, we examined the costimulatory effects of RANTES bound to LFA-3/V3wt-Rg on Th1 or Th2 cell clones using plates coated with anti-CD3 mAb and either LFA-3/V3wt-Rg or LFA-3-Rg. The cultures were examined 72 h later to assess effects on cell proliferation. In these studies, RANTES was incubated for 2 h on precoated plates and then washed to remove nonbound chemokine before adding T cell clones. Thus, the responses observed in these studies are only examining the presentation of RANTES by the ligands bound to the plate. Parallel samples with and without RANTES were tested, and the difference in signal given by the samples with RANTES over that of the corresponding controls without RANTES is shown in Fig.7. These results demonstrate that the chemokine RANTES induces an increase in proliferation in response to immobilized LFA-3/V3wt-Rg and anti-CD3 mAb, as compared with LFA-3-Rg and anti-CD3 mAb. These data show that it is possible to make artificial proteoglycans with multiple functional domains and that their activity is enhanced by codelivering biologically active GAG binding molecules. In the accompanying paper (46Greenfield B. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Piepkorn M. Wolff E.A. Aruffo A. Bennett K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2511-2517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we showed that a recombinant form of CD44 exon V3 alone could be expressed as a HS- and CS-modified proteoglycan. In contrast, a mutant form of this exon, in which the eight residues located downstream of the SGSG site were replaced with those located downstream of the first SG site in exon E5 (V3E5/8aa), was modified with only CS. These observations led us to examine whether we could generate artificial proteoglycans containing both CS and HS or CS only. We designed artificial proteoglycans by preparing chimeric proteins containing CD44 exon V3, which would be modified with HS and CS, or proteins containing the mutant CD44 exon V3E5/8aa, which would be modified with only CS. The LFA-3/V3wt-Rg and LFA-3/V3E5/8aa-Rg constructs reported in this study provide examples of these artificial proteoglycans. In these examples, the chimeric protein has three functional domains. The amino-terminal domain is a receptor-targeting domain, LFA-3, which binds to CD2. The second domain contains the GAG polymer (either HS and CS in the V3wt-containing protein or CS in the V3E5/8aa-containing protein). The third domain is an immunoglobulin constant region, which binds to molecules known to interact with the constant region of human IgG1. We were concerned that the inclusion of the GAG-modified domain would perturb the function of the other polypeptides in the chimera, and thus we examined in detail the functional properties of each of the domains of LFA-3/V3wt-Rg. All of the domains of this artificial proteoglycan function as expected. The CD44-V3 domain is modified with HS and CS and is capable of binding b-FGF and RANTES. The LFA-3 domain is capable of engaging CD2 and triggering a costimulatory signal, and the immunoglobulin domain binds anti-IgG1 antibodies and protein A (allowing for a simple method of purification). The generation of artificial proteoglycans provided a system for studying the binding of growth factors and chemokines to GAGs and led us to the finding that the chemokine RANTES binds CS. The ability of RANTES to bind CS has broad implications with respect to the identity of proteoglycans responsible for chemokine presentation. Chemokines participate in the regulation of immune responses by acting as chemoattractants and activators of leukocytes. The recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation requires the formation and maintenance of chemokine gradients, which are achieved by the interaction of chemokines with proteoglycans. The capture of chemokines by endothelial proteoglycans provides the mechanism to concentrate and present chemokines in biologically active form to the signaling receptors of passing leukocytes (22Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 24Gilat D. Cahalon L. Hershkoviz R. Lider O. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 16-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Shaw S. Immunol.

One of the proteoglycans proposed to participate in this process is CD44. The standard CD44 isoform (CD44H) contains no variably spiced exons and is modified with CS but not HS (28Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). CD44H is expressed by resting and activated lymphocytes and activated endothelial cells. In this study, we show that CD44 modified with CS alone is capable of binding and presenting the chemokine RANTES but not the HS-binding growth factor b-FGF. On the other hand, CD44 isoforms containing variably spliced exon V3, which are expressed by activated monocytes, dendritic cells, and keratinocytes, are modified with HS and CS and are capable of binding both RANTES and b-FGF. These findings indicate that the alternative splicing of CD44 provides a molecular mechanism for CD44 to function as an immune regulator, by determining which growth factors and/or chemokines are localized and presented. The ability of CS-modified CD44 to bind RANTES indicates that CS-modified proteoglycans play an important role in adding diversity to the process of chemokine binding and presentation. There is evidence to suggest that CS-modified proteoglycans are more abundant than HS-modified proteoglycans (39Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellen L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and, as such, may play a dominant role in chemokine activity. The artificial proteoglycan LFA-3/V3wt-Rg was tested for its ability to deliver the chemokine RANTES and enhance the biological activity of the targeting domain. Soluble chemokines have been shown to exert a costimulatory effect on T cell activation and proliferation if added in combination with the proper T cell stimulus (31Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in proliferation of T cell clones was observed when RANTES was added to LFA-3/V3wt-Rg and anti-CD3 mAb-coated plates as compared with immobilized LFA-3-Rg and anti-CD3 mAb. In addition, human T cells exhibited potent chemotaxis in response to C-C chemokines immobilized on LFA-3/V3wt-Rg-, but not LFA-3-Rg-, coated polycarbonate filters (data not shown), strongly supporting the presentation ability of our recombinant CD44 construct. Taken together, these data demonstrate that artificial proteoglycans can be engineered such that the biological activity of the targeting domain can be enhanced by delivering GAG-binding molecules. We attempted to generate an artificial proteoglycan by placing the eight aa located downstream of the SGSG in CD44 exon V3 downstream of a natural SG site in a polypeptide typically not modified with GAG chains. These studies were performed with LFA-3, which contains a single SG and does not normally support GAG assembly. The placement of the eight amino acids (IDDDEDFI) from CD44 exon V3 downstream of the SG site in LFA-3 did not result in CS and/or HS assembly. 3B. Greenfield, unpublished observations. This supports the notion that the enzymes responsible for GAG assembly recognize the SG site to be modified in a three-dimensional context. This is consistent with the observations that not all SG sites support GAG assembly. Such a structural requirement for GAG assembly has been observed in the analysis of decorin (41Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to generate artificial proteoglycans was attractive in light of recent evidence which indicates that proteoglycans play an important role in regulating the activity of GAG binding molecules, including growth factors and chemokines (42Goldstein L.A. Zhou D.F. Picker L.S. Minty C.N. Bargatze R.F. Ding J.F. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1989; 56: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This regulatory function is mediated in part by the ability of proteoglycans to bind multiple copies of GAG-binding proteins, prolonging their high local concentration, and increasing the likelihood that they will encounter, bind, and drive the oligomerization of their specific signaling receptors. There is also evidence that some GAG-binding proteins, upon interaction with GAGs, induce dimerization of their receptors, potentially changing their conformation, creating a more favorable environment for ligand driven receptor signaling (43Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bashkin P. Fuks Z. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, there appears to be a significant level of specificity in the interaction between GAG-binding proteins and GAGs. For example, certain HS-binding proteins can bind only to a subset of HS-modified proteoglycans (44Jacobsson K.-G. Lindahl U. Horner A.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This specificity is thought to be driven by HS heterogeneity arising from distinct levels of sulfation, disaccharide composition, and chain length (45Lindahl U. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin and Heparan Sulphate Proteoglycans: An Overview. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 159-189Google Scholar). Differences between the abilities of GAG-binding proteins to bind CS or HS also impart specificity to interactions with proteoglycans, as shown by the comparison of b-FGF and RANTES binding to CD44. Thus artificial proteoglycans containing targeting domains and/or functional domains can be used to manipulate the levels, types, and activity of GAG-binding proteins in vitro and in vivo. In addition, artificial proteoglycans provide a convenient in vitro system to study the binding relationships between GAGs and the proteins with which they interact.

Partensky F. Van Der Staay G.W. Garcia-Fernandez M. Börner T. Vaulot D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11126-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), but the biochemical characteristics and the intracellular localization of this pigment have not been investigated. The spectral properties of PBP are due to bilins, linear tetrapyrroles covalently linked to specific cysteinyl residues of the polypeptidic chains by means of one (or less frequently two) thioether bonds. Due to differences in PBP bilin composition, light may be efficiently collected from the blue-green edge to the red part of the visible light spectrum. Moreover, the light absorption properties of the different tetrapyrroles are modulated by molecular interactions with the apoprotein chains in monomers (αβ), in oligomers, and with the specific linker polypeptides. In prokaryotic organisms (cyanobacteria and Prochlorophyta), the genes for the apoproteins of the two polypeptide chains of a given biliprotein are polycistronic that can be transcribed with genes for specific linker polypeptides as well as for subunits of lyases for chromophore linkage. Cotranscription of the two genes encoding apoproteins is always observed (1Bryant D.A. Bogorad L. Vasil I.K. Cell Culture and Somatic Cell Genetics of Plants. 7B. Academic Press, New York1991: 257-300Google Scholar, 6Grossman A.R. Shaefer M.R. Chiang G.G. Collier J.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 725-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sidler W. Bryant D.A.

Rev. 1993; 104: 119-189Crossref Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic Rhodophyta, the PBS apoproteins are encoded by the chloroplast genome, but linkers of the outer PBP (for instance PE linkers, when this pigment present) are nuclear-encoded (19Egelhoff T. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3339-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Apt K.E. Hoffman N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol.

Data from Cryptophyta showed that the β-subunit of the unique PBP is chloroplast-encoded (22Reith M. Douglas S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas the α-subunit is specified by the nucleus (23Jenkins J. Hiller R.G. Speirs J. Godovac-Zimmermann J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or by the residual nucleus of the first eukaryotic red algal symbiont, the so-called nucleomorph (as proposed in Ref. 9Sidler W. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 139-216Crossref Google Scholar). During the past 10 years, high resolution crystallographic data have been obtained for representatives of the major groups of phycobiliproteins mentioned above (PC, PEC, PE, and APC). To date, no detailed crystallographic data have been published on cryptophytan biliproteins. For each of the phycobiliproteins, details of the structural interactions between the α- and β-subunits have been delineated (24Schirmer T. Bode W. Huber R. Sidler W. Zuber H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 262: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Such interactions are essential for assembly of αβ monomers and of the higher order (αβ)3 trimers and (αβ)6 hexamers. It has generally been assumed that phycobiliproteins cannot be assembled from only one type (α or β) of subunit. We describe here an unusual biliprotein belonging to the PE family from the unicellular red alga Rhodella reticulata strain R6. This unique PE, in association with C-PC and APC, forms phycobilisomes similar to the hemidiscoidal type found in cyanobacteria and in some unicellular Rhodophyta. This PE can be purified as hexamers and dodecamers containing only β-type subunits, which are stabilized by unusually large, colorless, linker polypeptides (60 and 87 kDa, respectively) specified by the nuclear genome. Moreover, we show that the β-subunit is encoded by a monocistronic chloroplast gene, interrupted by two large intronic sequences, one of which is related to a typical group II intron. R. reticulatastrain R6 (Rhodella grisea (Geitler) Fresnel et al. (32Fresnel J. Billard C. Hindak F. Pekàrkova B. Plant Syst. Evol. 1989; 164: 253-262Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) was collected in 1983 by C. Billard (Caen University France) from seawater samples from Sarasota Bay, FL, and kindly provided by C. Billard. Two other closely related strains were obtained from the UTEX collection: R. reticulata Deason (UTEX LB 2320) and Dixoniella grisea (Geitler) Scott et al. (UTEX LB2615) (as R. reticulata Deason) for comparison. The two last strains were independent isolates from the U. S. All strains were grown on Erdschreiber liquid medium (33Starr A.R. J. Phycol. 1978; 14 (suppl.): 47-100Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar) in Erlenmeyer flasks, bubbled with sterile water-saturated air, and exposed to 50 μmol photons m−2s−1 of cool fluorescent light under a 16/8 light-dark cycle. Phycobilisomes were isolated by modifications of the procedure of Yamanaka et al. (34Yamanaka G. Glazer A.N. Williams R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8303-8310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, exponentially growing cells from 1 liter of culture were collected by centrifugation (4,500 × g, 10 min, Kontron A8.24 rotor), rinsed twice with potassium/sodium phosphate buffer 0.75 m, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine (buffer I), resuspended in 40 ml of the same buffer, dispersed with a Thoma homogenizer, and submitted to a French press treatment (Aminco Corp.) operating at 12,000 p.s.i. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in solution in isopropyl alcohol (1 mm final concentration) and Triton X-100 (5% w/v) were added to the broken cells, and incubation with stirring was for 45 min at room temperature. The cell lysate was centrifuged (27,000 ×g, 15 min. 15 °C, Kontron A8.24 rotor). The pellet and the upper “cream” were discarded while 3% Triton (w/v) was added to the intermediate blue-violet layer, rapidly mixed, and layered (6 ml) onto a 0.25 to 1 m discontinuous sucrose gradient in buffer I with 6-ml fractions of 0.25, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75- and 1m sucrose and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 16 h 12 °C, Beckman SW 28 rotor). The intact PBS fraction corresponding to >95% of the total pigments was collected in the 0.625 m sucrose layer and used for subsequent analysis, whereas small aggregates (<5% total pigments) banded in the 0.25 to 0.5 m sucrose layers. PBS dissociation was achieved as described for Rhodella violacea (35Mörschel E. Koller K.P. Wehrmeyer W. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 125: 43-51Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with modifications. The PBS fraction was diluted 1:3 with buffer I and pelleted by centrifugation (210,000 ×g, 6 h, 4 °C, Beckman Ti60 rotor). The pellet was dissolved in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer II) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Inhibitors of protease activity (1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added at all experimental steps. The dialysate was layered onto a linear sucrose density gradient (5–20% sucrose, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7, 10% glycerol) and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 15 h, 4 °C, Beckman Ti60 rotor). Pigment aggregates banded in two main fractions and were collected with a syringe; the upper third was blue-colored (fraction A), and the lower two-thirds were pink-violet (fraction B). A small pellet was also collected, but its composition was found similar to fraction B. Fractions A and B were dialyzed separately against potassium phosphate buffer (5 mm, pH 7) containing 10% glycerol (v/v) (buffer III), and each fraction was subjected to chromatography on a column (16 × 250 mm) of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated with buffer II. The columns were developed with a potassium phosphate linear gradient (5–150 mm, 120 ml each) including 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors at the same concentration as above, and 10% glycerol at 4 °C in the dark (36Yu M.H. Glazer A.N. Williams R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pigment complexes from each major elution peak were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation (160,000 ×g, 15 h, Kontron TFT70 rotor) and resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer II. Aliquots (4 ml) were then loaded onto linear sucrose density gradients (5–20% sucrose w/v in buffer III; total volume, 26 ml) and centrifuged (160,000 × g, 16 h 30, 4 °C, Kontron TFT70 rotor). The trimeric aggregates of blue pigments (PC and APC) were collected from the middle third of the gradient, whereas larger aggregates with pink-violet PE were in the lower third. Pure fractions of PE, as judged by their electrophoretic composition were concentrated by centrifugation after 2-fold dilution with buffer II (160,000 × g, 16 h 30, 4 °C, Kontron TFT70 rotor), and the pellets solubilized in a minimal volume of buffer II were used for characterization of the two forms of PE (see below). The pure PE-containing fraction was subjected to centrifugation (260,000 ×g, 24 h, 4 °C, Beckman SW41 rotor) on a linear sucrose density gradient (5–20% sucrose w/v in buffer III). Proteins of known molecular mass: catalase (240 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) were used as standards. The gradient was then fractionated using a Isco 185 density gradient fractionator. The absorbance of fractions (180 μl each) was measured at 550 and 280 nm. The apparent molecular weight of pigment aggregates were calculated according to Martin and Ames (37Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two forms of PE, associated, respectively, with two different colorless polypeptides (PE-LR60 and PE-LR87), were thus separated. Absorption spectra were recorded on a DW2 Aminco spectrophotometer. 77 K fluorescence emission spectra were obtained with a F3010 Hitachi spectrofluorometer equipped with a Dewar device. Bilin quantitation was made with samples denatured in 9 m urea at pH 2, using the millimolar extinction coefficients of 53.7 and 0 mm−1cm−1 for phycoerythrobilin at 550 and 662 nm, respectively, and 6.0 and 35.4 mm−1cm−1 for phycocyanobilin at the same wavelengths (38Glazer A.N. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 291-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Aliquots (100–200 μg) of proteins in buffer II were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v final concentration), and pellets were dissolved in 70 μl of 70% formic acid (v/v) in water and, after complete solubilization, CNBr crystals were added (39Judd R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reaction vessel was flushed with gaseous N2 and sealed. The reaction was carried out overnight at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of 630 μl of H2O, and the samples were lyophilized. Control samples were subjected to the formic acid treatment alone. LiDS-PAGE was performed on protein aliquots (20–100 μg) after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) on 9–18% acrylamide gradient gels (40Garnier F. Dubacq J.P. Thomas J.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the resolution of low molecular weight polypeptides after CNBr cleavage, the Tris-Tricine system (41Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) was used as described previously (40Garnier F. Dubacq J.P. Thomas J.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the visualization of chromophore-bearing peptides, the gels were soaked in 20 mmzinc acetate for 5 min (42Berkelman T.R. Lagarias J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The fluorescent zinc-bilin complexes were visualized at 312 nm with a transilluminator (Vilbert Lourmat France). After electrophoresis, the peptides were stained in situ by Coomassie Blue G-250 (0.1% in 9% acetic acid, 45% methanol) and destained (7.5% acetic acid, 30% methanol) before blotting onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by a liquid transfer system (TE, Hoefer, San Francisco) with Tris (50 mm) borate (50 mm) in 10% methanol as electrophoresis buffer and a constant current of 6 mA for 2 h at room temperature. After transfer, the peptides were stained with Amido Black (0.1% w/v) in methanol/acetic acid (10:2%), and excess stain was removed (45% methanol, 7% acetic acid), then 90:7% for 5 s. Sequence analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems 473 A sequencer at the Laboratoire de Microséquençage des Proteines, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. Total DNA from R. reticulata R6 was isolated by procedures described for chromophyte algae (43Passaquet C. Lichtlé C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) except the two CsCl density gradients were adjusted to 1.570 g/cm3 to separate plastid and mitochondrial DNA from nuclear DNA. Plastid DNA libraries were constructed by respectively ligating DNA digests with EcoRI or PstI into EcoRI or PstI cloning sites in pTZ18. Standard methods (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) were used for Southern blotting and in situ colony hybridization using randomly labeled probes. Two heterologous probes were prepared from R. violacea DNA by PCR using four synthetic oligonucleotides designed from the R. violacea rpeB gene sequence (45Bernard C. Thomas J.C. Mazel D. Mousseau A. Castets A.M. Tandeau de Marsac N. Dubacq J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as follows: oligonucleotide I, 5′ATGCTAGATGCATTTTCAAGA3′; oligonucleotide II, 3′TAATCCGTTTAAACATCTGTCTTC5′; oligonucleotide III, 5′ATGGCTGCTTGCTTACGTGACGGA3′; and oligonucleotide IV, 3′TAAAGCTACAACAGAAGCTTTCAT5′. PCR amplification was done withR. violacea plastid DNA (0.5 mg, one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C, 55 and 72 °C for 45 s for each step and one final elongation cycle for 5 min) using Tfi polymerase (Promega Corp. Madison, WI). PCR products obtained corresponding to 679 (probe I) or 189 (probe II) base pairs using the I and II coupled oligonucleotides and III and IV, respectively, were used in Southern or library heterologous hybridizations. The DNA sequences of both strands were determined by the dideoxyribonucleotide chain termination method using the Sequenase 2.0 system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [α-33P]dATP with double-stranded DNA. Total RNA was isolated as described for cyanobacteria (46Mazel D. Guglielmi G. Houmard J. Sidler W. Bryant D.A. Tandeau de Marsac N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8279-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). RNA (5 μg) was electrophoresed in 1.2% denaturing agarose gels in HF buffer (0.5m Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, 16% formaldehyde) and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was at 42 °C with probes as described under “Results.” To sequence cDNA in the junction between the exons and introns, we performed coupled reverse transcription and PCR amplification; R. reticulata R6 total RNA (5 mg) was used with 0.02 pmol of strict oligonucleotides (see “Results”: rpeB gene cloning and sequencing), 400 units of reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 20 nmol of each dNTP and 20 units of RNasin (Promega). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C and then inhibited for 5 min at 95 °C. Amplification was performed on the retrotranscription product using a second complementary oligonucleotide as forward primer and the first one as reverse primer. The PCR protocol was the same as above. Primer extension was performed for mapping of the 5′ terminus of the rpe mRNA using a strictly complementary 24-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (from nt 1468 to 1441): 5′TCCGTCCCTTAAACAGGCGGCCAT3′. 30 μg of total RNA from anR. reticulata R6 exponential culture were used in the primer extension method described by Sambrook et al. (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) modified as in Richaud and Zabulon (47Richaud C. Zabulon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11736-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After ethanol precipitation, the sample was loaded on a sequencing gel together with a sequence standard (pTZ18) in a parallel lane to determine the size of the hybrid. After release of R. reticulata R6 phycobilisomes by Triton X-100 treatment of cell lysates, they were recovered from the 0.625 msucrose layer. They exhibited characteristic absorption features of PEB- and PCB- containing biliproteins (Fig.1) with a single peak at 562 nm originating from the PEB-containing putative phycoerythrin while absorption maxima at 612 and 650 nm (as a shoulder) were attributed to phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, respectively. No shoulder was observed in the 495 nm region, indicating the probable absence of PUB-type chromophores. The 77 K fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 1) exhibited a main peak at 685 nm from the terminal energy acceptors of the phycobilisome and minor peaks at 629 and 651 nm and a 660 nm shoulder. The 651-nm fluorescence peak and the 660 nm shoulder were attributable to uncoupled phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, respectively, but it was not possible before further subfractionation of the main biliproteins to determine the origin of the 629-nm fluorescence peak. We determined the R. reticulata R6 PBS polypeptide composition by LiDS-PAGE (Fig. 2,lane 7). The main biliprotein subunits were in the 15–20-kDa range, the LCM was at 95 kDa, and three linkers were 87, 60, and 30 kDa apparent molecular mass, respectively (Fig. 2,lane 7). After zinc acetate treatment, only the biliprotein subunits and the LCM appeared fluorescent (Fig. 2,lane 8) under UV excitation. The three linker polypeptides (87, 60 and 30 kDa) were clearly non-chromophorylated. We verified, by labeling experiments of PBS polypeptides in the presence of chloroplastic and cytoplasmic ribosomal translational inhibitors (chloramphenicol and cycloheximide, respectively) as described previously for R. violacea (21Bernard C. Etienne A.L. Thomas J.C. J. Phycol. 1996; 32: 265-271Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), that all the polypeptides of the R. reticulata R6 PBS were chloroplast-encoded. Synthesis of the two PE colorless linkers was blocked by cycloheximide but not by chloramphenicol and therefore are nuclear-encoded (data not shown) as typically is the case for PE linkers in red algae (19Egelhoff T. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3339-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Apt K.E. Hoffman N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16208-16215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bernard C. Etienne A.L. Thomas J.C. J. Phycol. 1996; 32: 265-271Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The R. reticulata R6 phycobilisome subcomponents were resolved after gentle dissociation of purified intact particles. Two main fractions were obtained in continuous sucrose gradients. The upper layer (fraction A) contained trimeric aggregates of C-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin and also a minor PE component of low molecular weight (data not shown). The lower part (fraction B) was largely enriched in phycoerythrin but also contained LRC-PC complexes and a LCM-APC complex (see below). Upon DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the fraction B, three main components were eluted (Fig. 3) with increasing phosphate concentration (35, 65, and 110 mm respectively). The two first peaks were identified as the LCM-APC and LRC-PC complexes and the third one as a PE-like pigment. The different fractions were pelleted separately, and the final step of PC and PE purification was carried out by ultracentrifugation on linear (5–20%) sucrose density gradients (data not shown). Electrophoretic data confirmed the purity of the LRC-PC fraction (Fig. 2,lane 1), and in the PE fraction, two non-chromophoric linkers of 87- and 60-kDa apparent molecular mass (Fig. 2, lanes 2–6) were found in addition to the PE subunits in the 20-kDa range. Surprisingly, as previously mentioned, the two PE linkers were clearly non-chromophorylated (Fig. 2, lane 8). Two distinct complexes of PE (PE I and PE II) were successfully resolved by sedimentation through a linear sucrose density gradient (Fig. 4, lower panel). Based on a calibration of the sucrose density gradient with proteins of known molecular weight, PE I was determined to be 184 kDa and PE II to be 300 kDa. The 60-kDa linker (LR60) was found in PE I and the 87-kDa linker (LR87) in PE II. Consequently, these complexes have designated PE-LR60 and PE-LR87, respectively. The spectral characteristics of the PC and PE pigments were analyzed. The data clearly showed that PC is a C-phycocyanin type, with α- and β-subunits bearing phycocyanobilin chromophores with an absorption maximum at 622 nm and 77 K fluorescence emission at 651 nm (not shown). PE I and PE II pigments were indistinguishable with respect to their spectral properties with absorption maxima at 562 and 604 nm, respectively (Fig. 5). When denatured in acidic 9 m urea, the protein absorption maxima were shifted to 550 and 662 nm (data not shown), demonstrating that the 562-nm peak in the native pigment originated from phycoerythrobilin and the 604-nm peak from phycocyanobilin chromophores, with a PEB/PCB molar ratio of 1.9. The 77 K fluorescence emission peak at 630 nm (Fig. 5) clearly arises from the phycocyanobilin chromophore of PE. Thus, we ascribe the 629 nm peak in the 77 K PBS fluorescence emission spectrum in Fig. 1 to uncoupled phycoerythrin. Because of two types of chromophores linked to the subunits of R. reticulata R6 PE, we examined the chromophore composition of each putative subunit (α and β). Pure PE I and PE II fractions were separately denatured by acidic 2 m urea and submitted to weak cation exchange chromatography on Bio-Rex 70. In each case, a single colored fraction was eluted with 9 m urea (data not shown). No pigmented polypeptides were obtained with 8 murea. CNBr chemical cleavage was performed on the 9 m urea Bio-Rex fraction. The electrophoretic pattern of cleavage products is shown in Fig. 6. All peptides were chromophore-linked (Fig. 6), and their amino-terminal sequences were determined. The main fragments (6 and 4 kDa) gave the amino sequences MAACLRD and MKASSVA, respectively. The amino-terminal sequence of the minor components (14 and 5 kDa) were identical to the unique amino-terminal sequence of the native polypeptide, i.e.MLDAFKSSVA. We infer that these two peptides were generated by partial cleavage. The amino-terminal sequence was"

TheS100A4(p9Ka) gene in rat mammary epithelial cells expressing low levels of S100A4 yields a reduced number of fragments upon digestion with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, HpaII, compared with the gene from high S100A4-expressing cells. Genomic sequencing of two potential regulatory elements in the S100A4 gene, an intronic enhancer and TATA box region, revealed that in low S100A4-expressing cells, most cytosine bases exhibited high levels of resistance to conversion to thymine by sodium bisulfite. In derivative cell lines, which express high levels of S100A4, only a small number of cytosine bases were resistant to treatment with sodium bisulfite. In contrast, cytosine bases in the DNA surrounding an upstream regulatory region, which binds inhibitory GC factor in the low-expressing cell lines, are sensitive to conversion to thymine by sodium bisulfite in both low- and high-expressing cell lines. The results suggest that the rat S100A4 gene is maintained in a different state in the low-expressing cell lines and that this state might be a consequence of the pattern of methylation in this regulated gene that does not contain a CpG island.

Hypomethylation of DNA in tumor cells might result in the elevated expression of tumor-promoting genes, whereas hypermethylation of DNA might be involved in reducing the expression of tumor-suppressing genes (1Counts J. Goodman J. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that 5-methylcytosine might contribute to mutations in DNA as a result of its chemical conversion to thymine (1Counts J. Goodman J. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Understanding the methylation status of genes thought to be involved in the development of cancer is therefore of some importance.S100A4(p9Ka), a small calcium-binding protein, is present at a relatively low level in a number of normal differentiated cell types (3Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Wilkinson M. Parry E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cultured rat or mouse mammary epithelial cells exhibit a low level of S100A4 and its mRNA, whereas closely related metastatic epithelial cells (4.Dunnington, D.

Experimental elevation of the level of S100A4(p9Ka) in benign tumor-derived mammary epithelial cells induces the metastatic phenotype in the cells (9Davies B. Davies M. Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Rudland P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, multiple rat (10Davies M. Rudland P. Robertson L. Parry E. Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar) benign mammary tumors, respectively. In view of the metastasis-inducing properties of S100A4 in epithelial cells, it is important to understand mechanisms whereby its level is kept low in these cells.The rat S100A4(p9Ka) gene contains acis-acting sequence that binds a GC factor-like repressor protein and exerts a repressive effect on the transcription of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene in low S100A4(p9Ka)-expressing rat benign mammary tumor cells but not in high-expressing metastatic or myoepithelial-like rat mammary epithelial cells (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hypermethylation is also believed to play a role in the transcriptional silencing of the mouse (mts1) and human (CAPL) S100A4genes (13Pedrocchi M. Schäfer B. Mueller H. Eppenberger U. Heizmann C. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To find out whether DNA methylation modulates transcription of the S100A4 gene in rat cells, the pattern and degree of methylation of genomic DNA from high or low S100A4(p9Ka)-expressing rat mammary tumor-derived cell lines have been investigated using sodium bisulfite-mediated genomic sequencing.DISCUSSIONThe rat S100A4(p9Ka) gene (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Barraclough R. Savin J. Dube S. Rudland P. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) does not contain a CpG island located between 2,696 base pairs upstream and 2,474 base pairs downstream of the start site of transcription, in common with the human (30Engelkamp D.

However, the rat S100A4(p9Ka) gene shows a 10–20-fold increase in expression between low-expressing benign rat mammary epithelial (Rama 37CL-A3) and high-expressing derivative elongated, myoepithelial-like (Rama 37-E8), or metastatic (Rama 800) epithelial mammary tumor cells (4.Dunnington, D. J., The Development and Study of Single Cell-cloned Metastasizing Mammary Tumour Cell Systems in the RatPh.D. thesis, 1984, University of London.Google Scholar, 6Barraclough R. Dawson K.J.

Commun. 1984; 120: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). UsingMspI/HpaII digestion and Southern blotting analyses, different patterns of methylation of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene were revealed between the low-expressing Rama 37CL-A3 cell line on the one hand and the high expressing, Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cell lines on the other. Treatment of the Rama 37CL-A3 cells with either of two demethylating agents, 5-aza-C or SAH, significantly raises the level of p9Ka mRNA in this cell line, strongly suggesting that methylation of cytosine bases is, at least in part, responsible for repressing the production of S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA. The fact that the methylation inhibitors do not increase significantly the level of S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA in the high-expressing Rama 800 cells suggests that in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells the methylation inhibitors are affecting directly the methylation of the S100A4 gene and are not acting indirectly, for example, by affecting the expression of another gene product.Mapping by genomic sequencing of individual protected cytosine bases indicated that cytosines in the TATA box and putative enhancer-containing DNA regions of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene were highly protected from the action of sodium bisulfite only in the low S100A4(p9Ka)-expressing cell line but not in the two high S100A4(p9Ka)-expressing cell lines. In these regions of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene, resistance to conversion of cytosine bases to uracil by sodium bisulfite was found infrequently in CpG dinucleotides due to their paucity (no CpG in the TATA box region, 2 CpGs in the intron region). In contrast, protection of cytosine bases from reaction with bisulfite is more commonly observed in CpNpG trinucleotides (8 in the TATA box region and 6 in the intron region). Methylation of CpNpG trinucleotides has been shown to occur in mammalian cells using the bisulfite modification procedure, but generally only a proportion of the molecules examined were methylated (31Clark S. Harrison J. Frommer M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, all randomly picked clones gave the same result.In the Rama 37CL-A3 cells, protection from sodium bisulfite is also evident in sequences CpCpCpApA, CpCpTpA, CpCpCpTpG, CpCpCpApT, CpTpCpTpT, CpApA, CpApCpApA, CpTpC, CpTpT, and CpTpA (16 such sequences in the TATA box region and 8 in the intron region). It is possible that the protection afforded to the cytosine bases is due to their methylation. A low level of similar unconverted cytosines has been reported recently (31Clark S. Harrison J. Frommer M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar); however, it was not possible to distinguish a low background of unreacted cytosine bases from a low level of non-symmetrical methylation in the plasmid-based experimental system employed. Although in genes that possess discrete CpG islands, it is well established that cytosine methylation occurs predominantly in CpG dinucleotides; few genes that do not possess CpG islands have so far been studied. In the genome as a whole, methylation of CpA, CpT, and CpC dinucleotides has been detected by nearest-neighbor analysis (32Woodcock D. Crowther P. Diver W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although a greater proportion of CpG dinucleotides are methylated due to the low overall occurrence of this dinucleotide in the genome, over 50% of the methylation of the genome as a whole occurs in CpA, CpT, and CpC dinucleotides (32Woodcock D. Crowther P. Diver W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these methylated dinucleotides are associated with any particular genes. Similar, diverse, non-symmetric sites of methylation have been described previously as “densely methylated islands” at origins of replication associated with ribosomal protein S14 and thedhfr locus in Chinese hamster ovary cells (33Tasheva E. Roufa D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that these densely methylated islands of methylated cytosine residues might be artifactual, arising from incomplete denaturation of the DNA prior to treatment with sodium bisulfite, at least at the dhfr locus (34Rein T. Natale D. Gartner U. Niggemann M. DePamphilis M. Zorbas H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10021-10029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, it is unlikely that the unusual pattern of methylation arises from incomplete denaturation of the DNA. Neither of two closely related cell lines, Rama 37-E8 nor Rama 800, showed the same pattern of protection of cytosine bases as Rama 37CL-A3 cells, even though treatment of their DNA with sodium bisulfite was carried out under identical conditions and at the same time as the DNA from the Rama 37CL-A3 cells. The lack of protection of cytosines in the upstream region of the DNA from the Rama 37CL-A3 cells further argues against a generalized technical failure to denature the DNA prior to reaction with sodium bisulfite. However, it is possible that the DNA in the TATA box and intron regions of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells is in some way different from that isolated from the Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cells, such that it is not completely denatured under conditions that denature the DNA from Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cells (24Barraclough R. Kimbell R. Rudland P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the derepressive effect of methylation inhibitors on S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA levels and the results of the digestions withMspI and HpaII, the reduced accessibility of cytosines to bisulfate in the Rama 37CL-A3 DNA is likely to be associated with methylation. However, it cannot be ruled out that the reduced accessibility of cytosine bases to sodium bisulfite in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells is a consequence of CpG methylation outside the regions of the genome analyzed in the present experiments.The region surrounding the upstream cis-acting inhibitory sequence of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) exhibits little or no protection of cytosine bases in all three cell lines. In the Rama 37CL-A3 cells, there is a clear contrast between the density of protected cytosine bases observed in this region (0/39) and the density of protected cytosine bases in the TATA box (21/27) and intron regions (16/16) of the rat S100A4(p9Ka) gene. It is possible that the unprotected nature of this region of the gene in all three cell lines is associated with the binding of the inhibitory GC factor (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cells, the level of GC factor mRNA is lower than in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Treatment of Rama 37CL-A3 cells with demethylating agents, but not an inactive analogue, reduces the number of methylcytosine residues in theS100A4(p9Ka) gene region of the Rama 37CL-A3 cells and causes an approximately 5–6-fold increase in the steady state level of S100A4(p9Ka). However, although the endogenous S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells can be increased to a certain extent, neither of the two demethylating agents was able to increase the level of this mRNA to more than half that of its relative level in the Rama 800 cells. Since the inhibitors have no effect on S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA level in at least one high-expressing cell line (Rama 800), it is possible that this lack of full induction represents the presence of inhibitory levels of GC factor which serve to limit the expression of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene in Rama 37CL-A3 cells, and suggests that methylation of positive regulatory elements cooperates with an inhibitory factor to completely inhibit the production of S100A4 mRNA.Altered levels of DNA methyltransferases and/or patterns of methylation are thought to contribute to the formation of cancer. Since it is likely that cytosine methylation of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene plays a role in the suppression of transcription of rat and mouse S100A4(p9Ka), and in view of the metastasis-inducing properties of human S100A4 (35Lloyd B. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is possible that inadvertent hypomethylation of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene in human breast epithelial cells might contribute to the malignant progression of some breast cancers. Altered DNA methylation has been associated with carcinogenesis in a number of experimental systems (1Counts J. Goodman J. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 2Zingg J.-M. Jones P. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Hypomethylation of DNA in tumor cells might result in the elevated expression of tumor-promoting genes, whereas hypermethylation of DNA might be involved in reducing the expression of tumor-suppressing genes (1Counts J. Goodman J. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that 5-methylcytosine might contribute to mutations in DNA as a result of its chemical conversion to thymine (1Counts J. Goodman J. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Understanding the methylation status of genes thought to be involved in the development of cancer is therefore of some importance. S100A4(p9Ka), a small calcium-binding protein, is present at a relatively low level in a number of normal differentiated cell types (3Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Wilkinson M.

The lack of protection of cytosines in the upstream region of the DNA from the Rama 37CL-A3 cells further argues against a generalized technical failure to denature the DNA prior to reaction with sodium bisulfite. However, it is possible that the DNA in the TATA box and intron regions of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells is in some way different from that isolated from the Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cells, such that it is not completely denatured under conditions that denature the DNA from Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cells (24Barraclough R. Kimbell R. Rudland P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the derepressive effect of methylation inhibitors on S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA levels and the results of the digestions withMspI and HpaII, the reduced accessibility of cytosines to bisulfate in the Rama 37CL-A3 DNA is likely to be associated with methylation. However, it cannot be ruled out that the reduced accessibility of cytosine bases to sodium bisulfite in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells is a consequence of CpG methylation outside the regions of the genome analyzed in the present experiments.The region surrounding the upstream cis-acting inhibitory sequence of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) exhibits little or no protection of cytosine bases in all three cell lines. In the Rama 37CL-A3 cells, there is a clear contrast between the density of protected cytosine bases observed in this region (0/39) and the density of protected cytosine bases in the TATA box (21/27) and intron regions (16/16) of the rat S100A4(p9Ka) gene. It is possible that the unprotected nature of this region of the gene in all three cell lines is associated with the binding of the inhibitory GC factor (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cells, the level of GC factor mRNA is lower than in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Treatment of Rama 37CL-A3 cells with demethylating agents, but not an inactive analogue, reduces the number of methylcytosine residues in theS100A4(p9Ka) gene region of the Rama 37CL-A3 cells and causes an approximately 5–6-fold increase in the steady state level of S100A4(p9Ka). However, although the endogenous S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells can be increased to a certain extent, neither of the two demethylating agents was able to increase the level of this mRNA to more than half that of its relative level in the Rama 800 cells. Since the inhibitors have no effect on S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA level in at least one high-expressing cell line (Rama 800), it is possible that this lack of full induction represents the presence of inhibitory levels of GC factor which serve to limit the expression of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene in Rama 37CL-A3 cells, and suggests that methylation of positive regulatory elements cooperates with an inhibitory factor to completely inhibit the production of S100A4 mRNA.Altered levels of DNA methyltransferases and/or patterns of methylation are thought to contribute to the formation of cancer. Since it is likely that cytosine methylation of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene plays a role in the suppression of transcription of rat and mouse S100A4(p9Ka), and in view of the metastasis-inducing properties of human S100A4 (35Lloyd B. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is possible that inadvertent hypomethylation of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene in human breast epithelial cells might contribute to the malignant progression of some breast cancers. The rat S100A4(p9Ka) gene (12Chen D. Davies M. Rudland P. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Barraclough R.

However, the rat S100A4(p9Ka) gene shows a 10–20-fold increase in expression between low-expressing benign rat mammary epithelial (Rama 37CL-A3) and high-expressing derivative elongated, myoepithelial-like (Rama 37-E8), or metastatic (Rama 800) epithelial mammary tumor cells (4.Dunnington, D. J., The Development and Study of Single Cell-cloned Metastasizing Mammary Tumour Cell Systems in the RatPh.D. thesis, 1984, University of London.Google Scholar, 6Barraclough R. Dawson K.J.

Commun. 1984; 120: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). UsingMspI/HpaII digestion and Southern blotting analyses, different patterns of methylation of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene were revealed between the low-expressing Rama 37CL-A3 cell line on the one hand and the high expressing, Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800 cell lines on the other. Treatment of the Rama 37CL-A3 cells with either of two demethylating agents, 5-aza-C or SAH, significantly raises the level of p9Ka mRNA in this cell line, strongly suggesting that methylation of cytosine bases is, at least in part, responsible for repressing the production of S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA. The fact that the methylation inhibitors do not increase significantly the level of S100A4(p9Ka) mRNA in the high-expressing Rama 800 cells suggests that in the Rama 37CL-A3 cells the methylation inhibitors are affecting directly the methylation of the S100A4 gene and are not acting indirectly, for example, by affecting the expression of another gene product. Mapping by genomic sequencing of individual protected cytosine bases indicated that cytosines in the TATA box and putative enhancer-containing DNA regions of theS100A4(p9Ka) gene were highly protected from the action of sodium bisulfite only in the low S100A4(p9Ka)-expressing cell line but not in the two high S100A4(p9Ka)-expressing cell lines. In these regions of the S100A4(p9Ka) gene, resistance to conversion of cytosine bases to uracil by sodium bisulfite was found infrequently in CpG dinucleotides due to their paucity (no CpG in the TATA box region, 2 CpGs in the intron region). In contrast, protection of cytosine bases from reaction with bisulfite is more commonly observed in CpNpG trinucleotides (8 in the TATA box region and 6 in the intron region). Methylation of CpNpG trinucleotides has been shown to occur in mammalian cells using the bisulfite modification procedure, but generally only a proportion of the molecules examined were methylated (31Clark S. Harrison J. Frommer M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, all randomly picked clones gave the same result. In the Rama 37CL-A3 cells, protection from sodium bisulfite is also evident in sequences CpCpCpApA, CpCpTpA, CpCpCpTpG, CpCpCpApT, CpTpCpTpT, CpApA, CpApCpApA, CpTpC, CpTpT, and CpTpA (16 such sequences in the TATA box region and 8 in the intron region). It is possible that the protection afforded to the cytosine bases is due to their methylation. A low level of similar unconverted cytosines has been reported recently (31Clark S. Harrison J. Frommer M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar); however, it was not possible to distinguish a low background of unreacted cytosine bases from a low level of non-symmetrical methylation in the plasmid-based experimental system employed. Although in genes that possess discrete CpG islands, it is well established that cytosine methylation occurs predominantly in CpG dinucleotides; few genes that do not possess CpG islands have so far been studied. In the genome as a whole, methylation of CpA, CpT, and CpC dinucleotides has been detected by nearest-neighbor analysis (32Woodcock D. Crowther P. Diver W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although a greater proportion of CpG dinucleotides are methylated due to the low overall occurrence of this dinucleotide in the genome, over 50% of the methylation of the genome as a whole occurs in CpA, CpT, and CpC dinucleotides (32Woodcock D. Crowther P. Diver W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these methylated dinucleotides are associated with any particular genes. Similar, diverse, non-symmetric sites of methylation have been described previously as “densely methylated islands” at origins of replication associated with ribosomal protein S14 and thedhfr locus in Chinese hamster ovary cells (33Tasheva E. Roufa D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that these densely methylated islands of methylated cytosine residues might be artifactual, arising from incomplete denaturation of the DNA prior to treatment with sodium bisulfite, at least at the dhfr locus (34Rein T. Natale D. Gartner U. Niggemann M. DePamphilis M. Zorbas H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10021-10029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

The study of its role in promoting transcription, however, has been partly hampered by the difficulties encountered in the purification of the other components of the amphibian RNA polymerase III transcription apparatus. The situation is somehow reversed in the case ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, the availability of highly resolved and purified transcription components (7Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G.

Binding of 5 S DNA by Xenopus TFIIIA depends on a large protein domain comprising nine adjacent zinc fingers of the Cys2–His2 type, in which a zinc ion is coordinated by invariant cysteine and histidine residues (1Miller J.

Nature. 1986; 324: 698-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Studies conducted on isolated finger polypeptides have shown that zinc coordination is essential for the correct folding of a finger domain (18Frankel A.D. Berg J.M. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A number of studies, mainly based on footprint analysis of zinc finger deletion mutants, have demonstrated that N-terminal and C-terminal zinc fingers contact, respectively, the 3′- and 5′-moieties of the 5 S DNA ICR (6Shastry B.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 535-539PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vrana K.E. Churchill M.E.A. Tullius T.D. Brown D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1684-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Liao X.

Sci. 1993; 18: 226-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This orientation is thought to facilitate protein-protein contacts between the small C-terminal extra finger region of TFIIIA, in which the transcription activation function has been shown to reside (22Vrana K.E. Churchill M.E.A. Tullius T.D. Brown D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1684-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Mao X. Darby M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7496-7506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the other components of the transcription machinery. This modular structure, initially revealed by limited proteolysis studies conducted on the native protein (1Miller J. Mc Lachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 22Vrana K.E. Churchill M.E.A. Tullius T.D. Brown D.D. Mol. Cell.

Jackson I.J. Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), is reminiscent of the organization of RNA polymerase II transcriptional activators. In the case of TFIIIA, however, the DNA-binding domain is much larger than the activation domain, as if the requirements for a complex mode of binding had to be satisfied, and the proper functioning of the activation region strongly depends on its position relative to the DNA-binding domain (25Mao X. Darby M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7496-7506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, despite a large interaction surface (a total of 52 base pairs covered by nine adjacent zinc fingers), the estimated binding affinity ofXenopus TFIIIA is comparable to that of other DNA-binding proteins that occupy much smaller regions (28Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17593-17600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the case of yeast TFIIIA, the native domain organization of the protein has not been probed yet, and the definition of the boundary between the DNA binding and the activating region is further complicated by the fact that the most C-terminal finger is separated from the others by an 81-amino acid-long linker region containing residues that are critical for transcription activation (30Milne C.A. Segall J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11364-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rowland O. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 420-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This unique feature of yeast TFIIIA, together with its high sequence divergence (20% identity) from the well characterized amphibian homologue (which is unable to bind the yeast 5 S DNA ICR and does not reconstitute 5 S rRNA synthesis in a yeast in vitro transcription system (32Struksnes K. Forus A. Gabrielsen O.S. Oyen T.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)), makes the yeast protein a particularly interesting candidate for detailed structural and functional studies. Among the various strategies that have been employed to study the functional role of individual TFIIIA fingers and to understand the reasons for such an extended DNA-binding surface, the analysis of deletion and so called “broken finger” mutants has been the most widely used. Whereas the first approach makes use of artificially truncated polypeptides, with the inherent risk of anomalous structural rearrangements, the second approach allows, in principle, the disruption of individual zinc fingers without introducing any major alteration in the overall structure of the protein. These two complementary approaches have contributed to elucidate the topography of individual finger-DNA interactions on the 5 S rRNA gene as well as the contribution of different fingers to DNA or RNA binding (reviewed in Refs. 6Shastry B.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 535-539PubMed Google Scholar and 24Pieler T. Theunissen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 226-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More recently, through the combined use of these two approaches, it has been inferred that the interaction between TFIIIA and 5 S DNA is a complex one, in which all fingers can be equally involved in 5 S DNA binding (without the thermodynamic dominance of any specific subset of fingers) and that functional interactions between fingers significantly contribute to the overall binding energy (33Kehres D.G. Subramanyan G.S. Hung V.S. Rogers Jr., G.W. Setzer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20152-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In keeping with the complex mode of binding emerging from these studies, the solution structure of the first three zinc fingers of Xenopus TFIIIA complexed with 5 S DNA also evidenced an important role of finger-finger interactions in determining specific DNA binding (34Wuttke D.S. Foster M.P. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 35Foster M.P. Wuttke D.S. Radhakrishnan I. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the recently solved crystal structure of the first six zinc fingers of XenopusTFIIIA bound to the cognate DNA revealed that different fingers can contact DNA in a very different manner (36Nolte R.T. Conlin R.M. Harrison S.C. Brown R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2938-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 37Choo Y. Schwabe J.W.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Given the complexity of the TFIIIA DNA-binding domain and the functional interdependence of individual fingers, it would be most informative to address the overall organization of TFIIIA by changing the zinc coordination state of the protein without introducing any amino acid sequence alteration. Such a strategy could be based on the stepwise removal of zinc ions from metal-saturated TFIIIA. The existence of distinct classes of zinc-binding sites with different metal affinities has been documented previously for Xenopus TFIIIA (38Han M.K. Cyran F.P. Fisher M.T. Kim S.H. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13792-13799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Makowski G.S. Sunderman F.W.J. J. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 48: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), yet the structural and functional consequences of partial zinc removal have not been examined, and nothing is known about the significance of this heterogeneity in zinc binding affinity. By taking advantage of the availability of transcriptionally competent, purified recombinant yeast TFIIIA (15Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and of a highly resolvedin vitro transcription system (40Ruth J. Conesa C. Dieci G. Lefebvre O. Dusterhoft A. Ottonello S. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate, with a non-mutagenic approach, the role of zinc ions in determining the properties of the yeast transcription factor. We first determined the native domain organization of the protein by means of limited proteolysis. TFIIIA forms with different zinc stoichiometries were then generated and characterized from a structural and functional point of view. Yeast TFIIIA was expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells co-transformed with plasmid pET-IIIA and a multicopy plasmid carrying the gene for a minor tRNAArg(AGA/AGG) species (15Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recombinant TFIIIA purification followed a previously described procedure (15Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. One of these was the introduction of a nucleic acids removal step at the beginning of the purification procedure. Accordingly, the pellet obtained from the initial ammonium sulfate precipitation (50% (NH4)2SO4 saturation) of the soluble lysate obtained from 2 liters of bacterial culture was dissolved in 30 ml of TEGZ-β buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 μmZnSO4, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol), dialyzed for 4 h against the same buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl (TEGZ-β/0.6), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. After adjustment to final NaCl and protein concentrations of 0.25m and 0.75 mg/ml with TEGZ-β buffer, the clarified supernatant (360 ml) was adsorbed in batch to 50 ml of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in TEGZ-β/0.25 buffer, and unbound proteins were then directly subjected to Bio-Rex 70 (Bio-Rad) chromatography. Other modifications were the elimination of β-mercaptoethanol from all the buffers used after Bio-Rex 70 chromatography and an improved final purification step, carried out on a heparin Ultrogel A4R (IBF Biotechnics) column (1 ml) equilibrated and washed with HNG buffer (30 mm Hepes-Na, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl (HNG/0.1) and eluted with a 0.3–1 m NaCl gradient. Pooled fractions from heparin Ultrogel chromatography contained yeast rTFIIIA at greater than 90% homogeneity and were subsequently concentrated to a final volume of 7 ml, corresponding to a protein concentration of 1.25 mg/ml. During the initial phases of purification, protein concentrations were determined with the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar), whereas an ε280 value of 27,100 m−1 cm−1 (15Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used to determine TFIIIA concentration in highly purified samples. Samples of TFIIIA (3 μg each) were digested (37 °C) with trypsin (Sigma, T8642) in a final volume of 10 μl, at a 1:1000 protease/TFIIIA (w/w) ratio, in trypsinolysis buffer (30 mm Hepes-Na, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol). Identical amounts of TFIIIA were used for S. aureus V8 protease (Fluka, 45712) digestions (15–60 min, 37 °C), which were conducted in PBS buffer (80 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol) at a 1:5 protease/TFIIIA ratio. Digestions were blocked by either the addition of 1 mm AEBSF (Sigma) or by a 2 min boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteolysis products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar), visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and quantitated by densitometric analysis carried out on digitized images with the Multi-Analyst/PC software (Bio-Rad). Samples of TFIIIA (9 μg each) were digested with either trypsin or V8 protease under standard limited proteolysis conditions (30 min at 37 °C). The resulting polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% preparative gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Immobilon-PSQ). The membrane was briefly stained with Coomassie Blue, and then slices corresponding to the proteolytic fragments were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing using an automated LF 3000 Protein Sequencer equipped with an on-line Gold high pressure liquid chromatography system (Beckman) for the detection of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. Phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids were separated on an Ultrasphere ODS column (Beckman). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a 450-base pair DNA fragment, containing the yeast 5 S RNA gene, was prepared from plasmid pUC9-5S (a kind gift of P. A. Weil (43Wang C.K. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) by BamHI-HindIII digestion and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After labeling and purification, DNA fragment concentration was determined by ethidium bromide staining. Binding reaction mixtures contained varying amounts (from 2.5 to 25 ng) of the different TFIIIA samples, 1 ng of labeled DNA fragment, and pUC19 plasmid DNA at a 5:1 (w/w) DNA/protein ratio. The composition of the binding buffer (prepared with double-distilled water, further purified by passage through Chelex 100 resin, sodium form (C-7901, Sigma) (44Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar)), was 30 mm Hepes-Na, pH 8.0, 120 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mg/ml ultrapure bovine serum albumin (Boehringer Mannheim). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C and loaded on a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5% glycerol, that had been pre-run for 2 h at 4 °C. Electrophoresis was conducted at 4 °C for 2.5 h (200 V), with two changes of the running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Bound and free DNA were quantified by scintillation counting of excised gel slices as described previously (45Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of TFIIIA-5 S DNA apparent dissociation constants, a fixed amount of TFIIIA (10 ng) was incubated with increasing concentrations of the labeled DNA fragment (0.025–0.5 nm). At each input DNA concentration, the ratio of bound to free DNA was determined from phosphorimages of dried gels obtained with the Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad), using the Multi-Analyst/PC software (Bio-Rad). Dissociation constants were determined by linear regression analysis of Scatchard plots using SigmaPlot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific Software). Standard error for individualK d determinations varied from 15 to 35%. Template DNA was the yeast 5 S rRNA gene contained in plasmid pUC9-5S. 250 ng of pUC9-5S were preincubated at 20 °C for 30 min in a 45-μl reaction mixture (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 8% glycerol, 8 units of RNasin (Ambion), 1 mm DTT) containing an internally balanced set of complementing fractions as follows: 20 ng of recombinant TBP (46Dieci G. Duimio L. Peracchia G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13476-13482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 60 ng of recombinant TFIIIB70 (46Dieci G. Duimio L. Peracchia G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13476-13482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and 0.5 μg of B″ fraction (47Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which together reconstitute TFIIIB activity, and 5 μg of a glycerol gradient fraction containing partially purified TFIIIC and RNA polymerase III (45Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following preincubation, RNA synthesis was started by adding 5 μl of a solution providing ATP, CTP, and GTP to a final concentration of 500 μm, UTP to a final concentration of 25 μm, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Multiple rounds of transcription were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 20 °C; reaction products were then purified, resolved, and quantified as described (15Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For single round transcription experiments, 5 S DNA was first preincubated with TFIIIC, TFIIIB, RNA polymerase III and limiting concentrations of TFIIIA for 30 min at 20 °C, in a volume of 33 μl. Stable elongation complexes paused at nucleotide 10 (48Braun B.R. Riggs D.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geidushek P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2530-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were then allowed to form by adding 5 μl of a solution supplying CTP and GTP to a final concentration of 500 μm, UTP to 25 μm, and 15 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. After 10 min at 20 °C, 2 μl of a solution providing 500 μm ATP and 300 μg/ml heparin (Sigma, H2149 type) were added to complete the synthesis of initiated transcripts under conditions of blocked reinitiation. The number of transcripts synthesized in a single round of transcription was taken to equal the number of active transcription complexes formed during preincubation, i.e. the number of active TFIIIA molecules. 5 S RNA transcripts were quantified from phosphorimages of dried gels obtained with a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) using the Multi-Analyst/PC software (Bio-Rad). The number of transcripts corresponding to each phosphorimaging signal was determined by comparison with the signal produced by a known amount of [α-32P]UTP. All solutions used for in vitrotranscription assays were made with Chelex-treated, double-distilled water and ultrapure reagents. Zinc-saturated TFIIIA was prepared by incubating the purified protein (1.25 mg/ml) for 1 h at 20 °C in the presence of 5 mm DTT, followed by a 4-h dialysis against HNG/0.35 buffer containing 50 μm ZnSO4, and by the final removal of unbound zinc with a 20-h dialysis against the same buffer without added zinc. The 6 Zn2+-liganded TFIIIA species was obtained upon incubation of metal-saturated TFIIIA (1 h, 20 °C) in the presence of 0.5 mm4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR, Sigma) and removal of excess reagent by a 20-h dialysis (two changes) against HNG/0.35 buffer. The TFIIIA species containing 3 zinc eq was similarly prepared by incubation (30 min, 20 °C) with 2 mm EDTA, followed by the removal of excess EDTA with a 20-h dialysis (two changes) against HNG/0.5 buffer (an increased salt concentration was required in this case to avoid the precipitation of the partially unfolded protein). Dialyses were conducted at 4 °C under nitrogen, and the different TFIIIA samples were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min) prior to protein determination. All dialysis buffers were made with ultrapure reagents using double-distilled, Chelex-treated water. Samples of the different TFIIIA species were diluted to a final concentration of 1 μm with HNG/0.35 buffer containing 0.1 mmPAR, adjusting the spectrophotometer to zero absorbance immediately before protein addition; higher protein (3 μm) and salt (0.5 m) concentrations were used in the case of EDTA-treated TFIIIA. In PMPS titration experiments, absorbance changes at either 500 or 250 nm (in the case of titrations conducted in the absence of PAR) were measured after each PMPS addition. Zinc release in the presence of PAR only was similarly analyzed by measuring absorbance changes at 500 nm as a function of time. Zinc release from TFIIIA was determined indirectly by monitoring the formation of a (PAR)2·Zn2+ complex (ε500 = 66,000 cm−1m−1), whereas mercaptide bond formation was directly followed at 250 nm. PMPS and PAR stock solutions (4 and 5 mm, respectively) were prepared with Chelex-treated buffers as described previously (44Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 49Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of the zinc content of buffers and reaction mixtures, PAR was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the decrease in absorbance at 500 nm was measured after the addition of 1 mm EDTA. All spectrophotometric measurements were conducted with a Cary 13E spectrophotometer. We initially probed the structural organization of yeast TFIIIA by limited proteolysis. Transcriptionally competent recombinant yeast TFIIIA, purified from an overproducing E. coli strain, and either trypsin or V8 protease were utilized for this analysis. As shown in Fig.1 A, a 33.5-kDa proteolytic fragment (p33.5) was already clearly detectable after a 10-min incubation in the presence of trypsin (lane 2); it became the main product of trypsinolysis following an additional 20-min digestion that led to the complete disappearance of full-length TFIIIA (lane 4) and remained stable even after a 1-h incubation in the presence of trypsin (data not shown). A smaller and less represented fragment of about 15 kDa (p15) was generated at the same time as p33.5 (lane 2) and decreased upon further digestion, concomitantly with the appearance of an 11.5-kDa fragment (p11.5,lane 4). Two other minor fragments of 17 kDa (p17) and 30.5 kDa (p30.5) first appeared after 20 min of trypsinolysis (lane 3) and slowly accumulated thereafter. Fig. 1 B shows that this trypsin cleavage pattern was not modified by the addition of excess zinc to the proteolysis mixture (cf. lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of EDTA (500 μm) prior to trypsin digestion caused a complete loss of the 33.5-kDa fragment and of all the other smaller polypeptides (Fig. 1 B,cf. lanes 2 and 4). The residual undigested protein observed in this latter case likely results from nonspecific self-aggregation of zinc-depleted TFIIIA. We interpreted the destabilizing effect of EDTA as the result of a conformational alteration of TFIIIA induced by zinc removal. Indeed, protease resistance was fully restored by a 10-min incubation of EDTA-treated TFIIIA with 500 μm Zn2+ prior to proteolysis (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). In yeast TFIIIA there are 62 potential trypsin cleavage sites (lysine and arginine) and 54 additional sites for the V8 protease (glutamate and aspartate), yet the latter enzyme also g"
