https://openalex.org/W2034851836,"Litters of puppies were isolated, with the bitch, in fenced acre fields from 2 to 14 weeks of age. They were removed indoors at different ages, played with for a week, and returned to the field. The pups manifested an increasing tendency to withdraw from human beings after 5 weeks of age and unless socialization occurred before 14 weeks of age, withdrawal reactions from humans became so intense that normal relationships could not thereafter be established."

https://openalex.org/W1965143185,"The frequency of action potentials of about one-third of the neurons sampled in the striate cortex of awake rabbits was clearly modified by mild stimulation of the reticular core of the brain stem. Reticular stimulation often brought about enhancement of firing in units activated by light, while it usually had the contrary effect upon light-inhibited units."

https://openalex.org/W2050609012,"The abnormally high thyroxin-like activity of certain thyroxin analogs is due to the use of the unique test route of immersion. When thyroxin, triiodothyronine, and their propionic and acetic acid analogs are tested by injection into the tadpole, their activities are more comparable to activity levels established in rat and man."

https://openalex.org/W2056936159,"A method for estimating the metabolic rate of the human pulmonary tissues is described. Six patients with far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis showed an average rate of 12 percent of the total oxygen consumption. A method for measuring the right ventricular output with an inert gas is also outlined, and the use of this approach to minimize errors in the estimation of the tissue metabolic rate is described."
https://openalex.org/W1980164943,"THE Priesz–Nocard bacillus (C. ovis) which is responsible for a number of diseases of animals, including caseous lymphadenitis of sheep and ulcerative lymphangitis of horses, grows well on blood-agar medium, producing circular, opaque surface colonies which are frequently surrounded by a narrow zone of hæmolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2157323760,"A single shock to the prepyri-form cortex with implanted electrodes caused a damped, sinusoidal oscillation in potential. The root-mean-square amplitudes of potentials evoked by short trains of stimuli, when plotted against the frequency of stimulation, fitted the equation for forced harmonic oscillation when the cat was attentive to the stimuli"

https://openalex.org/W2052601458,"IN view of the contradictory reports1–3 with respect to changes in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels of the mammalian central nervous system during convulsion, this problem was re-examined in rats in which convulsion was induced by intraperitoneal injection of fluoroacetate or ‘Metrazol’. The former convulsant was particularly preferred because, unlike the convulsive agents generally employed, its action can be related to specific biochemical events, that is, blocking of the citric acid cycle4 with concomitant changes in certain amino-acid5- and ammonia6-levels of the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2019336574,"SHIFTS in the ultra-violet absorption spectra of aqueous organic solutions of some amino-azo dyes on the addition of buffered protein solutions have frequently been interpreted as evidence of complex formation between protein and dye1–4. The effect of the buffer itself on the spectrum of the dye has apparently not always been checked, and the fact that this may influence the results is shown by the following experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2021863389,"LEPTOSPIRAL infection of white laboratory rats was first reported by Uhlenhuth and Zimmermann1. Later it was observed in some stocks in Germany, Holland and Denmark2. The infection seemed to be present inapparently in white rats, although some observers emphasized the high incidence of albuminuria in these populations. The examination of single isolated strains and the results of serological screening tests suggested Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae as the causative agent. It was generally assumed that the infection originated from wild rats in the animal house. Human cases were regularly detected in these institutes showing mainly the picture of Weil's disease with a high fatality-rate."
