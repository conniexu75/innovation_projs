Here, by performing a pan-cancer analysis of single myeloid cells from 210 patients across 15 human cancer types, we identified distinct features of TIMs across cancer types. Mast cells in nasopharyngeal cancer were found to be associated with better prognosis and exhibited an anti-tumor phenotype with a high ratio of TNF+/VEGFA+ cells. Systematic comparison between cDC1- and cDC2-derived LAMP3+ cDCs revealed their differences in transcription factors and external stimulus. Additionally, pro-angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were characterized with diverse markers across different cancer types, and the composition of TIMs appeared to be associated with certain features of somatic mutations and gene expressions.

Tumors are complex ecosystems where heterogeneous malignant cells interact with both immune and nonimmune cells to shape the complex cellular network of the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38731) Google Scholar). Because myeloid cells constitute a key cellular component of immune cells that infiltrate into tumors and play important roles in modulating tumor inflammation and angiogenesis (Engblom et al., 2016Engblom C. Pfirschke C. Pittet M.J. The role of myeloid cells in cancer therapies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar; Schmid and Varner, 2010Schmid M.C. Varner J.A. Myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment: modulation of tumor angiogenesis and tumor inflammation.J. Oncol. 2010; 2010: 201026Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), several therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells are ongoing in pre-clinical and clinical studies (Nakamura and Smyth, 2020Nakamura K. Smyth M.J. Myeloid immunosuppression and immune checkpoints in the tumor microenvironment.Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2020; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), although the heterogeneity of myeloid cells remains less studied. TIMs consist of several distinct major lineages including mast cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), monocytes, and macrophages (Engblom et al., 2016Engblom C. Pfirschke C. Pittet M.J. The role of myeloid cells in cancer therapies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In the past decade, primarily with the aid of flow cytometry, the complexity of major myeloid lineages has begun to be revealed. Monocytes are usually classified based on the expression of surface markers CD14 and CD16 (Yang et al., 2014Yang J. Zhang L. Yu C. Yang X.F. Wang H. Monocyte and macrophage differentiation: circulation inflammatory monocyte as biomarker for inflammatory diseases.Biomark. Res. 2014; 2: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Macrophages are critical mediators in TME and participate in multiple aspects of tumor immunity (DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019DeNardo D.G. Ruffell B. Macrophages as regulators of tumour immunity and immunotherapy.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The “classically activated” M1 and “alternatively activated” M2 macrophage polarization system has been used to describe the in vitro activation state of macrophages (Vogel et al., 2014Vogel D.Y. Glim J.E. Stavenuiter A.W. Breur M. Heijnen P. Amor S. Dijkstra C.D. Beelen R.H. Human macrophage polarization in vitro: maturation and activation methods compared.Immunobiology. 2014; 219: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, macrophages in vivo exhibit more complex phenotypes, which argue against such a simple categorization in vitro (Ginhoux et al., 2016Ginhoux F. Schultze J.L. Murray P.J. Ochando J. Biswas S.K. New insights into the multidimensional concept of macrophage ontogeny, activation and function.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Dendritic cells (DCs) are key players in antigen-specific immune responses (Mellman, 2013Mellman I. Dendritic cells: master regulators of the immune response.Cancer Immunol. Res. 2013; 1: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Two distinct cDC subsets, XCR1+CADM1+ cDC1s and CD1A+CD172A+ cDC2s, have been identified and shown to interact with CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively (Binnewies et al., 2019Binnewies M. Mujal A.M.

Furthermore, the heterogeneity of cDC2s only starts to be revealed recently, as distinct cDC2 subsets in human blood and spleen have been identified (Brown et al., 2019Brown C.C. Gudjonson H.

However, the complexity of cDC2s across tumors is still not fully characterized. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have been increasingly applied to characterize TME at the single-cell resolution (Ren et al., 2018Ren X. Kang B. Zhang Z. Understanding tumor ecosystems by single-cell sequencing: promises and limitations.Genome Biol. 2018; 19: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At present, several studies have delineated the diversity of TIMs in a single cancer type when characterizing the global immune landscape of TME (Azizi et al., 2018Azizi E. Carr A.J. Plitas G.

However, it is not clear whether such findings can be extended to other cancer types, and it remains unknown whether the same subsets of TIMs are present across different cancer types. In this study, using a combination of published and newly generated scRNA-seq data, we painted the landscapes of TIM across 15 tumor types, characterized the degree of similarity of myeloid cell subsets across cancer types, and investigated the unique composition and characteristics of those subsets in different cancer types. Our comprehensive TIM compendium would provide an unprecedented resource to understand the complexity of the TME and guide immunotherapy development for multiple human cancer types. To generate a deep transcriptional atlas of TIMs, we obtained scRNA-seq data on myeloid cells in 380 samples from 210 patients diagnosed with one of the 15 common cancer types, including newly collected 82 treatment-naive patients of 10 cancer types (Figure 1A; Table S1). After strict quality control and filtration, we collected a total of 138,161 myeloid cells derived from the tumors, adjacent non-cancer tissues, peripheral blood, or lymph node of 194 patients (338 samples) across 15 common cancer types (Figures 1A, 1B, S1A, and S1B; Table S1; STAR methods).Figure S1Basic information of the data and myeloid cell subsets in each cancer type, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Bar plot showing the number of myeloid cells collected in each cancer type.

(C) UMAP plots showing the subsets of myeloid cells in the 15 cancer types. ∗, cancer types comprising two independent datasets. To characterize the subsets of myeloid cells and minimize batch effects among different datasets, we analyzed each dataset independently. We performed unsupervised graph-based clustering on myeloid cells and then identified four common major linages (mast cells, pDCs, cDCs, monocytes, or macrophages) based on canonical cell markers. In addition, cDCs and monocytes or macrophages could be further divided into multiple sub-populations (Figure S1C, STAR methods). Using esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) as an example, mast cells, pDCs, cDCs, and monocytes/macrophages were characterized by specific high expression of KIT, LILRA4, HLA/FCER1A, and CD68/CD163, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D). Three distinct subsets in cDCs were identified (Figures 1E and S1C), including two classical cDC subsets (CLEC9A+ cDC1s and CD1C+ cDC2s) and a mature cDC subset (LAMP3+ cDC) recently characterized (Zhang et al., 2019Zhang Q. He Y. Luo N. Patel S.J. Han Y. Gao R. Modak M. Carotta S. Haslinger C. Kind D. et al.Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Cell. 2019; 179: 829-845.e20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Further clustering of the monocytes/macrophages in ESCA gave rise to 6 sub-populations with specific gene signatures, including two groups of monocytes (classical CD14hiCD16− and non-classical CD14+CD16hi) and four groups of macrophages (Figures 1E and S1C). Likewise, cDCs and monocytes in all other 14 cancer types were clustered into the same sub-populations with consistent markers (Figures 1F and S1C). Of note, in CRC and myeloma, we identified an intermediate monocyte subset (CD14hiCD16+ monocytes) (Yang et al., 2014Yang J. Zhang L. Yu C. Yang X.F. Wang H. Monocyte and macrophage differentiation: circulation inflammatory monocyte as biomarker for inflammatory diseases.Biomark. Res. 2014; 2: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), which was likely to benefit from the large number of monocytes in the blood. In contrast to cDCs and monocytes, macrophage subsets in different tumor types exhibited much higher heterogeneity (Figures 1F and S1C). For example, we identified a lung cancer-specific macrophage population Macro_PPARG, which represented lung-resident alveolar macrophages, characterized by high expression of PPARG, MARCO, MRC1, and MSR1 (Gordon et al., 2014Gordon S. Plüddemann A. Martinez Estrada F. Macrophage heterogeneity in tissues: phenotypic diversity and functions.Immunol. Rev. 2014; 262: 36-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar; Figures S1C and S2A). The rationality of our cluster identification was further verified using the four cancer types comprising two independent studies (Figures 1G and S2B-S2D, STAR methods). We next compared the relationship between the major lineages of myeloid cells across different cancer types. We first integrated the large number of myeloid cells across 15 cancer types and observed that cells with the same major lineage identities were well mixed (Figure S3A). To quantify their similarities, we calculated the correlations between the average transcriptome of each major lineage in different cancer types. As expected, the same major lineages from different cancer types were clustered together (Figures 2A and S3B, STAR methods), further demonstrating that major myeloid lineages shared similar transcriptomic profiles.Figure 2Characterization of major myeloid cell lineages in various cancer typesShow full caption(A) Hierarchical clustering of major myeloid cell lineages.(B) Boxplots showing the proportions of each major lineage divided by the total myeloid cell number in tumor tissues across various cancer types.

(J) Bar plot showing the proportion of IL1B+ macrophages divided by the total macrophage number. See also Figure S3. We then examined the composition of the major lineages in each tumor type (Figure 2B). Monocytes and macrophages accounted for the largest proportion of TIMs, with an average of above 50% in most tumors. The pDCs lineage was a small sub-population at tumor site, comprising less than 10% of TIMs. The proportion of cDCs was relatively stable (∼10%–20%) across tumor types. By contrast, the proportion of mast cells showed dramatic variation across different tumors. For instance, mast cells were largely absent in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) and HCC, whereas the ratio of mast cells was relatively high in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), which hinted that mast cells might exhibit diverse functions across cancer types. We further examined the tissue distribution of mast cells. Higher proportions of mast cells in tumor tissues were observed in most cancer types (Figure S3C), supporting that mast cells accumulate in tumors and play important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression (Maciel et al., 2015Maciel T.T. Moura I.C. Hermine O. The role of mast cells in cancers.F1000Prime Rep. 2015; 7: 09Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, we noticed that mast cells increased in the adjacent normal uterus (Figure S3D), which was further confirmed by the Ro/e analysis (Figure S3E; STAR methods) and could be associated with reproductive processes (Woidacki et al., 2013Woidacki K. Jensen F. Zenclussen A.C. Mast cells as novel mediators of reproductive processes.Front. Immunol. 2013; 4: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lower expression of TNF was observed in mast cells from tumor tissues compared with that from non-cancer tissues in UCEC (Figure 2C). Mast-derived TNF has been reported to play a critical role in DC functionality and T cell priming, which is beneficial for anti-tumor capacity (Dudeck et al., 2015Dudeck J. Ghouse S.M. Lehmann C.H. Hoppe A. Schubert N. Nedospasov S.A. Dudziak D. Dudeck A. Mast-Cell-Derived TNF Amplifies CD8(+) Dendritic Cell Functionality and CD8(+) T Cell Priming.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 399-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We then extended our analysis to compare the expression patterns of TNF and found that tumor-derived mast cells showed low expression of TNF in multiple cancer types (Figure S3F), suggesting the presence of an inhibitory program that hinders the anti-tumor activities of mast cells in those tumors. Moreover, we observed an increase of TNF+ mast cells in lung cancer (LUNG) patients at the residual disease (RD) state, compared to patients before tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy (TN) or at the progressive disease (PD) state (Figure S3G; Maynard et al., 2020Maynard A. McCoach C.E. Rotow J.K. Harris L. Haderk F. Kerr D.L. Yu E.A. Schenk E.L. Tan W. Zee A. et al.Therapy-Induced Evolution of Human Lung Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.Cell. 2020; 182: 1232-1251.e22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which further supports the importance of TNF+ mast cells in anti-tumor immunity. Mast cells in tumors are thought to play a dual role in influencing the fate of tumor cells (Ribatti, 2016Ribatti D. Mast cells as therapeutic target in cancer.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2016; 778: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Apart from TNF, mast-derived VEGFA is a key gene associated with tumor angiogenesis (Marone et al., 2016Marone G. Varricchi G. Loffredo S. Granata F. Mast cells and basophils in inflammatory and tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2016; 778: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which informed us to evaluate the complexity of mast cells. Using ROGUE analysis (Liu et al., 2020Liu B. Li C. Li Z. Wang D. Ren X. Zhang Z. An entropy-based metric for assessing the purity of single cell populations.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we observed that mast cells showed the highest homogeneity among the four major lineages (Figure S3H). We then directly compared the expression patterns of TNF and VEGFA in mast cells and observed both mutually exclusive and co-expression pattern across different cancer types (Figure S3I), suggesting that masts cell in different tumors might exhibit different compounding effects on tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor sections further confirmed the existence of these two subsets of mast cells in thyroid carcinoma (THCA) (Figure 2D). To compare their effects on tumor cells across cancer types, we quantified the ratio of TNF+ to VEGFA+ mast cells in tumors and observed that the frequencies of VEGFA+ mast cells were much higher than TNF+ cells in most tumor types (Figure 2E), indicating their prevailing pro-angiogenic role. Intriguingly, NPC stood up as the only cancer type with dramatically higher frequency of TNF+ than VEGFA+ mast cells (ratio = 2.4) (Figure 2E), indicating a higher anti-tumor capacity. Using clinical data collected from the TCGA project (Liu et al., 2018Liu J. Lichtenberg T. Hoadley K.A. Poisson L.M. Lazar A.J. Cherniack A.D. Kovatich A.J. Benz C.C. Levine D.A. Lee A.V. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkAn Integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource to Drive High-Quality Survival Outcome Analytics.Cell. 2018; 173: 400-416.e11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) and NPC patients, we confirmed that the higher expression of mast cell markers was associated with a survival advantage in NPC, while an opposite effect was observed in multiple cancer types (Figures 2F and S3J; STAR methods), consistent with our hypothesis. Taken together, these findings reveal unique anti-tumor function of mast cells in NPC, whereas mast cells usually play a pro-tumorigenic role in most other tumors. To explore the underlying reasons for the enrichment of TNF+ mast cells in NPC, we compared the transcriptomic differences between TNF+ and TNF− mast cells, and then used the highly expressed genes in TNF+ mast cells for NicheNet analysis (Browaeys et al., 2020Browaeys R. Saelens W. Saeys Y. NicheNet: modeling intercellular communication by linking ligands to target genes.Nat. Methods. 2020; 17: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar; STAR methods). We noticed that SPP1 and interleukin (IL)-1β, highly produced by TAMs, were predicted as the possible ligands to drive the phenotype of TNF+ mast cells (Figure 2G). Using CellphoneDB (Efremova et al., 2020Efremova M. Vento-Tormo M. Teichmann S.A. Vento-Tormo R. CellPhoneDB: inferring cell-cell communication from combined expression of multi-subunit ligand-receptor complexes.Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15: 1484-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), we also found that mast cells were more likely to interact with macrophages in NPC (Figure S3K), and one of the significantly enriched ligand-receptor pairs was IL1B-ADRB2 (Figure 2H). ADRB2 has been reported to possess a critical role in preventing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from mast cells (Barnes, 1999Barnes P.J. Effect of beta-agonists on inflammatory cells.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: S10-S17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we identified a positive correlation between IL1B+ macrophages and TNF+ mast cells in tumor tissues (Figure 2I). Meanwhile, NPC was found to harbor the highest proportion of IL1B+ macrophages (Figure 2J). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of IL1B+ macrophages may drive the anti-tumor property of mast cells in NPC. Next, we focused on the heterogeneity and functions of cDCs. To assess the similarity of the three cDC subsets across different tumor types, we observed that the same cDC subsets from different cancer types were clustered together (Figures 3A and 3B ), suggesting that the transcriptomic states of each cDC subset are developmentally determined, with cancer types having relatively marginal impacts. We previously reported that the LAMP3+ cDCs represented a distinct subset of cDCs in HCC (Zhang et al., 2019Zhang Q. He Y. Luo N. Patel S.J. Han Y. Gao R. Modak M. Carotta S. Haslinger C. Kind D. et al.Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Cell. 2019; 179: 829-845.e20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Here, we identified the LAMP3+ cDCs in all 15 cancer types (Figures 1F and 3A), indicating their broad presence in TME. IHC staining of tumor sections from CRC patients further confirmed the existence of LAMP3+ cDCs and showed the physical juxtaposition of LAMP3+ cDCs and multiple T types (Figure 3C). In line with the char"

We identify species preferentially targeted by systemic antibodies in humans, with Candida albicans being the major inducer of antifungal immunoglobulin G (IgG). Fungal colonization of the gut induces germinal center (GC)-dependent B cell expansion in extraintestinal lymphoid tissues and generates systemic antibodies that confer protection against disseminated C. albicans or C. auris infection. Antifungal IgG production depends on the innate immunity regulator CARD9 and CARD9+CX3CR1+ macrophages. In individuals with invasive candidiasis, loss-of-function mutations in CARD9 are associated with impaired antifungal IgG responses. These results reveal an important role of gut commensal fungi in shaping the human antibody repertoire through CARD9-dependent induction of host-protective antifungal IgG."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Its cardinal features include motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability, though nonmotor symptoms are often also present. The current mainstay of pharmacologic therapy consists of augmentation of dopamine levels in the brain via dopamine supplements or agonists or by inhibiting dopamine degradation. Treatment is symptomatic but not long-lasting, and it has no neuroprotective effect. Cell therapy with grafts of human fetal tissue from the ventral mesencephalon have been carried out successfully, with multiple reports of long-term benefits. But placebo-controlled double-blind studies in the United States have failed to reach their primary endpoints (Freed et al., 2001Freed C.R. Greene P.E. Breeze R.E. Tsai W.-Y. DuMouchel W. Kao R.

Nonetheless, graft survival was shown by fluorodopa PET scans (Freed et al., 2011Freed C.R. Zhou W. Breeze R.E.

U S A. 2016; 113: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and subgroup analysis suggested benefit in some patients (Freed et al., 2011Freed C.R. Zhou W. Breeze R.E. Dopamine cell transplantation for Parkinson’s disease: the importance of controlled clinical trials.Neurotherapeutics. 2011; 8: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the clinical results of fetal tissue transplantation were variable, there were enough successes (up to complete cessation of anti-PD therapy in successfully grafted patients) to warrant improved trial design and development of a new European Union-funded study. This new trial, TRANSEURO (NCT01898390), has just finished accrual of 11 patients, randomly selected from a large observational cohort to receive human fetal grafts (Barker et al., 2019Barker R.A. Farrell K. Guzman N.V. He X. Lazic S.E. Moore S. Morris R. Tyers P. Wijeyekoon R. Daft D. et al.TRANSEURO consortiumDesigning stem-cell-based dopamine cell replacement trials for Parkinson’s disease.Nat. Med. 2019; 25: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although much will be learned from this study, fetal tissue-based studies in humans are fraught with enormous logistical hurdles and ethical concerns. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived dopamine neurons provide several advantages over the use of human fetal tissue. They are readily expandable at the undifferentiated state to generate large-scale cell banks. Robust differentiation protocols can then be applied to yield large cryopreserved lots of differentiated cells that are subjected to stringent quality control measures after development of the critical release criteria. Cell composition and phenotype of ESC or iPSC-derived dopamine cells can be further validated pre-grafting. Ethical and logistical hurdles are also significantly reduced in comparison with the use of fetal tissue. There are at least two patients known to have received iPSC-derived dopamine cells, a patient in a recent trial in Japan (Cyranoski, 2018Cyranoski D. ‘Reprogrammed’ stem cells implanted into patient with Parkinson’s disease.Nat. News. 2018; https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07407-9Crossref Google Scholar) and a patient in the United States on a compassionate basis (Cyranoski, 2018Cyranoski D. ‘Reprogrammed’ stem cells implanted into patient with Parkinson’s disease.Nat.

Li Q. et al.Personalized iPSC-derived dopamine progenitor cells for Parkinson’s disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382: 1926-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Preclinical data have also been reported (Doi et al., 2020Doi D. Magotani H. Kikuchi T. Ikeda M. Hiramatsu S. Yoshida K. Amano N. Nomura M. Umekage M. Morizane A. Takahashi J. Pre-clinical study of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic progenitor cells for Parkinson’s disease.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated the in vitro derivation of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons (Perrier et al., 2004Perrier A.L. Tabar V. Barberi T. Rubio M.E. Bruses J. Topf N. Harrison N.L. Studer L. Derivation of midbrain dopamine neurons from human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2004; 101: 12543-12548Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), then developed an enhanced specification approach based on floor-plate derivation of authentic mDA neurons that express key lineage-defining transcription factors such as FOXA2, LMX1A, and PITX3 as well as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) upon maturation. Grafted cells survived, integrated into the host tissue, and rescued the behavioral abnormalities of Parkinsonian rodents (Kriks et al., 2011Kriks S. Shim J.W. Piao J. Ganat Y.M. Wakeman D.R. Xie Z. Carrillo-Reid L. Auyeung G. Antonacci C. Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Encouraged by these results, we elected to translate our findings toward a clinical trial. In a first step, we further enhanced the robustness of the differentiation and adapted the dopamine neuron differentiation conditions toward clinical compatibility under near current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The resulting dopamine neuron differentiation protocol and its developmental rationale are presented in the companion article in this issue of Cell Stem Cell (Kim et al., 2021Kim T.W. Piao J. Koo S.Y. Kriks S. Chung S. Betel D. Choi S.J. Mosharov E.V. Irion S. Tomishima M. et al.Biphasic activation of WNT signaling enhances the derivation of midbrain dopamine neurons for translational use.Cell Stem Cell. 2021; 28 (this issue): 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Building on those results, we report here the large-scale manufacture of cryopreserved clinical-grade cells, named MSK-DA01. We also present the design and results of toxicity, biodistribution, tumorigenicity, and efficacy studies in rodents. The initial step in the transition of the protocol of dopamine neuron differentiation to clinical compatibility entailed the elimination of the mouse fibroblast feeders and the knockout serum replacement product (KSR) in the original protocol to feeder-free conditions using Essential 8 Medium for expansion and Neurobasal Medium for differentiation. However, those changes resulted in a near complete loss of TH+ mDA neurons co-expressing FOXA2 and in the low expression of additional dopamine and midbrain markers such as EN1. As detailed in the accompanying article (Kim et al., 2021Kim T.W. Piao J. Koo S.Y. Kriks S. Chung S. Betel D. Choi S.J. Mosharov E.V. Irion S. Tomishima M. et al.Biphasic activation of WNT signaling enhances the derivation of midbrain dopamine neurons for translational use.Cell Stem Cell. 2021; 28 (this issue): 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we addressed this problem by modifying timing and concentration of the WNT agonist CHIR99021 with treatment at 0.7 μM from days 0–3, at 7.5 μM from days 4–9, and at 3 μM from days 10–11 to dynamically control WNT signaling levels during differentiation (“Chir-Boost” protocol). This strategy improved rostro-caudal patterning of the SHH-induced ventral FOXA2+ population with minimal contamination of anterior diencephalic or posterior hindbrain lineages or non-neural contaminant and led to the successful derivation of authentic mDA neurons with very low run-to-run variability. We next developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the new differentiation conditions and transiently embedded members of our team in the institutional GMP facility (Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Facility [CTCEF]) to achieve a seamless transfer of the SOPs to the facility staff and to initiate the next steps. Master banks of undifferentiated WA09 (H9) cells (passage 28) were obtained from the WiCell Research Institute. The cells were manufactured under cGMP conditions to establish working cell banks (WCBs) in E8 medium that were further certified by Waisman Biomanufacturing. The cells passed a battery of tests, including cell authentication by STR, karyotype, hESC marker expression, adventitious virus, and mouse antibody testing (Table S1). After transfer to the CTCEF, the cells were thawed and expanded for two or three passages prior to differentiation. Cells passed quality control analysis for morphology, cell identity (NANOG expression ranged from 95.8% to 98.1% by flow cytometry; criteria set at ≥90%), viability (ranging from 83.8% to 90.8% [criteria ≥ 70%] by AO/PI staining), sterility, and mycoplasma tests. For manufacturing of dopamine neuron progenitors (MSK-DA01), we first identified and performance-tested lots of all the reagents required. After completing the engineering run of our process in the CTCEF to evaluate product yield and quality, we manufactured four lots of MSK-DA01. Three of the four lots yielded at least 2 billion cells (2.0 × 109 to 2.8 × 109 cells), stored in >200 vials each. Only lot 3 was more limited in size (1.1 × 109 cells), as some of the cells were used for extended culture to allow adventitious agent testing. An overview of experimental design and quality assurance is shown in Figure 1A. The differentiation process at the CTCEF was monitored at several time points using in-process analyses of cell morphology, sterility, and viability at day 11 and day 16. For cell identity, gene expression of a list of key markers (41 genes plus 1 internal control gene [ACTB]; Kim et al., 2021Kim T.W. Piao J. Koo S.Y. Kriks S. Chung S. Betel D. Choi S.J. Mosharov E.V.

The list consisted of genes involved in mDA development (such as FOXA2, LMX1A, EN1, and TH) (Ferri et al., 2007Ferri A.L.M. Lin W. Mavromatakis Y.E. Wang J.C. Sasaki H. Whitsett J.A. Ang S.L.

A previous small-scale lot (NB072715SZ), shown to function in vivo, served as a reference. The data demonstrated high expression of genes involved in mDA development and minimal expression of non-mDA fates. POU5F1 expression was undetectable as of day 11 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (data not shown). At the end of differentiation at day 16, the cells passed sterility, pyrogen, and mycoplasma testing and were cryopreserved using STEM-CELLBANKER and a controlled rate freezer into 8 million cell vials. Viability after thaw ranged from 79.6% to 87.2% (criteria > 70%; n = 6 vials/lot). Additional testing on cryopreserved lots involved markers nominated as release criteria at day 16, including gene expression for LMX1A and POU5F1 (Figure 1B) and gene expression for TH and PITX3 using qRT-PCR at day 21, 5 days after further differentiation of cryopreserved day 16 product (Figure 1B). IHC for co-expression of FOXA2 and TH co-expression was also carried out at day 21 (Figure S1B). We established validated intracellular flow cytometry assays for expression of key proteins of thawed cells, including FOXA2 (criteria > 85%), PAX6 (criteria < 5%), and NANOG (criteria < 0.2%). Data on thawed cells from MSK-DA01 showed a high percentage (90.1%–94.4%) of FOXA2, a floor-plate marker that is maintained throughout the development of mDA neurons, very low percentage of PAX6+ (0.1%–0.2%), and undetectable NANOG+ cells (Figure S1C). We did not observe significant differences among the lots or loss of marker expression in long-term cryopreserved cells. As contamination with undifferentiated PSCs is a major concern for any PSC-based products, in addition to our standard flow cytometry-based release assay for NANOG and qRT-PCR-based assay for POU5F1, we tested carefully for POU5F1+ cells in our product at day 16 using several orthogonal assays. MSK-DA01 was tested alone or in samples spiked with WA09-hPSCs (human PSCs) in a dilution series ranging from 0.001% to 1% undifferentiated PSCs to determine the limit of detection of the various assays. First, we used an automated high-content microscope (Operetta) to detect and quantitate immunostained POU5F1+ cells (Figure S1D). The quantified percentage of POU5F1+ cells is highly similar to the percentage of spiked PSCs (Figure S1E). The automatedly detected POU5F1+ cells were subjected to validation by manual observation, and false-positive signals were excluded. At the lowest spiked percentage tested (0.001% PSC spike), 5 POU5F1+ cells were identified out of 191,570 cells (0.0026%), confirming the sensitivity of the analysis. Using high-content imaging, we could not find evidence for the presence of any POU5F1 cells in MSK-DA01. For qRT-PCR-based detection of POU5F1 mRNA, we observed a 2,000-fold decrease in expression from undifferentiated cells to MSK-DA01. However, there was evidence for persistent low POU5F1 mRNA expression compared with negative control, which is not consistent with the absence of POU5F1+ cells in MSK-DA01 described above. We then suspected that our release POU5F1 primer set (Figure 1B) may have detected known POU5F1 pseudogenes, which may limit sensitivity (Liedtke et al., 2007Liedtke S. Enczmann J. Waclawczyk S. Wernet P. Kögler G. Oct4 and its pseudogenes confuse stem cell research.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 364-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we implemented an additional primer sets optimized to avoid pseudogene detection (Liedtke et al., 2007Liedtke S. Enczmann J. Waclawczyk S. Wernet P. Kögler G. Oct4 and its pseudogenes confuse stem cell research.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 364-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) using both ddPCR (data not shown) and qRT-PCR assays. We analyzed POU5F1 expression in a set of samples including MSK-DA01, fibroblasts (negative control), and 100%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%, 0.0001%, and 0.00001% hPSCs spiked into MSK-DA01 (Figure S1F). The data suggest that the limit of detection for this assay reaches at least low as 0.001%. MSK-DA01 showed levels not significantly different from the fibroblast negative control, confirming that POU5F1 mRNA was undetectable in MSK-DA01. We next tested each of the four lots of MSK-DA01 for in vivo survival and mDA differentiation. We injected 400,000 cells (n = 4–6 mice per lot) unilaterally into the striatum of severe combined immunodeficient/nonobese diabetic NSG (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtmWjl/SzJ) mice and assessed for survival and phenotypes of grafted cells 3 weeks later. We observed robust human cell survival and formation of well-defined grafts in the striatum, at the site of injection. The human dopamine neurons in the graft were identified by co-expression of human cytoplasmic marker (STEM121) and TH (Figure S1G). FOXA2 was expressed in the majority of human cells (84.3% ± 10.3%). TH+ cells in the graft were co-labeled with human nuclear antigen (hNA) and FOXA2 (Figure 1C). Most human cells also expressed NURR1 and PITX3 (Figure 1D; Figure S1H), which are critical for the development and maintenance of mDA neurons (Kadkhodaei et al., 2009Kadkhodaei B. Ito T. Joodmardi E. Mattsson B. Rouillard C. Carta M. Muramatsu S. Sumi-Ichinose C. Nomura T. Metzger D. et al.Nurr1 is required for maintenance of maturing and adult midbrain dopamine neurons.J.

No grafted human cells expressed NKX2.1, indicating the cells did not differentiate into hypothalamic fates (Ohyama et al., 2005Ohyama K. Ellis P. Kimura S. Placzek M. Directed differentiation of neural cells to hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons.Development. 2005; 132: 5185-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). POU5F1, a marker of PSC was absent while PAX6 was present very rarely in short-term grafts as well as in vitro assays, indicating that the cells will unlikely form teratoma or neural rosettes in the brain. There were no significant differences in graft volume and percentage of TH-expressing cells among the four lots of MSK-DA01 3 weeks after grafting. We selected lot 2 to perform all studies, as this lot resulted in the highest average graft volume (0.187 mm3) and percentage of TH+ cells (15.91%) at 3 weeks post-grafting. As cells are mDA progenitors when grafted, they are expected to complete their maturation in vivo over time. We next proceeded to perform a long-term efficacy study, with a goal of analyzing the impact of MSK-DA01 on animal behavior in 6-hydroxydopamine (OHDA)-lesioned nude rats (NIH-Foxn1rnu) as well as graft survival and differentiation. We performed the study in our lab under near good lab manufacturing practice (GLP) conditions, as adequate expertise was not available at any external GLP-certified location. We induced hemiparkinsonism in nude rats by stereotactic injection of 6-OHDA in the median forebrain bundle (Kriks et al., 2011Kriks S. Shim J.W. Piao J. Ganat Y.M. Wakeman D.R. Xie Z. Carrillo-Reid L. Auyeung G. Antonacci C. Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Amphetamine-induced rotational testing was performed at 4 and 6 weeks (±1 week). Rats exhibiting more than six rotations per minute were selected for inclusion in the efficacy study. Forty-four rats were separated randomly into a cell group (n = 28, male/female ratio [M/F] = 1:1) and a vehicle group (n = 16, M/F = 1:1). Freshly thawed MSK-DA01 cells (day 16) passed an empirical pre-established viability threshold (>70%) and were suspended at a concentration of 100,000 ± 10,000 cells/μL. Animals received 400,000 cells or vehicle in 4 μL via stereotactic injection at four deposits along a single track in the striatum. Cell viability showed some decrease at the end of grafting (less than 5 h from thaw time) but remained above 70% (Figure S2A). There was no correlation between graft volumes and the time of injection after initial cell thawing (r = −0.2797, p = 0.1577). We replaced one female in the cell group because of a premature withdrawal of the injection needle during the procedure, resulting in a total of 29 rats receiving graft injections (14 male and 15 female rats). Animals underwent behavioral testing at 2, 4, 5, 6.5, and 8 months (±1 week) post-grafting (Figure 2A). There was a significant decrease in rotation scores at 5 months post-grafting. Rotations per minute were down to −1.4 (median for all rats) at 8 months after transplantation compared with a median of +14.6 in the vehicle group. Animals were euthanized and their brains analyzed by independent pathologists at a contractor site (Charles River Laboratories). In the vehicle group, there were no human cells and no dopaminergic innervation in the lesioned striatum. Grafted animals showed human TH+ cells at the injection site (Figure 2B). Stereological estimates (physical dissector) of the total number of human cells showed a median of 0.53 million cells in male rats and 0.46 million cells in female rats (Figure 2C). Graft volume analysis showed a median of 16.60 mm3 in males and 14.62 mm3 in females, a difference that was not statistically significant (Figure 2D). There was a strong correlation and linear regression between human cell number and graft volume in all animals (Figure 2E). Large well-differentiated human dopamine neurons were observed in the graft (Figure 2F), extending their processes into the surrounding tissues (Figure 2G; Figure S2F). Human dopamine neurons (hNA+TH+) amounted to an average of 49,250 cells in males and 42,480 cells in females (Figure 2H). Two male rats had small grafts (23,484 and 115,092 surviving human cells, respectively) and a correspondingly small number of TH cells (1,250 and 2,500 cells); these animals were also the only two rats that did not show significant behavioral recovery, suggesting that fewer than 2,500 grafted human TH+ cells cannot support recovery of motor asymmetry in rats. As expected, the number of human TH+ cells correlated with the total number of human cells in all animals (Figure S2B). The percentage of TH+ cells in hNA+ cells was not different between genders (Figure S2C). To evaluate the proliferation of grafted cells, we performed IHC for hNA and Ki67 (Figure 2I). The percentage of Ki67 in hNA+ cells was very low in both male (average at 0.61%) and female (average at 0.68%) animals (Figure 2J). There was no obvious correlation between the percentage of Ki67+ cells and the number of hNA+ cells (Figure S2D) or graft volume (data not shown). About 67.78% hNA+Ki67+ cells expressed FOXA2 (Figure 2I). IHC for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) was negative (Figures 2K and 2L), suggesting the absence of human serotonergic or GABAergic neurons, respectively. Two female grafted rats developed flank masses at 22 and 32 weeks after transplantation but remained well. The rats were euthanized at the scheduled time and underwent a necropsy. The masses were identified histologically as mammary fibroadenomas (Figure S2E) and had no human cells (hNA) (data not shown); they were ruled as spontaneous benign tumors, known to occur in laboratory rats (Percy and Barthold, 2001Percy D. Barthold S. Pathology of Laboratory Rodents and Rabbits. Iowa State University Press, 2001Google Scholar). In addition, four rats had to be terminated earlier than scheduled (Table S2). Those rats were not included in the data analysis described above, because of the discrepancy in the endpoints. However, full necropsy was performed independently by the Veterinary Pathology Services at our institution, including histological evaluation of an extensive list of organs (>30). The cause of death of three animals was infection in multiple organs, while one male rat had trauma due to an attack by its cage mate; all deaths were ruled unrelated to the grafts. Two of these animals, which were from the graft group, exhibited surviving human TH neurons in the striatum (Figure S2F), with absent POU5F1 (Figure S2G), a small number of Ki67 cells (Figure S2H), and no evidence of abnormal graft histology (Figure S2I). We conducted large-scale biodistribution, toxicology, and tumorigenicity studies under GLP conditions. The studies were designed by our team and conducted at an outside contracted facility (WuXI-Apptec, St. Paul, MN). MSK-DA01 cells were grafted into 6- to 8-week-old normal NSG mice. We used two doses for the biodistribution (n = 10 per dose group, M/F = 1:1) and toxicology studies (n = 20 per dose group, M/F = 1:1): a lower dose of 200,000 cells in 2 μL and a higher dose of 400,000 cells in 4 μL; a third group received vehicle only. An additional mouse group (n = 10, M/F = 1:1) was added to the study as a potential source of replacement should any mouse die or require termination. Our target dose in rats was 400,000 cells, and we recognize that this dose and volume are too large for a mouse brain. However, to maximize our chances to reveal a potential safety signal, we used the maximally feasible dose of 400,000 cells. The animals were separated randomly, and there was no significant difference in weight among all the groups in both studies. On each day of grafting, MSK-DA01 cells were thawed and reconstituted to 100,000 ± 10,000 cells/μL. Cell viability at initial thaw, pre-transplantation, and post-transplantation exceeded our preset threshold of >70% (Figure S3A). A few animals did not have any graft, probably for technical reasons, and were not included in the analysis (see STAR Methods; Table S4). Biodistribution was assessed in an array of tissues collected on days 30 and 180, by qPCR for human-specific Alu repeat sequences. The collected tissues included liver, blood, lungs with mainstem bronchi, bone marrow, axillary lymph nodes, brain near the injection site, spinal cord, spleen, heart, kidneys, and any visible abnormality. Sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR assay were determined prior to the start of the study. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 0.303 genome copies for all samples, with the exceptions that LOQ was 1.51"

However, their huge genome sizes have hindered understanding of this key transition in evolution. Here, we report a 40-Gb chromosome-level assembly of the African lungfish (Protopterus annectens) genome, which is the largest genome assembly ever reported and has a contig and chromosome N50 of 1.60 Mb and 2.81 Gb, respectively. The large size of the lungfish genome is due mainly to retrotransposons. Genes with ultra-long length show similar expression levels to other genes, indicating that lungfishes have evolved high transcription efficacy to keep gene expression balanced. Together with transcriptome and experimental data, we identified potential genes and regulatory elements related to such terrestrial adaptation traits as pulmonary surfactant, anxiolytic ability, pentadactyl limbs, and pharyngeal remodeling.

The continuous increase in the oxygen content of the Earth’s atmosphere during the Paleozoic era created conditions for the emergence of terrestrial animals (Hsia et al., 2013Hsia C.C. Schmitz A.

The water-to-land transition of vertebrates required the evolution of a series of body innovations (Ashley-Ross et al., 2013Ashley-Ross M.A. Hsieh S.T. Gibb A.C. Blob R.W.

The respiratory, sensory, locomotory, circulatory, and other systems had to be remodeled for terrestrial adaptation (Long and Gordon, 2004Long J.A. Gordon M.S.

In recent decades, paleontological studies have led to a progressive clarification of the process by which vertebrates emerged onto land (Clack, 2012Clack J.A. Gaining Ground, The Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods.Second Edition. Indiana University Press, 2012Google Scholar). As an important complementary approach, a study of comparative genomics in tetrapods and their living sister lineages would provide pivotal perspectives to reveal the transition process and underlying molecular mechanisms. Tetrapods are nested within the tetrapodmorphs, one of the three living sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) lineages that also include coelacanths and lungfishes (Lu et al., 2012Lu J. Zhu M. Long J.A. Zhao W. Senden T.J. Jia L. Qiao T. The earliest known stem-tetrapod from the Lower Devonian of China.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Lungfishes, as the closest living relative of tetrapods, highlight ancestral state of the lobe-finned fishes that have remained in the water (Amemiya et al., 2013Amemiya C.T. Alföldi J. Lee A.P. Fan S. Philippe H. Maccallum I. Braasch I. Manousaki T. Schneider I. Rohner N. et al.The African coelacanth genome provides insights into tetrapod evolution.Nature. 2013; 496: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), representing a bridge to understanding the genetic basis and evolutionary process of these transitions. However, the large size of lungfishes’ genomes, ranging from 40–130 gigabases (Gb) (Metcalfe et al., 2012Metcalfe C.J. Filée J. Germon I. Joss J. Casane D. Evolution of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri) genome: a major role for CR1 and L2 LINE elements.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 3529-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), has posed a huge challenge in relevant studies. In this study, we successfully obtained a 40-Gb chromosome-level genome assembly with a high level of completeness and continuity for the African lungfish (Protopterus annectens) and conducted systematic analysis, from genomic sequences, expression profiles spanning most tissues, to experimental validation of some genes and regulatory elements, in order to explore the evolutionary genetic process from water to land ∼420 million years ago (Ma) (Zhu et al., 2009Zhu M. Zhao W. Jia L. Lu J. Qiao T. Qu Q. The oldest articulated osteichthyan reveals mosaic gnathostome characters.Nature. 2009; 458: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). From Kmer analysis with short reads (Figure S1A) and flow cytometry (Figure S1B), the size of the African lungfish genome is estimated to be around 40 Gb. We sequenced long reads (∼50× coverage, N50 read length 28.48Kb) using Oxford nanopore sequencing technology (ONT) (Figure S1C; Table S1). Combined with short-reads sequencing, optical maps, and Hi-C technology, we got a chromosome assembly with 17 chromosomes (Figure S1D), ranging from 862 Mb to 5.28 Gb, and 12,640 small unplaced scaffolds (totally, 126 Mb). The final length of the assembly is 40.05 Gb, with an N50 of 2.8 Gb (Table 1). The number and length of the assembled chromosomes are consistent with the lungfish karyotype (Figure S1E) (Suzuki and Yamanaka, 1988Suzuki A. Yamanaka K. Chromosomes of an African Lungfish, Protopterus annectens.Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B. 1988; 64: 119-121Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). More than 97.3% and 95.2% of the genomic regions could be covered 20-fold by long and short reads, respectively (Figure S1F). In addition, for the short pair reads, 96.6% of them could be properly paired, indicating a high level of continuity of the assembly. A total of 178 ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) across bony fishes were then used to assess the completeness of the assembly, and 171 (96.07%) of them could be aligned to the assembly. By comparison, 169 and 158 could be aligned to the coelacanth (Amemiya et al., 2013Amemiya C.T. Alföldi J. Lee A.P. Fan S. Philippe H. Maccallum I. Braasch I. Manousaki T. Schneider I.

Based on the transcript dataset and homologous proteins of vertebrates, we identified 19,457 protein-coding genes in the genome, containing 95.4% of complete conserved orthologs within vertebrates and 92.0% of complete conserved orthologs within tetrapods, based on BUSCO analysis (Table 1) (Seppey et al., 2019Seppey M. Manni M. Zdobnov E.M. BUSCO: Assessing Genome Assembly and Annotation Completeness.Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The similar numbers of genes and Ks distribution between the lungfish and coelacanth/axolotl/frog (Figure S1G; Table S2) suggest that there has been no recent whole genome duplication (WGD) other than the shared two rounds of WGD from the ancestral vertebrates, and the expansion of transposable elements (TEs) is likely to have been the dominant force resulting in the large genome size in the African lungfish, as we shall show below. We then identified 11,837 1:1 orthologous genes between the lungfish and western clawed frog (Hellsten et al., 2010Hellsten U. Harland R.M. Gilchrist M.J. Hendrix D. Jurka J. Kapitonov V. Ovcharenko I. Putnam N.H. Shu S. Taher L. et al.The genome of the Western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis.Science. 2010; 328: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), which has high quality of chromosome-level genome assembly to examine the chromosomal relationship between the two species. A synteny plot reveals that the homologous chromosomal segments of the two species can be clearly identified (Figure 1A). The phylogenetic relationship reconstructed from 5,149 1:1 orthologous genes in eight vertebrate species confirmed that the lungfishes are the closest sister lineage to tetrapods (Figure 1B). Although the bootstrap value of the concatenated gene trees receives 100% support, there exists extensive heterogeneity in the topologies of single gene trees (Figure S1H), indicating some extent of incomplete lineage sorting during early divergence of lobe-finned animals. The time of divergence of lungfishes and tetrapods is estimated to be 419 Ma (Figure 1B), about the beginning of the Devonian period. Through inference of recent demographic history, we found that the population of this African lungfish experienced a rapid decline around 1 Ma (Figure 1C), consistent with a previous study that reported a long-term period of aridification in the Limpopo catchment of South Africa, which is an important habitat for the African lungfish, in the past 1 Ma (Caley et al., 2018Caley T. Extier T. Collins J.A. Schefuß E. Dupont L. Malaizé B. Rossignol L. Souron A. McClymont E.L. Jimenez-Espejo F.J. et al.A two-million-year-long hydroclimatic context for hominin evolution in southeastern Africa.Nature. 2018; 560: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also re-sequenced another lungfish individual and validated the demographic dynamics result. The expansion of the lungfish genome size was caused mainly by proliferation of TEs. A total of 61.7% of the lungfish genome was annotated as repeated sequences, representing 24.7 Gb (Figure 2A). Around 15 Gb of the entire genome was annotated as neither functional nor repeat sequences. These regions are most likely to represent an ancient burst of transposition followed by a long period of degeneration, resulting in very large numbers of unique sequences, a so-called “cemetery of TEs” (Sirijovski et al., 2005Sirijovski N. Woolnough C. Rock J. Joss J.M. NfCR1, the first non-LTR retrotransposon characterized in the Australian lungfish genome, Neoceratodus forsteri, shows similarities to CR1-like elements.J. Exp. Zoolog. B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2005; 304: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The most abundant TE types are long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs, 11.5 Gb), long terminal repeats (LTRs, 7.7 Gb), and DNA transposons (3.7 Gb). Among them, LINE/CR1 (7.8 Gb) and LTR/DIRS (6.1 Gb) are the two subclasses forming the highest proportion. We then estimated historical TE expansion activity by analyzing the Kimura distance (Chalopin et al., 2015Chalopin D. Naville M. Plard F. Galiana D. Volff J.-N. Comparative analysis of transposable elements highlights mobilome diversity and evolution in vertebrates.Genome Biol. Evol. 2015; 7: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the results suggest that TEs, especially retrotransposons, have been active within the last 70 million years (Myr) (Figure S2A). The recent activity of these TEs accounts for 5.9 Gb, with a peak expansion rate of 433 Mb per Myr, indicating that the genome size of the African lungfish has gradually increased over the past hundred Myr, consistent with previous work showing gradual increase in cell size over the Phanerozoic (Thomson, 1972Thomson K.S.

The constant insertion of TEs may have impact on genome content and gene regulation. The mean and median intron lengths are very long in the African lungfish, and almost 16 Gb of the genome are intronic regions. The longest gene in the lungfish is 18 Mb, much longer than the ones in axolotl (6.7 Mb) and human (2.5 Mb). There are only 91 genes longer than 1 Mb in the human genome, but more than 5,000 in the lungfish. In contrast, the mean exon number and exon length are similar in the lungfish and other vertebrates, and species-specific gene family expansion in the African lungfish is at a similar level to other vertebrates (Table S2). By inspecting transcriptome data, we found that there is no obvious correlation between gene expression level and gene length; even genes with length greater than 1 Mb exhibit similar expression levels to those of other shorter genes (Figure S2B). We also found that changes in gene length did not have any great impact on gene expression in the African lungfish when compared to other species (Figure S2C). These results indicate that transcription efficacy for extra-long genes might have improved in the lungfish in order to keep gene expression balanced. The TE content of the African lungfish is very different from the case of the axolotl assembly, whose genome size is 32 Gb (Figure 2A). Consistently, their domain contents are also different (Figure S2D). When we take a closer look at the distances between different genes of the Hoxa gene cluster, it is clear that intergenic/intronic elongation occurred independently in the African lungfish and the axolotl because they were caused by proliferation of different types of TEs (Figure 2B). These observations are consistent with previous comparative phylogenetic analysis showing that their genome sizes were increased independently (Organ et al., 2016Organ C. Struble M. Canoville A. de Buffrénil V. Laurin M. Macroevolution of genome size in sarcopterygians during the water–land transition.Comptes Rendus Palevol. 2016; 15: 65-73Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Despite their independent genome expansion, both the African lungfish and the axolotl have an enormous number of the domain RVT_1 (Figure 2C), encoding reverse transcriptase, which is always carried by retrotransposons. The number of RVT-1 has a positive correlation with the genome size in 266 vertebrates (Table S3), with more than 5.2 million in the African lungfish and only 61,631 in the mouse, implying that the retrotransposon is a main driver of genome amplification. These RVT_1 domains were found to be broadly distributed throughout the African lungfish genome (Figure S2E), implying that the accumulation process had continued for a long time. We then investigated genome expansion across species by inspecting the intron length of orthologous genes. First, we observed that the increment of intron length of lungfish genes is linearly correlated with the number of RVT_1 domain (Figure 2D), reflecting the important role of retrotransposons in the genome expansion. Second, we observed that the increment of intron length in the African lungfish is positively correlated with that of the orthologous genes of axolotl (Figure 2E), indicating that longer introns have accumulated more TEs. Consistently, we observed a positive correlation between the increment of intron length and the initial intron length (Figure 2F). However, the genes with longer initial intron length tend to have smaller expansion rate (Figure 2G), although their absolute increments are larger (Figure 2F), indicating the selection against extreme extension of gene length. Previous studies have proposed that the red queen hypothesis may explain the relationship between TE activity and repression strategies (Bruno et al., 2019Bruno M. Mahgoub M. Macfarlan T.S.

Zheng J. et al.Genomic Takeover by Transposable Elements in the Strawberry Poison Frog.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2018; 35: 2913-2927PubMed Google Scholar). We detected 16,826 domains in 40 vertebrate species based on PFAM-A database (El-Gebali et al., 2019El-Gebali S. Mistry J. Bateman A. Eddy S.R. Luciani A. Potter S.C. Qureshi M. Richardson L.J. Salazar G.A. Smart A. et al.The Pfam protein families database in 2019.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D427-D432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Among them, only 54 domains have significant positive correlation between the domain counts and genome sizes (Table S4). Twelve of the 54 domains have count larger than 1,000 in the African lungfish. Seven of the 12 domains are associated with TEs, three are zinc-finger protein domains, one is the Filament domain, and one is the KRAB domain. Interestingly, the KRAB domain and one of the zinc-finger protein domains (zf-C2H2) together form the Kruppel-associated box zinc-finger proteins, which had been proved to play an important role in the silencing of transposable elements in embryonic stem cells (Imbeault et al., 2017Imbeault M. Helleboid P.Y. Trono D. KRAB zinc-finger proteins contribute to the evolution of gene regulatory networks.Nature. 2017; 543: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, the lungfish has the highest number of KRAB domains in 266 vertebrates analyzed (Figure 2C; Table S3), and the genes containing KRAB domains (KZFPs) also tend to be highly expressed in the ovary of the lungfish (Figure S2F). This is largely different from the expanded gene families containing RVT_1 that tend to have a low expression level in all tissues including ovary (Figure S2F). This suggests that the red queen hypothesis might hold true for the case of lungfishes because more KRAB domain and high expression of KRAB-domain-containing genes have evolved in the lungfish, possibly to repress TE activity. Taken together, the above results indicate that the African lungfish genome has a sloppy efficacy of dismissing junk DNAs while it has evolved higher TE repression and long gene transcription ability.

Takeda H. Kohara Y. Morishita S. Reconstruction of the vertebrate ancestral genome reveals dynamic genome reorganization in early vertebrates.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). While two fission events were observed from the LCA of bony fishes to the LCA of ray-finned fishes (Table S5), no major chromosomal fusion/fission event was observed during the evolution from the LCA of bony fishes to the LCA of tetrapods (Figure 3A). In addition, we noticed that the proto-chromosomes 11-20 and 13-28 should have been fused independently in the lungfish and spotted gar because they are not fused in chicken, frog, bichir, or shark (Figures 3B and 3C). Similar independent fusions are also observed between the spotted gar and the western clawed frog, and between the lungfish and the bichir (Figures S3A and S3B; Table S5). The presence of shared fusion events in different lineages suggested that the chromosome fusion events might be correlated with certain characteristics of the proto-chromosomes themselves. We identified highly conserved elements (HCEs) in different lineages of bony fishes by using 12 species’ genomes, including cartilaginous fishes, ray-finned fishes, and sarcopterygians. A total of 2,157, 1,191, and 4,916 HCEs were found to be gained by the CA of sarcopterygians, lungfish-tetrapods, and tetrapods, respectively. Besides, 388, 559, and 394 HCEs were lost in the CA of sarcopterygians, lungfish-tetrapods, and tetrapods, respectively, but are present in cartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes. These HCEs contain both conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) and coding elements. Moreover, from the transcriptomes of 220 samples of nine tissues of five species, including alligator gar, bichir, lungfish, frog, and mouse (Bi et al., 2021Bi X. Wang K. Yang L. Pan H. Jiang H. Wei Q. Fang M. Yu H. Zhu C.

The most significant cases of these HCEs and specifically expressed genes will be discussed in the following sections.

A previous study suggested that the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio (μg/μg) in surfactants is much higher in ray-finned fishes (∼0.2–0.27) than in African lungfishes and tetrapods (∼0.05–0.075) (Daniels and Orgeig, 2003Daniels C.B. Orgeig S. Pulmonary surfactant: the key to the evolution of air breathing.News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 151-157PubMed Google Scholar). The role of cholesterol is subtle, in that it can confer the correct fluidity and viscosity upon pulmonary surfactant (Orgeig and Daniels, 2001Orgeig S. Daniels C.B. The roles of cholesterol in pulmonary surfactant: insights from comparative and evolutionary studies.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 129: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), while an excess of cholesterol inhibits surfactant function (Leonenko et al., 2007Leonenko Z. Gill S. Baoukina S. Monticelli L.

J. 2007; 93: 674-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To alleviate this conflict, the surfactant protein C (SP-C) is helpful in sustaining the presence of cholesterol in surfactant without functional impairment (Gómez-Gil et al., 2009Gómez-Gil L. Schürch D. Goormaghtigh E. Pérez-Gil J.

The gene Sftpc, which encodes SP-C, was found to be originated via duplication, since the MRCA of sarcopterygians and then further duplications resulted in three copies in the African lungfish (Figure 4A). Our in situ hybridization results show clear evidence that they are indeed expressed in lungs of lungfishes (Figure 4B) and thus may function in regulating pulmonary surfactant. In line with the newly evolved Sftpc genes, there are three genes that are highly expressed in the lungs of African lungfishes, African clawed"
https://openalex.org/W3129061869,"Human pluripotent stem cells show considerable promise for applications in regenerative medicine, including the development of cell replacement paradigms for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Protocols have been developed to generate authentic midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons capable of reversing dopamine-related deficits in animal models of Parkinson's disease. However, the generation of mDA neurons at clinical scale suitable for human application remains an important challenge. Here, we present an mDA neuron derivation protocol based on a two-step WNT signaling activation strategy that improves expression of midbrain markers, such as Engrailed-1 (EN1), while minimizing expression of contaminating posterior (hindbrain) and anterior (diencephalic) lineage markers. The resulting neurons exhibit molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological properties of mDA neurons. Cryopreserved mDA neuron precursors can be successfully transplanted into 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) lesioned rats to induce recovery of amphetamine-induced rotation behavior. The protocol presented here is the basis for clinical-grade mDA neuron production and preclinical safety and efficacy studies."
https://openalex.org/W3127582959,"Rich fossil evidence suggests that many traits and functions related to terrestrial evolution were present long before the ancestor of lobe- and ray-finned fishes. Here, we present genome sequences of the bichir, paddlefish, bowfin, and alligator gar, covering all major early divergent lineages of ray-finned fishes. Our analyses show that these species exhibit many mosaic genomic features of lobe- and ray-finned fishes. In particular, many regulatory elements for limb development are present in these fishes, supporting the hypothesis that the relevant ancestral regulation networks emerged before the origin of tetrapods. Transcriptome analyses confirm the homology between the lung and swim bladder and reveal the presence of functional lung-related genes in early ray-finned fishes. Furthermore, we functionally validate the essential role of a jawed vertebrate highly conserved element for cardiovascular development. Our results imply the ancestors of jawed vertebrates already had the potential gene networks for cardio-respiratory systems supporting air breathing."

The receptor binds mannose, fucose, or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues on these targets. C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain 4 (CRD4) of the receptor contains the site for Ca2+-dependent interaction with sugars. To investigate the details of CRD4 binding, glycan array screening was used to identify oligosaccharide ligands.

The mechanisms of binding to monosaccharides and oligosaccharide substructures present in many of these ligands were examined in multiple crystal structures of CRD4. Binding of mannose residues to CRD4 results primarily from interaction of the equatorial 3- and 4-OH groups with a conserved principal Ca2+ common to almost all sugar-binding C-type CRDs. In the Manα1-2Man complex, supplementary interactions with the reducing mannose residue explain the enhanced affinity for this disaccharide.

Binding to the receptor leads to endocytosis of these ligands, resulting in rapid and efficient clearance of glycoproteins from circulation. The ability of the mannose receptor to facilitate uptake of glycoproteins bearing high-mannose oligosaccharides is used to target therapeutic glycoproteins to macrophages, particularly in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases (8Brady R.O.

Myeloid C-type lectin receptors in viral recognition and antiviral immunity.Viruses. 2017; 9: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These diverse ligands are bound to three different types of protein domains in the extracellular portion of the mannose receptor (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain is an R-type carbohydrate-recognition domain, related in sequence and structure to the sugar-binding portion of ricin (14Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Misulovin Z. Leteux C. Feizi T. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of the cysteine-rich domain of mannose receptor complexed with a sulfated carbohydrate ligand.J. Exp.

The molecular mechanism of sulfated carbohydrate recognition by the cysteine-rich domain of mannose receptor.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This domain binds to 4-sulfo-GalNAc residues that are displayed at the nonreducing ends of glycans on specific glycoproteins, including luteinizing hormone (18Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. A cysteine-rich domain of the ""mannose"" receptor mediates GalNAc-4-SO4 binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The adjacent fibronectin type II domain binds to fragments of collagens that contain triple helical regions (16Paracuellos P. Briggs D.C. Carafoli F. Loncar T. Hohenester E.

Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Collagen binding by the mannose receptor mediated through the fibronectin type II domain.Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The remainder of the extracellular portion of the receptor consists of eight C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs2). CTLDs 4 and 5 account for most of the sugar-binding activity, and CTLD4 is the only one of the CTLDs that binds sugars in the absence of other domains (13Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. Contribution to ligand binding by multiple carbohydrate-recognition domains in the macrophage mannose receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Structural requirements for high affinity binding of complex ligands by the macrophage mannose receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two domains are therefore usually designated carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) 4 and 5. Interaction of these domains with mannose-containing oligosaccharides accounts for binding of the receptor to lysosomal enzymes, nonhelical fragments of collagen, and viral glycoproteins and can also account for binding to mannose residues on the surfaces of other pathogens. Internalization of ligands is mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles for trafficking to endosomes and lysosomes. The mannose receptor is a prototype for a family of proteins that have similar domain organization. The other three members of the family are Endo180, also known as urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein or uPARAP, the phospholipase A2 receptor, and DEC-205 (21Taylor M.E. Evolution of a family of receptors containing multiple motifs resembling carbohydrate-recognition domains.Glycobiology. 1997; 7: R5-R8Crossref Google Scholar). All four proteins are conserved throughout mammalian evolution. The endothelial receptor Endo180 is the only other member of the family with sugar-binding activity, but in this case it is CTLD2 that binds selectively to GlcNAc residues (22East L. Rushton S. Taylor M.E. Isacke C.M. Characterization of sugar binding by the mannose receptor family member, Endo-180.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50469-50475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previous binding studies of the interactions of mannose receptor CRD4, performed by competition binding assays and by NMR titration, revealed binding to a range of monosaccharides including mannose, GlcNAc, and glucose (23Hitchen P.G. Mullin N.P. Taylor M.E. Orientation of sugars bound to the principal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain of the macrophage mannose receptor.Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These sugars all have adjacent, equatorial 3- and 4-OH groups that can interact with Ca2+ in C-type CRDs, as originally described for serum mannose-binding protein (26Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of a C-type mannose-binding protein complexed with an oligosaccharide.Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Like binding sites in many C-type CRDs that bind these sugars, CRD4 also binds to fucose but not to galactose. Studies of the overall conformation of the extracellular domain of the mannose receptor have been undertaken by electron microscopy and the structure of the N-terminal R-type CRD, fibronectin type II repeat, and first three CTLDs has been determined by X-ray crystallography (17Hu Z.

These results have provided information about the relative positions of the different domains, but ligands were not present so there was no information about how sugars are bound. Crystal structures of the R-type CRD with 4-sulfo-GalNAc and other sulfated sugars have been obtained (14Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Misulovin Z. Leteux C. Feizi T. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J.

Biol. 2001; 305: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interactions observed are consistent with the observed affinities for different ligands. In crystals of a fragment containing CRD4, a domain swap occurred between two copies of the CRD, which precluded ligand binding (29Feinberg H. Park-Snyder S. Kolatkar A.R. Heise C.T. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Structure of a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain from the macrophage mannose receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21539-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NMR analysis of ligand binding, combined with extensive mutagenesis of CRD4 and molecular modeling, has provided insights into the likely arrangement of key residues near to the binding site (23Hitchen P.G. Mullin N.P. Taylor M.E. Orientation of sugars bound to the principal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain of the macrophage mannose receptor.Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Mullin N.P. Hitchen P.G. Taylor M.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, up to now there has been no high-resolution structural information about the mode of sugar binding to this key domain. In the present studies, binding competition experiments, glycan array analysis, and X-ray crystallography have been used to define the binding selectivity of CRD4 and the molecular mechanisms by which this selectivity is achieved. In an effort to increase yields and generate novel crystal forms of CRD4 that avoid formation of domain-swapped dimers seen in previous experiments, the expression construct was modified by changing the expression system and removing potentially flexible regions. Interdomain linkers on either side of CRD4 were retained in the CRD4 expression system employed previously, in which the ompA signal sequence was used to direct CRD4 to the periplasm of Escherichia coli to facilitate disulfide bond formation (24Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. Characterization of ligand binding to a carbohydrate-recognition domain of the macrophage mannose receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these earlier experiments, folded CRD4 was extracted from the periplasm and purified by affinity chromatography. To increase the yield of protein in the present studies, CRD4 was expressed in a T7-based system without a signal sequence. In this system, placing the sequence MetAla at the N terminus leads to cleavage of the methionine residue within the bacteria to yield a free N-terminal alanine residue, which represents a minimal modification of the natural protein sequence. The connecting sequences at either end of CRD4, which are proline-rich and contain potential O-linked glycosylation sites, may be quite flexible in conformation (30Napper C.E. Dyson M.H. Taylor M.E. An extended conformation of the macrophage mannose receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14759-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the length of the expression construct was reduced based on the structure deduced in the earlier studies (29Feinberg H. Park-Snyder S. Kolatkar A.R. Heise C.T. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Structure of a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain from the macrophage mannose receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21539-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), with the goal of facilitating crystallization in alternative lattice arrangements while retaining an active CRD. Initially, residues at the N and C termini were removed if they were not seen in all copies of the protomer in the earlier crystal structures (Fig. 2A). Thus, the N-terminal sequence of the purified, modified protein is AlaCys. This cysteine residue is linked in a disulfide bond, so the new version represents the minimum N-terminal sequence compatible with correct formation of all of the disulfide bonds. At the C terminus, residues up to the sequence CysGlnIleGln are visible in all copies in the earlier crystal structures. However, while the side chain of the isoleucine residue points inward, the C-terminal glutamine residue points mostly away from the protein surface. Therefore, the expression construct, designated “trimmed CRD4,” was terminated with the sequence CysGlnIle. A minimal CRD4, generated by further N-terminal truncation, lacks most of the residues up to the first β strand seen in the original crystals. As part of this truncation, a cysteine residue was deleted, so the cysteine residue that would normally be paired with this residue was mutated to alanine. Expression of these modified CRD4 constructs without a signal sequence resulted in formation of inclusion bodies that were dissolved in guanidine and dialyzed to allow renaturation and disulfide bond formation. The folded proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose (Fig. 2, B and C). The fact that the minimal CRD4 can be purified by affinity chromatography on a sugar ligand confirms that it retains a functional ligand-binding site. A biotin-tagged version of the trimmed CRD4 was also generated by appending a biotinylation target sequence onto the C terminus (Fig. 2A). Biotinylation of the single lysine residue in this sequence can be catalyzed by biotin ligase in the bacterial cytoplasm. The biotinylated CRD, purified by affinity chromatography, was immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates for binding assays. In addition, the biotinylated CRD was incubated with fluorescently labeled streptavidin to form a tetrameric complex, which was repurified by affinity chromatography for use in screening a glycan array (Fig. 2D). Two independent screenings of the glycan array developed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (31Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. et al.Printed covalent glycan array for ligand profiling of diverse glycan binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), which contains 601 oligosaccharides, gave very similar results, with the same ligands giving the strongest signals, although the relative intensities showed small variations in a few cases (Tables S1 and S2). Almost all of the oligosaccharides giving strong signals contain either mannose or fucose residues at the nonreducing termini (Fig. 3). All of the mannose-containing ligands are substructures of a Man9 high-mannose oligosaccharide. For comparison, the relative rank and structures of the remaining high-mannose oligosaccharides on the array are also shown in Figure 3. The six high-mannose glycans with the strongest signals all contain terminal Manα1-2Man linkages, and only one glycan with Manα1-2Man linkage is ranked further down, at position 39. In general, the signals for mannose-containing oligosaccharides decrease with increasing size. This trend may reflect preferential binding to the Manα1-2Man epitope, which might become less accessible on larger glycans as a result of conformational differences or steric clashes with additional substituents. The epitopes may also become less abundant as space restricts the density of larger glycans on the array. The mannose receptor can be targeted with a range of mammalian N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides on glycoproteins, and experiments in knock-out mice confirm its role in clearance of such glycoproteins (7Lee S.J.

The array results are also consistent with binding of CRD4 to glycans on the surfaces of microorganisms, such as yeast mannans and mannose-capped lipo-arabinomannans of mycobacteria, which contain Manα1-2Man units (32Shibata N.

Fucose is likely to be the main binding determinant in most of the remaining ligands, based on evidence that fucose competes for binding to the receptor and to a CRD4-5 fragment, while other sugars in some of the oligosaccharides, such as galactose, are poor ligands (13Taylor M.E.

Survey of immune-related mannose/fucose-binding C-type lectin receptors reveals widely divergent sugar-binding specificities.Glycobiology. 2011; 21: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). There is no simple pattern to the fucose-containing ligands. Ligands that bind strongly include fucose in α1-2, α1-3, and α1-4 linkage, although the α1-4 linkage, as in the Lewis-a trisaccharide in glycans 6, 8, 11, 12, 20, and 21, is somewhat more common. Glycan 4, which lacks galactose, binds better than any of the trisaccharides. These results suggest that, as in the case of the mannose-containing ligands, the binding epitope is likely to be relatively simple. Other larger glycans that contain terminal fucose with these linkages give considerably weaker signals. Comparison of N-linked glycans in which the chitobiose core is fucosylated or not fucosylated also does not reveal any significant contribution to binding by the core fucose in α1-6 linkage. As with the mannose-containing ligands, these results may indicate that larger glycans decrease the ability of the binding fucose residue to access the binding site, perhaps because of steric occlusion by the rest of the glycan. Some additional glycans that do not have exposed mannose or fucose residues show binding to CRD4. Glycan 23 contains three terminal GlcNAc residues and other glycans containing one or more terminal GlcNAc residues also rank relatively high at 30, 32–34, 38, 41, and 51–52, with more in the top 100 ligands. These results, showing some binding but generally less than for mannose- and fucose-terminated glycans, are consistent with weaker binding to GlcNAc seen in binding competition assays (23Hitchen P.G. Mullin N.P. Taylor M.E. Orientation of sugars bound to the principal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain of the macrophage mannose receptor.Biochem.

The α anomer is ranked at position 593, and several disaccharides that contain β-linked glucuronic acid residues do not show binding above background. Thus, it is not clear whether the binding to glycan 16 represents a biologically meaningful interaction. Two of the ligands for CRD4 identified in the array screening contain sulfated sugars, although binding of ligands 20 and 21 (Fig. 3B) can be explained by the presence of exposed fucose residues in the Lewis-a configuration. In contrast to these results, screening of an earlier version of the array with an Fc chimera that contained the entire extracellular portion of the mannose receptor showed binding to many different sulfated oligosaccharides (36Hsu T.-L. Cheng S.-C. Yang W.-B. Chin S.-W. Chen B.-H. Huang M.-T. Hsieh S.-L. Wong C.-H. Profiling carbohydrate-receptor interaction with recombinant innate immunity receptor-Fc fusion proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34479-34489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Binding to these additional sulfated ligands is probably mediated by the N-terminal R-type CRD, which is known to bind the physiological 4-sulfo-GalNAc ligand (18Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. A cysteine-rich domain of the ""mannose"" receptor mediates GalNAc-4-SO4 binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present results confirm that binding to most sulfated oligosaccharides is not through CRD4. In order to investigate the mechanism of binding of sugars to CRD4, the trimmed version of CRD4 (Fig. 2A) was used to screen for suitable crystallization conditions in the presence of various ligands. A total of eight different crystal forms with different unit cells and/or different space groups were obtained with different combinations of ligands and crystallization conditions (Table S3). In the following descriptions, each of the different crystal forms, distinguished by the space group symmetry and unit cell parameters (Table S4), is indicated by the number appended to the ligand name. Thus, αMeMan/1 and αMeMan/2 are two crystal forms of CRD4 bound to αMeMan, whereas αMeMan/3 and Lewis-a/3 are different ligand complexes that crystallized in the same crystal form and thus have the same unit cell and symmetry. Data were collected at 1.2–1.75 Ǻ for the various crystals forms (Table S4), and the final refined structures had Rcryst values of 13.4–18.9 and Rfree values of 15.7–22.0 (Table S5). In all of the structures, residues from 641 to residue 761 at the C terminus are visible and this portion of the CRD adopts a similar conformation in all of the structures (Fig. 4A). This result is consistent with the demonstration that the truncated, minimal CRD starting at re"

Effectors can be recognized by plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors, initiating an immune response. The AVR-Pik effector from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is recognized by a pair of rice NLR receptors, Pik-1 and Pik-2. Pik-1 contains a noncanonical integrated heavy-metal-associated (HMA) domain, which directly binds AVR-Pik to activate plant defenses. The host targets of AVR-Pik are also HMA-domain-containing proteins, namely heavy-metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) and heavy-metal-associated plant proteins (HPPs). Here, we demonstrate that one of these targets interacts with a wider set of AVR-Pik variants compared with the Pik-1 HMA domains. We define the biochemical and structural basis of the interaction between AVR-Pik and OsHIPP19 and compare the interaction to that formed with the HMA domain of Pik-1. Using analytical gel filtration and surface plasmon resonance, we show that multiple AVR-Pik variants, including the stealthy variants AVR-PikC and AVR-PikF, which do not interact with any characterized Pik-1 alleles, bind to OsHIPP19 with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of OsHIPP19 in complex with AVR-PikF reveals differences at the interface that underpin high-affinity binding of OsHIPP19-HMA to a wider set of AVR-Pik variants than achieved by the integrated HMA domain of Pik-1. Our results provide a foundation for engineering the HMA domain of Pik-1 to extend binding to currently unrecognized AVR-Pik variants and expand disease resistance in rice to divergent pathogen strains.

Phytopathogens constrain crop production and threaten global food security. The filamentous ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is the causative agent of rice blast disease, which annually destroys enough rice to feed upward of 200 million people for a year (1Wilson R.A.

In addition to rice, strains of M. oryzae can infect and cause blast disease on other staple food crops such as wheat, barley and millet, and various wild grass species (5Kato H. Yamamoto M.

During infection, phytopathogens deliver effector proteins to the plant apoplast and to the inside of host cells. These effectors function in diverse ways to suppress immunity and manipulate endogenous processes to create favorable conditions for colonization.

For most M. oryzae effectors described to date, the mechanism by which they promote fungal virulence remains unknown. The presence of some effectors inside host cells can be detected by specific nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat domain containing proteins (NLRs) (14Jones J.D.G. Vance R.E. Dangl J.L. Intracellular innate immune surveillance devices in plants and animals.Science. 2016; 354aaf6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). NLRs are intracellular immune receptors, which instigate defensive signaling pathways following perception of a specific effector protein, either through direct interaction with the effector or through monitoring the state of an intermediate protein (15Jones J.D.G.

OsHIPP19 (LOC_Os04g39350) and OsHIPP20 (LOC_Os04g39010) are members of the heavy-metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein (HIPP) family (39de Abreu-Neto J.B.

All four proteins contain an N-terminal HMA domain, and OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20 have a CααX isoprenylation motif (-CSIM) at their C termini (Fig. 1). Here, taking a biochemical and structural approach, we characterize the interaction between AVR-Pik and OsHIPP19. We demonstrate that AVR-PikD interacts with the HMA domain of OsHIPP19 with high affinity and that the interaction between AVR-PikD and the HMA domain of OsHIPP19 is tighter than the interactions between AVR-PikD and the integrated HMA domains of Pik-1 alleles. Further, we show that the tight interaction with OsHIPP19 is not unique to AVR-PikD, but is shared with other AVR-Pik variants. Finally, we present the crystal structure of AVR-PikF in complex with the HMA domain of OsHIPP19, revealing differences between the effector-binding surface of OsHIPP19 and that of the NLR protein Pikm-1. Our findings reveal the biochemical and structural basis of a M. oryzae effector protein’s interaction with a putative virulence-associated host target and present opportunities for target-guided engineering of NLR IDs to extend their recognition profile. In an independent study, four small HMA-domain-containing proteins were found to interact with AVR-PikD by yeast two-hybrid analysis (34Oikawa K. Fujisaki K. Shimizu M. Takeda T. Saitoh H.

Of these, we selected OsHIPP19 for further study as it was identified most frequently in the initial yeast two-hybrid screen (34Oikawa K. Fujisaki K. Shimizu M. Takeda T. Saitoh H. Hirabuchi A.

Plants. 2018; 4: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that AVR-PikD would interact with the HMA domain of OsHIPP19. We defined the HMA domain of OsHIPP19 (OsHIPP19-HMA hereafter) as amino acids 1 to 77 inclusive. This domain was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (see Experimental procedures) and used in all subsequent work in vitro. Intact mass spectrometry confirmed a molecular mass of 8323 Da for the purified protein, which exactly matched the theoretical mass. First, we used analytical gel filtration to qualitatively test for interaction between AVR-PikD and OsHIPP19-HMA. When combined, the two proteins coeluted from the column, at an earlier elution volume than observed for either protein alone, demonstrating that AVR-PikD and OsHIPP19-HMA form a complex in vitro (Fig. 2A).

To investigate the affinity of the interaction between AVR-PikD and OsHIPP19-HMA, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR). AVR-PikD was immobilized on a Ni2+-NTA chip via a noncleavable 6xHis tag at the C terminus of the protein. OsHIPP19-HMA, at a range of concentrations between 0.25 nM and 25 nM, was flowed over the chip. A 1:1 binding model was used to fit the data (Fig. 2B) and to estimate the rate constants ka and kd for the interaction (Table S1), from which the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, could be calculated (KD = kd/ka). The KD value obtained from the data shown in Figure 2B was 0.7 nM. Two further replicates were performed with similar results (KD = 0.6 nM and KD = 0.9 nM). We conclude that AVR-PikD binds to OsHIPP19 with nanomolar affinity. The HMA domain of OsHIPP19 shares 51% amino acid sequence identity with the integrated HMA domains of both Pikp-1 and Pikm-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Previous work has shown that AVR-PikD binds to the integrated HMA domains of Pikp-1 and Pikm-1 with nanomolar affinity (29Maqbool A. Saitoh H. Franceschetti M. Stevenson C.E.M. Uemura A. Kanzaki H.

AVR-PikD was immobilized on a Ni2+-NTA chip via a C-terminal 6xHis tag. Three different concentrations of each HMA domain (2 nM, 5 nM, and 20 nM) were flowed over the chip, and the binding (Robs, measured in response units (RU)) was recorded. The Robs for each HMA was then expressed as a percentage of the maximum theoretical response (Rmax) that would be obtained if each immobilized molecule of AVR-PikD was bound to the HMA domain, referred to as %Rmax.

To address this interest and provide a basis for further research, in May 2020, the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series was launched as a new section of the Human Mortality Database. At present, this unique data resource provides weekly mortality death counts and rates by age and sex for 38 countries and regions. The main objective of this paper is to detail the web-based application for visualizing and analyzing the excess mortality based on the Short-term Mortality Fluctuation data series. The application yields a visual representation of the database that enhances the understanding of the underlying data. Besides, it enables the users to explore data on weekly mortality and excess mortality across years and countries. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, to describe a visualization tool that aims to facilitate research on short-term mortality fluctuations. Second, to provide a comprehensive open-source software solution for demographic data to encourage data holders to promote their datasets in a visual framework."
https://openalex.org/W3126288386,"Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of amyloid fibrils. The causative agent is an infectious amyloid that comprises solely misfolded prion protein (PrPSc). Prions can convert normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) to protease K-resistance prion protein fragment (PrP-res) in vitro; however, the intermediate steps involved in this spontaneous conversion still remain unknown. We investigated whether recombinant prion protein (rPrP) can directly convert into PrP-res via liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the absence of PrPSc. We found that rPrP underwent LLPS at the interface of the aqueous two-phase system of polyethylene glycol and dextran, whereas single-phase conditions were not inducible. Fluorescence recovery assay after photobleaching revealed that the liquid–solid phase transition occurred within a short time. The aged rPrP-gel acquired a proteinase-resistant amyloid accompanied by β-sheet conversion, as confirmed by Western blotting, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Congo red staining. The reactions required both the N-terminal region of rPrP (amino acids 23–89) and kosmotropic salts, suggesting that the kosmotropic anions may interact with the N-terminal region of rPrP to promote LLPS.

Thus, structural conversion via LLPS and liquid–solid phase transition could be the intermediate steps in the conversion of prions. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, also called prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, are infectious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases with rapidly progressive dementia (1Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar). Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc), which is spontaneously converted from normal prion protein (PrPC). PrPC is well preserved among mammalian species and is particularly expressed in neurons and tethered to the cell membrane via the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (2Roucou X. Gains M. LeBlanc A.C. Neuroprotective functions of prion protein.J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The protein-only hypothesis proposes that the infectious agent prion is solely composed of PrPSc. The main biochemical characteristics of PrPSc are that it has seeding activity to convert PrPC into itself (PrPSc) and rPrP into protease K-resistance prion protein fragment (PrP-res); both of them have protease K resistance. However, PrP-res does not necessarily correlate with infectivity or seeding activity (3Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G.

Collinge J. Protease-resistant prion protein produced in vitro lacks detectable infectivity.J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This conversion process presumably proceeds via direct interaction between PrPC/rPrP and PrPSc (6Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Pathologic conformations of prion proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Several studies have attempted to generate artificial PrPSc, and the amplification of PrPSc in vitro has been successfully demonstrated using intermittent ultrasonication on brain homogenates (BHs), called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) (7Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Sensitive detection of pathological prion protein by cyclic amplification of protein misfolding.Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 8Castilla J. Morales R. Saá P. Barria M. Gambetti P. Soto C. Cell-free propagation of prion strains.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Not only sonication but also shaking of the protein solution can promote in vitro amyloid formation. The quaking-induced conversion (QuIC) assay is now widely used to detect trace amounts of PrPSc in cerebrospinal fluid using rPrP as a substrate (9Atarashi R. Satoh K. Sano K. Fuse T. Yamaguchi N. Ishibashi D. Matsubara T. Nakagaki T. Yamanaka H. Shirabe S. Yamada M. Mizusawa H. Kitamoto T. Klug G. McGlade A. et al.Ultrasensitive human prion detection in cerebrospinal fluid by real-time quaking-induced conversion.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These lines of experimental evidence suggest that rPrP can be converted to proteinase K (PK)-resistant amyloid (rPrP-res) in the presence of PrPSc, with the provision of kinetic energy. However, to explain spontaneous generation and to generate artificial prions, the spontaneous misfolding process from rPrP to rPrP-res in the absence of PrPSc needs to be elucidated. Recently, proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) have been shown to undergo liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm and form membraneless organelles such as stress granules (10Hyman A.A. Weber C.A. Jülicher F. Liquid-liquid phase separation in biology.Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 39-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The N terminus of PrPC is an IDR comprising five repeats of proline/glycine-rich sequences, which are called octapeptide repeats. In the liquid phase, IDRs assemble to form a cross-β-sheet structure. The aberrant phase transition of amyloidogenic proteins may facilitate pathological amyloid synthesis. This phenomenon has been associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Tau protein in Alzheimer's disease and RNA binding protein FUS in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which are caused by pathogenic amyloids (11Patel A.

Tau protein liquid-liquid phase separation can initiate tau aggregation.EMBO J. 2018; 37: e98049Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the spontaneous process involved in the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc, we examined whether rPrP can convert into rPrP-res or PrPSc via LLPS, without the use of kinetic energy. In this study, we found that the N-terminal region and kosmotropic anions play an important role in LLPS and liquid–solid phase transition of rPrP. Furthermore, rPrP in gels acquired the features of PrP-res with β-sheet–rich structure and protease K resistance. These results suggest that the LLPS and liquid–solid phase transition can initiate spontaneous conformational conversion of rPrP to PrP-res without the use of kinetic energy. In general, polymers such as PEG or dextran are used to induce LLPS of proteins as crowding agents (13Shin Y. Brangwynne C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease.Science. 2017; 357: eaaf4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). First, we tried with a single polymer solution; however, rPrP did not undergo LLPS but resulted in salting out with both PEG and dextran at concentrations greater than 10% (Fig. S1A). Next, we applied aqueous two-phase system (ATPS), which is composed of PEG and dextran because we expected that the stronger volume exclusion effect between two different polymers would induce LLPS of rPrP (14Asenjo J.A. Andrews B.A. Aqueous two-phase systems for protein separation: A perspective.J. Chromatogr. A. 2011; 1218: 8826-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The droplets appeared at the interface of the polymer fractions immediately after mixing 10 μM rPrP with an ATPS mixture containing sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3). We tested combinations of various concentrations of the polymers and investigated where ATPS was able to form an interface (15Lu A.X. Oh H. Terrell J.L. Bentley W.E. Raghavan S.R.

Aqueous two-phase system (ATPS): An overview and advances in its applications.Biol. Proced. Online. 2016; 18: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Below the binodal curve, no droplet was formed at the interface of the ATPS. Under such conditions (PEG/dextran: 2%–4%/2%–4%), rPrP precipitated as amorphous aggregates at the bottom of wells after 24 h of incubation (Fig. S1B). With 6%/6% PEG/dextran, spherical droplets were observed at the interface of ATPS and the bottom of the well, some of them were puddle-like and slightly Thioflavin T (ThT) positive, and the amorphous aggregates were also visualized by ThT. These fresh droplets were visualized by ThT immediately after formation, suggesting that β-sheet formation of rPrP was initiated. Of note, the PEG or dextran droplets in ATPS did not stain with ThT. The ThT-positive droplets appeared even more efficiently with 9%/9% PEG/dextran (Figs. 1B, S1B). Quantification of ThT fluorescence intensity showed that 9%/9% of PEG/dextran had the highest fluorescence intensity after 24 h of incubation (Fig. S1C). Therefore, we set the experimental conditions of 9%/9% PEG/dextran with 120 mM Na2S2O3 in the experiments that followed, unless mentioned otherwise. The ThT-positive aggregates appeared to correlate with the concentration of rPrP for up to 6 μM; spherical droplets with clear ThT fluorescence appeared from 8 μM rPrP and were most prominent at 10 μM of rPrP (Fig. S2A). The fluorescence intensity was significantly higher in the presence of 10 μM rPrP (Fig. S2B). To confirm if the droplets consisted of rPrP, we performed a similar experiment with Alexa 488–labeled rPrP and found that the fluorescence was equally distributed in all the droplets (Fig. 1C). We investigated the influence of the salt type on droplet formation and screened various salts according to the Hofmeister series. Sodium salts, such as NaCl, Na2S2O3, Na2CO3, Na3C6H5O7, Na2SO4, and (NH4)2SO4, were tested. We found that all the salts induced ThT-positive droplet formation, except NaCl and Na2CO3 (Fig. S3, A and B). This result suggests that kosmotropic anions were able to induce LLPS of rPrP, whereas Cl- and CO32- did not. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity showed that Na2S2O3 induced significantly higher fluorescence intensity. Because the fluorescence intensity directly reflects the amount of ThT-positive droplets exhibited by ThT, the strength of the fluorescence intensity indicates the efficiency of the droplet formation, suggesting that Na2S2O3 had the best efficiency for droplet formation of rPrP among the salts tested here. Of note, the sample treated with Na2CO3 showed no fluorescence intensity after background subtraction, while barely visible aggregation was observed. This can be explained by the fact that the alkaline conditions caused by Na2CO3 affected ThT, resulting in the loss of the ability to fluoresce (17Hackl E.V. Darkwah J. Smith G. Ermolina I. Effect of acidic and basic pH on Thioflavin T absorbance and fluorescence.Eur. Biophys. J. 2015; 44: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We next tested the effect of Cu2+ on rPrP droplet formation, which is known to bind histidine residues in the N-terminal IDR region of PrP (18Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. Bohlen A. Von Schulz-schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H.

Functional implications of multistage copper binding to the prion protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 11576-11581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The samples containing CuSO4 did not show any droplet formation but had amorphous aggregates. These amorphous aggregates acquired slight ThT fluorescence after 24 h of incubation, suggesting that the aggregation was induced by the binding of Cu2+ to the N-terminal region (Fig. S3A). Furthermore, Cu2+ inhibited the SO42--induced droplet formation (Fig. S3C). To examine the influence of pH, we tested at different pH values under conditions of 9%/9% of PEG/dextran with 120 mM Na2S2O3. At pH 4, a small number of spherical droplets were observed, but most of them formed ThT-positive, granule-like aggregates with a low circularity value. These granule-like aggregates did not fuse with each other. Among the conditions we tested, the droplets were most efficiently formed at neutral pH, although we could not fully evaluate the formation efficiencies at pH 12 because of the loss of ThT fluorescence (Fig. S3D). We confirmed that 120 mM Na2S2O3 and neutral pH were the optimal conditions for our experiments. To investigate the properties of the droplets, we continuously observed their behavior. The nascent droplets floating at the interface seamlessly fused with each other, suggesting that the droplets were in the liquid phase (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, rPrP immediately condensed to form droplets at the PEG/dextran interface by adding Na2S2O3 (Fig. 2B). In addition, fluorescence-labeled PEG colocalized with rPrP in the droplets, suggesting that PEG was bound to rPrP. These results clarified that the spherical structures without Alexa488 or ThT fluorescence in the background were polymer droplets in ATPS. Next, we conducted fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to the droplets, before and after 1 h of incubation. Fresh droplets, immediately after LLPS (0 min), showed full recovery of the intensity within 60 s after photobleaching, whereas the droplets incubated for 1 h at 37 °C showed no recovery throughout the observation period (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that the droplets of rPrP underwent liquid–solid phase transition and became rPrP-gels. However, it would be more important to investigate structural differences between droplets of rPrP formed in the initial stage and the aged gels. We failed to isolate the fresh droplets from ATPS because the fresh droplets became solid gels during centrifugation. Thus, the limitation of these experiments was that we could not directly compare the structure of liquid droplets formed in the initial stage and those in the solid gels post centrifugation. The N-terminal region of PrPC is known to be an IDR, whereas its C-terminus consists of stable secondary structures with three α-helices, as revealed by a nuclear magnetic resonance study, consistent with the prediction result from protein disorder prediction server (PrDOS) (20Ishida T. Kinoshita K. PrDOS: Prediction of disordered protein regions from amino acid sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W460-W464Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 21Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T.

A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Under biological conditions, PrPC is not phosphorylated or methylated but is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein with two glycosylation sites (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the IDR of rPrP influences LLPS, we first calculated its disordered propensity, hydrophobicity, and electric charge (Fig. 3B). This region coincides with the positively charged region predicted by EMBOSS and the hydrophilic region calculated from Protscale (22Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A.

In order to examine the molecular interactions, we calculated the possibility of planar π–π interactions (propensity score: PScore) by using an algorithm written by Venon et al. (25Vernon R.M. Chong P.A. Tsang B. Kim T.H. Bah A Farber P. Lin H. Forman-Kay J.D. Pi-Pi contacts are an overlooked protein feature relevant to phase separation.Elife. 2018; 7: e31486Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The results showed that the residues from 23 to 104 were above the confidence threshold, which is defined as the possibly significant enrichment (>5- to 50-fold) of the π–π interaction (Fig. S4A). To elucidate the role of the N-terminal region, we compared the behavior of the full-length rPrP and N-terminally truncated mutant, rPrP Δ (23–89) in ATPS. We found that rPrP Δ (23–89) did not increase the fluorescence intensity even with Na2S2O3; however, it formed slightly ThT-positive aggregates at the interface. These aggregates showed no increase in ThT fluorescence throughout the observation period of up to 48 h, whereas the droplet of full-length rPrP increased the fluorescence intensity over time (Fig. 3, C–E). Even very small droplets (<5 μm) with no apparent ThT fluorescence at 0 min could be clearly identified after 24 h of incubation. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity was significantly higher than that of rPrP Δ (23–89) with Na2S2O3 at 1 h and it became more striking after 48 h (Fig. 3, F and G). Full-length mouse rPrP (Mo–rPrP residues: 23–231) also showed similar results (Fig. S4, B and C). Because the rapid growth of ThT fluorescence coincides with the timing of a liquid–solid phase transition (Fig. 2, C and D), we investigated how aging affects the biochemical properties of the rPrP-gels. First, we aged the droplets for 30 min and then collected them by centrifugation. First, we aged the droplets for 30 min and then collected them by centrifugation. The rPrP-gels were ThT positive and did not dissolve in water (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, we resuspended the gels in 1% sarkosyl and reprecipitated them by centrifugation. Western blot analysis showed that rPrP was insoluble in 1% sarkosyl solution (Fig. 4B). There was no significant difference in the insoluble fraction (P2), with or without treatment (Fig. 4C). Next, we examined whether these PrPs in the gels acquired PK resistance. We aged the rPrP-gels for 72 h and then digested them with PK. The appearance of aged gels remained unchanged after PK digestion (Fig. 4D). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of the aged gels collected by centrifugation showed that the aged droplets contained oligomers of rPrP and 40% of rPrP remained undigested (Fig. 4, E and F). A small PrP-res fragment was detected around 10 to 15 kDa. We could not disrupt the aged gel by sonication to improve the penetration of proteinase. There was no significant difference in PK resistance between the aged rPrP-gel and brain-derived PrPSc, even though they showed different band patterns (Fig. S4, D and E). We further attempted to confirm that the rPrP-gel was composed of amyloid. The aged gels stained positively with Congo red, although they did not show apple-green birefringence under cross-polarized light (Fig. 4G). A similar observation was reported in human amyloid spherulites composed of islet amyloid polypeptide in the pancreatic tissue of type 2 diabetes mellitus (26Exley C. House E. Patel T. Wu L. Fraser P.E. Human pro-islet amyloid polypeptide (ProIAPP(1-48)) forms amyloid fibrils and amyloid spherulites in vitro.J. Inorg. Biochem. 2010; 104: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the aged gel did not show the Maltese cross under cross-polarized light, which is a characteristic of spherulites. To analyze the secondary structure of the aged gel, we performed FTIR analysis. FTIR analysis showed that the aged gels had a distinctive peak at 1620 cm−1 in the β-sheet region of the second-derivative spectra, which shifted from 1651 cm−1 in the α-helix region from the native form of rPrP (Fig. 4H). Moreover, they were stable for months in water (data not shown). These results suggest that rPrP is converted into PrP-res inside the droplets, acquiring a β-sheet–rich structure, detergent insolubility, and PK resistance. We next investigated whether the aged rPrP-gel has seeding activity. The aged rPrP-gels were subjected to real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) analysis (Fig. S4F). As a result, the samples with the rPrP-gels added as seed did not show ThT positivity (Fig. S4F), and the rPrP-gels maintained its shape even after 100 cycles of the reaction, indicating that rPrP-res generated from the rPrP-gels did not have seeding activity. We have demonstrated that rPrP undergoes LLPS at the interface of the ATPS. IDR in the N-terminal region of PrPC (residues 23–89) and kosmotropic anions were essential for the overall reaction. The rPrP liquid droplets subsequently showed liquid–solid phase transition within an hour, and the aged rPrP-gels contained β-sheet–rich, sarkosyl-insoluble, and PK-resistant amyloid. ATPS has been used for a wide range of purposes, such as purification of enzymes, nucleic acids, and viruses to stabilize their structure (14Asenjo J.A. Andrews B.A. Aqueous two-phase systems for protein separation: A perspective.J. Chromatogr. A. 2011; 1218: 8826-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 27Benavides J. Rito-Palomares M. Asenjo J.A. Aqueous two-phase systems.Compr. Biotechnol. Second Ed. 2011; 2: 697-713Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The partitioning behavior in ATPS has been well documented. In protein purification, monomeric IgG could be collected separately in the PEG-rich fraction because of its positive charge (28Shibata C. Iwashita K. Shiraki K. Selective separation method of aggregates from IgG solution by aqueous two-phase system.Protein Expr. Purif. 2019; 161: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Such convention by ATPS can facilitate interactions of the sequestered molecules, as demonstrated by DNA and actin fibers separately interacting and polymerizing inside the dextran phase, called cell-sized aqueous microdroplets, imitating cell-like crowded microenvironments (29Nakatani N. Sakuta H. Hayashi M. Tanaka S. Takiguchi K. Tsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. Specific Spatial Localization of actin and DNA in a Water/water microdroplet: Self-Emergence of a cell-like structure.Chembiochem. 2018; 19: 1370-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similarly, our present results could be interpreted from a similar viewpoint. It is conceivable that rPrP, which has positive charges like IgG in the IDR, was sequestered to the PEG phase at first and then, when it was sufficiently condensed, formed a liquid phase on its own owing to the interactions between the IDRs. Similar to many other proteins known to undergo LLPS, the region consists of five repeats of a glycine-rich motif and contains proline and aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan. However, it is not clear why the interface of ATPS is the essential factor for inducing LLPS of rPrP. The hydrophobicity of the protein surface and solubility in different polymer solutions may affect the behavior of the protein in ATPS (14Asenjo J.A. Andrews B.A. Aqueous two-phase systems for protein separation: A perspective.J. Chromatogr. A. 2011; 1218: 8826-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 30Carlson A. Factors influencing the Use of aqueous two-phase partition for protein purification.Separation Sci. Technology. 1988; 23: 785-817Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since little is known about protein behavior in ATPS, further investigation is required to answer this question. It is unlikely that the fluorescence-labeled PEG colocalized with the droplet of rPrP directly induces the reaction of rPrP because it hardly affects the conversion properties of PrPC to PrP-res (31Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Dorward D.W. Chesebro B. Caughey B. Conversion of raft associated prion protein to the protease-resistant state requires insertion of PrP-res (PrP(Sc)) into contiguous membranes.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Proline and glycine-rich N-terminal IDRs of rPrP are very flexible and multivalent because of the periodically located tryptophan residues; these features enable efficient intermolecular interactions and consequently LLPS. The liquid phase formation via IDR may subsequently facilitate interactions between the C-terminal regions and finally evoke parallel β-sheet conversion of the entire molecule. Therefore, it does not require agitation to catalyze the reactions. This may be in contrast to the facilitation of conversion by mechanical agitation, where natively folded protein molecules at the air–water interface are denatured and the forcefully exposed hydrophobic residues presumably enable efficient intermolecular binding, and eventually conversion (32Dorosz J. Volinsky R. Bazar E. Kolusheva S. Jelinek R.

Originally, it was described as the Hofmeister series, which is a series of anions and cations to order the relative protein salting-out abilities (35Hofmeister F. Zur Lehre von der Wirkung der Salze.Archiv F. Exp. Pathol. U. Pharmakol. 1888; 24: 247-260Crossref Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 36Zhang Y. Cremer P.S. Interactions between macromolecules and ions: The Hofmeister series.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the efficiency of amyloid formation from prion protein is in accordance with the Hofmeister series (37Diaz-Espinoza R. Mukherjee A. Soto C. Kosmotropic anions promote conversion of recombinant prion protein into a PrPSc-like misfolded form.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e31678Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 38Yeh V. Broering J.M. Romanyuk A. Chen B. Chernoff Y.O. Bommarius A.S. The Hofmeister effect on amyloid formation using yeast prion protein.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Kosmotropic anions have been shown to drastically improve the detection limit of pathological amyloids, including prions (39Metrick 2nd, M.A. do Carmo Ferreira N. Saijo E. Hughson A.G. Kraus A. Orrú C. Miller M.W. Zanusso G. Ghetti B. Vendruscolo M. Caughey B. Million-fold sensitivity enhancement in proteopathic seed amplification assays for biospecimens by Hofmeister ion comparisons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 23029-23039Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the reason why the efficiency of droplet formation does not exactly match with the Hofmeister series is unclear. Copper ions are well known to bind to the N-terminal region of prion proteins and play an important role in the aggregation process (40Thakur A.K. Srivastava A.K. Srinivas V. Chary K.V. Rao C.M.

Addition of skeletal elements along the proximal-distal axis facilitated critical transformations, including the fin-to-limb transition that permitted generation of diverse modes of locomotion. Here, we identify zebrafish mutants that form supernumerary long bones in their pectoral fins. These new bones integrate into musculature, form joints, and articulate with neighboring elements. This phenotype is caused by activating mutations in previously unrecognized regulators of appendage patterning, <i>vav2</i> and <i>waslb</i>, that function in a common pathway. This pathway is required for appendage development across vertebrates, and loss of <i>Wasl</i> in mice causes defects similar to those seen in murine Hox mutants. Concordantly, formation of supernumerary bones requires Hox11 function, and mutations in the vav2/wasl pathway drive enhanced expression of <i>hoxa11b</i>, indicating developmental homology with the forearm. Our findings reveal a latent, limb-like pattern ability in fins that is activated by simple genetic perturbation."

The activity of inhibitory neurons is essential for generating these neural oscillations, but molecular control of this dynamic process during learning remains unknown. Here, we show that hippocampal oscillatory strength positively correlates with excitatory monosynaptic drive onto inhibitory neurons (E→I) in freely behaving mice. To establish a causal relationship between them, we identified γCaMKII as the long-sought mediator of long-term potentiation for E→I synapses (LTPE→I), which enabled the genetic manipulation of experience-dependent E→I synaptic input/plasticity. Deleting γCaMKII in parvalbumin interneurons selectively eliminated LTPE→I and disrupted experience-driven strengthening in theta and gamma rhythmicity. Behaviorally, this manipulation impaired long-term memory, for which the kinase activity of γCaMKII was required. Taken together, our data suggest that E→I synaptic plasticity, exemplified by LTPE→I, plays a gatekeeping role in tuning experience-dependent brain rhythms and mnemonic function."
https://openalex.org/W3127431638,"Introduction The success of current policies and interventions on providing effective access to treatment for childhood illnesses hinges on families’ decisions relating to healthcare access. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is an uneven distribution of child healthcare services. We investigated the role played by barriers to healthcare accessibility in healthcare seeking for childhood illnesses among childbearing women in SSA. Materials and methods Data on 223,184 children under five were extracted from Demographic and Health Surveys of 29 sub-Saharan African countries, conducted between 2010 and 2018. The outcome variable for the study was healthcare seeking for childhood illnesses. The data were analyzed using Stata version 14.2 for windows. Chi-square test of independence and a two-level multivariable multilevel modelling were carried out to generate the results. Statistical significance was pegged at p&lt;0.05. We relied on ‘Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology’ (STROBE) statement in writing the manuscript. Results Eighty-five percent (85.5%) of women in SSA sought healthcare for childhood illnesses, with the highest and lowest prevalence in Gabon (75.0%) and Zambia (92.6%) respectively. In terms of the barriers to healthcare access, we found that women who perceived getting money for medical care for self as a big problem [AOR = 0.81 CI = 0.78–0.83] and considered going for medical care alone as a big problem [AOR = 0.94, CI = 0.91–0.97] had lower odds of seeking healthcare for their children, compared to those who considered these as not a big problem. Other factors that predicted healthcare seeking for childhood illnesses were size of the child at birth, birth order, age, level of community literacy, community socio-economic status, place of residence, household head, and decision-maker for healthcare. Conclusion The study revealed a relationship between barriers to healthcare access and healthcare seeking for childhood illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa. Other individual and community level factors also predicted healthcare seeking for childhood illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa. This suggests that interventions aimed at improving child healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa need to focus on these factors."

Objectives To identify beliefs and practices associated with the use of alternative treatments for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus among patients. Methods A mixed-methods study including an investigator-administered survey and focus group discussion sessions using convenience sampling was conducted among patients aged ≥18 years during May to August 2018. Descriptive statistics were used to describe and compare demographic characteristics among groups of survey participants using JMP Pro 14.0. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyze the qualitative data using NVivo. Results Most study participants (87–90%) were on prescription medication for their condition. Of survey participants, 69% reported taking their medication as prescribed and 70% felt that prescription medicine was controlling their condition. Almost all participants (98%) reported using alternative treatments, mainly herbal medications, and 73–80% felt that herbal medicines controlled their conditions. One-third believed that herbal medicines are the most effective form of treatment and should always be used instead of prescription medication. However, most participants (85%) did not believe that prescription and herbal treatments should be used simultaneously. Most (76–90%) did not discuss herbal treatments with their healthcare providers. Four themes emerged from the focus group sessions: 1) Simultaneous use of herbal and prescription medicine was perceived to be harmful, 2) Patients did not divulge their use of herbal medicine to healthcare providers, 3) Alternative medicines were perceived to be highly effective, and 4) Religiosity and family elders played key roles in herbal use. Conclusions This study provides useful insights into perceptions and use of alternative treatments by patients that can be used by healthcare providers in developing appropriate interventions to encourage proper use of prescription medicines and alternative medicines resulting in improved management of these chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3128428338,"Skeletal muscle is one of the most important organs of the animal body. Long noncoding RNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of skeletal muscle development via several mechanisms. We recently identified obesity-related lncRNA (lnc-ORA) in a search for long noncoding RNAs that influence adipogenesis, finding it impacted adipocyte differentiation by regulating the PI3K/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. However, whether lnc-ORA has additional roles, specifically in skeletal muscle myogenesis, is not known. Here, we found that lnc-ORA was significantly differentially expressed with age in mouse skeletal muscle tissue and predominantly located in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of lnc-ORA promoted C2C12 myoblast proliferation and inhibited myoblast differentiation. In contrast, lnc-ORA knockdown repressed myoblast proliferation and facilitated myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, silencing of lnc-ORA rescued dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in vitro. Furthermore, adeno-associated virus 9–mediated overexpression of lnc-ORA decreased muscle mass and the cross-sectional area of muscle fiber by upregulating the levels of muscle atrophy–related genes and downregulating the levels of myogenic differentiation–related genes in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-ORA inhibited skeletal muscle myogenesis by acting as a sponge of miR-532-3p, which targets the phosphatase and tensin homolog gene; the resultant changes in phosphatase and tensin homolog suppressed the PI3K/protein kinase B signaling pathway. In addition, lnc-ORA interacted with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 and reduced the stability of myogenesis genes, such as myogenic differentiation 1 and myosin heavy chain.

Collectively, these findings indicate that lnc-ORA could be a novel underlying regulator of skeletal muscle development. Skeletal muscle development is regulated by a series of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) (1Braun T. Gautel M. Transcriptional mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 12: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The MRF family plays a crucial positive role in skeletal muscle myogenic determination and differentiation during embryogenesis and postnatal myogenesis and includes myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD), myogenic factor 5, myogenin (MyoG), and myogenic regulatory factor 4 (2Buckingham M. Rigby P.W. Gene regulatory networks and transcriptional mechanisms that control myogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 225-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Once MRFs have been activated, many myogenic transcription factors form obligate heterodimers with their coregulators to activate the myoblast differentiation program by regulating the transcription of many genes, including coding and noncoding genes. In addition, myoblast proliferation leads to an increase in the number of nuclei, contributing to muscle growth in some forms of muscle hypertrophy in adults. Skeletal muscle atrophy is controlled by the balance between the protein degradation rate and protein synthesis rate and induced by various stressors, including starvation, denervation, mechanical unloading, inflammation, and aging (3Schiaffino S. Dyar K.A. Ciciliot S. Blaauw B. Sandri M. Mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle growth and atrophy.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 4294-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This balance reflects the physiological condition of the muscle fiber, and breakage results in muscular dystrophy (4Bonaldo P. Sandri M. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy.Dis. Model Mech. 2013; 6: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Two critical protein degradation pathways, the autophagic–lysosomal and ubiquitin–proteasome systems, are activated during skeletal muscle atrophy (5Jackman R.W. Cornwell E.W. Wu C.L. Kandarian S.C. Nuclear factor-kappaB signalling and transcriptional regulation in skeletal muscle atrophy.Exp. Physiol. 2013; 98: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Jiao J. Demontis F. Skeletal muscle autophagy and its role in sarcopenia and organismal aging.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2017; 34: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These pathways include many atrophy-related genes, which are regulated by specific transcription factors. Muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) are atrophy markers, which represent two of many E3 ubiquitin ligases that are mostly expressed in skeletal muscle. Knockdown of MAFbx prevents skeletal muscle loss during fasting, and the absence of MuRF1 alleviates dexamethasone (Dex)-induced muscle atrophy in mice (7Bodine S.C. Baehr L.M. Skeletal muscle atrophy and the E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 307: E469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is one of the signaling pathways that regulate mammalian skeletal muscle atrophy (8Wimmer R.J. Russell S.J. Schneider M.F.

The animal genome contains abundant noncoding RNAs, which serve as regulators of gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic levels. Noncoding RNAs regulate various muscle biological processes (9Jandura A. Krause H.M.

Although the effects of these lncRNAs in skeletal muscle myogenesis have been partially characterized, the function and regulatory mechanism of obesity-related lncRNA (lnc-ORA) in this process remains elusive. In the present study, we found that lnc-ORA was significantly differentially expressed in skeletal muscle between two important developmental stages. Furthermore, the results indicated that lnc-ORA promoted myoblast proliferation, inhibited myoblast differentiation, and induced muscle atrophy in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of lnc-ORA reduced muscle mass and the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers by upregulating the levels of muscle atrophy–related genes and downregulating the levels of myoblast differentiation–related genes in vivo. Mechanistic investigations showed that lnc-ORA functioned as a sponge for miR-532-3p and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), which activated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and attenuated PI3K/AKT signaling, a critical pathway of myogenesis and muscle atrophy. Based on the aforementioned results, our findings provide a novel strategy for the regulation of skeletal muscle development. To confirm whether lnc-ORA is associated with skeletal muscle development, the absolute expression of lnc-ORA in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius (GAS), and extensor digitorum longus muscles from 8-week-old and 52-week-old mice was examined. The results showed that the levels of lnc-ORA were much higher in 52-week-old mice than in 8-week-old mice (Fig. 1, A–C). Furthermore, the level of lnc-ORA was the highest at 12 h and then gradually decreased from 24 to 48 h during myoblast proliferation (Fig. 1D). The level of lnc-ORA gradually increased during the early stage and then decreased in the late stage of C2C12 cell differentiation (Fig. 1E), indicating that lnc-ORA was involved in myoblast proliferation and differentiation during muscle formation. To confirm the stability of lnc-ORA in C2C12 cells, a half-life experiment was performed. The results showed that the half-life of lnc-ORA was approximately 12 h, indicating that lnc-ORA is stably expressed in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1F). In addition, based on lnc-ORA–targeted genes, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed. GO term analysis revealed that lnc-ORA participated in the regulation of skeletal muscle development, muscle atrophy, cellular metabolic process, muscle hypertrophy, especially myoblast proliferation and differentiation (Fig. 1G). KEGG analysis indicated that lnc-ORA could regulate biological processes through the PI3K/AKT, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors, mammalian target of rapamycin, and forkhead box O signaling pathway (Fig. 1H). Collectively, these results imply that lnc-ORA is a potential regulator of skeletal muscle development, partly through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. To investigate the role of lnc-ORA in myoblast proliferation, lnc-ORA overexpression and knockdown experiments were carried out in proliferating C2C12 cells. The results showed that overexpression and knockdown of lnc-ORA worked well (Fig. S1, A and B). Overexpression of lnc-ORA increased the number of 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU)-positive cells (Fig. 2, A and B). A flow cytometry analysis also indicated that overexpression of lnc-ORA increased the number of cells that progressed to S phase (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, cell count assay showed that overexpression of lnc-ORA increased the total cell number (Fig. S1C). Moreover, overexpression of lnc-ORA increased the mRNA and protein levels of proliferation-related genes, including cyclin E, cyclin D1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Fig. 2, E–G). Furthermore, knockdown of lnc-ORA decreased the number of EdU-positive cells (Fig. 3, A and B), the total cell number (Fig. S1D), the number of cells in S phase (Fig. 3, C and D), and the mRNA and protein levels of proliferation-related genes (Fig. 3, E–G). Taken together, these results indicate that lnc-ORA promotes myoblast proliferation.Figure 3Knockdown of lnc-ORA inhibits myoblast proliferation.

C2C12 cells were induced by differentiation culture medium (Fig. S2A). After myoblasts were transfected with pcDNA3.1-lnc-ORA or siRNA-lnc-ORA (silnc-ORA) vector, the levels of lnc-ORA markedly changed after myogenic induction (Fig. S2, B and C), showing that overexpression and knockdown of lnc-ORA worked well. Overexpression of lnc-ORA decreased the number of myosin heavy chain (MyHC)-positive cells, the differentiation index, and the multinuclear fusion index (Fig. 4, A–C). Moreover, overexpression of lnc-ORA downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of myogenic markers, including MyoD, MyoG, and MyHC (Fig. 4, D–F). Conversely, knockdown of lnc-ORA increased the number of MyHC-positive cells and the differentiation index, as well as the multinuclear fusion index at day 4 after myogenic induction (Fig. 5, A–C). Knockdown of lnc-ORA upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of these markers (Fig. 5, D–F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that lnc-ORA inhibits myogenic differentiation of myoblasts.Figure 5Knockdown of lnc-ORA promotes myogenic differentiation.

The level of lnc-ORA was significantly upregulated by the Dex treatment (Fig. 6B), and an increase in the protein levels of MAFbx and MuRF1 also occurred (Fig. 6, C and D). Furthermore, knockdown of lnc-ORA markedly rescued Dex-induced muscle atrophy, as shown by MyHC staining (Fig. 6E). Knockdown of lnc-ORA decreased the levels of MAFbx and MuRF1 and increased the levels of myogenic differentiation factors (Fig. 6, F and G). Therefore, knockdown of lnc-ORA rescued Dex-induced muscle atrophy in vitro, suggesting that lnc-ORA could be a potential therapeutic target for treating muscle atrophy. To investigate the role of lnc-ORA in the regulation of muscle development in vivo, 10-week-old mice were injected with adeno-associated virus-GFP (AAV-GFP) or AAV-lnc-ORA overexpression virus and sacrificed after 8 weeks. Compared with the AAV-GFP control group, the AAV treatment group showed decreased size and mass of the tibialis anterior and GAS muscles (Fig. 7, A and B). Meanwhile, the muscle percentage of AAV-lnc-ORA–injected mice was lower (Fig. 7C). H&E staining showed that the cross-sectional areas of GAS fibers were dramatically smaller in the AAV-lnc-ORA group than in the AAV-GFP group (Fig. 7, D and E). Overexpression of lnc-ORA significantly decreased the expression levels of MyHC and MyoD but increased the expression levels of MAFbx and MuRF1 (Fig. 7, F and G). The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited in the GAS muscles of AAV-lnc-ORA mice (Fig. 7, F and H). Together, these results suggest that overexpression of lnc-ORA decreases muscle mass and induces muscle atrophy in vivo. To investigate the molecular mechanism of lnc-ORA in myogenesis, FISH experiments were performed to confirm the subcellular locations of lnc-ORA in myoblasts and myotubes. The results showed that lnc-ORA was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of both myoblasts and myotubes (Fig. 8, A and B). This finding indicates that lnc-ORA plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation mechanism in the cytoplasm. Moreover, we predicted that miR-532-3p with a conserved seed sequence could be adsorbed by lnc-ORA (Fig. S3, A and B) and that PTEN acts as a target of miR-532-3p (Fig. S3C). To confirm this hypothesis, we constructed wildtype and mutant dual luciferase reporters, psi-CHECK 2.0-lnc-ORA or psi-CHECK 2.0-PTEN 3’UTR (Fig. 9, A and B). The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-532-3p bound to lnc-ORA transcripts and the PTEN 3′UTR (Fig. 9, C and D). Furthermore, significantly enriched miR-532-3p and lnc-ORA were measured through argonaute 2 RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay (Fig. S3D). Moreover, lnc-ORA was significantly enriched by biotin-labeled miR-532-3p compared with the control or mutated miR-532-3p (Fig. S3E). We have also detected the absolute copy number of miR-532-3p under the different conditions. The results showed that the absolute copy number of miR-532-3p exhibited opposite trends as that of lnc-ORA under different conditions (Fig. S4, A–E). Based on the aforementioned results, we speculated that lnc-ORA acted as a competing endogenous RNA to sponge miR-532-3p. Furthermore, miR-532-3p mimics promoted myogenic differentiation, as shown by immunofluorescence staining of MyHC-positive myotubes (Fig. S5, A and B). Besides, rescue experiments indicated that miR-532-3p attenuated the positive effect of lnc-ORA on myoblast proliferation (Fig. 9, E and F), whereas it rescued the repressive effect of lnc-ORA on myoblast differentiation (Fig. 9, G and H). Moreover, miR-532-3p showed the opposite effect against lnc-ORA on the protein levels of PTEN, phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K), and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) (Fig. 9, I and J). In contrast, lnc-ORA knockdown reduced the protein level of PTEN and increased the protein levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT (Fig. S6). Therefore, lnc-ORA inhibited myogenic differentiation and promoted muscle atrophy through absorption of miR-532-3p via PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.Figure 9Lnc-ORA functions as a ceRNA for miR-532-3p to control myogenesis.

Through this analysis, we identified IGF2BP2, an RNA-binding protein, as being bound to lnc-ORA, and we confirmed this interaction by Western blotting (Fig. 10A). Next, RIP was performed in C2C12 cells using an IGF2BP2 antibody. Lnc-ORA was present in the IGF2BP2 RIP sample at a much higher level than in the control IgG RIP sample (Fig. 10B). It has been demonstrated that IGF2BP2 could promote RNA stability. We then used this half-life assay to explore the RNA stability of lnc-ORA. The results showed that the interaction of lnc-ORA and IGFBP2 increased lnc-ORA stability and the ability to sponge miR-532-3p (Fig. 10, C and D). Moreover, lnc-ORA directly bound to IGF2BP2 and negatively regulated the IGF2BP2-mediated stability of myogenesis genes such as MyoD and MyHC (Fig. 10, E and F). Together, we used RNA pull-down experiments to identify IGF2BP2 as an important binding partner of lnc-ORA in the myogenesis process. Based on the aforementioned results, we suggest that lnc-ORA, acting as a miR-532-3p sponge and interacting with IGF2BP2 to control PTEN-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling, inhibits skeletal muscle myogenesis and induces muscle atrophy (Fig. 11).Figure 11Molecular regulatory mechanism of lnc-ORA that inhibits skeletal muscle myogenesis and induces muscle atrophy.

Recently, several studies have indicated that lncRNAs are implicated in skeletal muscle formation. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of lnc-ORA on myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and muscle atrophy are unknown. In the present study, we found that lnc-ORA was differentially expressed in mouse skeletal muscle with age, functioning as a miR-532-3p sponge and interacting with IGF2BP2 to inhibit myogenesis and induce muscle atrophy, and it could be a novel target for the regulation of skeletal muscle development. LncRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation, such as Myoparr (19Hitachi K. Nakatani M. Takasaki A. Ouchi Y. Uezumi A. Ageta H. Inagaki H. Kurahashi H.

https://openalex.org/W3126168703,"Cardiac muscle thin filaments are composed of actin, tropomyosin, and troponin that change conformation in response to Ca2+ binding, triggering muscle contraction. Human cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is the Ca2+-sensing component of the thin filament. It contains structural sites (III/IV) that bind both Ca2+ and Mg2+ and a regulatory site (II) that has been thought to bind only Ca2+. Binding of Ca2+ at this site initiates a series of conformational changes that culminate in force production. However, the mechanisms that underpin the regulation of binding at site II remain unclear. Here, we have quantified the interaction between site II and Ca2+/Mg2+ through isothermal titration calorimetry and thermodynamic integration simulations. Direct and competitive binding titrations with WT N-terminal cTnC and full-length cTnC indicate that physiologically relevant concentrations of both Ca2+/Mg2+ interacted with the same locus. Moreover, the D67A/D73A N-terminal cTnC construct in which two coordinating residues within site II were removed was found to have significantly reduced affinity for both cations. In addition, 1 mM Mg2+ caused a 1.4-fold lower affinity for Ca2+. These experiments strongly suggest that cytosolic-free Mg2+ occupies a significant population of the available site II. Interaction of Mg2+ with site II of cTnC likely has important functional consequences for the heart both at baseline as well as in diseased states that decrease or increase the availability of Mg2+, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism or ischemia, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3128464844,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines play critical roles in regulating valvular interstitial cell (VIC) phenotypic changes that can cause heart valve fibrosis and calcification. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a cytokine known to influence VIC behavior and has been reported at high levels in calcified valves ex vivo. We sought to understand the specific effects of TNF-α on VIC phenotypes (eg, fibroblast, profibrotic activated myofibroblasts) and its link with heart valve disorders. We characterize human aortic valve tissue from patients with valve disorders and identify a high variability of fibrotic and calcific markers between tissues. These results motivated in vitro studies to explore the effects of TNF-α on defined VIC fibroblasts and profibrotic activated myofibroblasts, induced via FGF-2 and TGF-β1 treatment. Using 3D hydrogels to culture VICs, we measure the effect of TNF-α (0.1-10 ng/mL) on key markers of fibrosis (eg, αSMA, COL1A1) and calcification (eg, RUNX2, BMP2, and calcium deposits). We observe calcification in TNF-α-treated VIC activated myofibroblasts and identify the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade as a potential pathway for TNF-α mediated calcification. Conversely, VIC fibroblasts respond to TNF-α with decreased calcification. Treatment of VIC profibrotic activated myofibroblast populations with TNF-α leads to increased calcification. Our in vitro findings correlate with findings in diseased human valves and highlight the importance of understanding the effect of cytokines and signaling pathways on specific VIC phenotypes. Finally, we reveal MAPK/ERK as a potential pathway involved in VIC-mediated matrix calcification with TNF-α treatment, suggesting this pathway as a potential pharmaceutical target for aortic valve disease."
https://openalex.org/W3128747351,"The emergence and global spread of extended-spectrum or AmpC β-lactamase (ESBL/AmpC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in companion animals have led to the hypothesis that companion animals might be reservoirs for cross-species transmission because of their close contact with humans. However, current knowledge in this field is limited; therefore, the role of companion animals in cross-species transmission remains to be elucidated. Herein, we studied ESBL/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli in particular, isolated from extraintestinal sites and feces of companion dogs. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that (i) extraintestinal E . coli isolates were most closely related to those isolated from feces from the same dog, (ii) chromosomal sequences in the ST131/C1-M27 clade isolated from companion dogs were highly similar to those in the ST131/C1-M27 clade of human origin, (iii) certain plasmids, such as IncFII/pMLST F1:A2:B20/ bla CTX-M-27 , IncI1/pMLST16/ bla CTX-M-15 , or IncI1/ bla CMY-2 from dog-derived E . coli isolates, shared high homology with those from several human-derived Enterobacteriaceae, (iv) chromosomal bla CTX-M-14 was identified in the ST38 isolate from a companion dog, and (v) eight out of 14 tested ESBL/AmpC-producing E . coli isolates (i.e., ST131, ST68, ST405, and ST998) belonged to the human extraintestinal pathogenic E . coli (ExPEC) group. All of the bla -coding plasmids that were sequenced genome-wide were capable of horizontal transfer. These results suggest that companion dogs can spread ESBL/AmpC-producing ExPEC via their feces. Furthermore, at least some ESBL/AmpC-producing ExPECs and bla -coding plasmids can be transmitted between humans and companion dogs. Thus, companion dogs can act as an important reservoir for ESBL/AmpC-producing E . coli in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3127912631,"Previous studies have identified GAPDH as a promising target for treating cancer and modulating immunity because its inhibition reduces glycolysis in cells (cancer cells and immune cells) with the Warburg effect, a modified form of cellular metabolism found in cancer cells. However, the quantitative relationship between GAPDH and the aerobic glycolysis remains unknown. Here, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of GAPDH expression and iodoacetate-dependent inhibition of enzyme activity, we examined the quantitative relationship between GAPDH activity and glycolysis rate. We found that glycolytic rates were unaffected by the reduction of GAPDH activity down to 19% ± 4.8% relative to untreated controls. However, further reduction of GAPDH activity below this level caused proportional reductions in the glycolysis rate. GAPDH knockdown or inhibition also simultaneously increased the concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P, the substrate of GAPDH). This increased GA3P concentration countered the effect of GAPDH knockdown or inhibition and stabilized the glycolysis rate by promoting GAPDH activity. Mechanistically, the intracellular GA3P concentration is controlled by the Gibbs free energy of the reactions upstream of GAPDH. The thermodynamic state of the reactions along the glycolysis pathway was only affected when GAPDH activity was reduced below 19% ± 4.8%. Doing so moved the reactions catalyzed by GAPDH + PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1, the enzyme immediate downstream of GAPDH) away from the near-equilibrium state, revealing an important biochemical basis to interpret the rate control of glycolysis by GAPDH.

Instead, the regulation of metabolic flux in a pathway that contains reactions near equilibrium depends more on distribution of the Gibbs free energy among reaction steps in the pathway than on the Gibbs free energy of the reaction catalyzed by the given enzyme.

Although the findings are promising for cancer treatment or immunity modulation, the detailed quantitative relationship between GAPDH and glycolysis has not been demonstrated. If a candidate drug interrupts glycolysis primarily via inhibiting GAPDH, it is essential that the numerical relationship between GAPDH and glycolysis be established, as this is the fundamental logic. We sought to investigate the quantitative relationship between GAPDH and aerobic glycolysis to delineate the biochemical insight into this relationship. We used five cancer cells lines for this work, cervical cancer cell line HeLa, gastric cancer cell line MGC80-3, colon cancer cell line RKO, liver cancer cell line SK-HEP-1, and lung cancer cell line A549. These cell lines exhibited the WE, as described by us recently (20Jin C. Zhu X. Wu H. Wang Y. Hu X.

In this study, the GAPDH specific activity (GAPDH-SA) refers to the activity assayed at the saturating substrate concentration. The concentration of the GAPDH is derived from the equation Vspecfic-activity ≈ Vmax = kcat[E]: we set the relative concentration of GAPDH in the control cells as 100%, then the relative concentration of GAPDH in the cells treated with siRNA or GAPDH inhibitor would be the following.[GAPDH]treated=GAPDH−SAtreatedGAPDH−SActrl[GAPDH]ctrl(1) The GAPDH actual activity (GAPDH-AA) refers to its activity at the actual concentration of its substrates in the glycolysis. siGAPDH specifically knocked down GAPDH-SA with no or marginal effect on the activities of other glycolytic enzymes (Fig. 1). The knockdown efficiency ranged from 48% (RKO) to 72% (HeLa) (Fig. 2, A and B). GAPDH knockdown marginally affected glucose (Glc) consumption and lactate generation (Fig. 2C) in HeLa, RKO, MGC80-3, and SK-HEP-1 cells. In A549 cells, GAPDH knockdown moderately reduced lactate production by about 15% but with a marginal reduced Glc consumption, in comparison with the control (Fig. 2C). The data suggested that the effect of GAPDH knockdown may vary from cell to cell, but the variation was moderate.Figure 2Knockdown of GAPDH marginally perturbed glycolysis.

To exclude this possibility, we used [13C6]glucose to trace lactate in cells and demonstrated that about 95% lactate (m + 3) generated by control and GAPDH knockdown cells was from Glc (Fig. S1). However, siRNA knockdown could not generate serial clones with a stepwise decrement of GAPDH activity, so that the quantitative relationship between GAPDH and aerobic glycolysis could not be established. Iodoacetate (IA) is a GAPDH inhibitor (21Williamson J.R. Glycolytic Control Mechanisms III. Effects of iodoacetamide and fluoroacetate on glucose metabolism in the perfused rat heart.J. Biol.

We measured the activities of glycolytic enzymes in the cell lysate prepared from HeLa, RKO, MGC80-3, SK-HEP-1, and A549, which were pretreated with IA (Fig. 3A). It is noted that even when GAPDH-SA was inhibited by 98.5%, the activities of other glycolytic enzymes were not significantly different from untreated controls. Cells were incubated in a serial of concentrations of IA (1–100 μM) for 7 h. The cellular GSH content did not change significantly at the IA concentration between 0 and 10 μM (Fig. 3B). At 25 μM IA, there was a moderate reduction of the cellular GSH concentration (by 23% and 15% for HeLa and RKO, respectively) but no statistical significance. When the IA concentration increased to 50 μM, the cellular GSH concentration was significantly reduced. The result was consistent with the previous report (24Schmidt M.M. Dringen R. Differential effects of iodoacetamide and iodoacetate on glycolysis and glutathione metabolism of cultured astrocytes.Front. inneuroenergetics. 2009; 1-1Google Scholar). In contrast, when cells were treated with IA at the concentration range between 0 and 25 μM, the GAPDH activity was inversely proportional to the IA concentration (Fig. 3C). GAPDH activity was significantly inhibited even by 1 μM IA. When IA was 25 μM, the residual activity of GAPDH only retained 2.6% and 1.1% for HeLa and RKO, respectively. Moreover, IA at the effective concentration inactivating GAPDH did not significantly affect other glycolytic enzymes (Fig. 3A). We prepared cell lysate from HeLa and RKO and measured the inhibition of GAPDH-SA by IA. The inhibition curve was similar between HeLa and RKO (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the inhibition is cell-type independent. We measured the stability of GAPDH-SA in the cell lysate prepared from HeLa and RKO pretreated with IA (Fig. 3E). The data showed that GAPDH-SA was stable. This stable inhibition is important for real-time monitor of the GAPDH-SA in the subsequent study, otherwise the quantitative relationship between GAPDH and the aerobic glycolysis in cells could not be established. We also did the substrate-dependent kinetics of GAPDH in the cell lysate from HeLa and RKO cells with or without IA treatment. When converting the kinetic rate to percentage, they were identical (Fig. 3F), indicating that IA inhibition only reduced the concentration of functional GAPDH without affecting the kinetic feature of the enzyme. Finally, we checked if cell density would affect the inhibition efficacy of IA. The results showed that IA efficacy decreased with the increase in the cell number (Fig. 3G). Therefore, in the subsequent experiments, we fixed the seeding cell number. We then treated HeLa cells with IA. At the indicated intervals, we collected cells and medium, measured GAPDH-SA (Fig. 4A), Glc consumption (Fig. 4B), and lactate generation (Fig. 4C). We then deduced the instantaneous rate of change of Glc consumption (Vi-glucose) (Fig. 4D) and lactate generation (Vi-lactate) (Fig. 4E) by differentiating the data of Figure 4, B and C and correlated the GAPDH-SA with Vi-glucose (Fig. 4F) and Vi-lactate (Fig. 4G). The quantitative relationship between GAPDH-SA and Vi-lactate appeared to be composed of two functions (Fig. 4G). When GAPDH-SA% was between 23.8% ± 3% and 100% (Table 1), the Vi-lactate was a constant, the function could be expressed byf(x) = c(2) Table 1The aerobic glycolysis (V) as a function of the GAPDH specific activity as a variableGAPDH-SA%HeLaRKOMGC80-3SK-HEP-1A549CombinedaThe mean ± SD of five cell lines.

Open table in a new tab GAPDH-SA, GAPDH specific activity. When GAPDH-SA% was below 23.8% ± 3%, Vi-lactate was positively correlated with GAPDH-SA%, the relationship could be expressed by the following:f(x)=ax/(b+x)(3) where x refers the GAPDH-SA%. The half maximal Vi-lactate corresponded to 8.1% ± 0.7% GAPDH-SA in HeLa cells (Table 1). The relationship between GAPDH-SA% and Vi-glucose exhibited a similar pattern (Fig. 4F) to that between GAPDH-SA% and Vi-lactate. Using the same approach, we obtained the curves between Glc consumption or lactate generation and the GAPDH-SA in RKO, SK-HEP-1, MGC80-3, and A549. (Figs. S2–S5). Again, the quantitative relationship between Glc consumption or lactate generation and the GAPDH-SA could be grouped into two functions, as described for HeLa cells. The half maximal Vi-lactate corresponded to 3.5% ± 0.4% GAPDH-SA for RKO cells, 6.7% ± 0.4% GAPDH-SA for MGC80-3 cells, 4.1% ± 0.6% GAPDH-SA for SK-Hep-1 cells, and 4.8% ± 0.7% GAPDH-SA for A549 cells (Table 1). The data revealed a high similarity of the quantitative relationship between the glycolysis and GAPDH in the five cancer cell lines. We summarized the quantitative relationship between GAPDH-SA% and the glycolysis rate derived from the five cell lines in Table 1. The equations numerically correlate the glycolysis rate to GAPDH-SA% and introduce two critical values of the glycolysis rate that were achieved at two critical points of GAPDH-SA%. The first critical point of GAPDH-SA% is 19% ± 4.8%; above this point, the glycolysis rate is a constant, and below this point, the glycolysis rate decreased according to Equation 3. The second critical point of GAPDH-SA% is 5.4% ± 1.9%, at which the glycolysis rate is decreased by half. Numerically, the glycolysis rate versus GAPDH-SA% is equivalent to the glycolysis rate versus the concentration of GAPDH. We treated HeLa cells with serial concentrations of IA and monitored the cell growth, Glc consumption, lactate generation, and GAPDH-SA in a time course (Fig. 5, A–D). The data demonstrated an association between the variables (IA, GAPDH-SA, glycolysis, and cell growth). To better correlate the quantitative nature of these variables, we extracted the data of the 24 h point. We first correlated IA with the glycolysis rate and cell growth (Fig. 5, E and F). The IC50 of IA for Glc consumption and lactate generation were 9.0 and 9.5 μM, respectively, which were close to the IC50 (8.2 μM) of IA for cell growth inhibition. The cell number were positively correlated with the glycolysis rate (Fig. 5, G and H) Then, we correlated IA with GAPDH. The IC50 of IA for GAPDH-SA was 2.5 μM (Fig. 5I), which was much lower than the IC50 for glycolysis and cell growth. By plotting GAPDH-SA with the glycolysis rate, the half inhibition of Glc consumption and lactate generation corresponded to 6.8% and 6.5% GAPDH-SA, respectively (Fig. 5, J and K), which were consistent to the data in Figure 4. Cell growth versus GAPDH-SA conveyed the following information (Fig. 5L). We dissected the line into three segments. Cell growth was not affected by perturbing GAPDH-SA from 100% and 42.9% (the black segment); cell growth was inhibited by further reducing GAPDH-SA from 42.9% and 9.5% (green segment); and cell death occurred by further inhibiting GAPDH-SA% down to <9.5% (red segment). We then used RKO to repeat the same experiments, and we obtained the similar results (Fig. S6). We were curious about if the cells treated with 8 μM IA could resume proliferation. We treated HeLa and RKO cells with 8 μM IA for 48 h. The residual GAPDH-SA only retained 2.3% and 4.5% in HeLa and RKO, respectively, and cell growth was completely inhibited. We then removed the drug by displacing the medium. GAPDH activity recovered by 75% and 72%, respectively, in HeLa and RKO cells at the 72 h point after displacing the medium. Cells partially resumed proliferation (Fig. S7). It is noted that when GAPDH-SA% in cells varied from 100% to 19% ± 4.8%, the lactate generation rate kept constant. As the lactate generation rate kept constant, the rate through GAPDH in the glycolysis must also keep constant. Then why GAPDH-SA reduced from 100% to 19% does not affect the rate through GAPDH in the glycolysis? We found that GAPDH knockdown was associated with an increase of [GA3P] in cells, consistent in five cell lines (Fig. 6A). In IA titration experiments, [GA3P] was incrementally increased, accompanied with a corresponding decrement of GAPDH-SA (Fig. 6B). The reciprocal relationship between [GAPDH] and [GA3P] could be expressed quantitatively by Equation 4 (Fig. 6C):f(x)= C/(Ax+B)(4) where f(x) and x refer [GA3P] and GAPDH-SA%, respectively. The most fundamental principle of enzyme kinetics is that the catalytic rate of an enzyme is the function of the concentrations of both the enzyme and its substrate. The Km values of GAPDH were 0.065 to 0.11 mM (Fig. S8), consistent with the reported value (25Lambeir A.M. Loiseau A.M. Kuntz D.A. Vellieux F.M. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R.

Immunoaffinity purification and characterization of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica. 2009; 41: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cellular [GA3P] in untreated cells was 0.031 to 0.061 mM (Table S4), which were not saturating GAPDH. Therefore, the increased [GA3P] could increase GAPDH activity and countered the effect of GAPDH knockdown or inhibition. Based on the information, we propose that the rate through GAPDH in the glycolysis is balanced by the concentration of both GAPDH and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P), that is, the reciprocal relationship of the concentrations between GAPDH and GA3P could compensate each other and stabilize the rate through GAPDH in the glycolysis. The next question is to what extent the increased GA3P concentration could compensate the decreased GAPDH activity induced by GAPDH knockdown or inhibition. This issue requires determination of the GAPDH-AA. However, as the GAPDH in cells is compartmented (27Daniela A.S. Ellen K.S. Leonor C.A.S. Calderon-Aranda E.S.

To correlate GAPDH-AA with the glycolysis rate, we used the cell-free glycolysis system. In this system, we can assume that all the molecules of GAPDH are taking part in the glycolysis, hence we could estimate the GAPDH-AA, according to the kinetic curve (Fig. S8). We prepared cell lysate from HeLa-siGAPDH and added pure GAPDH into cell lysate to titrate GAPDH-SA. The titrated cell lysate was used for glycolysis assay. In the given range of relative concentration of GAPDH ([GAPDH]) from 0.6 to 1.4, we did not observe a rate of increase of lactate generation (Fig. 7A). [GA3P] was inversely proportional to relative [GAPDH] (Fig. 7B), and the data fit Equation 4. We then calculated the GAPDH-AA, which were virtually the same in the [GAPDH] range between 0.6 and 1.4 (Fig. 7C), quantitatively explaining why titration of GAPDH did not change the lactate generation rate. We then prepared cell lysate from HeLa cells pretreated with IA, which inhibited GAPDH-SA by 95%. The cell lysate was titrated by GAPDH and was used for cell-free glycolysis assay. We correlated the lactate generation with GAPDH-SA (Fig. 7D). The quantitative relationship is similar to that in the cells, that is, it could be expressed by two functions, f(x) = c when GAPDH-SA% is between 40% and 100% and f(x) = ax/(b + x) when GAPDH-SA% was below 40%. The reciprocal quantitative relationship between [GA3P] and GAPDH-SA% fits Equation 4 very well (Fig. 7E). Then, we calculated the GAPDH-AA and correlated GAPDH-AA with GAPDH-SA (Fig. 7F). From Figure 7, D and E, we could see that when GAPDH-SA% ranged from 100% to 40%, the lactate generation rate was a constant and GAPDH-AA was nearly constant. The half lactate generation rate corresponded to 4.3% GAPDH-SA and the estimated 50% GAPDH-AA corresponded to 10% GAPDH-SA. The data demonstrated that GAPDH-AA was in parallel with the lactate generation rate, indicating that the rate through GAPDH in the glycolysis was balanced by both [GAPDH] and [GA3P]. The thermodynamic state of glycolysis in five different cancer cell lines share the same pattern (Fig. S9A). The Q values (Table S3) were far smaller than Keq in the reactions catalyzed by HK, PFK1, and PK, generating a large and negative ΔG, which drives the forward flux of glycolysis. The ΔG of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-catalyzed reaction was between −3.4 and −4.1 kJ/mol, favoring the forward reaction, that is, converting pyruvate (Pyr) and NADH to lactate and NAD. This underlies the thermodynamic basis for the WE. The concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates were controlled by ΔG. The pattern of the glycolytic intermediates could be defined by the Q values or by the concentrations. The inter"

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically defined by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques, mainly constituted by amyloid β peptides (Aβ), along with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (1Selkoe D.J.

A large number of studies suggests that excessive cerebral accumulation of Aβ plays a central role in the development of AD pathology. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be cleaved by BACE1 at Asp1 (β-site; the first N-terminal residue of Aβ in APP) or at Glu11 (β′-site), generating soluble N-terminal APP fragments (sAPPβ or sAPPβ′, respectively) and membrane-bound C-terminal APP fragments (C99 or C89, respectively) (3Cai H.

Therefore, BACE1 has been considered a prime therapeutic drug target for lowering Aβ levels in the AD brain. However, clinical trials based on BACE inhibitors verubecestat and atabecestat were discontinued due to a modest worsening of cognitive function and other adverse effects including the onset of psychiatric symptoms (9Egan M.F.

More recently, Biogen and Eisai discontinued two phase-III trials (with BACE inhibitor elenbecestat) due to an unfavorable risk–benefit ratio. Given that the different molecules produced similar adverse effects, most likely these are mechanism-based side effects owing to reduced processing of BACE1 substrates that are essential for normal neuronal function. In order to understand and possibly avoid the mechanism-based side effects caused by BACE inhibitors, it is important to identify and validate BACE1 substrates in vivo. Besides APP, more than 60 putative BACE1 substrates have been reported in vitro using proteomic analysis (14Kuhn P.H. Koroniak K. Hogl S. Colombo A. Zeitschel U. Willem M. Volbracht C. Schepers U.

Neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) and neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) belong to the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF-CAMs). The overall structure of NCAM1 and NCAM2 is similar: five immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig 1–5) and two fibronectin type III repeats (FN 1–2). NCAM2 is expressed as a transmembrane isoform with a cytosolic region (NCAM2-TM) or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored (NCAM2-GPI) isoform (Fig. 1A). Similarly, three isoforms of NCAM1 are produced: two transmembrane isoforms with cytoplasmic tails of different lengths (NCAM1-180 or NCAM1-140) and a GPI-anchored isoform (NCAM1-120) (Fig. 1B). NCAM2-TM and NCAM1-140 amino acid sequences are ∼44% identical (27Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Fujita H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. OCAM: A new member of the neural cell adhesion molecule family related to zone-to-zone projection of olfactory and vomeronasal axons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NCAM2 contains eight putative Asn-linked glycosylation sites (N-glycosylation), while NCAM1 has six N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1C, blue triangles). NCAM1 is known to be posttranslationally modified by a linear chain of alpha 2,8 linked 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid of variable length (from 8 to 400), also known as polysialic acid (PSA) (28Sato C.

Cell Neurosci. 2013; 7: 61Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Hildebrandt H. Muhlenhoff M. Weinhold B. Gerardy-Schahn R. Dissecting polysialic acid and NCAM functions in brain development.J. Neurochem. 2007; 103 Suppl 1: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the fifth Ig domain (Ig5) of NCAM1, two of the three N-glycosylation sites are polysialylated (Fig. 1C, right panel). Sialic acid molecules are added to α-2,3 or α-2,6-linked mono-sialylated NCAM1 by two Golgi-resident polysialyltransferase ST8SIA2 (also known as STX) and ST8SIA4 (also known as PST) (29Hildebrandt H. Muhlenhoff M. Weinhold B. Gerardy-Schahn R. Dissecting polysialic acid and NCAM functions in brain development.J. Neurochem. 2007; 103 Suppl 1: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). ST8SIA2 is mainly responsible for PSA modification of NCAM1 in the developing brain, whereas ST8SIA4 is the major polysialyltransferase of the adult brain (30Angata K.

Neurobiol. 2006; 80: 129-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and its expression in the adult brain is highly restricted to the brain regions where neurogenesis is ongoing such as the hippocampus, subventricular zone, and olfactory system (34Bonfanti L.

Therefore, the polysialylation of NCAM1 needs to be highly regulated for normal cellular functions. In contrast, NCAM2 is not modified with PSA, suggesting that NCAM1 and NCAM2 have distinctive biological function in vivo (27Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Fujita H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. OCAM: A new member of the neural cell adhesion molecule family related to zone-to-zone projection of olfactory and vomeronasal axons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NCAMs have been shown to regulate formation, maturation, and maintenance of synapses (37Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Schachner M. Neural cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily regulate synapse formation, maintenance, and function.Trends Neurosci. 2017; 40: 295-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since synaptic loss is one of the earliest signs of AD (38Scheff S. Synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease: A review of ultrastructural studies.Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 1029-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the relationship between NCAMs and AD has been described in a number of reviews (39Leshchyns'ka I. Sytnyk V. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules in Alzheimer's disease.Neural Plast. 2016; 2016: 6427537PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nielsen H. Wennström Cell adhesion molecules in Alzheimer's disease.Degener. Neurol. Neuromuscul. Dis. 2012; 2: 65-77PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced synaptic levels of NCAM1 were reported in the frontal and temporal cortex of AD brains (41Aisa B. Gil-Bea F.J. Solas M. García-Alloza M. Chen C.P. Lai M.K. Francis P.T. Ramírez M.J. Altered NCAM expression associated with the cholinergic system in Alzheimer's disease.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 20: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, Leshchyns'ka et al. (42Leshchyns'ka I. Liew H.T. Shepherd C. Halliday G.M. Stevens C.H. Ke Y.D. Ittner L.M. Sytnyk V. Abeta-dependent reduction of NCAM2-mediated synaptic adhesion contributes to synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) showed that the levels of synaptic NCAM2 were significantly reduced while levels of soluble fragment of NCAM2 were increased in the hippocampus of AD brains compared with controls. These findings suggest an increased processing of NCAM2 at synapses. However, the protease responsible for NCAM2 processing has not been identified. Because BACE1 levels and activity are increased in AD brains compared with controls (43Li R. Lindholm K. Yang L.B. Yue X. Citron M. Yan R. Beach T. Sue L. Sabbagh M. Cai H. Wong P. Price D. Shen Y.

In contrast, the proteolysis of NCAM1 by metalloproteinases, including a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10, ADAM17, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9, has been well characterized (46Kalus I.

Moreover, proteomic studies reported that NCAM1 is a putative BACE1 substrate in vitro (15Hemming M.L. Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. Selkoe D.J. Identification of beta-secretase (BACE1) substrates using quantitative proteomics.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Dislich B. Wohlrab F. Bachhuber T. Muller S.A.

Cell Proteomics. 2015; 14: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage of NCAM1 by BACE1 was not previously validated in vivo. Here, we report that NCAM1 and NCAM2 are BACE1 substrates in vivo. We demonstrate that BACE1 differentially processes NCAM1 and NCAM2 depending on the region of brain, subcellular localization, and age in vivo. Our data indicate that BACE1 controls neuronal physiology by spatiotemporally regulating the proteolysis of some of its substrates. Since NCAM2 is highly expressed in mouse olfactory epithelium and the brain (27Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Fujita H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. OCAM: A new member of the neural cell adhesion molecule family related to zone-to-zone projection of olfactory and vomeronasal axons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first investigated the proteolysis of NCAM2 in the olfactory bulb (OB) of BACE1+/+ and BACE1−/− mice at the age of 4 months. Sequentially prepared soluble and membrane fractions were analyzed by immunoblot with mouse anti-N-terminal NCAM2 antibody (sc-136328) (Fig. 1C). Three soluble NCAM2 fragments (sNCAM2) were detected in the soluble fraction of BACE1+/+ OB (Fig. 1D). Importantly, an sNCAM2 fragment with a size of ∼88 kDa was almost absent in BACE1−/− samples (Fig. 1D, arrow), indicating that it is generated by BACE1 cleavage (sNCAM2β). To confirm the specificity of the BACE1-derived fragment, western blot was performed with a goat anti-N-terminal NCAM2 antibody (AF778) previously validated in NCAM2 null tissue (Fig. S1B and Table S1). Consistent with the data obtained with sc-136328 mouse antibody (Figs. 1C and S1A), an sNCAM2 fragment with a size of ∼88 kDa was almost absent in BACE1−/− samples (Fig. S1B, arrow), indicating that it is generated by BACE1 cleavage (sNCAM2β). In order to identify nonspecific bands detected by secondary antibodies, we performed western blot with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse and anti-goat) without primary antibodies (Fig. S1D). Although nonspecific bands were detected (open arrowhead), none of these bands corresponded to the ∼88 kDa sNCAM2 fragment (Fig. S1, B and D). In the membrane fraction of BACE1+/+ and BACE1−/− OB, two bands corresponding to the two isoforms of NCAM2 (NCAM2-TM and NCAM2-GPI) were detected (Fig. 1, A and D). However, there was no change in the levels of full-length NCAM2 (NCAM2-FL) in BACE1−/− OB (Fig. 1D). Next, we assessed the proteolysis of NCAM1 in soluble and membrane fractions, prepared from OB of BACE1+/+ and BACE1−/− mice. Immunoblot analysis with goat anti-N-terminal NCAM1 antibody (AF2408) (Fig. 1C) revealed three soluble NCAM1 fragments (sNCAM1) in the soluble fraction of BACE1+/+ OB (Fig. 1D). Similar to NCAM2, an sNCAM1 fragment with a size of ∼95 kDa was not detected in BACE1−/− samples (Fig. 1D, arrow), indicating that it is generated by BACE1 cleavage (sNCAM1β). Western blot with HRP-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody without the primary antibody revealed nonspecific bands (Fig. S1C, open arrowhead). However, none of these bands corresponded to the ∼95 kDa sNCAM1 fragment. Three isoforms of full-length NCAM1 (NCAM1-120, NCAM1-140, and NCAM1-180) were detected in the membrane fraction of BACE1+/+ OB (Fig. 1D). A slight increase in the levels of full-length NCAM1 (NCAM1-180 and NCAM1-140, but not NCAM1-120) was observed in BACE1−/− samples compared with BACE+/+ samples (Fig. 1, A and D). In order to detect BACE1-specific C-terminal NCAM1 and NCAM2 fragment (NCAM1-βCTF and NCAM2-βCTF, respectively) in vivo, we performed western blot of membrane fraction of 4-month-old BACE1+/+ and BACE1−/− OB samples using anti-C-terminal NCAM1 (rabbit pAb; AB5032 and mouse mAb; 5B8) and anti-C-terminal NCAM2 (goat pAb; GTX89311) antibodies (Fig. 1, E–G). Full-length NCAM1-180 and NCAM1-140 were detected by three different anti-C-terminal NCAM1 antibodies (AB5032, 0B11, and 5B8), while GPI-anchored NCAM1-120 was not detected owing to the absence of C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1, B, E, and F, and Fig S2A, arrow). All the anti-C-terminal NCAM1 antibodies detected a ∼75 kDa C-terminal NCAM1 fragment (NCAM1-βCTF) that was significantly decreased in BACE1−/− OB samples, indicating that it is produced by BACE1 cleavage (NCAM1-βCTF) (Fig. 1, E and F, and Fig S2A, arrowhead). The specificity of both AB5032 and 5B8 was previously validated in NCAM1 null tissue (Table S1). Furthermore, western blot performed with HRP-conjugated anti-goat, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies without primary antibodies revealed nonspecific bands (Fig. S2B, open arrowhead). However, none of these bands corresponded to the ∼75 kDa NCAM1-βCTF. Similar to NCAM1, full-length NCAM2-TM was detected by anti-C-terminal NCAM2 (GTX89311) antibody, while the GPI-anchored NCAM2 (NCAM2-GPI) isoform was not detected owing to the absence of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1, A and G, arrow). In contrast to NCAM1, we did not detect the BACE1-specific NCAM2-CTF (NCAM2-βCTF) in the membrane fraction of BACE1+/+ OB even after a longer exposure of the same blot. Lack of detection is most likely owing to the level of NCAM2-βCTF being below the detection limit of western blot, to its rapid degradation, or to its further proteolytic processing. Based on our finding that NCAM1 and NCAM2 are BACE1 substrates in the OB, NCAM1 and NCAM2 are expected to be colocalized with BACE1 in this brain region. Thus, we performed immunostaining of BACE1+/+ OB sections with anti-BACE1, anti-NCAM1, and anti-NCAM2 antibodies. As previously reported (19Hitt B. Riordan S.M. Kukreja L. Eimer W.A. Rajapaksha T.W.

https://openalex.org/W3129153713,"The recent discovery of the cancer-associated E76K mutation in histone H2B (H2BE76-to-K) in several types of cancers revealed a new class of oncohistone. H2BE76K weakens the stability of histone octamers, alters gene expression, and promotes colony formation. However, the mechanism linking the H2BE76K mutation to cancer development remains largely unknown. In this study, we knock in the H2BE76K mutation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and show that the E76K mutant histone H2B preferentially localizes to genic regions. Interestingly, genes upregulated in the H2BE76K mutant cells are enriched for the E76K mutant H2B and are involved in cell adhesion and proliferation pathways. We focused on one H2BE76K target gene, ADAM19 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-domain-containing protein 19), a gene highly expressed in various human cancers including breast invasive carcinoma, and demonstrate that H2BE76K directly promotes ADAM19 transcription by facilitating efficient transcription along the gene body. ADAM19 depletion reduced the colony formation ability of the H2BE76K mutant cells, whereas wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing ADAM19 mimics the colony formation phenotype of the H2BE76K mutant cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate the mechanism by which H2BE76K deregulates the expression of genes that control oncogenic properties through a combined effect of its specific genomic localization and nucleosome destabilization effect. The recent discovery of the cancer-associated E76K mutation in histone H2B (H2BE76-to-K) in several types of cancers revealed a new class of oncohistone. H2BE76K weakens the stability of histone octamers, alters gene expression, and promotes colony formation. However, the mechanism linking the H2BE76K mutation to cancer development remains largely unknown.

Histones are nuclear proteins required for the packaging of genomic DNA in the form of chromatin. Two copies of each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 with ∼147 bp of DNA form a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 {Å} resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). The compaction of DNA into the nucleosome, however, creates major obstacles to gene regulatory processes, such as transcription and DNA replication. Nucleosome dynamics, regulated in part by histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) (2Lawrence M. Daujat S. Schneider R. Lateral thinking : How histone modifications regulate gene expression.Trends Genet. 2016; 32: 42-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), thus play a major role in modulating gene activity by controlling DNA accessibility. Misregulation of histone PTMs has been extensively linked to cancer (3Audia J.E. Campbell R.M. Histone modifications and cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8a019521Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and was most recently implicated in cancers containing mutations in genes encoding histone H3 (4Wan Y.C.E. Liu J. Chan K.M.

Notably, these cancer-associated H3 mutations are all located at or near key lysine residues that are posttranslationally modified and thus affect key regulatory PTMs, subsequently driving oncogenesis through changes in the epigenetic landscape and gene expression profiles. To address whether additional histone mutations exist in other malignancies, we searched for missense mutations that occur in histone encoding genes in cancer patient samples through the cBioPortal database (12Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B. Sumer S.O. Sun Y. Jacobsen A. Sinha R. Larsson E. Cerami E. Sander C. Schultz N. Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8695) Google Scholar). We identified a couple of novel cancer-associated mutations in genes encoding histone H2B, including the H2BG53D mutation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) we recently reported (13Wan Y.C.E.

Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we found the E76 residue to be the most frequently mutated H2B residue in various cancers including breast and lung carcinoma, which contained either Glu76Lys (E76K) or Glu76Gln (E76Q) missense mutations in genes encoding H2B (Table S1). Interestingly, the ectopic overexpression of H2BE76K has been previously shown to enhance colony formation ability in mouse fibroblast and human epithelial cells, suggesting that H2BE76K can confer oncogenic properties (16Bennett R.L.

Z. 1 affect the structure and stability of the nucleosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 10007-10018PubMed Google Scholar). Within the nucleosome, the H2BE76 residue (equivalent to E73 in Xenopus laevis) interacts directly with the R92 residue of histone H4 through hydrogen bonding at the H2A-H2B dimer–(H3-H4)2 tetramer interface (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 {Å} resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that the abolishment of this interaction by H2BE76K destabilizes the nucleosome (17Arimura Y. Ikura M. Fujita R. Noda M. Kobayashi W. Horikoshi N. Sun J. Shi L. Kusakabe M.

Z. 1 affect the structure and stability of the nucleosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 10007-10018PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the H3K27M and H3K36M mutations, which directly alter global levels H3K27 and H3K36 methylation, respectively, H2BE76K does not occur on a posttranslationally modified site and is therefore unlikely to directly affect PTMs (18Huang H. Sabari B.R. Garcia B.A. Allis C.D. Zhao Y. SnapShot: Histone modifications.Cell. 2014; 159: 458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Instead, the H2BE76K mutation has been suggested to promote gene expression through its nucleosome destabilizing effect (16Bennett R.L. Bele A. Small E.C. Will C.M. Nabet B. Oyer J.A. Huang X. Ghosh R.P. Grzybowski A.T. Yu T. Zhang Q. Riva A. Lele T.P. Schatz G.C. Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the complete picture of how H2BE76K induces transcriptional misregulation remains unclear, as H2BE76K expression has been shown to result in both gene activation and repression (16Bennett R.L. Bele A. Small E.C. Will C.M. Nabet B. Oyer J.A. Huang X. Ghosh R.P. Grzybowski A.T. Yu T. Zhang Q. Riva A. Lele T.P. Schatz G.C. Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how H2BE76K mediates specific transcriptional changes to promote oncogenic phenotypes also remains to be answered. The average tumor allele frequency of the H2BE76K mutation in tumors (∼20%) suggests that it is an acquired subclonal mutation rather than a germline mutation and is likely to cooperate with other driver mutations in later stages of cancer progression (15Nacev B.A. Feng L. Bagert J.D. Lemiesz A.E. Gao J. Soshnev A.A. Kundra R. Schultz N. Muir T.W. Allis C.D.

Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Table S1). Supporting this notion, the expression of H2BE76K alone has been shown to have no effect on the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, but could enhance colony formation ability in the presence of the oncogenic PI3KCA-H1047R mutant (16Bennett R.L. Bele A. Small E.C. Will C.M. Nabet B. Oyer J.A. Huang X. Ghosh R.P. Grzybowski A.T. Yu T. Zhang Q. Riva A. Lele T.P. Schatz G.C. Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To dissect the molecular mechanism by which H2BE76K promotes breast cancer development, we knock in the H2BE76K mutation in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Using CUT&RUN, we mapped the genome-wide localization of the H2BE76K mutant histone and found that H2BE76K preferentially localizes on gene bodies. We further identify the H2BE76K-enriched gene ADAM19 as a direct target linking H2BE76K to oncogenic phenotypes. Collectively, these findings illustrate the effects of the H2BE76K mutation in transcription misregulation and breast cancer development. The E76 residue of histone H2B is evolutionarily conserved among yeast and higher eukaryotes (Fig. 1A) and is located at the H2B-H4 interface in the center of the histone octamer (Fig. 1B). Recent studies have shown that the H2BE76K mutation destabilizes the nucleosome by disrupting H2B-H4 interactions (16Bennett R.L. Bele A. Small E.C. Will C.M. Nabet B. Oyer J.A. Huang X. Ghosh R.P. Grzybowski A.T. Yu T. Zhang Q. Riva A. Lele T.P. Schatz G.C. Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Arimura Y. Ikura M. Fujita R. Noda M. Kobayashi W. Horikoshi N. Sun J. Shi L. Kusakabe M. Harata M. Ohkawa Y. Tashiro S. Kimura H. Ikura T. Kurumizaka H. Cancer-associated mutations of histones H2B, H3. 1 and H2A. Z. 1 affect the structure and stability of the nucleosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 10007-10018PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to H2BE76K’s effect on nucleosome stability, we asked whether the mutation might also affect histone modifications and nucleosome–histone chaperone interactions. To address this, FLAG-tagged H2BE76 mutants were expressed in 293T cells followed by FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP). FLAG-IP results confirmed the negative effect of the H2BE76K mutation on H2B-H3/H4 interaction (Fig. 1C). The substitution of H2BE76 to K and Q, as well as to the neutrally charged alanine (A), reduced H2B association with H3 and H4, with the E76K mutant showing the strongest effect. Intriguingly, we also found that the H2BE76K, but not the H2BE76Q mutant, displayed elevated interaction with both the H2A-H2B chaperones nucleosome assembly protein 1-Like 1 and 2 (NAP1L1 and NAP1L2) and reduced interaction with the H2A-H2B chaperone FACT subunit SPT16. While the presence of the mutant H2BE76K did not affect global histone modification levels in transfected 293T cells, the H2BE76K mutation led to a reduced association with H2AK119 ubiquitination (H2AK119ub), a repressive histone mark (19Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing: Knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and H2BK120 ubiquitination, a histone mark associated with active transcription elongation (20Minsky N. Shema E. Field Y. Schuster M. Segal E. Oren M. Monoubiquitinated H2B is associated with the transcribed region of highly expressed genes in human cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We confirmed the reduced H2AK119ub and H2BK120ub levels in fixed mononucleosomes containing H2BE76 mutants (Fig. 1D). Interestingly we also found increased H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) levels specifically on H2BE76K-containing nucleosomes. While both H2BE76K and H2BE76Q mutations reduced H2AK119ub and H2BK120ub levels in cis, the two mutations appear to be functionally distinct as H2BE76K, but not the H2BE76Q mutant, protein differentially binds to histone chaperones. We reasoned that since the H2BE76K mutation is an acquired subclonal mutation, normal nontransformed cells might not acquire oncogenic phenotypes when the H2BE76K mutant histone is expressed at a physiological level. To study the effect of H2BE76K mutation in cancer development, we generated knock-in (KI) mutant cell lines using the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was employed to introduce the H2BE76K mutation into an H2B encoding gene to express the H2BE76K mutant at a physiological level mimicking patient conditions (Fig. 1, E and F). To achieve this, we substituted one of the 17 somatic H2B encoding genes, HIST1H2BO, with a wild-type (WT) or E76K mutated H2B through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). We chose to target HIST1H2BO since 1) the H2BE76K mutation was found in this H2B gene in breast cancer (Table S1) and 2) to minimize CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects, as the sgRNAs targeting this H2B gene had the highest predicted specificity scores. We tagged both the WT and E76K mutant H2B with a FLAG-tag at the C-terminal tail for the assessment of expression levels and the mapping of the genomic distribution of the H2BE76K mutant histones. The targeted editing was confirmed through PCR genotyping with no effects on the top predicted off-target sites and on other H2B genes with high sequence similarity to HIST1H2BO (Fig. S1, A–C, Fig. S2, A and B). Herein, KI cell lines expressing FLAG-WT H2B and FLAG-H2BE76K are referred to as WT and H2BE76K cells, respectively. Global histone modifications levels were unaffected in the mutant cell lines carrying either the WT or E76K mutant H2B (Fig. S3). Cell fractionation assays revealed a small portion of H2BE76K that failed to deposit on the chromatin and remained in the cytosolic fraction; however, the majority of the E76K mutant H2B was still successfully incorporated into the chromatin (Fig. 1G, Fig. S4). We subsequently performed FLAG-IP using the cytoplasmic and mononucleosomes fractions and found that both cytosolic and chromatin-bound H2BE76K protein interacts with NAP1L1 and NAP1L2 (Fig. 1G), similar to the increased H2BE76K-NAP1L1/NAP1L2 interactions observed in 293T cells (Fig. 1, C and D). The H2BE76K-containing nucleosomes additionally displayed decreased H2AK119ub, in agreement with the results of the IP experiments performed with 293T cells (Fig. 1C). While a previous study has shown the transcriptional changes that accompanied the ectopic overexpression of H2BE76K, the exact mechanism underlying H2BE76K’s effect on gene expression remains unclear (16Bennett R.L. Bele A. Small E.C. Will C.M. Nabet B. Oyer J.A. Huang X. Ghosh R.P. Grzybowski A.T. Yu T. Zhang Q. Riva A. Lele T.P. Schatz G.C. Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To understand H2BE76K’s direct effect on gene expression, we performed CUT&RUN (21Skene P.J. Henikoff S. An efficient targeted nuclease strategy for high-resolution mapping of DNA binding sites.Elife. 2017; 6e21856Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) to map the genomic localization of the FLAG-tagged WT H2B and H2BE76K mutant histones in WT and H2BE76K cell lines, respectively (Fig. 2A, Fig. S5). Histone H2A CUT&RUN was performed to assess nucleosomal occupancy and additionally acts as an internal control for the FLAG CUT&RUN (Fig. S5A). Intriguingly, we found that the genomic distribution of FLAG-H2BE76K was markedly different compared with that of FLAG-WT H2B. While the major portion of FLAG-WT H2B peaks were localized in intergenic regions, more than 70% of FLAG-H2BE76K peaks are located in genic regions (Fig. 2B). Profiles of average FLAG CUT&RUN signals show that FLAG-H2BE76K is specifically enriched on gene body regions, downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (Fig. 2C). The increased genic FLAG-H2BE76K enrichment was not attributed to nucleosomal occupancy changes, as the average H2A CUT&RUN signals were comparable between the WT and H2BE76K mutant cells (Fig. S5). A previous report on H2BE76K’s effect on chromatin accessibility showed that ectopic H2BE76K overexpression promoted chromatin accessibility and gene expression in MCF10a cells (16Bennett R.L. Bele A. Small E.C. Will C.M. Nabet B. Oyer J.A. Huang X. Ghosh R.P. Grzybowski A.T. Yu T. Zhang Q. Riva A. Lele T.P. Schatz G.C. Kelleher N.L. et al.A mutation in histone H2B represents a new class of oncogenic driver.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1438-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, our genome-wide chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq (Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing) (22Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3185) Google Scholar) showed that H2BE76K-enriched genes, as exemplified at the CHKA, KMT5B, LRP5, PPP6R3, and MRPL21 loci, did not display apparent chromatin accessibility changes in our H2BE76K mutant cells (Fig. 2A). We further performed differential occupancy analysis on genes and found significant FLAG-H2BE76K enrichment (Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) adjusted p < 0.05, log2 fold change (log2FC) > 0.5) in more than 2000 genes (Fig. S5C). We validated the FLAG CUT&RUN results by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and confirmed H2BE76K enrichment patterns on selected genes in chromosome 11 highlighted in Figure 2A (Fig. S6). Analysis of genome-wide differential distribution patterns between WT H2B and H2BE76K further revealed the specific gain of H2BE76K enrichment in promoter (16.2%) and genic (82.9%) regions, whereas the lost H2B occurred equally across promoter (35.7%), genic (38.7%), and intergenic (25.7%) regions (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results show that H2BE76K is redistributed to and preferentially localizes in genic regions. To further investigate the effect of the H2BE76K mutation on gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptomes of the KI cell lines using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The H2BE76K cell lines exhibited a distinct gene expression profile with 228 significantly upregulated and 493 downregulated genes (BH adjusted p < 0.05, absolute log2FC > 0.25) from two independent experiments comparing two H2BE76K KI clones and two isogenic WT clones (Fig. 3A, Fig. S7). Importantly, we found that some cancer-associated pathways such as cell adhesion and cell proliferation were significantly enriched in genes showing upregulation by gene ontology (GO) analysis. In contrast, cancer-related pathways such as focal adhesion assembly, cell signaling as well as response to hypoxia were also significantly enriched in downregulated genes (Fig. 3B). We performed RT-qPCR and confirmed the differential expression of several cancer driver genes (23Bailey M.H. Tokheim C. Porta-Pardo E. Sengupta S. Bertrand D. Weerasinghe A. Colaprico A. Wendl M.C. Kim J. Reardon B. Ng P.K.-S. Jeong K.J. Cao S. Wang Z. Gao J. et al.Comprehensive characterization of cancer driver genes and mutations.Cell. 2018; 173: 371-385.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar): increased mRNA expression of oncogenes MYC and PIK3CG, as well as decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes CDKN1A and EPHA2, was observed in the H2BE76K mutant cells (Fig. 3C). To investigate the direct role of H2BE76K in gene misregulation, we analyzed H2BE76K’s genomic localization in relation to gene expression changes (Fig. 3D, Fig. S8, A and B). Intriguingly, we observed that genes upregulated in H2BE76K mutant cells exhibited increased H2BE76K enrichment (enrichment over FLAG-WT H2B) (Fig. 3D). As represented by H2A CUT&RUN, total nucleosomal occupancy on the upregulated genes was comparable between WT and H2BE76K mutant cells (Fig. S9, C–E). More importantly, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed a positive correlation between upregulated genes and H2BE76K enrichment, suggesting a relationship between H2BE76K enrichment and increased transcription (Fig. 3E). Figure 3F shows the 78 upregulated genes with the most significant H2BE76K enrichment (Table S2). The role of the H2BE76K mutation in cancer was further characterized by studying the oncogenic properties of the H2BE76K mutant cells. The H2BE76K mutant cell lines formed bigger colonies than the WT isogenic lines and one of the H2BE76K mutant lines had moderate increased proliferation rates (Fig. S9, A and B). RNA-seq results showed that the expression of genes that control cellular phenotypes was affected (Fig. 3B), which might directly contribute to the increased clonogenicity of the H2BE76K mutant cells. Indeed, several upregulated genes in the H2BE76K mutant cells, such as WNT7B and PTN, are involved in promoting metastasis-associated tumor cell phenotypes, including increased clonogenicity (24De P. Carlson J.H. Wu H. Marcus A. Leyland-Jones B. Dey N.

Signal. 2018; 16: 92Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. S9C). To identify H2BE76K target genes that promote colony formation in the H2BE76K mutant cells, we depleted multiple H2BE76K target genes individually using lentiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Intriguingly, we found that the knockdown of one of the H2BE76K-enriched genes, ADAM19 (Fig. 4, A and B, Figs. S9A and S10), reduced the sizes of colonies formed by the H2BE76K cells to the sizes of WT colonies treated with nontargeting (NT) shRNA (Fig. 4, C and D) with minimal effect on proliferation (Fig. S9). ADAM19 belongs to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family that comprises transmembrane and secreted proteins and is found to be highly expressed in various human carcinomas including breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (Fig. S11). Conversely, the overexpression of ADAM19 significantly increased the sizes of colonies formed by the WT cells (Fig. 4, E–G). These results demonstrate that ADAM19 upregulation promotes the colony formation ability of the H2BE76K cells. We next investigated the mechanism of ADAM19’s upregulation in the H2BE76K mutant cells. As H2BE76K destabilizes the nucleosome, its enrichment on gene bodies may provide a more permissive environment for RNA polymerase II (Pol II) progression. As Pol II recruitment is a key step of transcription activation, we first examined Pol II occupancy on ADAM19 by ChIP-qPCR. We monitored Pol II recruitment by treating the cells with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole1-β-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) to inhibit the positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb) kinase. DRB treatment inhibits initiating Pol II from entering productive elongation while allowing elongating complexes to complete transcription, effectively arresting Pol II surrounding the TSS. Pol II recruitment to ADAM19 was comparable between WT and H2BE76K cells, suggesting an alternative mechanism driving ADAM19’s upregulation (Fig. 5A). To further examine the effect of H2BE76K on ADAM19 transcription, we monitored in vivo Pol II transcription elongation by transiently inhibiting transcription elongation with DRB (26Singh J. Padgett R.A. Rates of in situ transcription and splicing in large human genes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W3126909829,"Context Obesity is a growing global health concern. The increased body mass and altered mass distribution associated with obesity may be related to increases in plantar shear that putatively leads to physical functional deficits. Therefore, measurement of plantar shear may provide unique insights on the effects of body mass and body distribution on physical function or performance. Purpose 1) To investigate the effects of body mass and distribution on plantar shear. 2) To examine how altered plantar shear influences postural control and gait kinetics. Hypothesis 1) a weighted vest forward distributed (FV) would shift the center of pressure (CoP) location forward during standing compared with a weighted vest evenly distributed (EV), 2) FV would increase plantar shear spreading forces more than EV during standing, 3) FV would increase postural sway during standing while EV would not, and 4) FV would elicit greater compensatory changes during walking than EV. Methods Twenty healthy young males participated in four different tests: 1) static test (for measuring plantar shear and CoP location without acceleration, 2) bilateral-foot standing postural control test, 3) single-foot standing postural test, and 4) walking test. All tests were executed in three different weight conditions: 1) unweighted (NV), 2) EV with 20% added body mass, and 3) FV, also with 20% added body mass. Plantar shear stresses were measured using a pressure/shear device, and several shear and postural control metrics were extracted. Repeated measures ANOVAs with Holms post hoc test were used to compare each metric among the three conditions (α = 0.05). Results FV and EV increased both AP and ML plantar shear forces compared to NV. FV shifted CoP forward in single-foot trials. FV and EV showed decreased CoP range and velocity and increased Time-to-Boundary (TTB) during postural control compared to NV. EV and FV showed increased breaking impulse and propulsive impulse compared to NV. In addition, EV showed even greater impulses than FV. While EV increased ML plantar shear spreading force, FV increased AP plantar shear spreading force during walking. Conclusion Added body mass increases plantar shear spreading forces. Body mass distribution had greater effects during dynamic tasks. In addition, healthy young individuals seem to quickly adapt to external stimuli to control postural stability. However, as this is a first step study, follow-up studies are necessary to further support the clinical role of plantar shear in other populations such as elderly and individuals with obesity or diabetes."

Because recent machine learning application in the clinical area has been shown to enhance prediction ability, applying this technique to this issue can lead to an accurate prediction model for in-hospital mortality prediction. In this study, we aimed to generate an accurate prediction model of in-hospital mortality using machine learning techniques. Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to the University of Tokyo Hospital between January 1, 2009 and December 26, 2017 were used in this study. The data were divided into a training/validation data set (n = 119,160) and a test data set (n = 33,970) according to the time of admission. The prediction target of the model was the in-hospital mortality within 14 days. To generate the prediction model, 25 variables (age, sex, 21 laboratory test items, length of stay, and mortality) were used to predict in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression, random forests, multilayer perceptron, and gradient boost decision trees were performed to generate the prediction models. To evaluate the prediction capability of the model, the model was tested using a test data set. Mean probabilities obtained from trained models with five-fold cross-validation were used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. In a test stage using the test data set, prediction models of in-hospital mortality within 14 days showed AUROC values of 0.936, 0.942, 0.942, and 0.938 for logistic regression, random forests, multilayer perceptron, and gradient boosting decision trees, respectively. Machine learning-based prediction of short-term in-hospital mortality using admission laboratory data showed outstanding prediction capability and, therefore, has the potential to be useful for the risk assessment of patients at the time of hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W3128594637,"Pear is one of the most important economic fruits worldwide. The productivity is often negatively affected by drought disaster, but the effects and adaptive mechanism of pear in response to drought stress has not been well understood at the gene transcription levels. Using Illumina HiSeq 2500, the transcriptome from ’Yulu Xiang’ Pear leaves were sequenced and analyzed to evaluate the effects of long-term drought stress on the expression of genes in different biosynthetic pathways. Results showed that long-term drought stress weakened antioxidant systematization and impaired the synthesis of photosynthetic pigment in ’ Yulu Xiang ’ Pear leaves. The reduced light utilization and photosynthetic productivity finally resulted in the inhibited fruit development. The transcriptome survey and expression analysis identified 2,207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which were summarized into the 30 main functional categories. DEGs analysis showed that the enzyme genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis under drought stress were up-regulated, and the promoted process of phenylpropanoid synthesis may be beneficial to reduce the transpiration rate and increase water use efficiency of ’ Yulu Xiang ’ Pear leaves. Up-regulated malate dehydrogenase expression were also observed in drought stress groups, and the activated soluble sugar biosynthesis could be helpful to promote osmotic regulation and increase antioxidant capacity to enhance drought resistance of leaves. The mRNA expression of enzyme genes associated with hormones including ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberellin were higher in drought stress groups than that in control, indicating a promoted cell proliferation under drought stress. Long-term drought stress significantly decreased photosynthetic productivity, and negatively affected development of ’ Yulu Xiang ’ Pear. Transcriptome survey and expression analysis reveals that the inhibited photosynthesis could be closely related with drought-induced lignification and hormones synthesis, and the present dataset can provide more valuable information to analyze the function of drought stress-related genes improving plant drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3127150327,"Reliable measurement of ligand binding to cell surface receptors is of outstanding biological and pharmacological importance. Resonance energy transfer–based assays are powerful approaches to achieve this goal, but the currently available methods are hindered by the necessity of receptor tagging, which can potentially alter ligand binding properties. Therefore, we developed a tag-free system to measure ligand‒receptor interactions in live cells using the Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) as a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer donor. GLuc is as small as the commonly applied Nanoluciferase but has enhanced brightness, and its proper substrate is the frequently used coelenterazine. In our assay, bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer is detected between a GLuc-based extracellular surface biosensor and fluorescent ligands bound to their unmodified receptors. The broad spectrum of applications includes equilibrium and kinetic ligand binding measurements for both labeled and competitive unlabeled ligands, and the assay can be utilized for different classes of plasma membrane receptors. Furthermore, the assay is suitable for high-throughput screening, as evidenced by the identification of novel α1 adrenergic receptor ligands.

Our data demonstrate that GLuc-based biosensors provide a simple, sensitive, and cost-efficient platform for drug characterization and development. The superfamily of plasma membrane (PM) receptors consists of a diverse range of signaling proteins, such as G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), tyrosine kinase receptors, enzyme-linked receptors, nutrient receptors, or ion channels. In addition to their important role in sensing environmental signals, their altered function is commonly reported in a wide array of pathological conditions. Accordingly, most of our currently prescribed drugs target cell surface receptors (1Santos R. Ursu O. Gaulton A. Bento A.P. Donadi R.S. Bologa C.G. Karlsson A. Al-Lazikani B. Hersey A. Oprea T.I. Overington J.P. A comprehensive map of molecular drug targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). A growing number of evidences indicates that characteristics of drug‒receptor interaction may profoundly shape the pharmacological outcome. In addition to affinity and efficacy, kinetic ligand parameters were also shown to be decisive factors for the clinical action of drugs. Association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff) of drugs, by defining ligand residence time, have been linked to various drug properties, such as duration of action, efficacy, or occurrence of side effects (2Copeland R.A.

Therefore, the proper characterization of drug‒receptor interactions represents a major task for drug development. Although various techniques with different advantageous properties are available, they all have serious drawbacks (8Stoddart L.A. Kilpatrick L.E. Hill S.J. NanoBRET approaches to study ligand binding to GPCRs and RTKs.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2018; 39: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For example, traditional radioligand binding measurements are ponderous and burdensome, especially in case of kinetic binding measurements, and the strict rules required for handling radioactive compounds limit their use. In contrast, fluorescence-based approaches are not hindered by the practical limitations surrounding the use of radioactivity but often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio due to the autofluorescence of biological samples. By overcoming these limitations, resonance energy transfer–based measurements have revolutionized the application of fluorescent ligands in binding measurements (9Castro M. Nikolaev V.O. Palm D. Lohse M.J. Vilardaga J.-P. Turn-on switch in parathyroid hormone receptor by a two-step parathyroid hormone binding mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fluorescence- and bioluminescence-based approaches to study GPCR ligand binding.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2016; 173: 3028-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In these assays, resonance energy transfer is detected between a fluorescent or luminescent donor attached to a receptor and a fluorophore conjugated to a receptor ligand. Since the efficiency of resonance energy transfer strongly depends on the molecular proximity, a condition that is met during ligand binding, the signal-to-noise ratio is greatly enhanced. Time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) have been successfully used to detect ligand binding of various receptors for equilibrium and kinetic measurements as well. However, these methods require the covalent labeling of the target protein, which may substantially alter the receptor function. Furthermore, the high cost of some substrates may limit their use in high-throughput applications. Therefore, there is a continuous need for new and surpassing assays to assess ligand‒receptor binding. Here we report a novel BRET-based approach to measure ligand binding of cell surface receptors. The method is cost-effective, does not need receptor modification, and is also applicable in high-throughput drug screenings. Since N-terminal receptor tagging with naturally nonsecreted and high-molecular-weight luciferases (such as Renilla luciferase) induces endoplasmic retention and impaired PM expression of several receptors, it was not possible to study receptor‒ligand binding with BRET for a long time (8Stoddart L.A. Kilpatrick L.E. Hill S.J. NanoBRET approaches to study ligand binding to GPCRs and RTKs.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2018; 39: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This limitation has been overcome by the development of the small luciferase NanoLuciferase (NanoLuc) (14Hall M.P. Unch J. Binkowski B.F. Valley M.P. Butler B.L. Wood M.G. Otto P. Zimmerman K. Vidugiris G. Machleidt T. Robers M.B. Benink H.A. Eggers C.T. Slater M.R. Meisenheimer P.L. et al.Engineered luciferase reporter from a deep sea shrimp utilizing a novel imidazopyrazinone substrate.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), a variant of the naturally secreted luciferase of the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris, which has made BRET suitable to detect ligand binding of NanoLuc-tagged receptors. However, the high cost of furimazine, the proper substrate of NanoLuc, seriously hinders the widespread application, especially in high-throughput experiments. Therefore, we aimed to establish a system using an alternative coelenterazine-utilizing luciferase that is also secreted naturally; thus, it may not induce incorrect folding of proteins tagged on the extracellular side. The luciferase of the marine copepod Gaussia princeps (Gaussia luciferase, GLuc) has the same molecular weight as NanoLuc (19 kDa), but its appropriate substrate is a natural substance, the native coelenterazine (Fig. 1A) (15Kaskova Z.M. Tsarkova A.S. Yampolsky I.V. 1001 lights: Luciferins, luciferases, their mechanisms of action and applications in chemical analysis, biology and medicine.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2016; 45: 6048-6077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since GLuc is rapidly inactivated, we used a mutant of GLuc (GLucM23) (16Lindberg E. Mizukami S. Ibata K. Fukano T. Miyawaki A. Kikuchi K. Development of cell-impermeable coelenterazine derivatives.Chem. Sci. 2013; 4: 4395Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which emits light substantially longer and was shown to be even 10-fold brighter than the wildtype enzyme. First, we compared the properties of GLuc and NanoLuc with constructs that label the extracellular surface of the PM (GLuc‒PM and NanoLuc‒PM) by fusing them to a transmembrane domain. We also created versions of the constructs that were intracellularly tagged with Venus to perform expression-normalized comparisons (Fig. 1B). Using bioluminescent and fluorescent image acquisition, we verified that all constructs had proper PM localization (Fig. 1C). As shown in Figure 1, D and E, GLuc was found to have extreme brightness, was even brighter than NanoLuc, and both luciferases produced long-lasting (glow-type) luminescence (Fig. 1D). We tested the effect of different substrates in multiple concentrations. In agreement with previous studies, GLuc was the brightest when native coelenterazine was used (15Kaskova Z.M. Tsarkova A.S. Yampolsky I.V. 1001 lights: Luciferins, luciferases, their mechanisms of action and applications in chemical analysis, biology and medicine.Chem. Soc.

Sci. 2013; 4: 4395Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The GLuc-emitted luminescence was already sufficiently detectable in the presence of 5 μM coelenterazine; therefore, this concentration was used in the experiments. Similar to previous reports (17Inouye S. Sato J. Sahara-Miura Y. Yoshida S. Kurakata H. Hosoya T. C6-Deoxy coelenterazine analogues as an efficient substrate for glow luminescence reaction of nanoKAZ: The mutated catalytic 19kDa component of Oplophorus luciferase.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Luciferase complementation based-detection of G-protein-coupled receptor activity.Biotechniques. 2018; 65: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we found that NanoLuc efficiently utilizes some other coelenterazine derivatives as well, such as 2-deoxycoelenterazine (coelenterazine h). Although coelenterazine h was shown to be inferior as a substrate of NanoLuc compared with furimazine, it still induced sufficient brightness to perform BRET measurements in our setup. We compared the emission spectra of GLuc and NanoLuc, and the emission of the former was right-shifted by approximately 20 nm (Fig. 1F), which may be beneficial for the excitation of red-emitting acceptors. To test the performance of GLuc in BRET assays, we measured receptor‒ligand BRET in a similar manner as it was described in a previous study with NanoLuc (Fig. 2A) (12Stoddart L.A. Johnstone E.K.M. Wheal A.J. Goulding J. Robers M.B. Machleidt T. Wood K.V. Hill S.J. Pfleger K.D.G. Application of BRET to monitor ligand binding to GPCRs.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We expressed GLuc- or NanoLuc-tagged AT1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R) in HEK 293T cells as BRET donors and treated them with red fluorophore–conjugated angiotensin II (TAMRA‒AngII) as BRET acceptor for 2 h at room temperature to reach equilibrium binding (Fig. 2, B and C). In both cases, the binding of TAMRA‒AngII to the tagged receptors resulted in an increase of the BRET signal, as the molecular proximity between the donor and the acceptor caused resonance energy transfer. The increase of the BRET ratio was higher with GLuc‒AT1R, for which a possible explanation could be the greater overlap between the excitation spectrum of TAMRA and the emission spectrum of GLuc than that of NanoLuc. The specificity of the signal was verified by competitive ligand binding measurements. The competitive AT1R antagonist candesartan prevented a great portion of the BRET signal, proving that this part of the signal originated from specific interaction between TAMRA‒AngII and AT1R. The remaining nonspecific signal reflects random collisions between the donor and acceptor molecules (bystander BRET), whose amplitude is linearly proportional to the acceptor concentration. Accordingly, increasing concentrations of TAMRA‒AngII elevated the nonspecific signal linearly, whereas the specific binding was saturable (Fig. 2D). To avoid possible receptor internalization–related changes in the signal, we always overexpressed an internalization inhibitor protein, the dominant negative form of dynamin2A (DN-Dyn). We confirmed that its application does not disturb the ligand binding properties of the receptor (Fig. S1, A and B). We also tested GLuc in receptor‒ligand BRET measurements for another GPCR, the α1A adrenergic receptor (α1AAR) (Fig. 2, E and F). The green-emitting fluorescent BODIPY FL‒prazosin was applied as the labeled ligand, the α1AAR antagonist prazosin and carvedilol or the α1AAR agonist A61603 were used as unlabeled ligands. Again, the ligand binding of the tagged receptor could be detected with GLuc. The tracer ligand was displaced by all α1AAR ligands, representing that binding of any orthosteric ligand can be measured. It must be emphasized that the phenomenon of bystander BRET not only denotes a background signal but can also be beneficially exploited. Bystander BRET measurements are widely used to detect enrichment of a protein in a particular compartment, where a compartment-targeted molecule and the protein of interest are labeled with BRET partners. The labeling can even be indirect by tagging an interaction partner of the protein, which has the advantage that no molecular modification of the protein under investigation is required. Using bystander BRET, cellular redistribution of proteins, such as receptor internalization and β-arrestin recruitment, or lipid levels in the PM were previously successfully monitored (19Lan T.-H.

Acta. 2016; 1861: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the acceptor accumulation in the donor’s proximity results in the elevation of the BRET signal. We applied a strategy based on similar principles to assess ligand binding of unmodified receptors. Instead of measuring BRET between luciferase-tagged receptors and their fluorescent ligands (“receptor‒ligand BRET”), we detected bystander BRET between luciferase-labeled PM and fluorescent ligands bound to their receptors (“PM‒ligand BRET”) (Fig. 2G). We coexpressed untagged AT1R with GLuc‒PM or NanoLuc‒PM constructs that label the extracellular side of the PM (Fig. 2, H and I). Treatment of cells with TAMRA‒AngII induced an increase of the BRET signal between the PM-targeted donor and TAMRA‒AngII. This signal originated from two types of bystander BRET. A significant portion of the signal could be prevented by the AT1R antagonist candesartan, showing that this signal reflects the specific interaction between TAMRA‒AngII and untagged AT1R, which caused the enrichment of TAMRA‒AngII at the PM. Accordingly, this signal was absent when no receptor was expressed (Fig. 2, J and K). The candesartan-insensitive part of the signal was caused by the other (nonspecific) type of bystander BRET (Fig. 2L), which is due to random collisions between PM–tagged luciferases and unbound acceptor-conjugated ligands. This candesartan-insensitive signal is similar and equally high as in receptor‒ligand BRET measurement (see Fig. 2, D and L). PM‒ligand BRET, in comparison with receptor‒ligand BRET, showed lower amplitude of the specific signal (ΔBRET values of the different setups are shown in Fig. 2, B, C, J, and K). This was in agreement with the fact that resonance energy transfer is greatly sensitive to the distance between donor and acceptor molecules, which is larger when the PM is labeled and not the target receptor. Remarkably, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of candesartan for the high-affinity binding site (IC50_Hi) was significantly lower in the case of the receptor‒ligand BRET than that of the PM‒ligand BRET (Fig. S1, C and D). Accordingly, the dissociation constant of TAMRA‒AngII for the high-affinity binding site (KD_Hi) of the untagged receptor was smaller than the KD_Hi for the GLuc-labeled receptor (Fig. 2, D and L), demonstrating that receptor tagging altered the ligand binding properties of the receptor. These results are in good agreement with previous studies showing altered ligand binding properties of AT1R upon N-terminal modification (24Zhang H. Unal H. Desnoyer R. Han G.W. Patel N. Katritch V.

Since we achieved larger BRET signal changes with GLuc than with NanoLuc in our system (compare Fig. 2, H with I and Fig. 2, J with K), only GLuc BRET measurements were performed in the further experiments. In principle, a ligand binding assay should be able to detect the binding of any orthosteric ligands regardless of their functional effects. In accordance, we were able to determine the binding of both the high-affinity full agonist angiotensin II (AngII) and the low-affinity β-arrestin‒biased agonist [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]-angiotensin II (SII) (26Szakadáti G. Tóth A.D. Oláh I. Erdélyi L.S. Balla T. Várnai P. Hunyady L. Balla A. Investigation of the fate of type I angiotensin receptor after biased activation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2015; 87: 972-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with our assay (Fig. 2M). We also measured the ligand binding of α1AAR with the PM‒ligand BRET setup (Fig. 2, N and O). With this approach, we were able to measure the competition binding of all three unlabeled ligands, and no significant shift of competition binding curves was observed compared with GLuc‒α1AAR, suggesting that the effect of N-terminal receptor tagging on receptor conformation may vary between GPCRs. We tested if the amplitude of the specific signal correlates with the amount of the receptor DNA transfected (Fig. S2). We found a positive correlation for both AT1R and α1AAR, suggesting that a high level of receptor expression is advantageous for good signal-to-noise separation. Theoretically, our PM‒ligand BRET system could be utilized for ligand binding detection of any cell surface receptors, if an appropriate fluorescent ligand is available. The approach is quick and easy, as it requires only the coexpression of the GLuc‒PM extracellular surface biosensor and the unmodified receptor, and no further protein fusion procedure is needed. First, we adjusted our system to other GPCRs. We could detect the binding of BODIPY FL‒propranolol to the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). Of interest, we found a consistent increase of the BRET ratio at low concentrations of the β2AR inverse agonist ICI118,552 instead of the expected drop in the signal (Fig. S3). We speculated that the 2-h incubation with the drug at room temperature may induce cell responses, for example, receptor externalization, which could influence the ligand binding results; therefore, we performed incubations on ice. Accordingly, we got regular competition binding curves (Fig. 3A). We could also successfully examine the ligand binding of the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) or the AT2 angiotensin receptor (AT2R) (Fig. 3, B and C). A study of the latter with our assay could be especially useful in drug screening applications, because AT2R cannot be investigated with receptor signaling assays, as it does not signal in heterologous expression systems (27Zhang H. Han G.W. Batyuk A. Ishchenko A. White K.L. Patel N. Sadybekov A. Zamlynny B. Rudd M.T. Hollenstein K. Tolstikova A. White T.A. Hunter M.S. Weierstall U. Liu W. et al.Structural basis for selectivity and diversity in angiotensin II receptors.Nature. 2017; 544: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is interesting that AT2R had a TAMRA‒AngII affinity approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of AT1R (Fig. S4), which explains the observed relatively higher IC50 of AngII to AT2R. We also performed experiments with non-GPCR cell surface receptors. We examined the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a prototypical tyrosine kinase receptor (Fig. 3D), and the transferrin receptor (TfR), as an example of cell surface nutrient receptors (Fig. 3E). In both cases, we could detect the specific binding of the Alexa488-conjugated ligands to their receptors, which was prevented by unlabeled ligands. These results show that PM‒ligand BRET using GLuc is a versatile tool for ligand binding measurement of cell surface receptors. A major advantage of resonance energy transfer–based ligand binding assays is the ability to detect ligand binding in real time and high temporal resolution, allowing simple determination of kinetic ligand parameters. We performed kinetic experiments on α1AAR in live cells with both GLuc BRET setups (receptor‒and PM‒ligand BRET). We measured the dissociation rate constant (koff) of the fluorescent ligand after its washout: the medium was replaced and supplemented with unlabeled ligand to prevent rebinding (Fig. 4A). We could follow the ligand dissociation in both setups. Next, we monitored the association of the fluorescent ligand to the receptor with real-time measurements (Fig. 4B) and determined the association rate constant (kon). Kinetic ligand parameters of unlabeled ligands can be assessed with the help of the Motulsky–Mahan equation (28Motulsky H.J. Mahan L.C. The kinetics of competitive radioligand binding predicted by the law of mass action.Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The koff and kon values of the unlabeled ligand can be calculated by measuring the ligand binding after simultaneous treatment of the labeled ligand and the unlabeled ligand in different concentrations. With the GLuc BRET system we could successfully determine these parameters of prazosin for α1AAR (Fig. 4B). We also performed similar studies with AT1R. TAMRA‒AngII binds AT1R with two different affinities; however, the proportion of high- and low-affinity states shows a temporal change upon agonist binding because of the ternary complex formation with effectors. For the sake of simplicity, we fitted one site binding curves on the measured points. The koff values of TAMRA‒AngII differed between receptor‒ligand BRET and PM‒ligand BRET setups (Fig. 4C), in agreement with the observation that the N-terminal tagging of AT1R alters its binding properties. Thereafter, we assessed the kon values of TAMRA‒AngII (Fig. 4D) and calculated kon and koff for the unlabeled ligand candesartan in kinetic competitive ligand binding measurements (Fig. 4E). We tested whether our system could be applied for receptor ligand screening. As a model receptor, we chose the α1AAR, a major pharmacological target in the treatment of high or low blood pressure and benign prostate hyperplasia (29Alexander S.P.H. Christopoulos A. Davenport A.P. Kelly E. Mathie A. Peters J.A. Veale E.L. Armstrong J.F. Faccenda E. Harding S.D. Pawson A.J. Sharman J.L. Southan C. Davies J.A. CGTP CollaboratorsThe concise guide to pharmacology 2019/20: G protein-coupled receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2019; 176 Suppl: S21-S141Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we compared the signal variance in equilibrium and kinetic binding measurements. From this viewpoint, the latter seemed to be more advantageous because of the possibility to apply baseline correction. To statistically characterize the suitability of our system for high-throughput screenings, we calculated the Z’-factor statistical parameter both for receptor‒ligand and PM‒ligand BRET (Fig. 5A) (30Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4981) Google Scholar). It was 0.919 and 0.774, respectively, proving that our system could also be applied in high-throughput screenings. Thereafter, we made a test screening with a compound library of 180 compounds (Fig. 5B and Table S1). As positive controls, four known α1AAR ligands were also tested. We defined those compounds as hits that induced at least 25% decrease of the signal (induced 25% displacement of the tracer ligand). Four compounds were found as hits (Fig. S5), which were previously not known to bind to α1AAR. The hits were further characterized. Their KD values were assessed using both ligand binding setups (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6A). Their functional effects on α1AAR, a receptor known to trigger phospholipase C–mediated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis and concomitant calcium signaling, were also investigated. All four hits were able to prevent the cytosolic calcium release induced by the α1AAR agonist A61603 (Fig. 5D). Similarly, the hits abolished the A61603-induced serum response element (SRE)-luciferase activation, a reporter of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling and serum response factor activity (Fig. 5E). Consistently with these results, they shifted the A61603 concentration‒response"
https://openalex.org/W3128298609,"Background Osteoporosis is an asymptomatic disease of high prevalence and incidence, leading to bone fractures burdened by high mortality and disability, mainly when several subsequent fractures occur. A fragility fracture predictive model, Artificial Intelligence-based, to identify dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) variables able to characterise those patients who are prone to further fractures called Bone Strain Index, was evaluated in this study. Methods In a prospective, longitudinal, multicentric study 172 female outpatients with at least one vertebral fracture at the first observation were enrolled. They performed a spine X-ray to calculate spine deformity index (SDI) and a lumbar and femoral DXA scan to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strain index (BSI) at baseline and after a follow-up period of 3 years in average. At the end of the follow-up, 93 women developed a further vertebral fracture. The further vertebral fracture was considered as one unit increase of SDI. We assessed the predictive capacity of supervised Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to distinguish women who developed a further fracture from those without it, and to detect those variables providing the maximal amount of relevant information to discriminate the two groups. ANNs choose appropriate input data automatically (TWIST-system, Training With Input Selection and Testing). Moreover, we built a semantic connectivity map usingthe Auto Contractive Map to provide further insights about the convoluted connections between the osteoporotic variables under consideration and the two scenarios (further fracture vs no further fracture). Results TWIST system selected 5 out of 13 available variables: age, menopause age, BMI, FTot BMC, FTot BSI. With training testing procedure, ANNs reached predictive accuracy of 79.36%, with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 83.72%. The semantic connectivity map highlighted the role of BSI in predicting the risk of a further fracture. Conclusions Artificial Intelligence is a useful method to analyse a complex system like that regarding osteoporosis, able to identify patients prone to a further fragility fracture. BSI appears to be a useful DXA index in identifying those patients who are at risk of further vertebral fractures."
https://openalex.org/W3127720870,"Homotypic or heterotypic internalization of another, either living or necrotic cell is currently in the center of research interest. The active invasion of a living cell called entosis and cannibalism of cells by rapidly proliferating cancers are prominent examples. Additionally, normal healthy tissue cells are capable of non-professional phagocytosis. This project studied the relationship between non-professional phagocytosis, individual proliferation and cell cycle progression. Three mesenchymal and two epithelial normal tissue cell lines were studied for homotypic non-professional phagocytosis. Homotypic dead cells were co-incubated with adherent growing living cell layers. Living cells were synchronized by mitotic shake-off as well as Aphidicolin-treatment and phagocytotic activity was analyzed by immunostaining. Cell cycle phases were evaluated by flow cytometry. Mesenchymal and epithelial normal tissue cells were capable of internalizing dead cells. Epithelial cells had much higher non-professional phagocytotic rates than mesenchymal cells. Cells throughout the entire cell cycle were able to phagocytose. The phagocytotic rate significantly increased with progressing cell cycle phases. Mitotic cells regularly phagocytosed dead cells, this was verified by Nocodazole and Colcemid treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate the ability of human tissue cells to phagocytose necrotic neighboring cells in confluent cell layers. The origin of the cell line influences the rate of cell-in-cell structure formation. The higher cell-in-cell structure rates during cell cycle progression might be influenced by cytoskeletal reorganization during this period or indicate an evolutionary anchorage of the process. Recycling of nutrients during cell growth might also be an explanation."

Effective and rapid data sharing and management practices are crucial to realize this potential; however, they are harder to implement than post-publication access. Here, we introduce the concept of a “data sharing trust” to maximize the value of large datasets. Complex datasets provide opportunities for discoveries beyond their initial scope. Effective and rapid data sharing and management practices are crucial to realize this potential; however, they are harder to implement than post-publication access. Here, we introduce the concept of a “data sharing trust” to maximize the value of large datasets. With the advent of new technologies and an appreciation for systems-level analyses, there are a growing number of research endeavors that generate large, multi-modal datasets. These projects often involve many investigators who bring complementary expertise in biological sub-specialties, both in generating and analyzing specific data types, and in contributing their clinical perspective and understanding. Such projects present an incredible opportunity for scientific advancement, but to be successful, they require rapid iteration, elaboration, and sharing in near real-time, often beyond the planned duration and scope of the initial project. A key development that the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought to the forefront is the importance of near real-time data sharing—bringing many eyes and many insights to important questions. Furthermore, the NIH recently released a “Data Sharing and Management Policy” requiring a stated data sharing and management plan for all federally funded projects; this both underscores the importance of this practice and prompts the research community to devise practical solutions to this challenge. Here, we present a perspective on possible approaches that move beyond the traditional “access-restriction” models, which are often limited to data sharing with an emphasis on secondary analysis, typically after a first publication has already been generated. These models are inflexible, and they tend to overvalue the work involved in the production of raw data and undervalue analytical work and interpretation. Instead, we will present a “data sharing trust” model that seeks to honor the personal incentives that drive the passion of scientists while enabling the community to access well-annotated data as early as, and ideally in concert with, its production. We will highlight our application of these ideas in our COVID-19 research effort, a collaboration and data sharing trust across over 150 researchers. These are ideas that need further development but might represent the right seed to make data sharing a valuable enterprise for both investigators and institutions, even beyond our current state of pandemic-driven, community-minded projects. Big and fast projects emphasize a need for data sharing that is concurrent with its production, quality-control, and primary insight generation. However, there are currently several barriers to fluid and timely data sharing among researchers. Beyond logistical constraints, including a lack of infrastructure for efficient data capture and sharing and the significant time and effort required for researchers to curate the datasets, there are three significant stakeholders to consider when crafting agreements for collaboration and data sharing:(1)Investigators. Publications are necessary for career advancement, and investigators seek to make contributions that solidify their status in their field; data sharing could jeopardize one’s chances for publication or to be credited with an important discovery.(2)Research Institutions. Institutions own and monetize the intellectual property (IP) developed by their investigators. Data sharing can lead to other parties developing IP based on data produced by their investigators, therefore weakening the IP position of the institution.(3)Human Subjects. For research involving human subjects, data sharing is strictly regulated to protect patient privacy. Failure to properly address these concerns undermines public trust, jeopardizes participation in future research, and could result in serious and costly legal consequences. The latter two barriers are often derived from the investigator’s home institution and will not be extensively covered here. Briefly to the third, investigators must take special care in drafting informed consent forms that enable, as much as possible, usage of the data for future research purposes—including a request for consent to distribute de-identified data to additional investigators, potential industry partners, and/or public repositories—with secure systems in place to shield protected health information and to respect patient privacy and autonomy. Institutional Review Boards should be engaged early in the design of research programs to ensure that protocols can be developed to maximize data sharing while at the same time protecting patient interests. The main focus of our perspective is the first barrier: the realities of a career in academic science that expects publications—most importantly, first and corresponding authorships—of novel findings in high-impact journals. This reality is complemented by the very real focus of scientists on having a reasonable window of time to discover in the data what it is they sought out to study in the first place. It is therefore an oversimplification to expect or mandate immediate broad release of an investigator’s data without addressing these realities in some way. In addition to data generation, the primary investigators invest substantial time and resources into conceiving and organizing a study. Their main motivation, producing scientific discoveries and breakthroughs, requires time for them to analyze and expand upon the data to publish derived insights. For investigators to want to share their data, there must be trust that others, using the fruits of their labor, will adequately include them in both the discovery process and in the assignment of credit for their works. Incentives might be formulated to convince scientists to share against their perceived interests (Bierer et al., 2017Bierer B.E. Crosas M. Pierce H.H. Data Authorship as an Incentive to Data Sharing.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 1684-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; Olfson et al., 2017Olfson M. Wall M.M. Blanco C. Incentivizing Data Sharing and Collaboration in Medical Research-The S-Index.JAMA Psychiatry. 2017; 74: 5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but these do not always provide an environment that minimizes the risk of being “scooped from within” using your own data. Two contrasting models dominate current data sharing practices in the biological sciences: (1) data sharing and distribution at the time of publication, and (2) real-time or near-real-time data release to the public (Birney et al., 2009Birney E. Hudson T.J. Green E.D. Gunter C. Eddy S. Rogers J. Harris J.R. Ehrlich S.D. Apweiler R. et al.Toronto International Data Release WorkshopPrepublication data sharing.Nature. 2009; 461: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Both of these models should be seen as important progress in norms and practices toward data sharing and collaborative science. Beyond the NIH mandate, other funding agencies and journals are requiring a commitment to data sharing (Sim et al., 2020Sim I. Stebbins M. Bierer B.E. Butte A.J. Drazen J. Dzau V. Hernandez A.F. Krumholz H.M. Lo B. Munos B. et al.Time for NIH to lead on data sharing.Science. 2020; 367: 1308-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and a wealth of data thus exists in the public domain for broad investigation and use. However, these models present their own limitations that hinder investigators. In the first, tying data sharing requirements to publication incurs a large time-delay between data generation and sharing, ranging from months to years. During that time, other investigators could have been deriving additional insight from the data. Furthermore, this likely would have been the ideal time for fruitful collaboration because this is the time window when the primary investigator is most intently focused on this particular dataset. Pre-print servers like BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChemRxiv might accelerate this timeline, but rarely include full data release. In addition, requirements and systems for data sharing are often very burdensome for the researcher, resulting in labs keeping “two sets of books:” an internal version of the data that they rely on for analysis and an external version with minimal curation that they are required to release after-the-fact. This second set might not include the raw data and might be less granular and less thoroughly annotated than their “in-house” version. This poses a large problem for new researchers who would like to work with this data and, though surmountable, results in more work and lower data integrity. A system that curates the data into a well-annotated “data library” at the time of collection is therefore optimal. Largely in response to these shortcomings, others advocate for the opposite approach: near-real-time data release. Although this approach solves the time-delay problem, it is problematic for both investigators and institutions, as discussed in the previous section. Ultimately, a more nuanced model is necessary to ensure timely dissemination of data and encourage collaboration while at the same time safeguarding the interests of all the stakeholders in the research ecosystem. We present here a perspective on possible approaches that bridge the divide between these two camps of thought and move beyond traditional access-restriction models. We begin with the concept of “shells” for data sharing (Figure 1A), starting with the data producers (or data “stewards”), who generate and share the data freely across collaborators (the other stewards and their labs), followed by restricted and subsequent data access to the broader participating institutions, and finally to the public. We also present the idea of a succession from “raw” to “processed” to “insight-level” data categories, with the first two categories being shared in near real-time, whereas the last category is dependent on initial insight-generating studies and/or analyses (Figure 1B). We note that in each transition from raw to curated insight-level data, investigators continually add value by contributing to the data curation and interpretation process, distilling ideas into insights in a steady progression. There are often many levels to which data can be processed to generate insights. Similar to current embargo models, each data class would then also have a proposed data release schedule determined by the steward and project leadership. Our underlying ethos for data sharing is that it is essential to define a human trust for all investigators who see data within a sphere (“data sharing trust”). For example, all collaborating investigators can see the data generated as part of the project, but each investigator must first contact the stewards of that particular dataset and engage them as collaborators before using the data. Such engagement should include routine reporting of insights, and investigators who subsequently use data in any publication are obliged to, at minimum, offer authorship to the stewards (primary investigators) and all contributing members of that dataset. New collaborators interested in accessing data must then also agree to follow the proposal submission process and read and sign a trust agreement prior to data access. Notably, although a team can be either intra- or inter-institutional, the model requires an established and ongoing trust, which could limit the total number of collaborators. Despite this, the codification and agreement of trust allows access to be granted to many more investigators than would typically be possible if a trust agreement was not settled in advance. At each level, the nature of trust changes, and it is important for all parties to understand and agree to the costs and benefits of including more access. We propose a system of data sharing that promotes both data integrity and collaborative discovery, as summarized in Figure 1B. In our scheme, raw and processed data are deposited in a shared data trust platform, or “data library,” in near real-time and ideally directly from the instruments. By setting the expectation that the dataset is immediately worthy of curation into a shareable format, our framework guarantees that QC and data integrity are conceived as important from the start. Sharing data early on has the additional benefit of informing project researchers that the data are available for collaboration and offers the possibility for integrative analysis with the consent of the stewards. Large enough incentives need to exist to strongly motivate or encourage participating investigators to go through the effort of curating and depositing data into the system. Several examples of data platform features that can incentivize its use and create added value for individual investigators include, but are not limited to:(1)Support from a data science team that manages the platform, including standardization and quality-control of the data as part of the import process;(2)Development of data visualization and analysis tools on top of the platform, that can accelerate the discovery process once data have been imported, rather than requiring re-exporting to yet another platform where insights will be private;(3)Seamless integration with other curated datasets (e.g., from scientific literature, publicly available databases, pre-publication datasets, and additional datasets from the collaborative project in question) loaded onto the platform to readily perform cross-dataset analyses. For a data platform to deliver this amount of added value, appropriate resources for personnel and infrastructure must be devoted to its development. Accordingly, funding agencies should make sure that more opportunities exist to support such efforts, and research institutions should create additional incentives to provide further support. Building such an infrastructure is necessary to ensure that data sharing is not only technically feasible, but also that the incentives are properly aligned for all stakeholders. Unfortunately, this foundational work rarely results in prestigious publications, and it needs special consideration from research institutions in an environment where funding is almost exclusively tied to academic achievement. Beyond raw and processed data, the sharing of insight-level data would come at the time of regularly held project-wide lab meetings or equivalent—this insight-level data can include additional feature extraction or dimensionality reduction, and/or observed signatures or biology revealed in the data. This creates an atmosphere of openness and inclusion, a forum to integrate insights across investigators, and an opportunity for team members to provide feedback and additional insights of their own. If all attendees are required to agree to the data trust document (see Box 1), there is at the very least a societal norm that governs how data should be protected within the trust.Box 1An example of data access restrictions and data access trustFor a recent COVID-19 project (COMET), we established the following trust. Over ten research labs agreed to deposit their raw and processed data, including bulk- and single-cell sequencing, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), cytokine profiles, and antibody characterization, in near-real-time into the UCSF Data Library for a data trust of open access across 150 researchers who have signed the COMET Data Sharing Agreement. These data are continually curated and aligned to de-identified clinical data that is shared across the project. Progress and insight-level data findings are shared among the COMET team at bi-weekly COMET lab meetings. An excerpt of the Data Sharing Agreement reads as follows:“As members of the collaborative project, you will have access to the project on the data repository, which will host the raw and processed data generated across participating labs. However, our data sharing proposal distinguishes data access from data use. Each data set will be associated with a lab “steward,” typically the PI from the lab that generated the data. Despite all investigators on the team having access to the data, there is an expectation of trust: that to make use of a given dataset an interested investigator will contact the steward prior to accessing the data with a specific proposal for data use that the steward can agree to, and that the steward be kept informed of use and progress on the analysis and included as a collaborator. This policy is to strike a balance between promoting collaborative science and respecting the investment the steward lab has put in to generating the data.”The COMET Data Sharing Agreement includes the following clauses:•As a lab generating data for the collaborative project, we will facilitate upload of the raw and processed data to the project repository in a timely manner (ideally within 1 day to 2 weeks of generation). This includes ancillary data generated as part of samples acquisition.•Prior to accessing data on the project for which I am not the steward, I will contact the lab steward to request permission for specified data use and will continue to update them on my use of the data and findings as an involved and respectful collaborator.•I will present my data insight at the bi-weekly data meeting.•I agree that should a new investigator request to work with project data as a collaborator, I will direct them to the established process of the request survey system for approval, and that I will confirm they have received approval and signed the data sharing agreement prior to sharing data.•I will follow COMET’s publication and authorship policies. How its working: challenges and solutionsThis process has presented specific requirements, triumphs, pitfalls, and solutions—it has enabled a series of new collaborations and much broader data use during this critical moment in the project and course of the pandemic. Patient privacy and honoring consentBecause of the circumstances of their illness, certain hospitalized patients were enrolled in the study under a waiver of consent, and data could be generated but not shared widely; if patients later declined all associated data needed to be destroyed, but if patients consented all data needed to be made available to the COMET team. This led to complications for data management, inclusion, and sharing in the Data Library.Solution: we built a restriction system in our database and file server such that if a patient’s consent status was “waiver,” their records were withheld from search results unless the user had privileged access. If the patient status updated to “consenting,” these records and data switched to unrestricted. If patient status updated to “decline,” all records and files were automatically removed and queued for deletion.

Solution: we introduced additional data streams and personnel (project and data management) to confirm and facilitate up-to-date data sharing and lab meeting participation and presentation. The next steps for all three types of data will be dissemination to other collaborators, other institutions, and to the public in the form of publications and public data hosting. A key to this process is adaptability and transparency. As new investigators seek access to the trust, they also become explicitly part of the trust and are expected to deposit their own insight-level work with clear understanding of how and by whom it might be accessed. Accordingly, prior to granting access to the project repository, the collaborator must review and sign the data sharing agreement and follow the process outlined in the data trust agreement to access data (contacting stewards for data use and the associated rules). Through this process the entire project improves its access to “expertly curated” data, even beyond what might have initially been conceived. As before, all of this requires monitoring, to minimize unequal sharing and possible data misuse, which would erode trust in the system. As a use-case, we first implemented and refined this approach in a recent and collaborative COVID-19 study called “COVID-19 Multi-Phenotyping for Effective Therapies (COMET)” at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The agreement and reflections on the process are detailed in Box 1. An important component of this type of data sharing model is an ethos where all investigators make their best efforts toward crediting the hard work and dedication of team members, including those on clinical, biospecimen processing, data analysis and management, and leadership teams. We recommend that project leaders define a set of authorship expectations at the outset of a data sharing agreement that might include a recipe for consortium attribution. Publications that involve data or significant expertise from a steward lab should approach the steward in regard to authorship. This authorship model is part of a larger need for a culture shift in authorship and credit toward inclusion of all contributing members of a project and requires formally rewriting current authorship guidelines, which historically often exclusively rewarded profound intellectual contribution (The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 2020The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors2020http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.htmlGoogle Scholar) to the manuscript. This ethos is increasingly inadequate in a world where projects require collaboration between several investigators with different expertise and wherein all contributions are critical but often easily forgotten or underestimated by project leaders. This shift is already happening, helped along considerably by author contribution paragraphs that allow the nature of contributions to become explicit. Although re-writing the authorship code for the age of collaborative science is beyond the scope of this manuscript, we highlight this as a developing issue because authorship is in many cases the primary reward that can be offered to encourage collaboration, and it is an integral part of the advancement system in many institutions worldwide. In summary, the large datasets we now produce have enormous value, but that value is only fully achieved if data can be mined in many different ways by multiple groups. As technology advances, and more data are generated, a majority of existing data, both public and private, are under-analyzed, and therefore, under-utilized. This is particularly wasteful when considering that the amount of data in the public domain dwarfs what can be generated by a single investigator or institution. Incorporating it all—raw and insight level–with other data, years earlier than current sharing requirements enable, will provide enormous value, both to investigators and to science and society as a whole. There are doubtlessly going to be additional refinements to a data sharing trust model. Critically, this model is most easily pioneered among a large number of researchers predominantly from the same institution—therefore there might need to be additional safeguards put in place for pre-publication sharing with researchers across multiple institutions. If there is an expectation of trust, having a new researcher (1) sign the data sharing agreement and (2) be given temporary access to the data sharing with user actions limited and recorded, could provide sufficient protections. Another option for third parties is to limit access to subsets of the data specified by the corresponding steward, without having access to the entire multi-investigator project. Although further developments of this framework will be needed, it would seem timely, particularly on the heels of this century’s fifth and largest global health threat, to start refining these models now."
https://openalex.org/W3126544738,"Many jurisdictions use a functional model of capacity with similar legal criteria, but there is a lack of agreed understanding as to how to apply these criteria in practice. We aimed to develop a typology of capacity rationales to describe court practice in making capacity determinations and to guide professionals approaching capacity assessments.We analysed all published cases from courts in England and Wales [Court of Protection (CoP) judgments, or Court of Appeal cases from the CoP] containing rationales for incapacity or intact capacity(n = 131). Qualitative content analysis was used to develop a typology of capacity rationales or abilities. Relationships between the typology and legal criteria for capacity [Mental Capacity Act (MCA)] and diagnoses were analysed.The typology had nine categories (reliability: kappa = 0.63): 1) to grasp information or concepts, 2) to imagine/ abstract, 3) to remember, 4) to appreciate, 5) to value/ care, 6) to think through the decision non-impulsively, 7) to reason, 8) to give coherent reasons, and 9) to express a stable preference. Rationales most frequently linked to MCA criterion 'understand' were ability to grasp information or concepts (43%) or to appreciate (42%), and to MCA criterion 'use or weigh' were abilities to appreciate (45%) or to reason (32%). Appreciation was the most frequently cited rationale across all diagnoses. Judges often used rationales without linking them specifically to any MCA criteria (42%).A new typology of rationales could bridge the gap between legal criteria for decision-making capacity and phenomena encountered in practice, increase reliability and transparency of assessments, and provide targets for decision-making support."
https://openalex.org/W3126973587,"We focus on learning during development in a group of individuals that play a competitive game with each other. The game has two actions and there is negative frequency dependence. We define the distribution of actions by group members to be an equilibrium configuration if no individual can improve its payoff by unilaterally changing its action. We show that at this equilibrium, one action is preferred in the sense that those taking the preferred action have a higher payoff than those taking the other, more prosocial, action. We explore the consequences of a simple ‘unbiased’ reinforcement learning rule during development, showing that groups reach an approximate equilibrium distribution, so that some achieve a higher payoff than others. Because there is learning, an individual’s behaviour can influence the future behaviour of others. We show that, as a consequence, there is the potential for an individual to exploit others by influencing them to be the ones to take the non-preferred action. Using an evolutionary simulation, we show that population members can avoid being exploited by over-valuing rewards obtained from the preferred option during learning, an example of a bias that is ‘rational’."
https://openalex.org/W3126522491,"Chloride is a key component of salt, used in many activities such as alkali production, water treatment, and de-icing. Chloride entering surface and groundwater is a concern due to its toxicity to aquatic life and potential to degrade drinking water sources. Minnesota being a hard-water state, has a high demand for water softening. Recent research has found that home-based water softeners contribute significantly to chloride loading at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Because of this, many WWTPs would now require water quality based effluent limits (WQBELs) to comply with the state’s chloride water quality standards (WQS), unless they install chloride treatment technologies, which are limited and cost-prohibitive to most communities. A potential solution to this problem, is shifting from home-based water softening to a system where water is softened at drinking water plants, before reaching homes, i.e. centralized softening, analyzed in this paper based on its ability to address both chloride pollution and water softening needs, at reasonable cost. We estimate lifetime costs of three alternative solutions: centralized softening, home-based softening, and a Business as Usual (BAU) or baseline alternative, using annualized 20-year loan payments and Net Present Value (NPV), applied to 84 Minnesota cities with matching data on drinking water plants and WWTPs. We find that centralized softening using either Reverse Osmosis (RO) or lime-softening technologies is the more cost-effective solution, compared to the alternative of home-based softening with end-of-pipe chloride treatment, with a cost ratio in the range 1:3–1:4. Between the two centralized softening options, we find RO-softening to be the lower cost option, only slightly more costly (1.1 cost ratio) than the BAU option. Considering additional environmental and public health benefits, and cost savings associated with removal of home-based softeners, our results provide helpful information to multiple stakeholders interested in an effective solution to chloride pollution."

Previous studies have shown that hepatic LRP1 deficiency exacerbates diet-induced steatohepatitis and insulin resistance via mechanisms related to increased lysosome and mitochondria permeability and dysfunction. The current study examined the impact of LRP1 deficiency on mitochondrial function in the liver. Hepatocytes isolated from liver-specific LRP1 knockout (hLrp1−/−) mice showed reduced oxygen consumption compared with control mouse hepatocytes. The mitochondria in hLrp1−/− mouse livers have an abnormal morphology and their membranes contain significantly less anionic phospholipids, including lower levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin that increase mitochondrial fission and impair fusion. Additional studies showed that LRP1 complexes with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase like protein-1 (PIP5KL1) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase-1β (PIP5K1β). The absence of LRP1 reduces the levels of both PIP5KL1 and PIP5K1β in the plasma membrane and also lowers phosphatidylinositol(4,5) bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) levels in hepatocytes. These data indicate that LRP1 recruits PIP5KL1 and PIP5K1β to the plasma membrane for PI(4,5)P2 biosynthesis. The lack of LRP1 reduces lipid kinase expression, leading to lower PI(4,5)P2 levels, thereby decreasing the availability of this lipid metabolite in the cardiolipin biosynthesis pathway to cause cardiolipin reduction and the impairment in mitochondria homeostasis. Taken together, the current study identifies another signaling mechanism by which LRP1 regulates cell functions: binding and recruitment of PIP5KL1 and PIP5K1β to the membrane for PI(4,5)P2 synthesis.

Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) is a type 1 transmembrane protein that serves endocytic and signaling functions through mechanisms that are cell type and context-dependent. For example, in macrophages, LRP1 is an endocytosis receptor for the uptake of aggregated LDL and efferocytosis of dead cells (1Llorente-Cortes V. Royo T. Juan-Babot O. Badimon L.

LRP1 in macrophages also serves important signal transduction functions including the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to suppress toll-like receptor-induced inflammation (3Luo L.

Neuroinflammation. 2016; 13: 304Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). LRP1 is also abundantly expressed in the liver, where it serves primarily an endocytic function and works in conjunction with LDL receptor for plasma clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins (19Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein mediates uptake of cholesteryl esters derived from apoprotein E-enriched lipoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that LRP1 also plays a regulatory role in hepatocytes. The absence of LRP1 in hepatocytes reduces cell surface expression of ABCA1, leading to the lowering of HDL level in the plasma of hepatocyte-specific LRP1 knockout (hLrp1−/−) mice (20Basford J.E. Wancata L. Hofmann S.M. Silva R.A. Davidson W.S. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y.

Chem. 2011; 286: 13079-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The hLrp1−/− mice are also more sensitive to high fat diet–induced hepatosteatosis and insulin resistance (21Ding Y. Xian X. Holland W.L. Tsai S. Herz J. Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 protects against hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.EBioMedicine. 2016; 7: 135-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with accelerated progression to steatohepatitis when fed a high fat diet with additional cholesterol supplementation (22Hamlin A.N.

Chem. 2018; 293: 9674-9684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of hLrp1−/− mice to diet-induced steatosis and toxicity is attributed to increased lysosomal and mitochondrial permeability as a consequence of lipid overload (23Hamlin A.N. Basford J.E. Jaeschke A. Hui D.Y. LRP1 protein deficiency exacerbates palmitate-induced steatosis and toxicity in hepatocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 16610-16619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, whether LRP1 deficiency directly influences the functions of these intracellular organelles in the absence of elevated lipid deposition remains to be clarified. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of LRP1 deficiency on mitochondrial functions in hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes isolated from chow-fed C57BL/6J wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice were incubated in vitro with medium containing 25 mM glucose to mimic the acute postprandial glycemic response in vivo. Oxygen consumption rates monitored over a 2-h period showed that the basal mitochondrial respiration rate was lower in hLrp1−/− hepatocytes compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The sequential addition of oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), and then rotenone plus antimycin A during the 2-h incubation period revealed significant reduction in ATP production, proton leak, maximal and spare respiration rates, as well as lower coupling efficiency in hepatocytes with LRP1 deficiency (Fig. 1, C–G). Additionally, LRP1 inactivation was also found to lower oxygen consumption rates in response to pyruvate and malate- or succinate-driven respiration (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of the data revealed that LRP1 deficiency reduces oxygen consumption at all three stages of the citric acid cycle (Fig. 2, A and B). We interpret these data to indicate that LRP1 inactivation reduces respiration by lowering mitochondria complex I and complex II activities in hepatocytes. Western blot analysis of hepatocyte lysates prepared from wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice with an antibody cocktail against rodent oxidative phosphorylation proteins confirmed the reduced levels of mitochondria complex-I and -II with LRP1 deficiency (Fig. 3).Figure 2Hepatic LRP1 deficiency reduces (A) pyruvate/malate- and (B) succinate-mediated mitochondrial respiration.

These results suggest that LRP1 deficiency directly impacts mitochondrial functions in hepatocytes. This hypothesis was tested by comparing calcium uptake and accumulation by mitochondria isolated from the livers of wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice. In these experiments, the isolated mitochondria were suspended in buffer containing Calcium Green-5N, a membrane-impermeable fluorescent calcium indicator, prior to the addition of 75 μM CaCl2. The addition of calcium to wild-type mitochondria incubation resulted in rapid increase in Calcium Green-5N fluorescence, indicative of elevated Ca2+ levels in the medium and the slow removal of calcium from the buffer by wild-type mitochondria (24Maxwell J.T. Tsai C.-H. Mohiuddin T.A. Kwong J.Q. Analyses of mitochondrial calcium influx in isolated mitochondria and cultured cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2018; 134e57225Google Scholar). In contrast, minimal fluorescence increase was observed when calcium was added to mitochondria isolated from hLrp1−/− mice (Fig. 4B). These data indicated the rapid accumulation of Ca2+ in mitochondria isolated from hLrp1−/− mouse livers compared with that observed with wild-type mouse livers (Fig. 4B). The increased calcium uptake of mitochondria from hLrp1−/− mice was reflected by their lower membrane potential compared with mitochondria obtained from the livers of wild-type mice (Fig. 4C). Both respiratory complexes I and II are present in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and their activities may be regulated by phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane (25Horvath S.E. Daum G. Lipids of mitochondria.Prog. Lipid Res. 2013; 52: 590-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Analysis of phospholipid composition of mitochondria from wild-type and hLrp1−/− mouse livers by thin layer chromatography revealed reduced levels of anionic phospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine, cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine in the mitochondria of hLrp1−/− mice compared with wild type (Fig. 5). Since phospholipid composition in the mitochondrial membrane also influences mitochondria morphology (25Horvath S.E. Daum G. Lipids of mitochondria.Prog. Lipid Res. 2013; 52: 590-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), we examined the livers isolated from wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice by transmission electron microscopy and observed significant differences in mitochondrial morphology. The mitochondria in the livers of hLrp1−/− mice appeared to be rounder than the typical elongated-shape mitochondria observed in wild-type mouse livers (Fig. 6A). Despite these differences in shape, no difference in the number of cristae or cristae density was observed between mitochondria from wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice (Fig. 6, B and C). These results indicate that LRP1 deficiency alters mitochondrial morphology and activities independent of cristae structure, but is a result of changes in phospholipid composition, particularly the lower phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin contents in the mitochondrial membrane (26Acoba M.G.

Mol. Med. 2015; 93: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the levels of mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins in the livers of wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice. Western blot results revealed significant reduction in the levels of the mitochondrial fusion proteins mitofusin-2 (MFN2) and OPA1 in the livers of hLrp1−/− mice (Fig. 7). In contrast, levels of the dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1) that is responsible for mitochondrial fission were found to be significantly higher in hLrp1−/− livers (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the impaired mitochondrial respiration activities observed in hLrp1−/− hepatocytes may be due to increased mitochondrial fragmentation/fission and the concomitant decrease in mitochondrial fusion. Additional experiments were performed to identify the mechanism by which LRP1 deficiency alters mitochondrial lipid composition and promotes mitochondrial fragmentation. Since the depletion of phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) may increase mitochondrial fragmentation (31Rosivatz E. Woscholski R.

Direct ELISA measurement of PI(4,5)P2 levels in the livers of wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice revealed lower PI(4,5)P2 levels with LRP1 deficiency (Fig. 8A). Previous studies using proteomics and yeast two-hybrid approaches revealed the potential of LRP1 interaction with phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1) that hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2 to diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (33Gaultier A. Simon G. Niessen S. Dix M. Takimoto S. Cravatt B.F. Gonias S.L. LDL receptor-related protein 1 regulates the abundance of diverse cell signaling proteins in the plasma membrane proteome.J.

Interestingly, whereas the liver membranes from wild-type and hLrp1−/− mice displayed similar levels of PIP5K1A (Fig. 8B), with undetected levels of PLCγ1 and phospho-PLCγ1 (data not shown), significantly lower levels of PIP5K1B and the PIP5K homolog PIP5KL1 were observed in the hepatic membrane fractions of hLrp1−/− mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 8B). Additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that LRP1 interacts not only with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-like 1 (PIP5KL1) (Fig. 8C), as predicted from the yeast 2-hybrid study (34Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Herz J.

Complex between LRP1 and PIP5K1B was confirmed based on pull-down assays with either LRP1 or PIP5K1B antibodies (Fig. 8D). Taken together, we interpret these data to indicate that LRP1 binding to PIP5KL1 recruits PIP5K1B to the plasma membrane where it catalyzes PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, and the absence of LRP1 reduces PI(4,5)P2 levels to enhance mitochondria fission. This study documents the importance of LRP1 for mitochondria homeostasis in the liver. The absence of LRP1 compromises mitochondrial fusion and enhances mitochondrial fission, resulting in increased mitochondrial fragmentation and functional defects that reduce respiration capacity for ATP production. The mitochondria in the livers of hLrp1−/− mice also display an abnormal morphology and contain less anionic phospholipids, thus indicating that the functional defects may be due to structural changes caused by the absence of LRP1. In particular, mitochondria in the livers of hLrp1−/− mice are relatively poor in phosphatidylethanolamine in comparison with the mitochondria in wild-type mouse livers. This anionic phospholipid is predominantly located in mitochondrial outer membrane and is important for appropriate mitochondrial fusion. Mitochondria with phosphatidylethanolamine deficiency are defective in undergoing fusion events due to incomplete mixing of the mitochondrial membranes, thereby increasing fragmentation and mitochondrial fission events (30Frohman M.A. Role of mitochondrial lipids in guiding fission and fusion.J. Mol. Med. 2015; 93: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mitochondria in the livers of hLrp1−/− mice are also poor in cardiolipin, the anionic phospholipid that is critical for fusion of the inner membrane via its interaction and assembly of the dynamin-related GTPase OPA1 (35Ban T. Kohno H. Ishihara T. Ishihara N. Relationship between OPA1 and cardiolipin in mitochondrial inner-membrane fusion.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2018; 1859: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin is also present in the outer membrane of the mitochondria where it interacts with another dynamin-related GTPase, DRP1, to mediate mitochondria division and fission events (36Stepanyants N. Macdonald P.J. Francy C.A. Mears J.A. Qi X. Ramachandran R. Cardiolipin's propensity for phase transition and its reorganization by dynamin-related protein 1 form a basis for mitochondrial membrane fission.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26: 3104-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reduced levels of MFN2 and OPA1 along with the increased levels of DRP1 observed in hLrp1−/− hepatocytes suggest that LRP1 regulates cardiolipin distribution among inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria, and its deficiency not only reduces cardiolipin levels but also lowers its interaction with the fusion protein OPA1 while preserving its interaction with DRP1 to promote mitochondrial fragmentation and fission. Finally, in addition to the regulation of mitochondria fusion and fission, cardiolipin also plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetic processes via its interaction and assembly of the electron transport chain complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (37Paradies G. Paradies V. De Benefictis V. Ruggiero F.M. Petrosillo G. Functional role of cardiolipin in mitochondrial bioenergetics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1837: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Hence, the lower respiration capacity observed in hLrp1−/− hepatocytes may also be due to the reduced cardiolipin levels observed in the mitochondrial membrane. Cardiolipi"

Six descending thoracic aortas from pigs were used for rectangular sample tests, in which the circumferential and axial specimens had widths of 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The other six aortas were used for the dog-bone-shaped sample tests and were punched into circumferential, axial and oblique specimens with widths of 2 mm, 4 mm and 6 mm. We performed uniaxial tensile tests on the specimens and compared the test results. The results showed that mid-sample failure occurred in 85.2% of the dog-bone-shaped specimens and in 11.1% of the rectangular samples, which could be caused by Saint-Venant’s principle. Therefore, rectangular specimens were not suitable for aortic uniaxial tensile testing performed until rupture. The results also showed that the size effect of the aorta conformed to Weibull theory, and dog-bone-shaped specimens with a width of 4 mm were the optimal choice for aortic uniaxial tensile testing performed until rupture."

Flower and pod survival seem to be critical determinants of grain number, which is related to the number of fertile flowers and pods during the anthesis period. Flower and pod growth are frequently considered the key determinants to establish grain number. The objective of this study was to explore the influences of paclobutrazol on flower and pod development, grain-setting characteristics and grain yield in Chinese milk vetch under different concentrations of foliar spray and try to explore the physiological regulatory mechanisms. Field experiments were carried out during the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 growing seasons at the Dayuzhuang experimental field. The experiment involved the Chinese milk vetch cultivar “Xinzi No. 1” and six levels of foliar application of paclobutrazol, 0, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mg L -1 , in treatments CK, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively. Foliar spray was applied once, at the squaring stage. In comparison with the CK treatment, all of the paclobutrazol treatments yielded, to various degrees, increased values of the number of inflorescences per unit area, number of pods per unit area, grain-setting rate of pods, and number of grains per pod in all six inflorescence layers, with the largest increases observed in the T3 treatment. In the T3 treatment compared with the CK treatment, from the first to sixth inflorescence layers, the number of inflorescences per unit area was increased by 34.07–58.97%, the number of pods per unit area was increased by 39.69–68.35%, the grain number per pod was increased by 44.31–53.69%, and the grain-setting rate of pods was increased by 1.84–4.89%. An analysis of yield composition revealed that the paclobutrazol spray treatment had little impact on the grain weight of Chinese milk vetch. The correlations between the concentration of paclobutrazol spray and the grain yield of Chinese milk vetch reached a significant level. Grain yield was highest at the paclobutrazol concentration of 373.10 mg/L. The inflorescence contents of gibberellic acid 3 (GA 3 ), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and abscisic acid (ABA) were reduced, whereas that of cytokinin (CTK) was increased, by foliar application of paclobutrazol (400 mg L -1 , T3 treatment) relative to CK treatment during the stages of flowers and pods developing into grains."

The global prevalence of A . butzleri infection is underestimated, and little is known about their phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The aim of this study was to determine antimicrobial susceptibility (AST) profiles, detect related virulence genes, and classify sequence type (ST) of A . butzleri isolates obtained from human stool and food samples. A total of 84 A . butzleri isolates were obtained from human diarrheal (n = 25), non-diarrheal (n = 24) stool, and food (n = 35) samples in Thailand. They were evaluated for phenotypic identification by conventional microbiological procedures and AST by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method as well as virulence genes detection. Representative isolates from each origin were selected based on the presence of virulence genes and AST profiles to analyze genetic diversity by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). All isolates showed resistance to nalidixic acid 40.5% (34/84), ciprofloxacin 11.9% (10/84), azithromycin 8.3% (7/84), and erythromycin 3.6% (3/84). Regarding the ten virulence genes detected, cj1349 , mviN and pldA had the highest prevalence 100% (84/84), followed by tlyA 98.8% (83/84), cadF 97.6% (82/84), ciaB 71.4% (60/84), hecA and hecB 22.6% (19/84), iroE 15.5% (13/84) and irgA 10.7% (9/84), respectively. Three virulence genes were present among A . butzleri isolates of human diarrheal stool and food samples, with a significant difference observed among isolates; hecB [36% (9/25) and 8.6% (3/35)], hecA [36% (9/25) and 5.7% (2/35)], and irgA [24% (6/25) and 2.9% (1/35)] ( p &lt; 0.05), respectively. The hecA and hecB virulence genes functions are related to the mechanism of hemolysis, while irgA supports a bacterial nutritional requirement. MLST analysis of 26 A . butzleri isolates revealed that 16 novel STs exhibited high genetic diversity. The results of this study is useful for understanding potentially pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant A . butzleri in Thailand. The pathogenic virulence markers hecB , hecA , and irgA have the potential to be developed for rapid diagnostic detection in human diarrheal stool. No significant relationships among STs and sources of origin were observed. Little is known about A . butzleri , the mechanism of action of these virulence genes, is a topic that needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3127875619,"Na + ,K + -ATPase is a crucial protein responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane. The Na + ,K + -ATPase is comprised of catalytic α, β, and γ subunits. In adult brains, the α3 subunit, encoded by ATP1A3 , is predominantly expressed in neurons, whereas the α2 subunit, encoded by ATP1A2 , is expressed in glial cells. In foetal brains, the α2 is expressed in neurons as well. Mutations in α subunits cause a variety of neurologic disorders. Notably, the onset of symptoms in ATP1A2 - and ATP1A3 -related neurologic disorders is usually triggered by physiological or psychological stressors. To gain insight into the distinct roles of the α2 and α3 subunits in the developing foetal brain, whose developmental dysfunction may be a predisposing factor of neurologic disorders, we compared the phenotypes of mouse foetuses with double homozygous knockout of Atp1a2 and Atp1a3 (α2α3-dKO) to those with single knockout. The brain haemorrhage phenotype of α2α3-dKO was similar to that of homozygous knockout of the gene encoding ascorbic acid (ASC or vitamin C) transporter, SVCT2. The α2α3-dKO brain showed significantly decreased level of ASC compared with the wild-type (WT) and single knockout. We found that the ASC content in the basal ganglia and cerebellum was significantly lower in the adult Atp1a3 heterozygous knockout mouse (α3-HT) than in the WT. Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in the ASC level in the basal ganglia and cerebellum of α3-HT in the peripartum period, during which mice are under physiological stress. These observations indicate that the α2 and α3 subunits independently contribute to the ASC level in the foetal brain and that the α3 subunit contributes to ASC transport in the adult basal ganglia and cerebellum. We propose that decreases in ASC levels may affect neural network development and are linked to the pathophysiology of ATP1A2- and ATP1A3 -related neurologic disorders."

We investigated the influences of the extracellular environment and intracellular signaling on the TM4SF5 traffic with regard to migration directionality. Cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) but not poly-l-lysine enhanced the traffic velocity and straightness of the TM4SF5WT (but not palmitoylation-deficient mutant TM4SF5 Pal - ) toward the leading edges, depending on tubulin acetylation. Acetylated-microtubules in SLAC2B-positive cells reached mostly the juxtanuclear regions, but reached-out toward the leading edges upon SLAC2B suppression. TM4SF5 expression caused SLAC2B not to be localized at the leading edges. TM4SF5 colocalization with HDAC6 depended on paxillin expression. The trimeric complex consisting of TM4SF5, HDAC6, and SLAC2B might, thus, be enriched at the perinuclear cytosols toward the leading edges. More TM4SF5WT translocation to the leading edges was possible when acetylated-microtubules reached the frontal edges following HDAC6 inhibition by paxillin presumably at new cell-FN adhesions, leading to persistent cell migration. Collectively, this study revealed that cell-FN adhesion and microtubule acetylation could control intracellular traffic of TM4SF5 vesicles to the leading edges via coordinated actions of paxillin, SLAC2B, and HDAC6, leading to TM4SF5-dependent cell migration."

In this study a functionalpolymorphism in Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (Val158Met) and the Dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) (120 bp tandem duplication) has been studied in substance abused subjects. The study was carried out with 183 substance abused subjects and 175 healthy persons with no history of substance abuse. DNA was extracted and polymorphisms were analyzed using allele-specific PCR. The impact of these two polymorphisms was also analyzed on addictive characteristics (age of starting abuse, a pattern of drug habit, and period of addiction). It was found that only the heterozygous variant of COMT polymorphism (Val/Met) (p&lt;0.05, OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.044–2.658) and both homozygous (p&lt;0.05, OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.193–0.937) and heterozygous (p&lt;0.05, OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.172–0.826) derived variants of DRD4 120 bp tandem duplication were significantly associated with risk of substance abuse compared to controls. In case of association of these polymorphisms with an age of onset, no significant difference was found among three different genotypic groups of COMT polymorphism. Whereas, the homozygous derived variant (240 bp/240 bp) of DRD4 gene was found to have a later age of onset (20.5±0.8) for substance abuse compared to heterozygous (120 bp/240 bp) (19.1±0.8) and wild type homozygous variant (120 bp/120 bp) (16.0±0.5), which was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Again, in the case of the pattern of drug habit, the frequency of the Val/Val genotype is higher in polysubstance abused (&gt;2 drugs) subjects (p&lt;0.05) compared to the heterozygous Val/Met containing variants. An association of period of addiction was analyzed with an individual type of substance abuse and found that heroin abused subjects have a significantly higher period of addiction (11.6±1.0) compared to other abusers (p&lt;0.01). Further, it was found that Met/Met containing variants of COMT polymorphism has a more extended period of addiction than other genetic variants in heroin abused subjects.

These technologies hold a number of fundamental challenges and ethical concerns that need addressing to aid the success of this fast-growing field. In particular, the responsible development of such technologies requires caregiver input. We conducted a survey of the opinions of 410 caregivers on the viability, privacy and data access of remote in-home monitoring technologies and study designs. Infant-friendly wearable devices (such as sensing body suits) were viewed favourably. Caregivers were marginally more likely to accept video and audio recording in the home if data was anonymised (through automated processing) at point of collection, particularly when observations were lengthy. Caregivers were more open to international data sharing for anonymous data. Caregivers were interested in viewing all types of data, but were particularly keen to access video and audio recordings for censoring purposes (i.e., to delete data segments). Taken together, our results indicate generally positive attitudes to remote in-home monitoring technologies and studies for infant research but highlight specific considerations such as safety, privacy and family practicalities (e.g. multiple caregivers, visitors and varying schedules) that must be taken into account when developing future studies."

The Tyr side chain functions as the catalytic base, the Ser side chain stabilizes the substrate, and the Lys side chain interacts with the nicotinamide ribose and lowers the pKa of the Tyr-OH (11Oppermann U.

The most recent review is 12 years old, and, given the rapid expansion of the databases, there may be additional types. Hence, SDRs are rather a hazy grouping. Several sequence signature motifs, most of which are parts of the Rossmann fold, can be identified (Fig. 1) (11Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M. Shafqat J. Nordling E.

Structural studies of Escherichia coli FabG suggested it to be a typical example of an SDR protein. This enzyme of 244 amino acid residues is tetrameric and has an α/β structure with the signature Rossmann fold motif (2White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M.

FabG also contains the highly conserved Y151-Xaa3-K155 motif, near the carboxy terminus of helix α4 (Fig. 1B). In addition, FabG has a conserved serine residue (S138) located near the tyrosine and lysine residues. Price and colleagues (8Price A.C. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. White S.W.

They proposed that, in E. coli FabG, protons are shuttled via a water network positioned to serve as a proton wire to the tyrosine via K155 and the 2’-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose (8Price A.C.

However, in prior work on Ralstonia solanacearum FabG1 we substituted Ser143, Y151, and Lys156 with A, F, or A, respectively. To our surprise, these substitutions failed to block the ability of FabG1 to complement growth of an E. coli fabG temperature mutant strain at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. S1). The R. solanacearum FabG1 aligns well with E. coli FabG (64% identical residues), and the catalytic triad residues (and their spacings) of the two FabG proteins are conserved (Fig. S1). We turned to E. coli FabG because it is considered a classical SDR protein and is the subject of several crystal structure studies and genetic analyses. The R. solanacearum results suggested that the postulated E. coli FabG catalytic triad may not be active site residues. We report that substitution of the putative E. coli FabG residues S138, Y151, and K155 with A, F, or A resulted in proteins that retained FabG activity both in vivo and in vitro. To test whether the S138-Y151-K155 motif of E. coli FabG is the catalytic triad of the enzyme, panels of E. coli fabG mutants were constructed on plasmids of high copy and low copy numbers. The plasmids were tested for complementation using two temperature-sensitive mutant strains that lack 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase activity at 42 °C. We first used E. coli strain CL104 and subsequently switched to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 strain CL95 (7Lai C. Cronan J.E. Isolation and characterization of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (fabG) mutants of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1869-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). (The use of conditionally mutant strains is required since FabG is an essential enzyme in E. coli.) We first substituted FabG S138 with A or T, Y151 with F or H, and K155 with T or A and inserted these mutant fabG genes into the high-copy-number vector pBAD24M to produce six plasmids (pTWH22, 23, 24, 25, 29, and 30). Transcription of the genes proceeded from the arabinose-regulated araBAD promoter in these plasmids. The vector also supplied the ribosome-binding site necessary for translational initiation. Following transformation into strain CL104, all of the resulting transformants were found to grow at 42 °C in the presence or absence of arabinose (Fig. S2, A–C) as previously seen with the R. solanacearum FabG1 (Fig. S1). In addition, all transformants grew better in the absence than in the presence of arabinose suggesting that FabG overexpression is somewhat toxic (Fig. S2, A–C). These data argued strongly that these mutant fabG genes encode functional 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductases and that the S138-Y151-K155 motif is not the E. coli FabG catalytic center. To strengthen this argument, we constructed six additional FabG mutant plasmids: Y151S, Y151I, Y151R, K155R, K155I, and K155E. These mutant proteins all remained active in vivo (Fig. S2, D and E). To exclude the possibility that combinations of two or three of these residues were essential for FabG activity, additional mutant plasmids were constructed including three double mutants (S138A/Y151F, S138A/K155A, Y151F/K155A) and the triple mutant (S138A/Y151F/K155A). Upon transformation of the resulting plasmids, pTWH38 (S138A/Y151F double mutant), pZH197 (S138A/K155A double mutant), pZH198(Y151F/K155A double mutant), and pZH199 (S138A/Y151F/K155A triple mutant), into the E. coli strain CL104, all conferred the ability of the mutant strain to grow in the presence or absence of arabinose at 42 °C (Fig. S2F). To investigate the possibility that complementation of E. coli strain CL104 resulted from elevated expression of the FabG mutant proteins, three single mutant fabG genes, three doubly mutant genes, and one triple mutant gene were inserted into the low-copy Lac promoter expression vector pHSG575 (1–5 copies/cell) to produce plasmids: pZH201 to 209. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli strain CL104, and the resulting CL104 derivatives were found to grow at 42 °C as well as the CL104 derivative encoding the wildtype fabG plasmid (Fig. S3). We next tested the possibility that growth was due to homologous recombination between the plasmid-borne mutant genes and the chromosomal gene. In this scenario the two mutant alleles, the temperature-sensitive or wildtype alleles encoded on the genome and the residue substitution allele encoded by the plasmids, would recombine to give a wildtype gene on the expression plasmid. This seemed implausible based on the R. solanacearum results since fabG1 and E. coli fabG have very different sequences. However, it remained possible when both genes are E. coli alleles. To eliminate this possibility we used the CL65 fabG(Ts) mutant of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 [7]. S. enterica LT2 is a close relative of E. coli and S. enterica proteins are generally almost identical to those of E. coli, whereas the coding sequences show less identity. In the case of FabG the E. coli and S. enterica LT2 proteins are 95% identical, whereas the fabG genes are only 88% identical. This is mainly due to third position differences (“wobble”) in the synonymous codons used by the two bacteria. Homologous recombination requires strict homology between the two strands, and recombination is severely decreased when the two strands are mismatched. This is due to two mechanisms: inefficient assembly of heteroduplexes by RecA and mismatch repair-catalyzed destruction of any heteroduplexes formed by strand exchange. Together, these processes block recombination between E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 genes (18Radman M. Wagner R. Mismatch repair in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 523-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. The barrier to recombination between Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is disrupted in mismatch-repair mutants.Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). This lack of recombination is equivalent to that given by loss of RecA function in homologous crosses but avoids the poor growth and low viability of recA strains. We found the plasmids encoding E. coli mutant proteins restored growth to the S. enterica fabG(Ts) strain indicating that the complementation results were not due to homologous recombination (Fig. 2). We next compared the fatty acid synthesis profiles of strain CL104 containing wildtype FabG with those of the CL104 derivatives encoding the FabG mutant proteins grown at 42 °C. Cultures were labeled by [14C]acetate incorporation and the fatty acid methyl esters separated by argentation thin-layer chromatography. Our data showed that, excepting strain CL104 carrying the empty vector pHSG575, all CL104 derivatives containing either the wildtype FabG or mutant FabG proteins synthesized fatty acids normally (Fig. 3). Taken together, our data indicated that the S-Y-K triad is not the catalytic center of E. coli FabG. A concern in characterization of the FabG mutant proteins was that the purified tetramers could contain low levels of chromosomally encoded wildtype or temperature-sensitive mutant subunits, which might somehow bestow activity on the plasmid-encoded mutant subunits. We eliminated this possibility using two complementary approaches. We first expressed the amino terminal hexahistidine-tagged wildtype and mutant FabG proteins in the phage T7 RNA polymerase pET-28b vector system in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). To avoid the possibility of contamination with wildtype FabG, the mutant (and wildtype) FabG proteins were purified under denaturing conditions as described in Experimental procedures and refolded on the purification column. FabG refolded with high efficiency (probably owing to spacing of the proteins on the columns preventing aggregation); the refolded wildtype protein had full activity. In later work we used the pQE2 vector, which allowed high-level expression in the S. enterica fabG(Ts) strain CL65 (7Lai C. Cronan J.E. Isolation and characterization of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (fabG) mutants of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1869-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and purified the proteins by denaturation–renaturation as given above. Use of this expression system had the advantage of precluding homologous recombination, and since each protein contains a lysine residue absent in the other protein (K72 of E. coli FabG, K43 of S. enterica FabG) this provided an assay to detect the presence of any S. enterica protein in our purified mutant protein preparations. This was done by trypsin digestion of the proteins followed by HPLC peptide separation and tandem mass spectral analyses of the recovered peptides. Analyses using the exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index, which denotes the ratio of observed to observable peptides, showed that the Y151F preparation contains less than 0.5% of the S. enterica FabG, whereas the S138A and K155A preparations contain only about 0.14% and 0.19% S. enterica FabG, respectively. The triple mutant E. coli FabG contained only 0.6% of the S. enterica FabG. In each case at least 93% of the possible peptides were observed experimentally. Finally, fragmentation by tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) was used to sequence tryptic peptides that span the three putative active site residues of the triple mutant protein. Figure 4A shows MS/MS sequencing of a peptide that contained all three assigned active site residues. Fragments that thoroughly documented the Y151F and K115A substitutions were present in this spectrum, whereas cleavages to document the S138A substitution were sparse. However, a longer peptide (owing to lack of trypsin cleavage at R132 and K163) gave fragments that documented the S138A substitution (Fig. 4B). These data were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the relevant portion of the triple mutant fabG gene (Fig. S4). These data demonstrated that all three expected residue substitutions had been made. Tandem MS sequencing of each of the singly mutant proteins also showed the expected residue substitutions (Fig. S5). Therefore, the putative active site residues had all been eliminated. These protein preparations were utilized in Figure 5 and for the kinetic analyses.Figure 5Function of mutant FabG proteins in fatty acid synthesis. A, the initial cycle of fatty acid synthesis was reconstructed in vitro using a combination of FabH, FabG (or a FabG single mutation protein), FabA, FabI, ACP, NADH, and NADPH as cofactors and malonyl-ACP plus acetyl-CoA as substrate to produce butyryl-ACP.

Excepting lane 1 these proteins were purified from S. enterica strain CL65. The wildtype protein in lane 1 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). All proteins were purified by Ni chelate chromatography under denaturing conditions and refolded. Note that the upper bands marked holo-ACP probably also contain malonyl-ACP and acetyl-ACP (from decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP), which comigrate under these conditions. ACP, acyl carrier protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the in vitro 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase activities of the FabG proteins wildtype fabG, three fabG single mutants (S138A, Y151F and K155A), three double fabG mutants (S138A/Y151F, S138A/K155A, and Y151F/K155A), and one triple fabG mutant (S138A/Y151F/ K155A) were inserted into vector pET28. The amino terminal hexahistidine-tagged wildtype and mutant FabG proteins were then expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by nickel chelation chromatography under denaturation conditions and refolded. SDS-gel electrophoresis showed that all of the N-terminal His-tagged proteins were highly purified and had the expected molecular weights (Fig. S6A). The enzymatic activity of the wildtype FabG and mutant FabG proteins was first tested in the initiation step of fatty acid synthesis. The reactions were constituted by sequentially adding initiation enzymes FabD, FabH, FabG or a mutant FabG (FabG S138A, FabG Y151F, and FabG K155A), FabA, and FabI, followed by analysis by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis (FabA and FabI were added to stabilize the short-chain products). In the absence of FabG, only the holo-ACP substrate was detected (Fig. 5A, lane7). After the addition of wildtype FabG (Fig. 5A, lane 2), FabG S138A (lane 3), FabG Y151F (lane 4), FabG K155A (lane 5), or FabG S138A/Y151F/K155A (lane 6) to the reaction, butyryl-ACP was produced. However, the activities of FabG S138A, FabG Y151F, and FabG K155A were lower than that of the wildtype FabG protein. These data showed that the mutant FabG proteins S138A, Y151F, K155A and triple mutant, like the wildtype FabG, could complete the initial cycle of fatty acid synthesis to produce butyryl-ACP. A more direct assay of the enzymatic activities of the mutant FabG proteins in reduction of a long-chain 3-ketoacyl-ACP was performed. We synthesized malonyl-ACP and octanoyl-ACP as described in “Experimental procedures.” As expected, the incubation of FabB with malonyl-ACP and octanoyl-ACP resulted in the formation of 3-ketodecanoyl-ACP (Fig. 5B, lane 7) (the longer-chain species are more stable to electrophoresis). Upon the addition of NADPH, FabG (or one of the mutant FabG proteins), and EcFabA to the reaction mixture (lanes 1–6 of Fig. 5B), all incubations yielded the expected enoyl-ACP species. FabG converted 3-ketoacyl-ACP to 3-hydroxacyl-ACP, whereas EcFabA dehydrated 3-hydroxacyl-ACP to"

Although it is well-documented that collaborative contexts facilitate young children’s reasoning, less is known about whether competition with other groups contributes to children’s collaborative reasoning. We investigated whether between-group competition facilitates children’s within-group collaborative reasoning, regarding their production of reasons and their use of transacts , communicative acts that operate on one another’s proposals and reasoning. We presented 5- and 7-year-old peer dyads with two collaborative problem-solving tasks (decorating a zoo and a dollhouse). In one task, children competed against another group (the competitive condition); whereas in the other task, they did not (non-competitive condition). Our results suggest that children’s sensitivity to group competition as reflected in their reasoning changed depending on the task. When they decorated a house, they produced more transacts in the competitive condition than in the non-competitive condition; whereas when they decorated a zoo, this pattern was reversed. Thus, our results highlight that group competition did not influence children’s collaborative reasoning consistently across different contexts."

Chemokines are a large family of chemotactic cytokines that regulate immune cell development and migration by signaling through 7-transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors. Chemokines are divided into four subfamilies, termed CC, CXC, XC, and CX3C, based on the number and arrangement of their N-terminal cysteine residues (1Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Chemokines: A new classification system and their role in immunity.Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). Two types of cellular receptors mediate chemokine functions, class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, n = 18) and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs, n = 4), which do not signal through G proteins (2Bachelerie F.

Chemokine receptors constitute one of the largest subfamilies of the 7TM receptor superfamily.

This model proposes that while the N terminus is mainly responsible for the affinity of the interaction by its binding to the globular core of the chemokine, the TM domains initiate conformational changes upon binding of the unstructured N-terminal domain of the chemokine, which ultimately trigger intracellular signaling. However, recent detailed structural studies, including the crystallographic structure of the first chemokine-receptor complexes, describe a higher degree of overlap in the regulation of chemokine binding and activation by more extended areas of the receptor (16Qin L.

In addition, ligand binding and selectivity of chemokine receptors are known to be further regulated by posttranslationally modified sulfated tyrosines in the N-terminal domain (21Liu J. Louie S. Hsu W. Yu K.M. Nicholas H.B. Rosenquist G.L. Tyrosine sulfation is prevalent in human chemokine receptors important in lung disease.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Chemokine GPCR intracellular signaling is transduced by heterotrimeric G proteins and/or β-arrestins, resulting in the release of intracellular stores of ionized calcium, actin polymerization and cell migration, or receptor internalization, respectively (23Legler D.F. Thelen M. New insights in chemokine signaling.F1000Res. 2018; 7: 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Thelen M. Dancing to the tune of chemokines.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). After chemokine binding, G protein subunits dissociate from the receptor to activate various signaling pathways allowing β-arrestin recruitment and the subsequent internalization of the receptor (25Patel J. Channon K.M. McNeill E. The downstream regulation of chemokine receptor signalling: Implications for atherosclerosis.Mediators Inflamm. 2013; 2013: 459520Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An Asp-Arg-Tyr (DRY) motif at the boundary between TMIII and ICL2 of the receptor is known to be an essential G-protein-coupling site in GPCRs (26Han X. Feng Y. Chen X. Gerard C. Boisvert W.A. Characterization of G protein coupling mediated by the conserved D134(3.49) of DRY motif, M241(6.34), and F251(6.44) residues on human CXCR1.FEBS Open Bio. 2015; 5: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Scheerer P.

Crystal structure of opsin in its G-protein-interacting conformation.Nature. 2008; 455: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). GPCR mutants for the DRY motif typically lose the ability to activate G proteins but retain β-arrestin-mediated signaling (28Lagane B. Ballet S. Planchenault T. Balabanian K. Le Poul E. Blanpain C.

Mutations in the “DRY” motif of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor result in biased receptor variants.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2015; 54: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similarly, the substantial divergence of the DRY motif of ACKRs from the canonical DRYLAIV sequence is thought to partially explain the β-arrestin-biased signaling of these chemokine scavenger receptors (4Nibbs R.J.B. Graham G.J. Immune regulation by atypical chemokine receptors.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although unable to induce cell migration, ACKR-mediated chemokine internalization is essential for regulating chemotactic gradients and chemokine availability during immune and inflammatory responses (30Bonecchi R. Graham G.J. Atypical chemokine receptors and their roles in the resolution of the inflammatory response.Front. Immunol. 2016; 7: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, some chemokine receptors constitutively induce G-protein-dependent signaling and/or β-arrestin-dependent internalization without the need for chemokine binding (31Gilliland C.T. Salanga C.L. Kawamura T. Trejo J. Handel T.M. The chemokine receptor CCR1 is constitutively active, which leads to G protein-independent, β-arrestin-mediated internalization.J. Biol.

This ligand-independent activity is particularly common among virally encoded chemokine receptors (33Pontejo S.M. Murphy P.M. Pease J.E. Chemokine subversion by human herpesviruses.J. Innate Immun. 2018; 10: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adding to the complexity, some receptors are known to interfere with the signaling of other chemokine receptors by the formation of heterodimers (34Salanga C.L. O'Hayre M. Handel T.

Chemokine receptors can also be classified as homeostatic or inflammatory depending on their functional roles (2Bachelerie F. Ben-Baruch A. Burkhardt A.M. Combadiere C. Farber J.M. Graham G.J.

Immunol. 2018; 15: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Most of the 14 known inflammatory chemokine receptor subtypes bind distinct subsets of multiple inflammatory chemokines, and for closely related receptors, the subsets typically overlap (2Bachelerie F. Ben-Baruch A. Burkhardt A.M. Combadiere C. Farber J.M. Graham G.J. Horuk R. Sparre-Ulrich A.H. Locati M. Luster A.D. Mantovani A. Matsushima K. Murphy P.M. Nibbs R. Nomiyama H. et al.International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. [corrected]. LXXXIX. Update on the extended family of chemokine receptors and introducing a new nomenclature for atypical chemokine receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2014; 66: 1-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). For instance, Ccr1 and Ccr3 have six (Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl5, Ccl6, Ccl7, and Ccl9/10) and five (Ccl5, Ccl7, Ccl9/10, Ccl11, and Ccl24) known chemokine ligands, respectively, three of which are the same. Ccr1l1 (Ccr1-like 1) is a putative 7TM mouse protein identified by gene cloning in 1995 (39Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. Cloning and differential tissue-specific expression of three mouse beta chemokine receptor-like genes, including the gene for a functional macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17494-17501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There have been no subsequent peer-reviewed papers in the ensuing 25 years characterizing Ccr1l1; however, bioinformatics databases contain evidence that it lacks a human orthologue and is the only gene located between Ccr1 and Ccr3 on mouse chromosome 9. In the ImmGen database, Ccr1, Ccr3, and Ccr1l1 mRNA are all listed as present in mouse eosinophils and some macrophages, with the highest Ccr1l1 expression in eosinophils. Ccr1l1 has 70% amino acid identity to mouse Ccr1 and 50% amino acid identity to mouse Ccr3, yet Ccr1l1 ligands have never been reported, nor has it been established that Ccr1l1 can be expressed on the plasma membrane. Here, we addressed these questions by a systematic and broad structural and functional interrogation of Ccr1l1. Given its extremely strong homology with Ccr1 and Ccr3, we framed our initial analyses of Ccr1l1 within the CC chemokine receptor subfamily. Ccr1l1 is located on mouse chromosome 9, together with seven other CC chemokine receptors (Ccr1, Ccr2, Ccr3, Ccr4, Ccr5, Ccr8, and Ccr9) (Fig. 1A). Ccr1l1 maps to chromosomal region 9qF4 flanked by Ccr1 and Ccr3. This region is syntenic to human 3p21, which contains CCR1 and CCR3 but lacks a Ccr1l1 ortholog. Ccr1 and Ccr1l1 are separated by approximately 14 kb and have the same transcription orientation (Fig. 1A). A BLAST-P search using the predicted mouse full-length Ccr1l1 protein sequence as the query revealed orthologs in at least ten other rodent species with amino acid identities >78% (Fig. 1B). Notably, no Ccr1l1 orthologs were found in any other mammalian families, indicating that Ccr1l1 is a highly conserved gene restricted to Rodentia. Ccr1l1 amino acid sequence is 70% and 53% identical to mouse Ccr1 and Ccr3, respectively, whereas it has slightly lower amino acid identity to human CCR1 (66%) and CCR3 (51%), and substantially lower homology with other CC chemokine receptors (Fig. 1C). To understand the evolutionary relationship of Ccr1l1 with other CC chemokine receptors, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of all CC chemokine receptors found in these 11 rodent species and humans. The different chemokine receptors were correctly clustered by a maximum likelihood analysis that established evolutionary relationships—common ancestors shared by Ccr6, Ccr7, Ccr9 and Ccr10; by Ccr4 and Ccr8; and by Ccr2 and Ccr5—similar to a previously published phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1D) (2Bachelerie F. Ben-Baruch A. Burkhardt A.M. Combadiere C. Farber J.M. Graham G.J. Horuk R. Sparre-Ulrich A.H. Locati M. Luster A.D. Mantovani A. Matsushima K. Murphy P.M. Nibbs R. Nomiyama H. et al.International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. [corrected]. LXXXIX. Update on the extended family of chemokine receptors and introducing a new nomenclature for atypical chemokine receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2014; 66: 1-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We found that Ccr1l1 shares a common ancestor with Ccr1 and Ccr3 and appears to have evolved directly from Ccr1 (Fig. 1D). In conclusion, mouse Ccr1l1 and Ccr1 are two highly related receptors with similar chromosomal location, transcription orientation, amino acid sequence, and evolution. Next, we investigated the tissue and cellular expression of Ccr1l1. In the absence of an available antibody reagent to detect Ccr1l1 protein, we analyzed Ccr1l1 mRNA expression in multiple tissues and cell types by qPCR. Relative transcript abundance of Ccr1l1 was particularly high in the bone marrow and the spleen of naïve C57BL/6NTac mice compared with other tissues such as the brain, kidney, liver, or heart (Fig. 2A). Then, we sorted naïve splenocytes into T, B, and non-T/non-B cell (non B/T) populations and found that Ccr1l1 expression was significantly higher in non-B/T cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, a search in the RNA-seq Gene Skyline databrowser of the Immunological Genome Project or ImmGen (http://rstats.immgen.org/Skyline/skyline.html) (40Heng T.S.P. Painter M.W. Immunological Genome Project ConsortiumThe Immunological Genome Project: Networks of gene expression in immune cells.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1091-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) revealed that Ccr1l1 expression is mostly restricted to macrophages and eosinophils (Fig. 2C). To confirm this, we analyzed the expression of Ccr1l1 in bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and eosinophils (BMDE) generated in vitro from wild-type Ccr1l1+/+ C57BL/6NTac mice or Ccr1l1−/− mice as a control. We found that while both BMDM and BMDE expressed Ccr1l1, the relative expression was 2 logs higher in BMDE (Fig. 2D). As expected, Ccr1l1 was undetectable or near the detection limit in cells derived from Ccr1l1−/− animals or in nonretrotranscribed controls (Fig. 2D). We concluded that Ccr1l1 is expressed in most lymphoid tissues and in some myeloid cells, with the highest constitutive expression in eosinophils. To assess the possibility that Ccr1l1 acts as a canonical GPCR, we next looked in both the primary amino acid sequence and a three-dimensional model of Ccr1l1 for classical structural and signaling features of chemokine GPCRs. A non-template-restricted homology model generated by I-TASSER predicted that Ccr1l1 preserves the 7TM domains, 3 ICL, 3 ECL, and the N-terminal and C-terminal domains that define the topology of chemokine GPCRs (Fig. 3A). In addition, this model supported that the β-hairpin fold typically observed in the ECL2 of chemokine receptors and the two conserved extracellular disulfide bridges (TMVII-N-terminus and TMIII-ECL2) are preserved in Ccr1l1 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the model predicted that Ccr1l1 conserves the G-protein-coupling DRY motif at the boundary between TMIII and ICL2 (Fig. 3C). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of 11 different rodent Ccr1l1 species with mouse Ccr1 confirmed that Ccr1l1 preserves the canonical DRYLAIV sequence of the DRY motif, with most rodent Ccr1l1 orthologues encoding a DRYLAVV sequence (Fig. 3D). This exact sequence is also found in the corresponding location of human CCR8 and CCR5 (41Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. Functional roles of evolutionary conserved motifs and residues in vertebrate chemokine receptors.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 97: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other conserved motifs have been implicated in the activation of class A GPCRs; in particular, TxP in TMII, CWxP in TMVI, and NPx2Yx6F at the boundary between TMVII and the C terminus (41Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. Functional roles of evolutionary conserved motifs and residues in vertebrate chemokine receptors.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 97: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3D, the TxP and the NPx2Yx6F motifs are highly conserved in all Ccr1l1 species whereas instead of a CWxP motif, mouse Ccr1 and 6 Ccr1l1 species contain LWxP and the other five Ccr1l1 species, including mouse Ccr1l1, present an LLxP motif. However, it is important to note that while the CWxP motif is highly conserved in other class A GPCRs, of these three signaling motifs, CWxP is the most variable in the chemokine receptor family (C, W, and P are conserved in 41%, 71%, and 99% of chemokine receptors, respectively), and it has been proposed to play only a minor role in signaling by chemokine GPCRs (41Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. Functional roles of evolutionary conserved motifs and residues in vertebrate chemokine receptors.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 97: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, a comprehensive mutagenesis analysis of CXCR4 revealed other amino acids required for G protein coupling, activation, and signal transmission (42Wescott M.P. Kufareva I. Paes C. Goodman J.R. Thaker Y. Puffer B.A. Berdougo E. Rucker J.B. Handel T.M. Doranz B.J. Signal transmission through the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) transmembrane helices.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 9928-9933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For instance, besides the DRY motif, this study identified that conformational changes in CXCR4 S131, Y219, and Y302 are critical to form the structural support for the G protein interface and that L226 is directly involved in G protein coupling. Y302 is part of the NPx2Yx6F motif conserved in Ccr1l1, Y219 and L226 are conserved in equivalent positions (220 and 227, respectively) of Ccr1l1 TMV, and S131 is substituted for a highly homologous T129 in Ccr1 and all Ccr1l1 species (Fig. 3D). In addition, Y45, W94, Y116, and E288 located at the bottom of the chemokine binding pocket of CXCR4 were shown to be critical signal initiators (42Wescott M.P. Kufareva I. Paes C. Goodman J.R. Thaker Y. Puffer B.A. Berdougo E. Rucker J.B. Handel T.M. Doranz B.J. Signal transmission through the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) transmembrane helices.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 9928-9933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in the alignment of Figure 3D, these four amino acids are conserved in equivalent positions of Ccr1 and Ccr1l1 (Y42, W91, Y114, and E288). Finally, we found that a TMVI hydrophobic bridge involved in the signal propagation from the signal initiators on the extracellular side to the intracellular activation determinants of GPCRs (42Wescott M.P. Kufareva I. Paes C. Goodman J.R. Thaker Y. Puffer B.A. Berdougo E. Rucker J.B. Handel T.M. Doranz B.J. Signal transmission through the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) transmembrane helices.Proc.

Together, these observations support that Ccr1l1 is well equipped to act as a canonical signaling GPCR. Ccr1l1 conserves major structural and signaling features of bona fide chemokine GPCRs, and therefore, it is likely to bind chemokines and signal through G proteins if it can be expressed on the cell plasma membrane. To test this, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with two different plasmid constructs, termed pNT1 and pNT2, containing the coding sequence of Ccr1l1 cloned from mouse splenic mRNA in frame with a C-terminal or N-terminal HA-tag, respectively (Fig. 4A).
