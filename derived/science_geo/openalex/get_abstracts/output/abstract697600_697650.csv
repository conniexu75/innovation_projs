https://openalex.org/W4288066825,"We examine the time-frequency spillovers, contagion, and pairwise interrelations between the BRIC index and its constituents, and between BRIC and G7 economies. The extent of interdependencies between market blocs and their constituents needs to be ascertained in the time-frequency domain for efficient asset allocation and portfolio management. Accordingly, the Baruník and Křehlík spillover index is employed with daily data between 11 th December 2015 and 28 th May 2021. We find the overall and net spillovers between BRIC and G7 to be significant in the short-term, with France, Germany, and the UK transmitting the greatest shocks to BRIC markets. We find no significant evidence of any sporadic volatilities for the studied markets in the COVID-19 period across all frequencies. However, we reveal contagious spillovers between the BRIC and G7 economies across all time scales in 2017 and 2019, which respectively reflect the persistent effect of Brexit and the US-China trade tension. Our findings divulge that in the short-term (mid-to-long-term), France and the UK (Canada and the US), are the sources of contagion between the BRIC and G7 markets. From the net-pairwise spillovers, we report high connectedness between the BRIC index and its members. BRIC countries are found to be transmitters of net-pairwise spillovers to the G7 markets excluding Japan. We recommend portfolio diversification using BRIC and G7 stocks in the intermediate-to-long-term horizon, where spillovers are less concentrated. Additionally, since individual markets are impacted by their unique shocks, investors should pay close attention to these shocks when distributing assets. In the interim, policy-makers and governments across the globe should ensure effective liberalisation of their economies to encourage international trade flows to boost portfolio diversification."
https://openalex.org/W4288051877,"Climate extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, extreme rainfall can lead to harvest failures, flooding and consequently threaten the food security worldwide. Improving our understanding about climate extremes can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and extremes. The objective here is to investigate the changes in climate and climate extremes by considering two time slices (i.e., 1962-1990 and 1991-2019) in all climate zones of Pakistan by utilizing observed data from 54 meteorological stations. Different statistical methods and techniques were applied on observed station data to assess changes in temperature, precipitation and spatio-temporal trends of climatic extremes over Pakistan from 1962 to 2019. The Mann-Kendal test demonstrated increasing precipitation (DJF) and decreasing maximum and minimum temperatures (JJA) at the meteorological stations located in the Karakoram region during 1962-1990. The decadal analysis, on the other hand, showed a decrease in precipitation during 1991-2019 and an increase in temperature (maximum and minimum) during 2010-2019, which is consistent with the recently observed slight mass loss of glaciers related to the Karakoram Anomaly. These changes are highly significant at 5% level of significance at most of the stations. In case of temperature extremes, summer days (SU25) increased except in zone 4, TX10p (cold days) decreased across the country during 1962-1990, except for zones 1 and 2. TX90p (warm days) increased between 1991-2019, with the exception of zone 5, and decreased during 1962-1990, with the exception of zones 2 and 5. The spatio-temporal trend of consecutive dry days (CDD) indicated a rising tendency from 1991 to 2019, with the exception of zone 4, which showed a decreasing trend. PRCPTOT (annual total wet-day precipitation), R10 (number of heavy precipitation days), R20 (number of very heavy precipitation days), and R25mm (very heavy precipitation days) increased (decreased) considerably in the North Pakistan during 1962-1990 (1991-2019). The findings of this study can help to address some of the sustainable development goals related climate action, hunger and environment. In addition, the findings can help in developing sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies against climate change and extremes. As the climate and extremes conditions are not the uniform in all climate zone, therefore, it is suggested to the formers and agriculture department to harvest crops resilient to the climatic condition of each zone. Temperature has increasing trend in the northern Pakistan, therefore, the concerned stakeholders need to make rational plans for higher river flow/flood situation due to snow and glacier melt."
https://openalex.org/W4288052188,"Covid-19 has been front and center in the global landscape since the beginning of 2020. In response, the scientific field has dedicated enormous amounts of resources to researching the virus and its effects. The number of times Covid-19 publications are being cited throughout the literature appears remarkably high but has not been directly compared to non-Covid-19 papers in the same journals over an extended period. In our study, we use Clarivate’s Web of Science—Science Citation Index Expanded™ database to identify Covid-19 papers published in 24 major scientific journals over a period of 24 months from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. We conduct our search using keywords “Covid-19”, “coronavirus”, and “sars-cov-2” to locate publications with these words in the title. We then quantify the number of citations these papers have received and compare rates to non-Covid-19 papers in the same journals over the same timeframe. We find that, across 24 open-access and subscription-based scientific journals, Covid-19 papers published in the past 2 years currently have a median citation rate of 120.79 compared to 21.63 for non-Covid-19 papers. When negative binomial regression is used to minimize the influence of other variables such as article number variation and field of research, Covid-19 papers have still experienced more than 80% increase in citations relative to non-Covid-19 papers. These novel findings demonstrate that Covid-19 papers are being cited at remarkably higher rates than non-Covid-19 articles contained within the same journals. This suggests that journal impact factor, which is a product of the number of citations that recently published articles receive, will likely be drastically influenced by the number of Covid-19 papers that a journal has included within its pages in the previous years."
https://openalex.org/W4288052030,"Tropical mountain ecosystems are threatened by land use pressures, compromising their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Although local patterns and interactions among anthropogenic and biophysical factors shape these socio-ecological systems, the analysis of landscape changes and their driving forces is often qualitative and sector oriented. Using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework, we characterized land use land cover (LULC) dynamics using Markov chain probabilities by elevation and geographic settings and then integrated them with a variety of publicly available geospatial and temporal data into a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to evaluate factors driving such landscape dynamics in a sensitive region of the northern Ecuadorian Andes. In previous agricultural land located at lower elevations to the east of the studied territory, we found a significant expansion of floriculture (13 times) and urban areas (25 times), reaching together almost 10% of the territory from 1990 to 2014. Our findings also revealed an unexpected trend of páramo stability (0.75-0.90), but also a 40% reduction of montane forests, with the lowest probability (<0.50) of persistence in the elevation band of 2800-3300 m; agricultural land is replacing this LULC classes at higher elevation. These trends highlight the increasing threat of permanently losing the already vulnerable native mountain biodiversity. GAMs of socio-economic factors, demographic, infrastructure variables, and environmental parameters explained between 21 to 42% of the variation of LULC transitions observed in the study region, where topographic factors was the main drivers of change. The conceptual and methodological approach of our findings demonstrate how dynamic patterns through space and time and their explanatory drivers can assist local authorities and decision makers to improve sustainable resource land management in vulnerable landscapes such as the tropical Andes in northern Ecuador."
https://openalex.org/W4288051927,"Balance training aims to improve balance and transfer acquired skills to real-life tasks. How older adults adapt gait to different conditions, and whether these adaptations are altered by balance training, remains unclear. We hypothesized that reorganization of modular control of muscle activity is a mechanism underlying adaptation of gait to training and environmental constraints. We investigated the transfer of standing balance training, shown to enhance unipedal balance control, to gait and adaptations in neuromuscular control of gait between normal and narrow-base walking in twenty-two older adults (72.6 ± 4.2 years). At baseline, after one, and after ten training sessions, kinematics and EMG of normal and narrow-base treadmill walking were measured. Gait parameters and temporal activation profiles of five muscle synergies were compared between time-points and gait conditions. Effects of balance training and an interaction between training and gait condition on step width were found, but not on synergies. After ten training sessions step width decreased in narrow-base walking, while step width variability decreased in both conditions. Trunk center of mass displacement and velocity, and the local divergence exponent, were lower in narrow-base compared to normal walking. Activation duration in narrow-base compared to normal walking was shorter for synergies associated with dominant leg weight acceptance and non-dominant leg stance, and longer for the synergy associated with non-dominant heel-strike. Time of peak activation associated with dominant leg stance occurred earlier in narrow-base compared to normal walking, while it was delayed in synergies associated with heel-strikes and non-dominant leg stance. The adaptations of synergies to narrow-base walking may be interpreted as related to more cautious weight transfer to the new stance leg and enhanced control over center of mass movement in the stance phase. The improvement of gait stability due to standing balance training is promising for less mobile older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4288052139,"Aedes spp. comprise the primary group of mosquitoes that transmit arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses to humans, and thus these insects pose a significant burden on public health worldwide. Advancements in next-generation sequencing and metagenomics have expanded our knowledge on the richness of RNA viruses harbored by arthropods such as Ae . aegypti and Ae . albopictus . Increasing evidence suggests that vector competence can be modified by the microbiome (comprising both bacteriome and virome) of mosquitoes present in endemic zones. Using an RNA-seq-based metataxonomic approach, this study determined the virome structure, Wolbachia presence and mitochondrial diversity of field-caught Ae . aegypti and Ae . albopictus mosquitoes in Medellín, Colombia, a municipality with a high incidence of mosquito-transmitted arboviruses. The two species are sympatric, but their core viromes differed considerably in richness, diversity, and abundance; although the community of viral species identified was large and complex, the viromes were dominated by few virus species. BLAST searches of assembled contigs suggested that at least 17 virus species (16 of which are insect-specific viruses [ISVs]) infect the Ae . aegypti population. Dengue virus 3 was detected in one sample and it was the only pathogenic virus detected. In Ae . albopictus , up to 11 ISVs and one plant virus were detected. Therefore, the virome composition appears to be species-specific. The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia was identified in all Ae . albopictus samples and in some Ae . aegypti samples collected after 2017. The presence of Wolbachi a sp. in Ae . aegypti was not related to significant changes in the richness, diversity, or abundance of this mosquito’s virome, although it was related to an increase in the abundance of Aedes aegypti To virus 2 ( Metaviridae ). The mitochondrial diversity of these mosquitoes suggested that the Ae . aegypti population underwent a change that started in the second half of 2017, which coincides with the release of Wolbachia -infected mosquitoes in Medellín, indicating that the population of w Mel-infected mosquitoes released has introduced new alleles into the wild Ae . aegypti population of Medellín. However, additional studies are required on the dispersal speed and intergenerational stability of w Mel in Medellín and nearby areas as well as on the introgression of genetic variants in the native mosquito population."
https://openalex.org/W4288052145,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 has impacted upon the role and safety of healthcare workers, with the potential to have a lasting effect on their wellbeing. Limited research has been conducted during previous pandemics exploring how student healthcare workers are impacted as they study and train for their professional careers. Objective The aim of the current study was to examine the specific impact of COVID-19 on the academic, clinical and personal experiences of healthcare students. Method Undergraduate students across three year groups within the School of Health Sciences at Ulster University completed online Qualtrics surveys at three timepoints during one academic year (2020/2021). Quantitative survey data was downloaded from Qualtrics into SPSS Version 25 for descriptive analysis of each cross-sectional sample. Qualitative survey data was downloaded into text format, which was thematically analysed using content analysis. Results 412 students completed the survey at Time 1 (October 2020), n = 309 at Time 2 (December 2020) and n = 259 at Time 3 (April 2021). Academically, the pandemic had mostly a negative impact on the learning environment, the development of practical skills, the assessment process and opportunities for peer learning and support. Students reported increased stress and challenges managing their workload and maintaining a sense of motivation and routine. Clinically, they felt unprepared by the university for placement where the pandemic had an increasingly negative impact over time on learning and skill development. In terms of personal experiences, despite the majority of students taking steps to keep physically and mentally well, negative impacts on friendships, mental wellbeing and concerns for family were reported. The pandemic had not impacted upon career choice for most students. Conclusion Consideration must be given to the development of practical skills so students feel prepared for their professional careers given the practical nature of their roles. Programme coordinators should adopt a holistic approach to student wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W4288068765,"Accomplishing the goals outlined in ""Ending the HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) Epidemic: A Plan for America Initiative"" will require properly estimating and increasing access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services. In this research, a computational spatial method for estimating access was applied to measure distance to services from all points of a city or state while considering the size of the population in need for services as well as both driving and public transportation. Specifically, this study employed the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method to measure spatial accessibility to HIV testing, treatment (i.e., Ryan White HIV/AIDS program), and prevention (i.e., Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP]) services. The method considered the spatial location of MSM (Men Who have Sex with Men), PLWH (People Living with HIV), and the general adult population 15-64 depending on what HIV services the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends for each group. The study delineated service- and population-specific accessibility maps, demonstrating the method's utility by analyzing data corresponding to the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois. Findings indicated health disparities in the south and the northwest of Chicago and particular areas in Illinois, as well as unique health disparities for public transportation compared to driving. The methodology details and computer code are shared for use in research and public policy."
https://openalex.org/W4288052082,"Latently infected CD4 T cells form a stable reservoir of HIV that leads to life-long viral persistence; the mechanisms involved in establishment of this latency are not well understood. Three scenarios have been proposed: 1) an activated, proliferating cell becomes infected and reverts back to a resting state; 2) an activated cell becomes infected during its return to resting; or 3) infection is established directly in a resting cell. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the relationship between T cell activation and proliferation and the establishment of HIV latency. Isolated primary CD4 cells were infected at different time points before or after TCR-induced stimulation. Cell proliferation within acutely infected cultures was tracked using CFSE viable dye over 14 days; and cell subsets that underwent varying degrees of proliferation were isolated at end of culture by flow cytometric sorting. Recovered cell subpopulations were analyzed for the amount of integrated HIV DNA, and the ability to produce virus, upon a second round of cell stimulation. We show that cell cultures exposed to virus, prior to stimulus addition, contained the highest levels of integrated and replication-competent provirus after returning to quiescence; whereas, cells infected during the height of cell proliferation retained the least. Cells that did not divide or exhibited limited division, following virus exposure and stimulation contained greater amounts of integrated and inducible HIV than did cells that had divided many times. Based on these results, co-culture experiments were conducted to demonstrate that latent infection could be established directly in non-dividing cells via cell-to-cell transmission from autologous productively infected cells. Together, the findings from our studies implicate the likely importance of direct infection of sub-optimally activated T cells in establishment of latently infected reservoirs in vivo, especially in CD4 lymphocytes that surround productive viral foci within immune tissue microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W4288052204,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the deadly cancers. Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment and the only curative intervention is stem cell transplantation which are intolerable for aged and comorbid patients. Therefore, finding complementary treatment is still an active research area. For this, empirical knowledge driven search for therapeutic agents have been carried out by long and arduous wet lab processes. Nonetheless, currently there is an accumulated bioinformatics data about natural products that enabled the use of efficient and cost effective in silico methods to find drug candidates. In this work, therefore, we set out to computationally investigate the phytochemicals from Brucea antidysentrica to identify therapeutic phytochemicals for AML. We performed in silico molecular docking of compounds against AML receptors IDH2, MCL1, FLT3 and BCL2. Phytochemicals were docked to AML receptors at the same site where small molecule drugs were bound and their binding affinities were examined. In addition, random compounds from PubChem were docked with AML targets and their docking score was compared with that of phytochemicals using statistical analysis. Then, non-covalent interactions between phytochemicals and receptors were identified and visualized using discovery studio and Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler web tool (PLIP). From the statistical analysis, most of the phytochemicals exhibited significantly lower (p-value ≤ 0.05) binding energies compared with random compounds. Using cutoff binding energy of less than or equal to one standard deviation from the mean of the phytochemicals' binding energies for each receptor, 12 phytochemicals showed considerable binding affinity. Especially, hydnocarpin (-8.9 kcal/mol) and yadanzioside P (-9.4 kcal/mol) exhibited lower binding energy than approved drugs AMG176 (-8.6 kcal/mol) and gilteritinib (-9.1 kcal/mol) to receptors MCL1 and FLT3 respectively, indicating their potential to be lead molecules. In addition, most of the phytochemicals possessed acceptable drug-likeness and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Based on the binding affinities as exhibited by the molecular docking studies supported by the statistical analysis, 12 phytochemicals from Brucea antidysentrica (1,11-dimethoxycanthin-6-one, 1-methoxycanthin-6-one, 2-methoxycanthin-6-one, beta-carboline-1-propionic acid, bruceanol A, bruceanol D, bruceanol F, bruceantarin, bruceantin, canthin-6-one, hydnocarpin, and yadanzioside P) can be considered as candidate compounds to prevent and manage AML. However, the phytochemicals should be further studied using in vivo & in vitro experiments on AML models. Therefore, this study concludes that combination of empirical knowledge, in silico molecular docking and ADMET profiling is useful to find natural product-based drug candidates. This technique can be applied to other natural products with known empirical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4288067743,"Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition associated with raised levels of blood glucose due to the body cannot produce any or enough insulin hormone or cannot be effectively utilized the produced insulin by the body. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes show a significant alteration in various parameters including metabolic, cellular, immunological, and hematological disturbances that leads to vascular complications. Thus, the main aim of this study is to compare hematological parameters between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and healthy controls. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in Dessie comprehensive specialized hospital from January to June 2021. A total of 240 study participants consisting of 120 T2DM patients and 120 healthy controls were recruited using a systematic random sampling technique. Hematological parameters were determined using the DIRUI BF6500 automated hematology analyzer. Independent T-test was used to compare the mean of hematological parameters between T2DM patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation test was used to determine the correlation between FBG, BMI, SBP, DBP, and hematological parameters in T2DM patients. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between socio-demographic and clinical variables with anemia. The result was expressed in mean and standard deviation and presented in texts and tables. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results The mean and standard deviation of monocyte count, basophil count, monocyte %, basophil %, RBC count, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, RDW-SD, MPV, PDW, PLC-R, and plateletcrit showed a significant difference between T2DM patients and healthy control group. Pearson correlation coefficient showed that the total WBC count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, basophil count, RDW-CV, PDW, MPV, PLC-R, and plateletcrit were statistically positively correlated with FBG whereas RBC count, Hgb, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and RDW-SD were statistically negatively correlated with FBG in T2DM patients. Moreover, total WBC count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, basophil count, Hgb, and plateletcrit were statistically positively correlated with BMI while RBC count, Hgb, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and RDW-SD were statistically negatively correlated with BMI in T2DM patients. On the other hand, DBP was significantly positively correlated with platelet count and RDW-CV whereas SBP also significantly positively correlated with total WBC count, neutrophil count, basophil count, and PDW. Besides, DBP and SBP showed statistically significant negative correlations with RBC count, Hgb level, and Hct value in T2DM patients. The overall prevalence of anemia was 25.8% in T2DM patients with a higher prevalence of anemia (16.7%) in female patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that being non-employee worker (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI, 1.4–46.0, P = 0.002), presence of neuropathy (AOR: 13.40, 95% CI, 6.83–26.28, P = 0.00), and duration of the disease ≥ 5 years (AOR = 3.2, 95% CI, 1.2–15.3, P = 0.03) have had statistically significant association with anemia inT2DM patients. Conclusions Patients with T2DM may have significant alterations in various hematological parameters. Hematological parameters should be regularly tested for early diagnosis and proper management of diabetes-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W4288052080,"Background Adolescents who are willing to perform first aid can help prevent injuries and ultimately death among themselves and others involved in accidents or injuries. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of students’ willingness to perform first aid procedures and additionally examine associated factors among high school students in Hue, Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional study utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling was conducted between April to July 2020 by investigating 798 high school students in Hue, Vietnam. Participants were invited to complete a self-reported questionnaire pertaining to individual demographic characteristics, personal perception of self-efficacy, and willingness to perform first aid. To better interpret these findings, both multivariable linear and Poisson regression models were fitted to evaluate the association between individual student characteristics and the willingness to perform first aid. Results The prevalence of having willingness to perform first aid (defined as ≥4 points out of 5 to all three questions) was 49.9% (95%CI:28.6–71.2%). The major reported barriers in performing first aid were fear of making mistakes and hurting victims (34.4%, 95%CI:31.9–37.0%), no prior first aid training (29.8%, 95%CI:25.9–33.9%), and forgetting first aid steps (23.0%, 95%CI:15.8–32.2%). By employing the multivariable linear regression model, it was identified that students with high (β = 0.614, 95%CI:0.009–1.219) or very high (β = 1.64, 95%CI:0.857–2.422) levels of self-efficacy appeared to be more willing to perform first aid. Similarly, in the Poisson regression models, compared to neutral students, students who reported high (PR = 1.214, 95%CI:1.048–1.407) or very high (PR = 1.871, 95%CI:1.049–3.337) levels of self-efficacy were more willing to perform first aid. Conclusions The level of willingness to perform first aid among high school students in this study population was found to be moderate. Therefore, integrating activities to promote self-efficacy in first aid training could be considered a progressive step towards improving a student’s willingness to provide such life-saving procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4288052171,"Background Understanding public discourse about a COVID-19 vaccine in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic may provide key insights concerning vaccine hesitancy. However, few studies have investigated the communicative patterns in which Twitter users participate discursively in vaccine discussions. Objectives This study aims to investigate 1) the major topics that emerged from public conversation on Twitter concerning vaccines for COVID-19, 2) the topics that were emphasized in tweets with either positive or negative sentiment toward a COVID-19 vaccine, and 3) the type of online accounts in which tweets with either positive or negative sentiment were more likely to circulate. Methods We randomly extracted a total of 349,979 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets from the initial period of the pandemic. Out of 64,216 unique tweets, a total of 23,133 (36.03%) tweets were classified as positive and 14,051 (21.88%) as negative toward a COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted Structural Topic Modeling and Network Analysis to reveal the distinct topical structure and connection patterns that characterize positive and negative discourse toward a COVID-19 vaccine. Results Our STM analysis revealed the most prominent topic emerged on Twitter of a COVID-19 vaccine was “other infectious diseases”, followed by “vaccine safety concerns”, and “conspiracy theory.” While the positive discourse demonstrated a broad range of topics such as “vaccine development”, “vaccine effectiveness”, and “safety test”, negative discourse was more narrowly focused on topics such as “conspiracy theory” and “safety concerns.” Beyond topical differences, positive discourse was more likely to interact with verified sources such as scientists/medical sources and the media/journalists, whereas negative discourse tended to interact with politicians and online influencers. Conclusions Positive and negative discourse was not only structured around distinct topics but also circulated within different networks. Public health communicators need to address specific topics of public concern in varying information hubs based on audience segmentation, potentially increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4288067020,"Domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) can live in high densities, although most feline species are solitary and exclusively territorial animals; it is possible that certain behavioral strategies enable this phenomenon. These behaviors are regulated by hormones and the gut microbiome, which, in turn, is influenced by domestication. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between the sociality, hormone concentrations, and gut microbiome of domestic cats by conducting three sets of experiments for each group of five cats and analyzing their behavior, hormone concentrations (cortisol, oxytocin, and testosterone), and their gut microbiomes. We observed that individuals with high cortisol and testosterone concentrations established less contact with others, and individuals with high oxytocin concentrations did not exhibit affiliative behaviors as much as expected. Additionally, the higher the frequency of contact among the individuals, the greater the similarity in gut microbiome; gut microbial composition was also related to behavioral patterns and cortisol secretion. Notably, individuals with low cortisol and testosterone concentrations were highly tolerant, making high-density living easy. Oxytocin usually functions in an affiliative manner within groups, but our results suggest that even if typically solitary and territorial animals live in high densities, their oxytocin functions are opposite to those of typically group-living animals."
https://openalex.org/W4288067538,"Rapid urbanization and its associated pollution can affect water quality in mosquito breeding habitats and, as a result, the ecology and control of mosquito vectors. To understand the effects of pollution on mosquito vectors, an accurate assessment of water quality in breeding habitats is needed. Presently, water quality assessment of mosquito breeding habitats is usually based on the measurement of individual physicochemical parameters. However, several parameters are sometimes difficult to interpret or may not give a clear picture of the overall water quality of the breeding habitats, especially when the pollutants are in complex mixtures. This study employed the use of Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy to assess water quality in breeding habitats of Anopheles , Aedes , and Culex mosquitoes in urban areas in Cape Coast, Ghana. The LIF spectra, using a 445-nm diode laser, were measured from field-collected water samples in the laboratory. The LIF spectra showed the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chlorophyll in the breeding habitats. The DOM and chlorophyll fluorescence signals were normalised by the Raman vibrational signals to determine water quality in each habitat. The overall water quality was better in Aedes breeding habitats than in Anopheles and Culex breeding habitats. The poor water quality in Anopheles and Culex breeding habitats was due to the presence of high fulvic acid and chlorophyll content, which often reflect pollutants from anthropogenic sources. Anopheles and Aedes habitats were made up of mainly An . coluzzii and Ae . aegypti respectively while Culex species were identified to genus level. The results add up to the growing concern about the breeding of Anopheles in polluted habitats. The study demonstrated for the first time the ability of LIF spectroscopy to assess water quality in mosquito breeding habitats."

QoL was measured using the anterior skull base surgery questionnaire (ASBS). Factors associated with QoL at baseline and at 12-month follow-up were identified using multivariate logistic regression. Multiple supervised learning models were trained to predict postoperative QoL improvement with five-fold cross-validation.ASBS at 12-month follow-up was significantly higher (132.19,SD = 24.87) than preoperative ASBS (121.87,SD = 25.72,p<0.05). High preoperative scores were significantly associated with institution, diabetes and lesions at the planum sphenoidale / tuberculum sella site. Patients with diabetes were five times less likely to report high preoperative QoL. Low preoperative QoL was significantly associated with female gender, a vision-related presentation, diabetes, secreting adenoma and the cavernous sinus site. Top quartile change in postoperative QoL at 12-month follow-up was negatively associated with baseline hypercholesterolemia, acromegaly and intraoperative CSF leak. Positive associations were detected for lesions at the sphenoid sinus site and deficient preoperative endocrine function. AdaBoost, logistic regression and neural network classifiers yielded the strongest predictive performance.It was possible to predict postoperative positive change in QoL at 12-month follow-up using perioperative data. Further development and implementation of these models may facilitate improvements in informed consent, treatment decision-making and patient QoL."
https://openalex.org/W4288051732,"The murder of George Floyd and subsequent mass protest movement in the summer of 2020 brought policing, race, and police brutality to the forefront of American political discourse. We examined mean-levels of attitudes about police and race using online surveys administered at five time points from June 2020 to October 2021 (n ~ 1000 at each wave) to adults living in the United States. There was a small increase in pro-police attitudes over this time (d = .24), and some evidence that mean-levels of pro-police attitudes increased more for Black participants (d = .51) than White participants (d = .20), and more for Democrats (d = .40) than Republicans (d = .15). Pro-police attitudes were much lower among Black participants than White participants (mean d = -1.04), and-relative to political independents-lower among Democrats (mean d = -.66) and higher among Republicans (mean d = .72). Pro-police attitudes had large associations with a variety of conservative or right-wing political attitudes (e.g., approval of Donald Trump) and COVID-19 variables (e.g., disapproval of government mandates and restrictions), but were unrelated to psychiatric problems and substance use. These results validate a new measure of police attitudes, provide information on trends in police attitudes over the 15 months following the largest mass protests against police brutality in American history, and begin to establish the nomological network of police attitudes, finding that pro-police attitudes are firmly within the right-wing coalition of American politics."

Thus, the aim of this study was assessing awareness of breast cancer on reproductive-aged women in West Badewacho Woreda, Hadiya Zone, South Ethiopia, 2020.A community-based-cross sectional study was employed from April 18 to May 16, 2020. To obtain data, a pre-tested structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was employed. A multistage random sampling technique was employed to select reproductive-aged women from Woreda. Data was entered into a computer using Epi data version 3.1, and edited, cleaned and analyzed using SPSS windows version 20. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were used to identify determinants related to awareness of breast cancer.A total of 578 reproductive-age women participated in this study. Only 364 women of reproductive-age (63%) had heard about breast cancer. 234 (64.3%) of the respondents were aware of breast cancer. After adjusting for other variables, husbands' educational status [AOR = 0.262; 95% CI (0.076, 0.900)], family history of breast cancer [AOR = 0.281; 95% CI (0.132, 0.594)] and having TV/Radio [AOR = 0.489; 95% CI (0.246, 0.972)] were significant predictors for awareness of breast cancer.This study emphasized the importance of raising breast cancer awareness among women in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W4288052006,"California is the only one of its peers with a state-wide tax earmarked for mental health programs. The voter-approved levy applies to personal income above $1 million and has generated over $20 billion since 2005. But whether the additional funding improved population mental health remains unknown. This study applies the synthetic control method to the CDC's National Vital Statistics System data to determine how the tax affected suicide deaths in California. Findings show that the state's suicide mortality rate increased more gradually after the tax's implementation than it would have otherwise. By 2019, the cumulative impact was approximately 5,500 avoided deaths. Multiple robustness and sensitivity checks confirm that result. However, the effect did not appear immediately, nor was it present within all demographic groups. Nevertheless, additional revenue was associated with improved mental health in California. Other governments may likewise yield beneficial outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4288066626,"The Corpus Callosum (CC) is an important structure that includes the majority of fibers connecting the two brain hemispheres. Several neurodegenerative diseases may alter CC size and morphology leading to its atrophy and malfunction which may play a role in the pathological manifestations found in these diseases. The purpose of the current study is to determine any possible changes in CC size in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The Study also investigated the effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) on the size of CC and its association with improvement in the Alzheimer disease severity scores. Midsagittal size of CC were recorded prospectively from 439 routine T1-weighted MRI brain images in normal individuals. The internal skull surface was measured to calculate CC/ internal skull surface ratio. Two groups of patients were studied: 300 (150 male / 150 female) were healthy subjects and 130 (55 males / 75 females) had Alzheimer disease. Out of the 130 Alzheimer disease pateints, 70 patients were treated with Donepezil or Rivastigmine or both. The size of the CC was measured based on T1-weighted MRI images after the treatment to investigate any possible improvement in CC size. The mean surface area of CC in controls was 6.53±1.105 cm 2 . There was no significant difference between males and females (P &lt; 0.627), and CC/ internal skull surface ratio was 4.41±0.77%. Patients with mild or severe Alzheimer disease showed a significant reduction in CC size compared to healthy controls. Treating mild Alzheimer patients with either Donepezil or Rivastigmine exerts a comparable therapeutic effect in improving the CC size. There was more improvement in the size of CC in patients with severe Alzheimer disease by using combined therapy of Donepezil and Rivastigmine than using single a medication. we measured the mean size of the various portions of the corpus callosum in normal individuals and Alzheimer patients before and after taking Donepezil and Rivastigmine. Alzheimer patients have pronounced reduction in CC which is corrected after taking Donepezil and Rivastigmine leading to remarkable improvement in Alzheimer disease severity scores."
https://openalex.org/W4288068251,"The Lower Austrian Wachau region was an early COVID-19 hotspot of infection. As previously reported, in June 2020, after the first peak of infections, we determined that 8.5% and 9.0% of the participants in Weißenkirchen and surrounding communities in the Wachau region were positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Here, we present novel data obtained eight months later (February 2021) from Weißenkirchen, after the second peak of infection, with 25.0% (138/552) and 23.6% (130/552) of participants that are positive for IgG and IgA, respectively. In participants with previous IgG/IgA positivity (June 2020), we observed a 24% reduction in IgG levels, whereas the IgA levels remained stable in February 2021. This subgroup was further analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 induced T cell activities. Although 76% (34/45) and 76% (34/45) of IgG positive and IgA positive participants, respectively, showed specific T cell activities (upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-derived peptides), those were not significantly correlated with the levels of IgG or IgA. Thus, the analyses of antibodies cannot surrogate the measurement of T cell activities. For a comprehensive view on SARS-CoV-2-triggered immune responses, the measurement of different classes of antibodies should be complemented with the determination of T cell activities."
https://openalex.org/W4288068419,"Studies have linked the timing of sexual debut to unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmissible infections, including HIV. Current understandings of sexual debut among Nigerian adolescents focused on the roles of individual and familial characteristics. We leveraged the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data to examine how community features like affluence, ethnic diversity, and women empowerment may be associated with the timing of sexual debut among adolescent girls. The sample comprised 7449 adolescent girls who were usual residents in 6,505 households and 1,352 clusters or communities. Statistical associations between community characteristics and the onset of sexual debut were assessed using a two-level mixed-effects parametric survival model with Weibull distribution. We found that community affluence [aHR:0.43, 95%CI: 0.30-0.62] and community ethnic diversity [aHR: 0.63, 95%CI: 0.42-0.94] are associated with a lower hazard of sexual debut among adolescent girls. We also observed that women that married within the observation period had an earlier sexual initiation than those who were unmarried. The results disaggregated by marital status further shows that higher community level of women's employment [aHR: 2.45, 95%CI: 1.38-4.38] and women's education [aHR:1.85, 95%CI: 1.03-3.33] were associated with a higher hazard of sexual debut among unmarried adolescent girls but not married adolescent girls. Higher community affluence [aHR:0.40, 95%CI: 0.27-0.60] was also associated with a lower hazard of sexual debut among unmarried adolescent girls but not married adolescent girls. Our results illuminate the associated factors of the timing of sexual debut among adolescent girls that moves beyond individual characteristics to community characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4288068522,"Cryoballoon ablation was established as an effective and safe modality to achieve pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). However, its role in persistent atrial fibrillation (PersAF) remains unclear.This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoballoon PVI in PAF and PersAF comparing conventional radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA).Two hundred patients undergoing cryoballoon ablation for symptomatic AF were consecutively enrolled in this retrospective study. For comparison, 210 patients undergoing RFCA in the same period were included. The primary outcome was a recurrence of any atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATas) after the index ablation. 12-lead ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring were obtained at 1,3,6 and 9-12 months.PVI by cryoablation alone was achieved in 197 patients (98.5%). ATas-free survival at 12 months post-ablation was 72.7% in the cryoablation and 80.6% in the RFCA group (P = 0.123), respectively. The cryoablation showed comparable efficacy maintaining sinus rhythm compared with RFCA in PAF (P = 0.539), whereas in PersAF, ATas-free survival was significantly lower in cryoablation (P = 0.039). PV reconnection was observed in the majority of patients (14/16, 87.5%) who receive redo RFCA. Complications were encountered in 10 patients, including femoral arteriovenous fistula (n = 1), transient phrenic nerve palsy (n = 8), and minimal amount pericardial effusion (n = 1).The efficacy of cryoballoon PVI is comparable with conventional RFCA in PAF, whereas PVI alone using cryoballoon may not be insufficient to maintaining sinus rhythm in PersAF. The safety of cryoballlon PVI is tolerable."
https://openalex.org/W4288051583,"PhD is the highest awarded degree offered by universities in different disciplines. Owners of a PhD can teach at universities, start independent research and receive a higher salary while further building a scientific career. We examined whether the publication output before the PhD degree has a correlation with subsequent research activities.We downloaded publication and citation data from the Hungarian Scientific Bibliography for Hungarian researchers who obtained PhD between the ages of 24 and 45. The researchers were grouped into eleven scientific sections. We examined the number of Q1 publications published in the previous 5 years, the H-index, the total number of citations for the last complete year, and the biological age of the researcher. Each parameter was computed for the year at which the PhD was obtained and ten years later. Pre-PhD publications (and citations for these) were excluded when assessing post-PhD track records. Spearman rank correlation and Kruskal-Wallis test were computed.We analyzed all together 4,790 researchers. We obtained a positive correlation between the number of Q1 publications before and after PhD (corr. coeff. = 0.21-0.54, p<0.01 in all sections), between the H-index before and after PhD (corr. coeff. = 0.32-0.56, p<0.01 in all sections), and between the citations received before and after PhD (corr. coeff. = 0.34-0.51, p<0.01 in all sections). All three metrics measured ten years after the PhD were negatively correlated with the age of the researcher at the time of obtaining the PhD (number of publications corr. coeff. = -0.09-0.22, p<0.05; H-index corr. coeff. = -0.09-0.29, p<0.08; number of citations corr. coeff. = -0.14-0.30, p<0.01).

In connection with age, the discipline-specific reference values of scientometric parameters at the time of obtaining the PhD can help to select candidates for postdoctoral grants and positions."
https://openalex.org/W4288051658,"Unlike other European domesticates introduced in the Americas after the European invasion, equids (Equidae) were previously in the Western Hemisphere but were extinct by the late Holocene era. The return of equids to the Americas through the introduction of the domestic horse ( Equus caballus ) is documented in the historical literature but is not explored fully either archaeologically or genetically. Historical documents suggest that the first domestic horses were brought from the Iberian Peninsula to the Caribbean in the late 15 th century CE, but archaeological remains of these early introductions are rare. This paper presents the mitochondrial genome of a late 16 th century horse from the Spanish colonial site of Puerto Real (northern Haiti). It represents the earliest complete mitogenome of a post-Columbian domestic horse in the Western Hemisphere offering a unique opportunity to clarify the phylogeographic history of this species in the Americas. Our data supports the hypothesis of an Iberian origin for this early translocated individual and clarifies its phylogenetic relationship with modern breeds in the Americas."
https://openalex.org/W4288051660,"Physical activity, which can be affected by airflow limitation and extrapulmonary comorbidities, has been reported to be reduced in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and reduced physical activity is associated with higher risks of exacerbation and mortality. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the comprehensive effect of extrapulmonary comorbidities on physical activity in Japanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, of which evidence is lacking. We conducted a cross-sectional study with a series of tests, including lung function, physical activity, symptom scores, and parameters for comorbidities. Sixty outpatients with stable disease were enrolled, and the relationship between the parameters and physical activity was evaluated. Physical activity was assessed over 7 consecutive days using a triaxial accelerometer, which records total daily energy expenditure, step count, and walking time. Cardiovascular status was assessed via echocardiography, and pulmonary artery pressure was estimated using Doppler sonography. As to mental status, depression and anxiety were assessed using the Self-Rating Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Physical activity level was significantly correlated with step count, walking time, body mass index, lean body mass index, lung function, pulmonary artery pressure, depression, anxiety, and serum total cholesterol level. In a median regression model analysis, low lung function, low lean body mass index, depression, and low serum total cholesterol level were independently associated with decreased physical activity level. These findings suggest that physical inactivity is affected by multiple extrapulmonary factors, including skeletal muscle dysfunction, depressive symptoms, and nutritional state, in Japanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
https://openalex.org/W4288051700,"SARS-CoV-2 is one of three recognized coronaviruses (CoVs) that have caused epidemics or pandemics in the 21st century and that likely emerged from animal reservoirs. Differences in nucleotide and protein sequence composition within related β-coronaviruses are often used to better understand CoV evolution, host adaptation, and their emergence as human pathogens. Here we report the comprehensive analysis of amino acid residue changes that have occurred in lineage B β-coronaviruses that show covariance with each other. This analysis revealed patterns of covariance within conserved viral proteins that potentially define conserved interactions within and between core proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 related β-coronaviruses. We identified not only individual pairs but also networks of amino acid residues that exhibited statistically high frequencies of covariance with each other using an independent pair model followed by a tandem model approach. Using 149 different CoV genomes that vary in their relatedness, we identified networks of unique combinations of alleles that can be incrementally traced genome by genome within different phylogenic lineages. Remarkably, covariant residues and their respective regions most abundantly represented are implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and are also enriched in dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4288051831,"Background Post-neonatal mortality is the number of deaths of infants aged 28 days through 11 months and is expressed as post-neonatal deaths per 1000 live births per year. This study aimed to identify the factors that influence post-neonatal death using the 2019 Ethiopia mini demographic and health survey (EMDHS2019). Methods The study included 2126 post neonates born from mothers who had been interviewed about births in the five years before the survey. The survey gathering period was carried out from March 21, 2019, to June 28, 2019. The data were first analyzed with a chi-square test of association, and then relevant factors were evaluated with binary logistic regression models and the results were interpreted using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and confidence interval(CI) of parameters. Results The prevalence of post neonatal death was 16% (95% CI: 15.46, 17.78). The study also showed that not vaccinated post-neonates (AOR = 2.325, 95% CI: 1.784, 3.029), mothers who were not receiving any tetanus injection (AOR = 2.891, 95% CI: 2.254, 3.708), mothers age group 15-24(AOR = 1.836, 95% CI: 1.168, 2.886), Afar (AOR = 2.868, 95% CI: 1.264, 6.506), Somali(AOR = 2.273, 95% CI: 1.029, 5.020), Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region(SNNP) (AOR = 2.619, 95% CI: 1.096, 6.257), 2–4 birth orders (AOR = 1.936, 95% CI: 1.225, 3.060), not attend antenatal care(ANC) visit (AOR = 6.491, 95% CI: 3.928, 10.726), and preceding birth interval less than 24 months (AOR = 1.755, 95% CI: 1.363,2.261) statistically associated with a higher risk of post neonatal death. Although not given anything other than breast milk (AOR = 0.604, 95% CI 0.462, 0.789), urban residents (AOR = 0.545, 95% CI: 0.338, 0.877), single births (AOR = 0.150, 95% CI: 0.096, 0.234), less than 3 children in a family (AOR = 0.665, 95% CI 0.470, 0.939) and the head of the male household (AOR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.270, 0.724) were statistically associated with a lower risk of post-neonatal mortality. Conclusions It is highly suggested that maternal and child health care services (including antenatal care visits, postnatal care visits, and immunization) be strengthened and monitored during the early stages of infancy. Mothers from Somali, Afar, and SNNP regions, as well as multiple births, rural residents, and those giving birth to a child with a birth gap of fewer than 24 months, demand special care."
https://openalex.org/W4288051903,"In this study, we adapted a race-Implicit Association Test (race-IAT) to mouse-tracking (MT) technique to identify the more representative target observed MT-metrics and explore the temporal unfolding of the cognitive conflict emerging during the categorisation task. Participants of Western European descent performed a standard keyboard-response race-IAT (RT-race-IAT) and an MT-race-IAT with the same structure. From a behavioural point of view, our sample showed a typical Congruency Effect, thus a pro-White implicit bias, in the RT-race-IAT. In addition, in the MT-race-IAT, the MT-metrics showed a similar Congruency Effect mirroring the higher attraction of the averaged-trajectories towards the incorrect response button in incongruent than congruent trials. Moreover, these MT-metrics were positively associated with RT-race-IAT scores, strengthening the MT approach's validity in characterising the implicit bias. Furthermore, the distributional analyses showed that mouse trajectories displayed a smooth profile both in congruent and incongruent trials to indicate that the unfolding of the decision process and the raised conflict is guided by dynamical cognitive processing. This latter continuous competition process was studied using a novel phase-based approach which allowed to temporally dissect an Early, a Mid and a Late phase, each of which may differently reflect the decision conflict between automatic and controlled responses in the evolution of the mouse movement towards the target response. Our results show that the MT approach provides an accurate and finer-grained characterisation of the implicit racial attitude than classical RT-IAT. Finally, our novel phase-based approach can be an effective tool to shed light on the implicit conflict processing emerging in a categorisation task with a promising transferable value in different cognitive and neuropsychological fields."

Patients with ENPP1 Deficiency or infant onset ABCC6 Deficiency often present with pathological calcification, narrowed blood vessels, multiorgan dysfunction and high infant mortality. The heterogenous presentation and progression is well documented. Our objective was to characterize how these morbidities lead to burden of illness and poor quality of life across ages from the patient/caregiver perspective. Patients/caregivers were interviewed via phone using Institutional Review Board-approved questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes were collected via validated instruments. Thirty-one caregivers and 7 patients participated: infant onset ABCC6 Deficiency, n = 6 (infants/children); ENPP1 Deficiency, n = 32 (13 infants, 12 children, 7 adults). ENPP1 and ABCC6-deficient children aged <8 years and aged 8-18 years reported poor school functioning (0.69 vs 0.72 effect size, respectively) and poor physical health (0.88 vs 1, respectively). In the total ENPP1 cohort, 72% (23/32) reported bone/joint pain and/or mobility/fatigue issues. Three of seven ENPP1-deficient adults reported moderate to severe pain (>4), as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), that interfered with daily activities despite pain medication. Top reported burdens for caregivers of infants with ABCC6/ENPP1 Deficiencies included heart-related issues and hospitalizations. Treatment/medications, and hearing loss were the highest burdens reported by caregivers/families of the pediatric ENPP1 Deficiency cohort, whereas adults reported bone/joint pain and mobility impairment as the greatest burdens. Individuals with ENPP1 Deficiency or infant onset ABCC6 Deficiency experience lifelong morbidity causing substantial physical and emotional burden to patients/caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W4288052055,"Currently, COVID-19 contributes to mortality and morbidity in developed as well as in developing countries since December 2019. However, there is scarcity of evidence regarding the incidence and predictors of death among patients admitted with COVID-19 in developing country including Ethiopia, where the numbers of deaths are under-reported. Hence, this study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of death among patients admitted with COVID-19 in Wollega University Referral Hospital (WURH), western Ethiopia.An institution based retrospective cohort study design was conducted among 318 patients admitted with COVID-19 in WURH treatment center. Patients who were tested positive for COVID-19 by using rRT-PCR test and admitted with the diagnosis of severe COVID-19 cases from September 30, 2020 to June 10, 2021 were a source population. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 for analysis. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with mortality from COVID-19. Multivariable Cox regression model with 95% CI and Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) was used to identify a significant predictor of mortality from COVID-19 at p-value < 0.05.A total of 318 patients were included in final analysis with mean age of 44 (SD±16.7) years and about two third (67.9%) were males. More than half (55.7%) of patients had no comorbidity on admission. The majority, 259 (81.45%) of patients recovered from COVID-19 and 267 (84%) of patients were censored at the end of follow up. The incidence rate of mortality was 14.1 per/1000 (95%CI: 10.7, 18.5) person days observation. Age ≥ 59 years (AHR: 5.76, 95%CI: 2.58, 12.84), low oxygen saturation (AHR: 2.34, 95% CI: (2.34, 4.17), and delayed presentation (AHR: 5.60, 95%CI: 2.97, 10.56) were independent predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients.The mortality rate of COVID-19 pandemic was high in the study area, and most of death was happened during the first 10 days. Being old age, low oxygen saturation and delayed presentation were factors which predict mortality due to COVID-19. Hence, strengthening the health care delivery system to satisfy the need of the patients should get due attention to reduce the incidence of mortality from COVID-19 cases."

The lifetimes of the units follow Marshall-Olkin Pareto distribution. We observe the posterior predictive density of the non-observed units and construct predictive intervals as well. Furthermore, we provide inference on the unknown parameters of the Marshall-Olkin model, so we observe point and interval estimation by using maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation methods. Bayes estimation methods are obtained under quadratic loss function. EM algorithm is used to obtain numerical values of the Maximum likelihood method and Gibbs and the Monte Carlo Markov chain techniques are utilized for Bayesian calculations. A simulation study is performed to evaluate the performance of the estimators with respect to the mean square errors and the biases. Finally, we find the best prediction method by implementing a real data example under progressive Type-II censoring schemes."
https://openalex.org/W4288052154,"The Salicornia L. has been considered one of the most taxonomically challenging genera due to high morphological plasticity, intergradation between related species, and lack of diagnostic features in preserved herbarium specimens. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), only one species of this genus, Salicornia europaea , has been reported, though investigating its identity at the molecular level has not yet been undertaken. Moreover, based on growth form and morphology variation between the Ras-Al-Khaimah (RAK) population and the Umm-Al-Quwain (UAQ) population, we suspect the presence of different species or morphotypes. The present study aimed to initially perform species identification using multilocus DNA barcode markers from chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA), followed by the genetic divergence between two populations (RAK and UAQ) belonging to two different coastal localities in the UAE. The analysis resulted in high-quality multilocus barcode sequences subjected to species discrimination through the unsupervised OTU picking and supervised learning methods. The ETS sequence data from our study sites had high identity with the previously reported sequences of Salicornia persica using NCBI blast and was further confirmed using OTU picking methods viz., TaxonDNAs Species identifier and Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning (ASAP). Moreover, matK sequence data showed a non-monophyletic relationship, and significant discrimination between the two populations through alignment-based unsupervised OTU picking, alignment-free Co-Phylog, and alignment &amp; alignment-free supervised learning approaches. Other markers viz., rbcL, trnH-psbA, ITS2, and ETS could not distinguish the two populations individually, though their combination with matK (cpDNA &amp; cpDNA+nrDNA) showed enough population discrimination. However, the ITS2+ETS (nrDNA) exhibited much higher genetic divergence, further splitting both the populations into four haplotypes. Based on the observed morphology, genetic divergence, and the number of haplotypes predicted using the matK marker, it can be suggested that two distinct populations (RAK and UAQ) do exist. Further extensive morpho-taxonomic studies are required to determine the inter-population variability of Salicornia in the UAE. Altogether, our results suggest that S . persica is the species that grow in the present study area in UAE, and do not support previous treatments as S . europaea ."
https://openalex.org/W4288052181,"Surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) filler, produced by PRG technology for use with various dental materials, is bioactive and known to release ions from a glass-ionomer phase. We previously reported that coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR), a tight junction associated protein, was located in the epithelial barrier of gingival epithelium. In the present study, the tissue protective effects of an S-PRG eluate prepared with S-PRG filler were investigated using a three-dimensional human gingival epithelial tissue model. The results showed that the S-PRG eluate specifically induced CXADR expression at the transcriptional level of messenger RNA as well as the protein level, and also nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in gingival epithelial cells. Furthermore, shigyakusan, a TFEB inhibitor, canceled induction of the CXADR protein by the S-PRG eluate. Additionally, gingival epithelial permeation by 40-kDa dextran, lipopolysaccharide, and peptidoglycan in the 3D-tissue models was prevented by the eluate, with those effects abrogated by knockdown of CXADR. These findings suggest that S-PRG eluate increases CXADR expression via the TFEB pathway, thus inhibiting penetration of bacterial virulence factors into subepithelial tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4288068257,"Fur is known from contemporary written sources to have been a key commodity in the Viking Age. Nevertheless, the fur trade has been notoriously difficult to study archaeologically as fur rarely survives in the archaeological record. In Denmark, fur finds are rare and fur in clothing has been limited to a few reports and not recorded systematically. We were therefore given access to fur from six Danish high status graves dated to the Viking Age. The fur was analysed by aDNA and palaeoproteomics methods to identify the species of origin in order to explore the Viking Age fur trade. Endogenous aDNA was not recovered, but fur proteins (keratins) were analysed by MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS. We show that Viking Age skin clothing were often composites of several species, showing highly developed manufacturing and material knowledge. For example, fur was produced from wild animals while leather was made of domesticates. Several examples of beaver fur were identified, a species which is not native to Denmark, and therefore indicative of trade. We argue that beaver fur was a luxury commodity, limited to the elite and worn as an easily recognisable indicator of social status."
https://openalex.org/W4288051702,"Temperatures have increased around the globe, affecting many ecosystems, including high-elevation Andean streams where important aquatic insect species coexist. Depending on the magnitude of change, warming could lead to the mortality of sensitive species, and those tolerant to rising water temperatures may exhibit differences in growth rates and development. Taxon-specific optimal temperature ranges for growth determine how high or low temperatures alter an organism's body size. In this study, we observed the effects of different climate change scenarios (following three scenarios of the 2021 IPCC predictions) in two aquatic insect species distributed in high-elevation streams in Ecuador: the mayfly Andesiops peruvianus (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) and the caddisfly Anomalocosmoecus illiesi (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae). We assessed how increased water temperatures affect larval growth rates and mortality during a 10-day microcosm experiment. Our results showed that Andesiops peruvianus was more thermally sensitive than Anomalocosmoecus illiesi. Mortality was higher (more than 50% of the individuals) in mayflies than in caddisflies, which presented mortality below 12% at +2.5°C and +5°C. Mortality in mayflies was related to lower dissolved oxygen levels in increased temperature chambers. Higher temperatures affected body size and dry mass with a faster growth rate of Andesiops peruvianus larvae at experimentally higher temperatures, suggesting an important response of this hemimetabolous species to stream temperatures. For Anomalocosmoecus illiesi, we did not find significant changes in mortality, body size or growth rate in response to temperature changes during our experiment. In situ outcomes of species survival and growth in Andean streams are difficult to predict. Nevertheless, our results suggest that at only +2.5°C, a water temperature increase affected the two insect taxa differentially, leading to a drastic outcome for one species' larvae while selecting for a more tolerant species. Our study suggests that climate change might produce significant mortality and growth rate effects on ectotherm tropical aquatic insects, especially Andean mayflies, which showed higher sensitivity to increased water temperature scenarios."

As anemia is associated with increased risk of perioperative death, diagnosis and treatment of preoperative anemia according to etiology have been recommended.The aim of the present study was to assess if the association between anemia and survival in patients undergoing colorectal surgery was determined by the severity of anemia alone or also by anemia etiology.To determine the prevalence of anemia and etiology, preoperative hematological parameters, C-reactive protein, ferritin and transferrin saturation were retrospectively assessed and correlated with outcome in a cohort of patients undergoing colorectal surgery between 2005 and 2019 at the University Hospital of Innsbruck. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <120 g/L in females and <130 g/L in males. The etiology of anemia was classified on the basis of serum iron parameters, as iron deficiency anemia, anemia of inflammation or other anemia etiologies.Preoperative anemia was present in 54% (1316/2458) of all patients. Anemia was associated with iron deficiency in 45% (134/299) and classified as anemia of inflammation in 32% (97/299) of patients with available serum iron parameters. The etiology of anemia was a strong and independent predictor of survival, where iron deficiency and anemia of inflammation were associated with better postoperative survival than other anemia etiologies. One year survival rates were 84.3%, 77.3% and 69.1% for patients with iron deficiency anemia, anemia of inflammation and other anemia types. Inflammation indicated by high C-reactive protein is a strong negative predictor of overall survival.Anemia has a high prevalence among patients undergoing colorectal surgery and rational treatment requires early assessment of serum iron parameters and C-reactive protein."
https://openalex.org/W4288051811,"Bone fracture is an extremely dangerous health risk to human. Actually, cortical bone is often subjected to the complicated loading patterns. The mechanical properties and deformation mechanism under the complicated loading pattern could provide a more precise understanding for the bone fracture. For this purpose, the mechanical response and multi-scale deformation mechanism of cortical bone material were investigated by in-situ experimental research using the compression-torsion coupling loads as an example. It was found that the torsion strength and shear modulus all decreased under the compression-torsion coupling loads than single torsion load. This indicated bone would suffer greater risk of fracture under the compression-torsion coupling loads. Based on in-situ observation, it was found that the rapid reduction of the anisotropy of bone material under the compression load was the potential influencing factor. Because of the redistribution of the principal strain and the variations of cracks propagation, the comprehensive fracture pattern containing both transverse and longitudinal fracture was shown under the coupling loads, and finally resulted in the reduction of the torsion properties. This research could provide new references for researches on mechanical properties of cortical bone material under complicated loading patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4288051845,"Background We developed a composite index–hospital preparedness index (HOSPI)–to gauge preparedness of hospitals in India to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We developed and validated a comprehensive survey questionnaire containing 63 questions, out of which 16 critical items were identified and classified under 5 domains: staff preparedness, effects of COVID-19, protective gears, infrastructure, and future planning. Hospitals empaneled under Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) were invited to the survey. The responses were analyzed using weighted negative log likelihood scores for the options. The preparedness of hospitals was ranked after averaging the scores state-wise and district-wise in select states. HOSPI scores for states were classified using K-means clustering. Findings Out of 20,202 hospitals empaneled in ABY included in the study, a total of 954 hospitals responded to the questionnaire by July 2020. Domains 1, 2, and 4 contributed the most to the index. The overall preparedness was identified as the best in Goa, and 12 states/ UTs had scores above the national average score. Among the states which experienced high COVID-19 cases during the first pandemic wave, we identified a cluster of states with high HOSPI scores indicating better preparedness (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh), and a cluster with low HOSPI scores indicating poor preparedness (Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Uttarakhand). Interpretation Using this index, it is possible to identify areas for targeted improvement of hospital and staff preparedness to deal with the COVID-19 crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4288051847,"Mislocalised membrane proteins (MLPs) present a risk to the cell due to exposed hydrophobic amino acids which cause MLPs to aggregate. Previous studies identified SGTA as a key component of the machinery that regulates the quality control of MLPs. Overexpression of SGTA promotes deubiqutination of MLPs resulting in their accumulation in cytosolic inclusions, suggesting SGTA acts in collaboration with deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) to exert these effects. However, the DUBs that play a role in this process have not been identified. In this study we have identified the ubiquitin specific peptidase 5 (USP5) as a DUB important in regulating the quality control of MLPs. We show that USP5 is in complex with SGTA, and this association is increased in the presence of an MLP. Overexpression of SGTA results in an increase in steady-state levels of MLPs suggesting a delay in proteasomal degradation of substrates. However, our results show that this effect is strongly dependent on the presence of USP5. We find that in the absence of USP5, the ability of SGTA to increase the steady state levels of MLPs is compromised. Moreover, knockdown of USP5 results in a reduction in the steady state levels of MLPs, while overexpression of USP5 increases the steady state levels. Our findings suggest that the interaction of SGTA with USP5 enables specific MLPs to escape proteasomal degradation allowing selective modulation of MLP quality control. These findings progress our understanding of aggregate formation, a hallmark in a range of neurodegenerative diseases and type II diabetes, as well as physiological processes of aggregate clearance."
https://openalex.org/W4288051878,"This study explores the difference in child emotion regulation (ER) and parenting between a heterogeneous clinical sample (ClinS) and a community sample (ComS). We hypothesized that parents of the ClinS would report more dysfunctional child ER and more dysfunctional parenting regarding the child's negative emotions than parents of the ComS. Further, we aimed to predict child ER by parenting behavior, parents' ER, and mental health. Parents of children and adolescents (aged 6-18 years) seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic were compared to a matched sample of parents in a ComS (n = 57 each group). As predicted, the children in the clinical group were reported to use less reappraisal and more suppression than ComS children. No difference was found in dysfunctional emotion parenting between the groups. Reappraisal in parents and supportive reactions to negative emotions predicted reappraisal in children. No predictor was found for child suppression. Child emotion regulation and parents' psychopathology were not associated. These results could suggest new elements for prevention and intervention programs with parents concerning their own emotion regulation and their reaction to negative emotions in children."

Using the baseline data of the MULTIPAP study (n = 593), an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out that analyzed the sex differences in the social support perceived by polymedicated adults aged 65 to 74 years with multimorbidity. The main outcome variable was social support measured through the Duke–UNC-11 Functional Social Support (DUFSS) questionnaire in its two dimensions (confident support and affective support). For both sexes, the perception of functional social support was correlated with being married or partnered and having a higher health-related quality of life utility index. In women, it was correlated with a higher level of education, living alone, and treatment adherence, and in men with higher monthly income, prescribed drugs and fewer diagnosed diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4288051962,"Counting is not always a simple exercise. Specimens can be misidentified or not detected when they are present, giving rise to unidentified sources of error. Deer pellet group counts are a common method to monitor abundance, density, and population trend. Yet, detection errors and observer bias could introduce error into sometimes very large (spatially, temporally) datasets. For example, in Scandinavia, moose ( Alces alces ) pellet group counts are conducted by volunteer hunters and students, but it is unknown how much uncertainty observer error introduces into these datasets. Our objectives were to 1) estimate the detection probability of moose pellet groups; 2) identify the primary variables leading to detection errors including prior observer experience; and 3) compare density estimates using single and double observer counts. We selected a subset of single observer plots from a long-term monitoring project to be conducted as dependent double observer surveys, where primary and secondary observers worked simultaneously in the field. We did this to quantify detection errors for moose pellet groups, which were previously unknown in Scandinavia, and to identify covariates which introduced variation into our estimates. Our study area was in the boreal forests of southern Norway where we had a nested grid of 100-m 2 plots that we surveyed each spring. Our observers were primarily inexperienced. We found that when pellet groups were detected by the primary observer, the secondary observer saw additional pellet groups 42% of the time. We found search time was the primary covariate influencing detection. We also found density estimates from double observer counts were 1.4 times higher than single observer counts, for the same plots. This density underestimation from single observer surveys could have consequences to managers, who sometimes use pellet counts to set harvest quotas. We recommend specific steps to improve future moose pellet counts."

Their motives are not well understood. We aimed to 1) identify and describe potential anchor businesses, 2) determine their motivations to contribute to community development, and 3) highlight motivations behind health-related initiatives.We identified a national sample of potential anchor businesses, grouped by those that contributed to 1) both health-related and non-health initiatives, 2) non-health initiatives only, and 3) those without substantial contributions. We conducted an environmental scan, semi-structured qualitative interviews and directed content analysis through rapid review methodology.We identified 4,512 potential anchor businesses nationally. Among the 108 of these included in the environmental scan, 48% substantially contributed to community development (12% in health). Interviewees' company philosophies ranged from the idea that economic well-being of the company and community were intertwined, to the idea that commercial success of the company would benefit the community. Motivations for contributions included improving the hiring pool, improved recruitment and retention, and goodwill. Other common sentiments included strategies to focus on core business strengths to address community needs and a desire that companies should not compete in their giving activities. Further, some participants believed health care companies should be investing in health-related initiatives.The generosity of potential anchor businesses' local contributions may be determined by company philosophy about its relationship with the community. Stakeholders interested in spurring contributions to local communities might consider messaging to leverage businesses' core strengths and encourage cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W4288052096,"Many species of plants have evolved structures called phytotelmata that store water and trap detritus and prey. These structures house diverse communities of organisms, the inquiline microbiome, that aids breakdown of litter and prey. The invertebrate and bacterial food webs in these systems are well characterized, but less is known about microbial eukaryotic community dynamics. In this study we focus on microbes in the SAR clade (Stramenopila, Alveolata, Rhizaria) inhabiting phytotelmata. Using small subunit rDNA amplicon sequencing from repeated temporal and geographic samples of wild and cultivated plants across the Northeast U.S.A., we demonstrate that communities are variable within and between host plant type. Across habitats, communities from tropical bromeliads grown in a single room of a greenhouse were nearly as heterogeneous as wild pitcher plants spread across hundreds of kilometers. At the scale of pitcher plants in a single bog, analyses of samples from three time points suggest that seasonality is a major driver of protist community structure, with variable spring communities transitioning to more homogeneous communities that resemble the surrounding habitat. Our results indicate that protist communities in phytotelmata are variable, likely due to stochastic founder events and colonization/competition dynamics, leading to tremendous heterogeneity in inquiline microeukaryotic communities."
https://openalex.org/W4288052124,"Nowadays there are many types of glass fiber reinforced polymer(GFRP) composite beam and column joints, such as standard connection, bolted through connection, angle steel connection, tube connection and so on, most of which connected by high-strength bolts with round holes. In this paper, monotonic loading tests on GFRPcomposite beam and column joints connected by slotted-hole bolts were conducted. To compare the performance of different joints, two groups of specimens were used in this study; one of group was the beam-column joints connected by the angle steel, and other group was connected by the tube connection. Specimens with different bolt holes, side plate reinforcement condition, and different bolt pre-tightening forces were studied. Failure modes, bending moment curves, plastic rotation, and yield stiffness of the two groups of joints were compared. Results showed thatthe ultimate bending moment bearing capacity of specimens with side plates could be increased by 30%. Under the same conditions, the bearing capacity of the tube joints was about 10% larger than that of the angle steel joints. Although the bearing capacity of joints was not increased by using slotted holes, plastic rotation capacity and yield stiffness of joints with slotted-hole bolts were 1.1 times than that of the ordinary round-hole bolts joints."

Different treatments included: control (C) without enzyme supplement, while the other three groups included enzyme mixture T1 and T2 with two commercially available enzyme mix, and T3 with indigenously produced multi-enzyme complex from Bacillus subtilis KT004404. Birds that were fed with indigenously produced multi-enzyme complex showed significant weight gain as compared to other groups. The total feed intake of the birds fed with enzyme supplements was higher than the birds in the control group. The feed conversion ratio was significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05) in treatment groups (T1, T2, T3) as compared to the control. The blood parameters which were analyzed included uric acid, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and serum proteins i.e. globulin and albumin. Birds fed with the enzyme in the group T1, T2 and T3 exhibited higher (p &lt; 0.05) body weight gain. Tibia ash content was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in T1, T2, and T3 as compared to the control. The results of the current study indicate that supplementing poultry feed with the exogenous multi-enzyme produced from Bacillus subtilis KT004404 improved the growth of the birds, feed utilization, and exhibited beneficial effects on the blood parameters, phosphorous and nitrogen retention in broiler chicken."
https://openalex.org/W4288052157,"Intelligentization-oriented development is a fast-developing trend of technological revolution. It promotes the reconstruction of the industrial system of a region and affects its overall industrial competitiveness. This paper sets up a variety of models featuring intelligentization level and multi-dimensional industrial competitiveness, and collects data of 28 provinces and cities in China from 2003 to 2017 to test the influence of industrial intelligentization level on the industrial competitiveness of a region. The result reveals that: 1) In China's provincial jurisdictions, the higher the level of intelligentization is, the lower the overall level of industrial competitiveness and the lower the proportion of industry in the economic system will be. In regions where the facilities are highly intelligentialized, the production sectors tend to move to the less developed regions, and the growth effect of technological dividends is the focus. 2) Compared with the middle region and the Western region of China, the Eastern region, which is more developed with higher intelligentization level, has stronger ability in the research and development (R&D) of technologies, and the economic structure of the industry there tends to be stable, manifesting a strong growth potential."
https://openalex.org/W4288066860,"Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are essential for environmental dynamics, especially in terms of climate variations. However, several anthropic factors have threatened the integrity of TDFs, and consequently the surface temperature (ST), which is a proxy variable for several environmental processes in TDFs. So, understanding their behavior is crucial. The objective was to analyze the behavior of surface temperature owing to conversion of TDFs into anthropic uses in northern Minas Gerais between 2007 and 2016. In 9 years, dry forests decreased by 22.9%, with pastures as the central driver (counted 93% of change). Between 2007 and 2016, there was an increase in ST by 1.55 K ± 1.15 K. When TDFs were converted to pastureland, the increase in ST was 2.21 K ± 1.39 K and for crops by 0.57 K ± 1.24 K. The remaining TDFs (2016) had an increase in their thermal average of 1.41 K ± 1.02 K. This analysis is essential for the adoption of conservation actions for the maintenance of ecological corridors in TDFs, considering their importance in the ecosystem context."
https://openalex.org/W4288067454,"Resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal acquired through functional magnetic resonance imaging is a proxy of neural activity and a key mechanism for assessing neurological conditions. Therefore, practical tools to filter out artefacts that can compromise the assessment are required. On the one hand, a variety of tailored methods to preprocess the data to deal with identified sources of noise (e.g., head motion, heart beating, and breathing, just to mention a few) are in place. But, on the other hand, there might be unknown sources of unstructured noise present in the data. Therefore, to mitigate the effects of such unstructured noises, we propose a model-based filter that explores the statistical properties of the underlying signal (i.e., long-term memory). Specifically, we consider autoregressive fractional integrative process filters. Remarkably, we provide evidence that such processes can model the signals at different regions of interest to attain stationarity. Furthermore, we use a principled analysis where a ground-truth signal with statistical properties similar to the BOLD signal under the injection of noise is retrieved using the proposed filters. Next, we considered preprocessed (i.e., the identified sources of noise removed) resting-state BOLD data of 98 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. Our results demonstrate that the proposed filters decrease the power in the higher frequencies. However, unlike the low-pass filters, the proposed filters do not remove all high-frequency information, instead they preserve process-related higher frequency information. Additionally, we considered four different metrics (power spectrum, functional connectivity using the Pearson’s correlation, coherence, and eigenbrains) to infer the impact of such filter. We provided evidence that whereas the first three keep most of the features of interest from a neuroscience perspective unchanged, the latter exhibits some variations that could be due to the sporadic activity filtered out."
