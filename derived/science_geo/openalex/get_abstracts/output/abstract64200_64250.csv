https://openalex.org/W2017646214,Preparations of secretory iminunoglobuilin A (S-IgA) isolated from human parotid fluid specifically inhibited the adherence of Streptococcus strains to epithelial cells. Since bacterial adherence is a prerequisite for colonization of mucous surfaces. S-IgA-mediated inhibition of adherence would limit bacterial colonization. This mechanism can explain how secretory immunoglobulins function in the disposal of bacterial antigens.

This effect, which is one of the more rapid physiological changes known to occur in the activity of any enzyme that metabolizes biogenic amines, appears to explain the rapid increase in the concentration of pineal serotonin that is caused by light exposure at night."

No consideration is given to possible subtle consequences. Offspring from mice exposed to methylmercury on day 7 or 9 of pregnancy were apparently unaffected during postnatal development.

Brain weight, protein, choline acetyltransferase, and cholinesterase were not significantly altered."
https://openalex.org/W2057370241,"The petals of the black-eyed susan (Compositae: Rudbeckia hirta) contain three flavonol glucosides (6,7-dimethoxy-3',4',5-trihydroxyflavone-3-O-glucoside, patulitrin, and quercetagetin). These compounds, which show intense spectral absorption at 340 to 380 nanometers, are restricted in distribution to the petal bases, which are ultraviolet absorbing as a result. Such ultraviolet-absorbing petal zones, known as ""nectar guides,"" are invisible to us, but are visible and of orientation value to the pollinating insect that lands on the flower in search for food. This is the first time that ultraviolet absorption in a nectar guide has been interpreted in chemical terms. In view of the widespread occurrence of flavonols in flowers, it is suggested that these pigments serve specifically for demarcation of ultraviolet petal patterns visible and relevant to insects."

https://openalex.org/W1526424989,"Abstract Organelles in spinach leaves were isolated in sucrose gradients by isopycnic centrifugation. The peroxisomal fraction was the only cellular site for two different and irreversible aminotransferases which utilized glyoxylate as the amino acceptor in the formation of glycine. These were a serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase with a specific activity of 1.54 µmoles x min-1 x mg-1 peroxisomal protein and a glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase with a specific activity of 2.4. Both enzymes also catalyzed an alanine:glyoxylate reaction, and the serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase catalyzed a serine:pyruvate reaction. These activities of the peroxisomal serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase coincided in fractions isolated on ion exchange or isoelectric focusing columns. For serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction the Km (glyoxylate) was 0.15 mm, the Km (pyruvate) was 2.82 mm, and the Km (serine) was 2.72 mm. The pH optimum was about 7. This enzyme was inhibited by d-serine, and phosphate buffer at 70 mm inhibited it 80%. Aspartate:α-ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity was located in peroxisomes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. By ion exchange chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis these were separated into three isoenzymes. Isoenzyme 1 was by far the most active, and it was the only form in mitochondria and chloroplasts. The combined specific activity of the peroxisomal aspartate aminotransferases was a low 0.15 µmole x min-1 x mg-1 protein. Isoenzyme 1 represented about half of this activity in the peroxisomes, and the peroxisomes contained in addition small amounts of Isoenzymes 2 and 3. The metabolic sequence for glycolate metabolism in leaves was modified to include the three different peroxisomal aminotransferases for glutamate:glyoxylate, serine:glyoxylate, and aspartate:α-ketoglutarate."

Diminished insulin-like responses to spermine and reduced rates of glucose oxidation are also evident in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W1506092238,"Abstract The δ-lactone derived from tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose (TACL) has been prepared by oxidation of tetra-N-acetyl-chitotetraose with iodine. The binding of TACL to lysozyme has been investigated by its inhibition of the lysozymecatalyzed lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells and by its perturbation of the tryptophyl fluorescence spectrum of lysozyme. At pH 6.2 the concentration of TACL that is required for 50% inhibition of the rate of lysis is 0.7 µm, which is 1/110 of the concentration of the unmodified tetrasaccharide that is required for such inhibition. The association constants for the binding of TACL to lysozyme over the pH range from 2 to 8 were obtained by fluorescence measurements. Their pH dependence shows that TACL binds most strongly to the species of lysozyme in which the carboxyl group of glutamate 35 is dissociated. In agreement with this result, the fluorescence-pH profile of the TACL-lysozyme complex indicates that the pK of glutamate 35 is about 4.7 in the complex, whereas the pK of glutamate 35 in the enzyme alone is about 6.0. The value of the association constant for the binding of TACL at pH 5.0 and 25° is 3.3 x 106 m-1, which is 32 times larger than that for the binding of the unmodified tetrasaccharide under the same conditions. On the basis of these results and of the similarity between the known conformation of the lactone ring and the proposed conformation of the transition state for lysozyme-catalyzed reactions (both half-chair ones), we conclude that TACL is a transition state analog for lysozyme. Furthermore, with these results we can estimate that the affinity of Subsite D of lysozyme for the half-chair conformation of the pyranose ring of N-acetylglucosamine is greater by a factor of 6 x 103 than its affinity for the chair conformation and thus contributes this factor to catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1510839354,"Abstract Circular dichroic measurements in peptide aromatic and visible absorption regions have been combined with fluorescence and sedimentation data to characterize the effects of heme binding to apocytochrome b5 upon the secondary and tertiary structure and the environment of the aromatic amino acid residues. At pH 7.5 heme binding causes a slight tightening of the tertiary structure and may increase the amount of ordered secondary structure. The environment of the buried tryptophan residue, which lies outside of the heme crevice, is also apparently unaltered in the apoprotein. This stable form of the apoprotein appears to retain the essential features of the tertiary structure required for heme binding and contrasts markedly with unfolded peptide species produced during reversible denaturation by nonpolar solvents."

https://openalex.org/W1595065447,"When the transport of Ca++ and other bivalent cations was arrested in the filamentous coenocytic fungus Achlya the transport of amino acids and assimilation of these precursors into proteins was promptly terminated. Uptake of thymidine but not of uracil was inhibited. However, both DNA and RNA syntheses continued under these conditions of cation starvation. The addition of Ca++ to Ca++-deficient cells enhanced amino acid transport by about 100%. Ca++ uptake was continuous throughout the growth phase of the organism and when this uptake was terminated, growth ceased immediately. Ca++ may be required for incorporation into cell wall and membrane material possibly to maintain their functional and structural integrity. The requirement for Ca++ in growth is specific and neither Mn++, Mg++, Co++, nor Fe++ could substitute. Ba++ acted as a competitive inhibitor of Ca++. Whether Ca++ alone is required for amino acid transport is not clear and has proved difficult to resolve. Over 50% of the Ca++ taken up by cells during growth could not be removed by metabolic poisons such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), azide, or cycloheximide, by chelators, or by simple exchange after growth was inhibited. The chelators (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N ,N′-tetraacetic acid) and di- and tricarboxylic acids were not transported into the cells either in acid or alkaline buffers. The cells probably lack transporters necessary to effect this transfer. Dicarboxylic amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, on the other hand, were transported slowly in acid pH buffers whereas at neutral pH they were transported more effectively but still less efficiently than the monocarboxylic amino acids. Metabolic poisons, azide, DNP, and Hg++ inhibited the transport of amino acids, thymidine, uracil, and Ca++. Cycloheximide, on the other hand, did not inhibit the transport of amino acids, Ca++, uracil, and thymidine. We propose that the effect of calcium in Achlya metabolism is pleiotropic. Ca++ may be involved in (a) maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane; (b) transport of amino acids although it is possible that other cations play a role as well; and (c) regulating protein biosynthesis by mediating transport of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1992429882,Two lateral nasal glands appear to provide a large part of the water for evaporative cooling in the panting dog; their function is analogous to that of sweat glands in man. Each gland drains through a single duct which opens about 2 centimeters inside the opening of the nostril. This location may be essential to avoid desiccation of the nasal mucosa during thermal panting. The rate of secretion from one gland increased from 0 to an average of 9.6 g (gland . hour)(-1) as air temperature was increased from 10 degrees to 50 degrees C. Evaporation of the fluid from the paired glands could account for between 19 and 36 percent of the increase in respiratory evaporation associated with thermal panting. The fluid secreted by the gland was hypoosmotic to plasma.

By means of chemical and enzymatic treatment, it is possible to remove quantitatively and selectively the carboxyl terminal octapeptide from porcine insulin B chain. This fragment can be replaced by an analogous synthetic human octapeptide to give a protein which is identical to human insulin by a number of criteria. By this method, human insulin can be prepared on a large scale simply and inexpensively from porcine insulin.

https://openalex.org/W1676448635,"Bovine heart mitochondria were found to bind large amounts of Cu2+, Cu+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ in a rapid, energy-independent reaction. Binding was more than 80% complete within 15 s (the shortest time tested). To prevent disproportionation of Cu+ to Cu2+ and Cu0, a cuprous-acetonitrile-perchlorate complex was used. Fe3+ was added as the 8-hydroxyquinoline or the citrate derivative. Of Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+, 1.5 to 2.5 µmoles per mg of protein could be bound in the absence of phosphate, while as much as 4 to 6 µmoles per mg of protein were bound in the presence of phosphate. A Cu2+- or Fe2+-dependent Pi uptake was observed with cation to Pi uptake ratios of 1.5 to 1.8, suggestive of the formation of Cu3(PO4)2 or Fe3(PO4)2. Cu+ binding, however, was limited to about 120 nmoles per mg of protein and a Km value of 0.42 m m was obtained. The binding of copper was inhibited by chelating agents. Bound copper was not removed by washing with sucrose, respiratory inhibitors, detergents, or mercurials, but was removed by chelating agents having a strong affinity for copper. Some of the Cu2+ was converted to Cu+ on being bound. Iron, once bound, was essentially attached in an irreversible manner, since it was not removed by various chelating agents and other additives. However, the initial iron binding was sensitive to these additives, which suggests that iron may initially bind in a reversible manner. Cu2+ and Cu+ binding was only slightly inhibited by Ca2+, Sr2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and the inhibition was not increased by adding phosphate or a source of energy. Zn2+, Ag+, and especially Hg2+, were more potent inhibitors of copper-binding than the above cations. There was no inhibition by monovalent cations. No competition was observed between copper and iron. In fact, copper was slightly stimulatory to the binding of iron, while iron was slightly stimulatory to the binding of copper. Thus, copper and iron do not bind to the same locus. The binding of Fe3+ was insensitive to Ca2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, or K+ in the presence or absence of Pi, or in the presence of an energy source. The binding of Fe2+ was inhibited by the monovalent cations Li+, Na+, and K+. Divalent cations, such as Mn2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Mg2+ were about 25 to 40% inhibitory toward Fe2+ binding at concentrations twice that of Fe2+. Zn2+ and Hg2+ were more potent inhibitors of Fe2+ binding (70 to 80% inhibition) than the other divalent cations. It is concluded that Cu+ and Cu2+ may bind to the sites implicated by others as binding Hg2+ and Zn2+. Fe2+ and Fe3+ bind to sites that are different than the sites which bind Cu+ and Cu2+ and the sites which bind Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1489214898,"Abstract Experiments were performed in which protein turnover was measured by incorporation of 18O from H218O into protein. Since proteolysis causes the incorporation of 18O into the carboxyl group of amino acids and the incorporation of this amino acid leads to protein with the peptide carboxyl oxygen labeled, turnover can be determined quantitatively. The rate of protein turnover during the first 5 hours after growth was found to be about 22% per hour. Spores contain an amount of 18O that allows the suggestion that the average protein turns over two or more times during sporulation. To examine the possibility of oxygen exchange during protein synthesis, Bacillus licheniformis cells were grown through eight generations, a 200-fold increase in mass, on a medium of glucose plus a mixture of amino acids that were labeled with 18O in the carboxyl groups. The protein of the cells contained oxygen, after appropriate corrections, at an atom per cent excess similar to that of the added amino acids. It is concluded that neither amino acid transport nor protein synthesis involve mechanisms that lead to significant loss or exchange of amino acid carboxyl oxygens."
https://openalex.org/W1528740390,"Abstract The effects of proteolytic and phospholipase A2 digestion on the transport of d-glucose by intact human erythrocytes and on the uptake of d-glucose by isolated erythrocyte membranes have been studied. This stereospecific uptake of d-glucose was previously shown to be compatible with the over-all monosaccharide transport system in erythrocytes and evidence was presented that it represented the binding of d-glucose to a specific site on the erythrocyte membrane (Kahlenberg, A., Urman, B., and Dolansky, D. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 3154–3162. In the absence of hemolysis, no change is observed in the transport of d-glucose by intact erythrocytes exposed to the above enzymes or in the uptake of d-glucose by membranes isolated from enzyme-treated cells. In contrast, limited proteolytic digestion of isolated erythrocyte membranes, under conditions identical with those for the digestion of intact cells, results in a 3- to 5-fold increase in d-glucose uptake and a 2-fold increase in the apparent dissociation constant for the d-glucose-membrane complex. This increase in the uptake of d-glucose is different from the effects which result from the digestion of isolated membranes with phospholipase A2 (decreased uptake of d-glucose) or neuraminidase (no change in d-glucose uptake). More drastic tryptic digestion leads to a loss of the stimulated d-glucose uptake with no further change in the affinity of the membrane for the sugar. Pronase hydrolysis of 20 to 30% of the proteins of isolated membranes results in the destruction of 50 to 70% of the d-glucose uptake. These results indicate that the transport system in erythrocytes involves membrane components not normally accessible to proteolytic and phospholipase A2 digestion. Isolation of the erythrocyte membrane renders the d-glucose uptake activity of these membrane components susceptible to enzymatic modification. The evidence suggests that the increase in maximum d-glucose uptake resulting from limited proteolytic digestion of isolated membranes represents exposure of latent d-glucose binding sites which are masked by a protease-sensitive covering on the surface of the isolated membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1488870267,"Abstract The reactivities of the tyrosyl residues of calf and rabbit cytochrome b5 have been examined by acylation, iodination, and titration of the proteins. These experiments distinguish residues 6 and 7 as the most exposed and reactive residues, which ionize normally and can be acetylated or iodinated to form the monoiodo or diiodo derivatives. Tyrosine 30, which is common to both cytochrome preparations and buried in a nonpolar environment according to x-ray data, is iodinated more slowly without affecting the heme binding. However, this latter iodination does produce a structural change reflected in a less stable protein conformation. The calf liver heme protein contains a fourth tyrosyl residue at position 27 in a nonpolar peptide sequence of nine amino acids which can be isolated as a tryptic peptide. This residue, either in the intact protein or the isolated peptide fragment, is extremely unreactive and can be iodinated or ionized only in concentrated urea solutions."

https://openalex.org/W1638116108,"Abstract A cell-free protein-synthesizing system from rainbow trout liver can initiate de novo synthesis in the presence of exogenous messenger RNA if the system is previously incubated for 60 min. Polyuridylic acid and polyguanylic uridylic acid can be used as synthetic messenger RNA to test for the ability of the system to reinitiate synthesis. Low molecular weight RNA isolated from protamine stage testis microsomes actively stimulates the incorporation of [14C]arginine and [35S]methionine into acid-insoluble material. Starch gel and polyacrylamide gel fractionation show that both isotopes are incorporated in vitro into protamine and histone. The protamine product was characterized by separately incorporating [14C]arginine, [14C]proline, and [14C]serine into in vitro synthesized material and carrying out ten sequential Edman degradations. The order of appearance of labeled amino acids during this process was consistent with the known sequence of rainbow trout protamine. Most of the in vitro [35S]methionine incorporation into protamine was found to be NH2-terminal. Electrophoresis of a tryptic digest of this material showed that methionine occurred in a basic peptide with the same mobility as that previously found (Wigle, D. T., and Dixon, G. H. (1970) Nature 227, 676) with in vivo methionine-labeled protamine. Methionine appears to be involved both in the in vitro and in vivo initiation of protamine synthesis. A substantial proportion (45%) of the [35S]methionine incorporated into histone was also found to be NH2-terminal."

https://openalex.org/W1567197204,"Abstract The time course of formation of the thyroid iodoprotein 19 S and its subunits (6 S, 7 S, and 12 S) has been studied after intravenous administration of [3H]leucine to normal rats and guinea pigs and after in vitro incorporation in thyroid hemilobes. The uptake of the [3H]leucine by the rat gland in vivo paralleled the disappearance of the radioactivity from the plasma (30 min): the amino acid was rapidly bound to a particulate fraction and was more slowly incorporated into proteins having solubility properties similar to that of thyroglobulin. Sucrose gradient analysis of the newly formed thyroglobulin-like labeled proteins showed the presence of a significant proportion of thyroglobulin and of its half-sized, 12 S subunit even at the earliest labeling interval (10 min). These data suggest that the assembly of the polypeptide chains of thyroglobulin occurs before the newly formed molecules are released from the intracellular membranes. The 6 S and 7 S labeled intermediates appear to be related to newly formed, unstable thyroglobulin molecules, the equilibrium between these units and the fully assembled molecules being shifted toward the latter with increasing labeling times. A similar pattern was observed after pulse labeling guinea pigs in vivo. In this species, however, there is a larger proportion of 12 S subunits derived from dissociation of newly formed and consequently poorly iodinated thyroglobulin molecules. Both in rats and guinea pigs, the sedimentation rate of newly formed thyroglobulin increased progressively from 14 to 19 S with the labeling time. After labeling thyroid hemilobes in vitro, the disappearance of the labeled intermediates 6 S, 7 S, and 12 S was both delayed and incomplete. It appears that the time-dependent disappearance of the labeled subunits 6 S, 7 S, 12 S, and of the unfolded 14 to 17 S species (prethyroglobulin) is related to later chemical modifications which increase the stability of the newly formed thyroglobulin molecules toward dissociation and unfolding. These later modifications include iodination and its oxidative side effects (oxidation of —SH to —S—S—) and addition of the carbohydrate moiety."

Cells incubated with [3H]puromycin produced radioactive materials which were precipitated with a serum specific for immunoglobulin G. Furthermore, reduced and alkylated [3H]puromycin-labeled immunoglobulins were smaller than heavy chains as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Incomplete heavy chains were synthesized as well as secreted into the extracellular medium by lymph node cells incubated in the presence of puromycin."
