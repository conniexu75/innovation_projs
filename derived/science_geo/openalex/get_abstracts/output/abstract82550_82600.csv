https://openalex.org/W2089850443,"Cyclophilin, a specific cytosolic binding protein responsible for the concentration of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A by lymphoid cells, was purified to homogeneity from bovine thymocytes. Cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography resolved a major and minor cyclophilin species that bind cyclosporin A with a dissociation constant of about 2 X 10(-7) moles per liter and specific activities of 77 and 67 micrograms per milligram of protein, respectively. Both cyclophilin species have an apparent molecular weight of 15,000, an isoelectric point of 9.6, and nearly identical amino acid compositions. A portion of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the major species was determined. The cyclosporin A-binding activity of cyclophilin is sulfhydryl dependent, unstable at 56 degrees C and at pH 4 or 9.5, and sensitive to trypsin but not to chymotrypsin digestion. Cyclophilin specifically binds a series of cyclosporin analogs in proportion to their activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Isolation of cyclophilin from the cytosol of thymocytes suggests that the immunosuppressive activity of cyclosporin A is mediated by an intracellular mechanism, not by a membrane-associated mechanism."

The incidence of breaks was enhanced by caffeine, a substance that inhibits DNA repair in replicating cells. The locations of 20 sites were correlated with breakpoints that have been related to human malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W1519338212,"Angiotensin II (AII) regulates the secretion of aldosterone from adrenal glomerulosa cells by a calcium-dependent mechanism which involves both the uptake of calcium from the extracellular pool, and the release of calcium from a dantrolene-sensitive intracellular pool. In the present study, it was shown that AII induces the rapid (10 s) hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and -4,5-bisphosphate, leading to the sustained production of inositol bis- and trisphosphate (Ins-P3), and diacylglycerol rich in arachidonic acid. Saponin-permeabilized glomerulosa cells accumulate calcium into a nonmitochondrial pool by an ATP-dependent manner. Ins-P3 (0.5-5 microM) induces a release of Ca2+ from this pool. This release was blocked by dantrolene (10 microM). Adrenal glomerulosa cells were shown to contain the calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (C-kinase). Perfusion of glomerulosa cells with combined 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and A23187 induced an immediately developing, sustained, maximal secretory response similar to that induced by AII. These data are interpreted in terms of a model in which, after AII addition, there is a flow of information through two separate branches of the calcium messenger system, each with its unique temporal role: a calmodulin branch activated by the transient rise in the [Ca2+] in the cell cytosol, which is largely responsible for the initial transient cellular response; and a C-kinase branch activated by the increase in both cytosolic [Ca2+] and the diacylglycerol content of the plasma membrane, which is largely responsible for the sustained phase of the cellular response. The temporal integration of these two phases underlies the observed pattern of cellular response."
https://openalex.org/W1491117599,"Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a] from the plasma of normolipidemic human donors was isolated by rate zonal and isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation. The final preparations usually contained varying amounts of isopycnic low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which were totally removed either by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography or by chromatofocusing. The Lp(a) preparations exhibited both inter- and intraindividual density heterogeneity which was accounted for by the differences in their protein and lipid composition. In addition, there was heterogeneity in the size of apoprotein (a) (apo(a] which was found to be linked to apoprotein B (apo-B) through disulfide bonds. Three different apo(a) species were obtained; they had a size either smaller, equal to, or larger than apo-B-100, the protein moiety of LDL. The apo(a) that was smaller than apo-B resided in a low-density Lp(a) particle whose peak was in the 1.019-1.063 g/ml density range. The larger apo(a) was a component of the dense Lp(a) particle and was responsible for the increased density in this Lp(a) species. The third apo(a) which was equivalent in size to apo-B resided in a density range intermediate between the other two Lp(a)s. It is concluded that Lp(a) may differ not only from one individual to another, but also within the same individual who may have more than one Lp(a) species. Part of this heterogeneity may be accounted for by differences in the (a) polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1528398382,"An affinity column, prepared by immobilizing phosphatidylserine and cholesterol in polyacrylamide, was utilized in the purification of protein kinase C. Protein kinase activity and phorbol ester binding were monitored by assaying Ca2+ plus phosphatidylserine-dependent phosphorylation of histone H1 and [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding, respectively. Both activities were present in a cytosolic extract of rabbit renal cortex, eluted together from a DEAE-cellulose column, bound to the affinity column in the presence of Ca2+, and eluted symmetrically upon application of EGTA. Recovery from the affinity column was high (30-50%) and resulted in as much as a 6000-7700-fold purification, depending on the region of the DEAE-cellulose peak that was applied. Following affinity column purification, protein kinase and phorbol ester binding activity eluted symmetrically upon gel filtration, with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa. A protein of the same size was present in silver-stained gels following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of affinity column purified samples from the DEAE-cellulose peak. From 2-4 other, smaller proteins were also present, their number and relative amounts depending on the region of the DEAE-cellulose peak used. These data indicate that Ca2+-dependent/binding to a polyacrylamide-immobilized phospholipid provides a useful technique for purification of protein kinase C as well as other, unidentified proteins exhibiting a Ca2+ plus phospholipid-dependent interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1997428826,"New active sites can be introduced into naturally occurring enzymes by the chemical modification of specific amino acid residues with the use of appropriately designed coenzyme analogs. The resultant semisynthetic enzymes can have catalytic activities very different from those of the corresponding native enzymes. For example, papain has been converted into a highly effective oxidoreductase by covalent modification of the sulfhydryl group of the active site cysteine residue (Cys25) with flavins such as 8-bromoacetyl-10-methylisoalloxazine. Thus, it is now possible to enhance the catalytic versatility of existing enzymes through the process of ""chemical mutation"" of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1556163437,"Steady-state free Ca2+ concentrations have been measured with a Ca2+ electrode using suspensions of isolated rat liver mitochondria or saponin-treated hepatocytes. Mitochondria, when incubated in the presence of Mg2+ and MgATP2-, maintain a steady-state pCa2+ (-log [Ca2+]) of approximately 6.1 (0.8 microM). Addition of spermine lowered this value to a pCa2+ of 6.6 (0.25 microM). Spermine was the most effective polyamine, giving half-maximal effects at 170 microM and maximal effects at 400 microM. With saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes, spermine addition similarly showed that the mitochondria buffered the steady-state medium-free Ca2+ at a level approximating the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration of intact hepatocytes. The initial rate of Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter was investigated using Ca2+-depleted mitochondria incubated in the presence of succinate and 0.3 mM free Mg2+. Under control conditions, Ca2+ uptake was not observed at free Ca2+ concentrations below 0.5 microM. Spermine (350 microM) increased the rate of Ca2+ uptake at all Ca2+ concentrations below 4.5 microM, but at higher Ca2+ concentrations, it was inhibitory. Spermine also affected mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux by decreasing the apparent Km from 16 to 3.8 nmol of Ca2+/mg of mitochondrial protein with no change of Vmax. Experiments with 45Ca2+ confirmed that spermine increased mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling at 0.2 microM free Ca2+. Hepatic spermine contents are reported to be about 1 mumol/g, wet weight, suggesting that this polyamine may have an important physiological role in intracellular calcium homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1497884043,"Four out of 17 enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from infantile diarrhea bound 125I-fibronectin. This binding, which was inhibited by unlabeled fibronectin but not by other proteins, appears to involve two classes of receptors, one of which binds the ligand reversibly. Consistent with the presence of two classes of receptors the bacteria bound to at least two distinct sites of the fibronectin molecule, one being the amino-terminal domain which also contains the binding sites for Gram-positive bacteria and the other located outside this domain. The E. coli strain expressing fibronectin receptors adhered to fibroblasts and to fibronectin but not to ovalbumin-coated coverslips. Bacteria grown at 40 degrees C did not express fibronectin receptors and did not adhere to either substrate. Saturation of receptors with fibronectin blocked adhesion to both fibronectin-coated coverslips and to cultured fibroblasts. These data suggest that binding to fibronectin represents a mechanism of tissue adherence of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1543867248,"1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), which has been identified as a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C in vitro (Hidaka, H., Inagaki, M., Kawamoto, S., and Sasaki, Y. (1984) Biochemistry, in press), enhanced serotonin release from human platelets that was induced by the 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and correspondingly decreased incorporation of radioactive phosphate into a 20,000-dalton protein. H-7 did not affect the protein phosphorylation or the serotonin secretion in unstimulated platelets. A phosphopeptide with a molecular weight of 20,000 has previously been identified as a light chain (LC20) of platelet myosin and both protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent myosin light-chain kinase have been shown to be involved in its phosphorylation. Two-dimensional peptide mapping following tryptic hydrolysis revealed that H-7 selectively inhibited the protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of myosin light chain. This pharmacological evidence suggests that Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent myosin light-chain phosphorylation may play an inhibitory role in the release reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1607588301,"Chitin synthetase, in the zymogen form, was extracted with digitonin from a particulate fraction from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and converted into active form by treatment with immobilized trypsin. When the activated enzyme was incubated with UDP-GlcNAc and other components of an assay mixture, a chitin precipitate formed, trapping a large portion of the synthetase. The enzyme was easily extracted frm the chitin gel with a recovery of approximately 50% and an enrichment of approximately 100-fold. Further purification was obtained by repeating the chitin step. After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the purified synthetase showed a major band corresponding to Mr 63,000, a weaker band at Mr 74,000, and some other minor bands. Under nondenaturing conditions, an Mr of 570,000 was calculated for the enzyme from Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient determinations. After electrophoresis in a nondenaturing gel and incubation with the components of the standard assay, chitin was formed and precipitated in the gel, yielding an opaque band. Soluble oligosaccharides were not precursors for insoluble chitin, suggesting that synthesis of chitin chains takes place by a processive mechanism. N-Acetylglucosamine stimulated the purified synthetase only slightly and did not participate as a primer in the reaction. The same chain length, somewhat more than 100 units of GlcNAc, was determined in samples of chitin that had been synthesized either in vivo, or with a membrane preparation or with purified synthetase. These results suggest that chitin synthetase itself is capable both of initiating chitin chains without a primer and of determining their length."
https://openalex.org/W2020308493,"The presence of antibodies to lymphadenopathy-associated retrovirus (LAV) was determined by a radioimmunoprecipitation assay and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent solid assay of sera from Zairian patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1983. Thirty-five of 37 patients (94 percent) and 32 of 36 patients (88 percent), respectively, were seropositive by the two tests. In a control group of 26 patients, six (23 percent) showed positive results in these tests. Of these six control patients, five had clinically demonstrable infectious diseases and a low ratio of T4 to T8 lymphocytes. In addition, sera collected from a control group of Zairian mothers in 1980 were positive for LAV in 5 of 100 cases. Other serologic data suggest that LAV was present as early as 1977 in Zaire."
https://openalex.org/W1578121192,"The transient and steady-state kinetic parameters for the ATPase cycle of the complex of skeletal muscle actin with smooth or skeletal muscle subfragment 1 (S-1) were determined over a wide range of actin concentrations from measurements of protein tryptophan fluorescence, the transient hydrolysis step, and the steady-state rate. The properties of the completely associated system were determined by using S-1 covalently cross-linking to actin. A four-state model was found to provide a good approximation to the kinetic and steady-state behavior: (sequence; see text) where T, D, and Pi refer to ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, respectively. The formation of AM1T and M1T occurs by a rapid equilibrium binding of T followed by a very fast step. Actin is in rapid equilibrium with M1T and M2.DPi, with association constants K2 and K4. The three rate constants k1, k-1, and k5 were obtained by fitting observed rate constants from transient state measurements and VM to the model using values of k3 and k-3 determined for S-1 alone. To fit the data for skeletal or smooth muscle acto-S-1, the calculated rate constant of the hydrolysis step k1 and the equilibrium constant K1 had to be 2-3 times smaller than the corresponding parameters (k3, K3) for S-1. The calculated effective rate constant for product release must be large for striated muscle (85 s-1 at 20 degrees C, low ionic strength) and relatively small for smooth muscle (3 s-1). The difference in the actin-concentration dependence of association and of steady-state ATPase activity was predicted correctly from the rate constants fitted to the transient evidence. While the proposed mechanism does not exclude the possibility of additional ATP or product intermediate states, the properties of such states cannot be deduced from the kinetic evidence."
https://openalex.org/W1480351756,The receptor for interleukin 2 (IL 2) is induced on normal mature T cells activated by antigen or mitogen. Receptor-negative human T leukemic cell lines were induced to express the IL 2 receptor after incubation with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate. The Mr of the IL 2 receptor expressed on the surface of four different T cell lines and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes varied. The source of the heterogeneity appeared to be due to differences in post-translational processing of the receptor. The precursor of the IL 2 receptor isolated from tunicamycin-treated HUT102B2 or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate-induced CCRF-CEM cells had the same Mr and isoelectric point. Incubation of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate also induced the rapid phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on the IL 2 receptor from HUT102B2 cells and activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. This phosphorylation may be mediated by the Ca2+ and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C.

https://openalex.org/W1571050060,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a tripeptide that rapidly enhances prolactin secretion in clonal, hormone-responsive GH3 rat pituitary cells. In an effort to identify postreceptor mechanisms for TRH, protein phosphorylation studies have been conducted. Our previous studies (Drust, D.S., Sutton, C.A., and Martin, T. F. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3306-3312; Drust, D.S., and Martin, T. F. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7566-7573) showed that TRH rapidly (less than 15 s) increased the phosphorylation of at least six cytosolic proteins (41K (Mr = 41,000), several 59K, 65K, 82K, and 97K) and, with a 5- to 10-min latency, increased the phosphorylation of a seventh (80K). Cyclic AMP did not appear to mediate TRH-stimulation of protein phosphorylation; in contrast, Ca2+ translocation and Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation accounted for hormone-induced changes in 97K (and possibly 41K) phosphorylation. The studies reported here indicate that lipid (diacylglycerol) accumulation and protein kinase C activation mediate TRH-stimulated phosphorylation of the additional five cytosolic proteins (two 59K, 65K, 80K, and 82K). This conclusion is based on the findings that: 1) phospholipase C treatment, which produces diacylglycerol, mimicked several TRH effects; 2) bombesin, another peptide that induces inositol phosphatide turnover, mimicked several TRH effects; 3) phorbol esters, which were shown to activate GH3 cell protein kinase C directly, produced TRH-like effects; 4) partially purified GH3 cell cytosolic protein kinase C was activated by diacylglycerol; and 5) 59K and 82K proteins were endogenous in vitro substrates for a cytosolic lipid-stimulated protein kinase. We conclude that rapid TRH effects in promoting inositol phosphatide turnover in GH3 cells may be linked to the activation of protein phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C. These, and previously reported studies, indicate a role for Ca2+ and lipids (diacylglycerol) as dual intracellular messengers for TRH."
https://openalex.org/W1580856681,"Mouse mammary epithelial cells (NMuMG cells) deposit at their basal surfaces an extracellular heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan that binds to type I collagen. The binding of the purified proteoglycan to collagen was studied by (i) a solid phase assay, (ii) a suspension assay using preformed collagen fibrils, and (iii) a collagen fibril affinity column. The binding interaction occurs at physiological pH and ionic strength and can be inhibited only by salt concentrations that greatly exceed those found physiologically. Binding requires the intact proteoglycan since the protein-free glycosaminoglycan chains will not bind under the conditions of these assays. However, binding is mediated through the heparan sulfate chains as it can be inhibited by block-sulfated polysaccharides, including heparin. Binding requires native collagen structure which may be optimal when the collagen is in a fibrillar configuration. Binding sites on collagen fibrils are saturable, high affinity (Kd approximately 10(-10) M), and selective for heparin-like glycosaminoglycans. Because a culture substratum of type I collagen fibrils causes NMuMG cells to accumulate heparan sulfate proteoglycan into a basal lamina-like layer, binding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans to type I collagen may lead to the formation of a basal lamina and may link the basal lamina to the connective tissue matrix, an association found in basement membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1601129141,"The 18 S dynein of the outer arm of Chlamydomonas flagella contains two different heavy polypeptide chains (Mr approximately equal to 340,000), two intermediate chains (Mr = 69,000 and 78,000), and eight light chains (Mr = 8,000-20,000). We report here that when purified 18 S dynein is dialyzed against a low ionic strength solution, it is dissociated into two smaller subunits which can then be separated and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. One subunit contains one of the heavy chains and a Mr = 16,000 light chain; the other contains the other heavy chain and the remaining intermediate and light chains. Both subunits have ATPase activity. When recombined in the presence of 5-25 mM KCl, the subunits reassemble to form a particle similar to native 18 S dynein; neither subunit by itself can reform such a particle. 18 S dynein is therefore a heteropolymer containing two compositionally distinct subunits. Because the complete outer arm contains both 12 S and 18 S dyneins, the arm must have a total of three sites of ATP binding and hydrolysis: one associated with 12 S dynein and two with 18 S dynein."
https://openalex.org/W1601915458,"Abstract A proteoglycan, accounting for about 75% of the total hexuronic acid of the bovine glomerular basement membrane, was solubilized by 4 M guanidine HCl extraction and purified by filtration on Sepharose CL-6B. This glycoconjugate was found to have an apparent molecular weight of 200,000 and to consist of peptide and carbohydrate in a ratio of 70 to 30. The amino acid composition of the proteoglycan was notable for its high content of half-cystine (61/1000 total amino acid residues). Alkaline NaB3H4 treatment of the proteoglycan released heparan sulfate chains terminating in [3H]xylitol with an Mr approximately 14,000 (hexuronic acid/xylitol = 30:1). Four such glycosaminoglycan units were calculated to be present in each proteoglycan molecule, and on the basis of previous studies (Parthasarathy, N., and Spiro, R. G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 507-513), these appear to be clustered in a very limited segment of the polypeptide. Nitrous acid degradation of the NaB3H4-reduced chains yielded radiolabeled oligosaccharides derived from the xylitol end; the relatively large size of these fragments (average Mr approximately 6,000) indicated an uneven distribution of N-sulfate with a preferential location of these groups in the peripheral regions of the glycosaminoglycans. The occurrence in the proteoglycan of sugars such as galactosamine, sialic acid, and mannose, which are not constituents of heparan sulfate, suggested that other O-linked as well as N-linked carbohydrates occurred in the molecule. Evidence for small serine (threonine)-bound units was provided by alkaline NaB3H4 treatment of the proteoglycan which converted 85% of the galactosamine to 3H-labeled galactosaminitol present in Bio-Gel P-2 included oligosaccharides (14 mol/mol proteoglycan)."
https://openalex.org/W1602390093,"A biochemical basis for the LEC10 mutant phenotype of Chinese hamster ovary cells has been identified. Independent LEC10 mutants, originally selected for resistance to the toxicity of ricin, have been shown to exhibit reduced binding of 125I-ricin at the cell surface. Although this is indicative of structural changes in cell-surface carbohydrates, labeling of plasma membranes with galactose oxidase/[3H]borohydride revealed no significant differences between mutant and parental cells. Alterations in the carbohydrates synthesized by LEC10 cells were, however, resolved by lectin-affinity chromatography of glycopeptides from the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) grown in LEC10. LEC10/VSV glycopeptides contain a fraction which is not bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose but is strongly retarded on E-PHA (erythroagglutinin from Proteus vulgaris)-agarose. In contrast, CHO/VSV glycopeptides or those from a LEC 10 revertant (R.LEC 10/VSV) do not contain carbohydrates with these properties. High-field 1H NMR spectroscopy of the novel LEC10/VSV carbohydrates showed that they are complex, biantennary structures containing N-acetylglucosamine in beta(1,4)-linkage to the beta-linked core mannose residue. The presence of these structures correlates with the expression of the enzyme responsible for the addition of this bisecting GlcNAc residue, UDP-GlcNAc:glycopeptide beta-4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GlcNAc-TIII). Parental Chinese hamster ovary cells and the LEC10 revertant possess no detectable GlcNAc-TIII activity. The combined evidence suggests that the LEC10 mutation induces the expression of the GlcNAc-TIII enzyme in Chinese hamster ovary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1530334685,"Macular corneal dystrophy is a human genetic disorder characterized by corneal opacities that arise, in part, from a failure to synthesize mature keratan sulfate proteoglycans. The macromolecules in macular corneas and in keratoconus corneas, an abnormality not involving proteoglycans, were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]mannose and [14C]glucosamine in organ culture, and the keratan sulfate proteoglycans were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the protein core of monkey keratan sulfate proteoglycan. The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which did not react with the antibody, were oversulfated in corneas from patients with macular corneal dystrophy. Characterization of the immunoprecipitates showed that macular corneas did not make keratan sulfate proteoglycan but did synthesize an immunoreactive glycoprotein in nearly equal amounts as keratan sulfate proteoglycan was synthesized by the keratoconus cornea. The oligosaccharides on the immunoprecipitated macular glycoprotein appeared to be normal. However, the macromolecules contained an unsulfated glycoconjugate that was nearly as large as the normal keratan sulfate chains isolated from the keratoconus keratan sulfate-proteoglycan and contained the same relative proportions of labeled glucosamine, mannose, and fucose. This glycoconjugate was resistant to digestion with keratanase. These observations indicate that macular corneal dystrophy is caused by an error in the synthesis of keratan sulfate, possibly involving the specific sulfotransferases involved in sulfation of the lactosaminoglycan backbone of the chains."

Disposition of these sequences on the same attachment site in integration, and on different attachment sites in excision, determines the opposite effects of Xis protein upon the two reactions (stimulation of excision and inhibition of integration). The binding of Xis to two adjacent directly repeated sequences in the left phage arm is shown to occur in a highly cooperative manner, to alter the conformation of the DNA, and to produce a 32-fold stimulation of Int binding to an adjacent locus."
https://openalex.org/W1506101589,"Proteins from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles solubilized by a nonionic detergent were fractionated by use of a reactive red-120 agarose column. The Ca-ATPase was obtained in pure form by eluting the column with 400 microM adenyl 5'-yl imidodiphosphate, yielding an enzyme of almost twice the starting specific activity in a fraction containing half the initial protein. The conclusion that the ATPase comprises 50% of the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicle protein agrees with estimates gained from densitometry using 7 1/2% Laemmli slab gels but not from densitometry using 7% Weber and Osborn slab gels. The mechanism of purification was found to be affinity chromatography, with the ATPase binding the reactive red-120 ligand in its nucleotide-binding site. The steady-state concentration of phosphorylated intermediate relative to the specific activity was found to be lower in the purified enzyme as compared to the starting vesicular enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1577362223,"Abstract When bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase, taken as alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon with a molecular weight of 375,000, was inactivated by greater than 90% with a 4-fold molar excess of 7-chloro-4-nitro[14C]benzofurazan at pH 7.4, 1.15 mol of 4-nitrobenzofurazan [14C]Nbf were incorporated per mol of enzyme. Reactivation of a sample of the modified enzyme with dithiothreitol removed 0.82 mol of [14C]Nbf/mol of the F1-ATPase indicating that, of the 1.15 mol of [14C]Nbf incorporated, 0.82 mol were present on tyrosine residues and 0.33 mol on lysine residues. Incubation of the modified enzyme at pH 9.0 for 18 h at 23 degrees C led to an increase of 0.64 mol of [14C]Nbf-N'-Lys/mol of the F1-ATPase which occurred as a consequence of an O----N migration. About 15% enzyme reactivation occurred simultaneously with the migration indicating that the fraction of the [14C]Nbf group originally present on tyrosine which did not migrate was lost by hydrolysis. Examination of a tryptic digest of the labeled enzyme after the O----N migration by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed a single major radioactive peptide. The labeled tryptic fragment was purified and subjected to automatic Edman degradation. This analysis revealed that Lys-beta-162 was specifically labeled during the O----N migration of the [14C]Nbf group."
https://openalex.org/W1647844745,"The metabolism of heparan sulfate proteoglycan was studied in monolayer cultures of a rat hepatocyte cell line. Late log cells were labeled with 35SO4(2-) or [3H] glucosamine, and labeled heparan sulfate, measured as nitrous acid-susceptible product, was assayed in the culture medium, the pericellular matrix, and the intracellular pools. Heparan sulfate in the culture medium and the intracellular pools increased linearly with time, while that in the matrix reached a steady-state level after a 10-h labeling period. When pulse-labeled cells were incubated in unlabeled medium, a small fraction of the intracellular pool was released rapidly into the culture medium while the matrix heparan sulfate was taken up by the cells, and the resulting intracellular pool was rapidly catabolized. The structures of the heparan sulfate chains in the three pools were very similar. Both the culture medium pool and the cell-associated fraction of heparan sulfate contained proteoheparan sulfate plus a polydisperse mixture of heparan chains which were attached to little, if any, protein. Pulse-chase data suggested that the free heparan sulfate chains were formed as a result of catabolism of the proteoglycan. When NH4Cl, added to inhibit lysosomal function, was present during either a labeling period or a chase period, the total catabolism of the heparan sulfate chains to monosaccharides plus free SO2-4 was blocked, but the conversion of the proteoglycan to free heparan sulfate chains continued at a reduced rate."
https://openalex.org/W1503210396,"3'-O-(4-Benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (Bz2ATP), an analog of ATP containing a photoreactive benzophenone moiety, was used as a probe of the ATP binding site of myosin subfragment 1 (SF1). The inactivation of SF1 NH+4-EDTA ATPase by the bifunctional thiol crosslinking system cobalt(II)/cobalt(III) phenanthroline complexes was enhanced by Bz2ATP to the same degree as by ATP. This treatment resulted in the stable trapping of Bz2ATP at the active site in nearly stoichiometric amounts in a manner exactly analogous to ATP (Wells, J.A., and Yount, R.G. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 4966-4970). Irradiation of SF1 containing trapped [3H]Bz2ATP gave approximately 50% covalent incorporation of the trapped nucleotide into the enzyme. Analysis of photolabeled SF1 by gel electrophoresis showed that all of the [3H]Bz2ATP was attached to the 95-kDa heavy chain fragment. No label was found in the light chains. Similar analysis of the same protein after limited trypsin treatment demonstrated that approximately 75% of the [3H]Bz2ATP was bound to the central 50-kDa peptide and its 75-kDa precursor from the heavy chain. The N-terminal 25-kDa tryptic peptide, shown to be photolabeled by other ATP analogs (Szilagyi, L., Balint, M., Sreter, F.A., and Gergely, J. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 87, 936-945; Okamoto, Y., and Yount, R.G. (1983) Biophys. J. 41, 298a), was not labeled (less than 1%) by Bz2ATP. These results demonstrate that portions of the 50 kDa-peptide of the heavy chain are within 6-7 A of the ATP binding site on SF1 and possibly contribute to nucleotide binding."
https://openalex.org/W1572109008,"Above its critical micelle concentration, Triton X-114 in solution forms two phases at room temperature: a lower phase containing supramicellar aggregates and an upper phase largely depleted of detergent. This property of the detergent is potentially useful for separating under mild conditions proteins that bind detergent from those that do not (Bordier, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1604-1607). We studied the distribution of the receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) and its subunits in the two phases. IgE and IgE complexed either with intact receptors or with the alpha chains of the receptor alone are principally partitioned into the upper phase, whereas the unliganded receptor as well as the isolated alpha, and especially the beta and gamma chains of the receptor, preferentially partition into the lower detergent phase. Chromatography of IgE and of the subunits of the receptor on a hydrophobic support showed that the beta and gamma chains have a considerably greater hydrophobic surface than the alpha chains or IgE. These results indicate that the distribution of a protein in the two phases of phase-separated Triton X-114 is not an all-or-none effect based upon whether it binds detergent or not. Rather, it reflects the overall balance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of the protein's surface."

The detergent-extracted membrane supernatant contains both beta 1-3- and beta 1-6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activities that transfer [3H]GlcNAc from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc to the terminal galactose of neolactotetraosylceramide (Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-ceramide; nLcOse4ceramide), to form the Ii core structures. The linkage of [3H]N-acetylglucosamine incorporated into the terminal galactose of nLcOse4Cer was determined from identification of 2,4,6-tri-O-methyl[3H]galactose and 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl[3H]galactose after hydrolysis of the permethylated enzymatic products, GlcNAc beta-[3H]Gal-GlcNAc-Gal-Glc-ceramide. In addition to the presence of beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, we have detected a galactosyltransferase activity in this soluble supernatant fraction that catalyzes the transfer of [14C]galactose from UDP-[14C]galactose to lactotriaosylceramide (GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-ceramide; LcOse3ceramide) to form nLcOse4ceramide, the acceptor in the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-catalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1556031243,"Plasmin preferentially cleaves rabbit hemopexin at a single site, generating two nondisulfide-linked carbohydrate-containing fragments. In contrast, heme-hemopexin is almost totally resistant to this enzyme and is more resistant than the apoprotein to digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, subtilisin, and proteinase K as well. Plasmin digestion dramatically shortens the plasma clearance time of the molecule. The larger glycopeptide (I), shown to be derived from the amino terminus of the parent molecule by sequence analysis, has a molecular weight near 35,000 with a pI of 5.0. It binds 1 mol of heme per mol in a manner analogous to intact hemopexin, molecular weight near 60,000 and pI 5.8. The smaller glycopeptide (II) has a molecular weight near 25,000, a pI of 6.4, and does not bind heme. Of the four oligosaccharides of rabbit hemopexin, peptide I contains three oligosaccharides and peptide II contains one. At micromolar concentrations, the two peptides migrate together during centrifugation through sucrose gradients in the presence, but not in the absence, of heme. Peptide I has a far UV circular dichroism spectrum indicating it has some alpha-helical and extensive nonrepeating peptide structures whereas peptide II appears to be almost exclusively in a beta-sheet conformation. Peptide II is responsible for most of the positive ellipticity at 231 nm of native apohemopexin, but the increase in ellipticity at 231 nm characteristic of heme-hemopexin is not seen when peptide I binds heme, even in the presence of peptide II."
https://openalex.org/W1545552670,"The alpha-oxidation of [1-14C]phytanic acid of high specific activity was studied in postnuclear and various subcellular fractions from rat liver. alpha-Oxidation in the postnuclear fraction required ATP, Mg2+, nicotinamide, and molecular oxygen for activity. alpha-Oxidation was inhibited by iron-specific chelating agents and respiratory chain inhibitors. Partial inhibition by carbon monoxide indicated a possible involvement of cytochrome P-450. However, phenobarbital-treated rat liver postnuclear fraction did not stimulate phytanic acid alpha-oxidation above that of control. Subcellular fractionation indicated that in addition to the mitochondrial fraction, cytosol was required for activity. The cytosolic factor appeared to be dialyzable; it was inactivated by heat treatment, but not affected by trypsin digestion. NAD, CoA, ascorbic acid, and catalase did not replace cytosolic activity nor did the recently characterized heat-stable factors in brain hydroxylation, namely, adenosine nucleotides and glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1643169027,"Nd3+ binding to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was detected by inhibition of ATPase activity and directly by a fluorimetric assay. Both methods indicated that Nd3+ inhibited the ATPase activity by binding in the high-affinity Ca2+ binding sites. The stoichiometry of binding was about 11 nmol of Nd3+ bound per mg of SR proteins at pNd = 6.5. At higher [Nd3+], substantial nonspecific binding occurred. The association constant for Nd3+ binding to the high-affinity Ca2+ binding sites was estimated to be near 2 X 10(9) M-1. When the CaATPase was inactivated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), 5.3 nmol were bound per mg of SR protein. This fluorescent probe is known to bind in the ATP binding site. The stoichiometry of Nd3+ binding to FITC-labeled CaATPase was the same, within experimental error, as to the unlabeled CaATPase. Fluorescence energy transfer between FITC in the ATP site and Nd3+ in the Ca2+ sites was found to be very small. This donor-acceptor pair has a critical distance of 0.93 nm and the distance between the ATP site and the closest Ca2+ was estimated to be greater than 2.1 nm. Parallel measurements with FITC-labeled SR and Co2+, an acceptor with a critical distance 1.2 nm, suggested the ATP and Ca2+ binding sites are greater than 2.6 nm apart."
https://openalex.org/W1619568399,"Purified lamb thymus high-mobility-group (HMG) proteins 1, 2, and 17 have been investigated as potential substrates for the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. HMG proteins 1, 2, and 17 are phosphorylated by the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase; the reactions are totally Ca2+ and lipid dependent and are not inhibited by the inhibitor protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. HMG 17 is phosphorylated predominantly in a single seryl residue, Ser 24 in the sequence Gln-Arg-Arg-Ser 24-Ala-Arg-Leu-Ser 28-Ala-Lys, with the second seryl moiety, Ser 28, modified to a markedly lesser degree. HMGs 1 and 2 are also phosphorylated in only seryl residues but with each there are multiple phosphorylation sites. HMG 17, but not HMG 1 or 2, is also phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase with the site phosphorylated being the minor of the two phosphorylated by the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase; the Km for phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent enzyme is 50-fold higher than that by the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent enzyme. HMG 17 is an equally effective substrate for the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase either as the pure protein or bound to nucleosomes. Preliminary evidence has indicated that lamb thymus HMG 14 is also a substrate for the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent enzyme. It is phosphorylated with a Km similar to that of HMG 17 (4-6 microM), and a comparison of tryptic peptides suggests that it is phosphorylated in a site that is homologous with Ser 24 of HMG 17 and distinct from the sites phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase."

Early in cerebellar and retinal development, neither goblin isoform is detected in mitotic cells. Subsequently, beta-goblin (Mr 237,000) is expressed in postmitotic cells, and gradually accumulates with alpha gamma (brain) spectrin on the neuronal plasma membrane during the phase of cell growth. At the onset of synaptogenesis and the cessation of cell growth, their levels of synthesis decline sharply while the assembled proteins remain as stable membrane components. Concomitantly, there is a dramatic induction in the accumulation of alpha-goblin (erythroid goblin; Mr 260,000) and alpha beta (erythroid) spectrin, whose assembly is limited to the plasma membrane of perikarya and dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W1549745457,"Calmidazolium, a lipophilic cation and putative calmodulin-specific antagonist, inhibited potently the calcium ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles isolated from skeletal muscle. Based on steady-state measurements of catalytic activity over a range of MgATP, calmidazolium, and SR protein concentrations, the calculated values of the inhibition constant (KI) and binding stoichiometry were 0.06 microM and 770 nmol/mg protein, respectively. SR CaATPase inhibition apparently is not a general property of lipophilic cations since the hydrophobic anion tetraphenylboron inhibited catalysis, whereas its cationic analog, tetraphenylarsonium, did not. Enzyme inhibition by calmidazolium was noncompetitive with respect to the substrates Ca2+ and MgATP. In the presence of other SR CaATPase inhibitors, calmidazolium was competitive with respect to quercetin and noncompetitive with respect to trifluoperazine and propranolol. While calmidazolium inhibited enzyme phosphorylation by MgATP, catalysis was more sensitive to the inhibitor. Binding of calmidazolium to SR membranes produced morphological changes seen by electron microscopy as membrane thickening and loss of resolution of surface detail. Our results show that calmidazolium is a high-affinity, noncompetitive inhibitor of skeletal SR CaATPase activity, and they suggest that this inhibition is based on binding to the membrane phospholipids rather than specific antagonism of enzyme activation by calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1572502382,"Membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO) of Escherichia coli are a family of substituted branched oligomers containing 8-12 residues of glucose that are joined by beta 1—-2 and beta 1—-6 linkages. MDO are localized in the periplasmic space of the cell, and their biosynthesis is regulated by the osmolarity of the medium (Kennedy, E. P. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 1092-1095). We report here the initial characterization of a novel glucosyltransferase system that catalyzes the elongation of beta 1—-2-linked polyglucose chains. The system requires: 1) a beta-D-glucoside such as the disaccharide sophorose (2-O-beta-D-glucosyl-glucose) or octyl beta-D-glucoside; 2) a trypsin-sensitive membrane fraction; 3) a heat-stable protein from the soluble fraction; 4) UDP-glucose; and 5) Mg2+ ions. Oligomers containing 6-10 glucose units (about the same size as MDO) that are joined by beta 1—-2 linkages are major products of the enzyme system. Mutants in the recently mapped mdoA locus (Bohin, J. -P., and Kennedy, E. P. (1984) J. Bacteriol. 157, 956-957) are blocked in vivo at an early stage of MDO synthesis. It has now been found that mdoA mutants are defective in the membrane component, but not in the heat-stable protein that is required for the in vitro synthesis of beta 1—-2-linked glucosyl oligomers. We conclude that the glucosyltransferase system described here has an essential function in the synthesis of MDO in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1581394627,"The photoaffinity analog 2-azido-ADP has been used to investigate the high-affinity binding site(s) for ATP on the chloroplast thylakoid membrane. Photophosphorylation of 2-azido-ADP results in the rapid formation of 2-azido-ATP, which remains tightly bound to the membranes after extensive washing. The kinetic parameters of the tight binding of ATP and of 2-azido-ATP are similar (apparent Km = 1-2 microM; maximum extent = 0.2-0.4 nmol/mg of chlorophyll). Ultraviolet irradiation of washed thylakoid membranes containing tightly bound 2-azido-[gamma-32P]ATP induces covalent incorporation of the label exclusively into the beta subunit of the chloroplast coupling factor one. Previous results have shown that the tight binding site for ADP is also located on the beta subunit of the ATP synthase (Czarnecki, J. J., Abbott, M. S., and Selman, B. R. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 136, 19-24). To further characterize the tight binding sites for ADP and ATP, the membrane-bound coupling factor has been covalently modified with either tightly bound 2-azido-[gamma-32P]ATP or tightly bound 2-azido-[beta-32P]ADP. The photolabeled beta subunits have been isolated and subjected to partial proteolytic digestion and SDS-gel electrophoresis. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the tight binding sites for ADP and ATP are located on identical portions of beta subunit polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2105741927,"The phosphorylated intermediate of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (EP) was formed from [gamma-32P] ATP, and its decomposition was monitored by chasing with either ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or an excess amount of [gamma-31P]ATP. Chasing in the initial phase of E32P formation leads to monophasic and rapid decomposition, whereas chasing after the maximal level of E32P has been reached leads to biphasic decomposition. If a portion of EPtotal is formed from [gamma-31P]ATP (E31P) and the rest from [gamma-32P]ATP (E32P), decomposition of the later portion (E32P) is roughly monophasic and the rate of decomposition is about the same as that of the slow phase of the biphasic decomposition. Initiation of the EP reaction by concurrent addition of [gamma-32P]ATP and EGTA, conditions that permit the selective monitoring of the EP reaction via one of the subunits of the putative dimer (Ikemoto, N., Garcia, A. M., Kurobe, Y., and Scott, T. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 8593-8601) leads to monophasic decomposition at a rate comparable with the fast phase of biphasic decomposition. The kinetics of biphasic EP decomposition is reversibly affected by the nonionic detergent ethylene glycol monoether and the cleavable cross-linker dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate, both of which presumably affect subunit-subunit interactions. The results suggest that the biphasic EP decomposition is due to sequential liberation of Pi from different subunits (EI and EII) forming an oligomer as shown in the following model."
https://openalex.org/W2034726976,X-ray analysis of the free-acid crystal form of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) revealed a conformational difference between the free NAD+ molecule and one bound in enzymes or complexed to Li+ ions. The pyrophosphate group showed asymmetry in the phosphate-oxygen bonds of the phosphate-oxygen-phosphate link; this bond at the nicotinamide side of the link is longer than that at the adenosine side by 0.04 angstrom. The crystal structure showed a novel intermolecular stacking of adenine and water molecules on opposite sides of nicotinamide that gives rise to a nicotinamide sandwich.
https://openalex.org/W1500901587,"The fluorescence of 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP (TNP-ATP) bound to the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum is greatly enhanced during turnover induced by ATP plus Ca2+ (Watanabe, T., and Inesi, G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11510-11516). We have studied the kinetics of induction of TNP-ATP fluorescence and of its decay and have found a close correlation with levels of phosphorylated intermediate of the enzyme, E-P. Steady-state kinetic studies suggested competitive binding of ATP and TNP-ATP to the catalytic site, with Km and Ki values of 2.4 and 1.0 microM, respectively. Rate constants for fluorescence enhancement and for E-P formation in the presteady state were 1.2 s-1 or 97-130 s-1 under conditions resulting in TNP-ATP or ATP saturation respectively, of the enzyme at inception of reaction. The slow process was concluded to be the koff for dissociation of TNP-ATP from the catalytic site. Following this dissociation, a second TNP-ATP site was detected, which both formed (97-130 s-1) and decayed (0.22 s-1) synchronously with E-P. TNP-ATP binding to this noncatalytic site was rapid (5 X 10(7) M-1 s-1) and resulted in high fluorescence during steady-state turnover. Fluorescence was found to be dissociated from E-P by KCl (100 mM). KCl had little effect on E-P levels, but decreased fluorescence by 68%. These studies provide independent kinetic evidence for the existence of both catalytic and noncatalytic, or regulatory, nucleotide-binding sites, but cannot distinguish whether the two sites exist independently or whether the catalytic site is transformed into a regulatory site on phosphorylation. The latter site, which shows relatively high selectivity for TNP-ATP over ATP, and which is simultaneously hydrophobic and freely accessible to the medium, may play a role during energy transduction. The changes occurring at this site during catalysis are conveniently monitored with TNP-ATP fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1599066318,"In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, the homogeneous ATPase peptide inhibitor of rat liver mitochondria markedly inhibits the proton ATPase from this source (Cintron N. M., and Pedersen, P. L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3439-3443). Under these conditions, calmodulin prevents the inhibitor peptide from inhibiting the liver H+-ATPase. About 1.5 mol of calmodulin/mol of inhibitor is necessary to effect a half-maximal response (apparent Km = 0.5 microM calmodulin). The capacity of calmodulin to neutralize the action of the ATPase inhibitor peptide appears highly specific. This effect is not produced by insulin, trypsin inhibitor, lysozyme, ribonuclease, myoglobin, cytochrome c, ovalbumin, or bovine albumin. Only polyglutamate was found to mimic the action of calmodulin. However, when added together with calmodulin, polyglutamate failed to elicit an additive effect indicating that its site of interaction on the ATPase inhibitor peptide differs from that of calmodulin. Calcium is not essential in the assay medium for calmodulin to neutralize the action of the ATPase inhibitor peptide. The neutralization effect produced by calmodulin is also source-independent, with preparations of calmodulin from bovine brain and rat testes being equally competent. Calmodulin has no direct effect on the ATPase activity of the proton ATPase, nor does it affect the capacity of the enzyme to participate in either ATP synthesis or the ATP-dependent transhydrogenase reaction. Moreover, calmodulin fails to reverse inhibition of the H+-ATPase to which ATPase inhibitor peptide is already bound. Overall, these results indicate that calmodulin interacts in a direct and highly specific manner with the free ATPase peptide inhibitor of rat liver mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1539684650,"There have been several reports on the involvement of a 29,000-dalton protein in the regulation of ATP synthesis and 32Pi-ATP exchange (Zimmer, G., Mainka, L., and Heil, B. M. (1982) FEBS Lett. 150, 207-210). The present communication demonstrates that incubation of electron transport particles with 50 microM copper-o-phenanthroline results in reversible loss of 32Pi-ATP exchange but not of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase. Dependence of the inhibition on oxygen, its prevention by EDTA, ATP, or 2-mercaptoethanol, and subsequent restoration of the activity by 2-mercaptoethanol point to a thiol-disulfide interchange as the cause of inhibition. Analysis of copper-o-phenanthroline-treated samples by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conducted under nonreducing conditions shows four major changes. There is a decrease in the staining intensity of two bands with molecular weights of 34,000 and 29,000 with concomitant appearance of two new bands with molecular weights of 28,000 and 58,000-60,000. The 34,000-dalton band is tentatively identified as the phosphate transport protein. The 28,000-dalton component is formed by intramolecular and the 58,000-60,000-dalton component by intermolecular cross-linking of the 29,000-dalton protein. Pretreatment of electron transport particles with 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide does not affect 32Pi-ATP exchange or its inhibition by copper-o-phenanthroline but prevents cross-linking of the 34,000- and 29,000-dalton proteins. Evidence is presented to demonstrate that the purified H+-ATPase preparation has a single 29,000-dalton protein, identical to the adenine nucleotide translocase, and that it is not essential for 32Pi-ATP exchange or oligomycin-sensitive ATPase."

These DNAs were used as template for in vitro complementary chain synthesis by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I large fragment. Chain terminations were observed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the synthesis products and localized by comparison with a standard dideoxy sequencing pattern. More than 90% of the chain terminations were mapped exactly one nucleotide before a guanine residue. In addition, photoreaction was shown to occur more predominantly with guanine residues localized in single-stranded parts of the genome. The same guanine residues could also be damaged when the reaction was performed, in the dark, in the presence of the artificially generated promazine cation radicals. Using the BamHI-SmaI adaptor (5'GATCCCCGGG-3'), it was shown that the guanine alteration was a covalent addition of the promazine, or of a cation radical photodegradation product, on the guanine moiety. Kinetics of chlorpromazine photoaddition on single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs were determined."

The IC50 values in molarity of TRA were as follows: myosin (K+,EDTA)-ATPase, 3.5 X 10(-6); myosin Ca2+-ATPase, 3.5 X 10(-5); and actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase, 1.6 X 10(-5). The inhibition of ATPase activity of myofibrils by TRA was virtually reversed by washing with the fresh saline solution. Kinetic analysis of inhibitory effects of TRA suggests that the inhibition of (K+,EDTA)-ATPase activity of myosin or subfragment-1 is parabolic noncompetitive. TRA had no effect on alkaline phosphatase and choline acetyltransferase activities. TRA may provide a useful chemical tool for the study of the molecular mechanisms of actin-myosin contractile systems."

This DNA synthesis reaction has been reconstituted with purified proteins and found to require P22 12 protein, dnaG protein, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme components, 4 dNTPs, Mg2+, any one of ATP, GTP, UTP, or CTP and single-stranded DNA. The reaction has been dissected into partial reactions: (a) in a prepriming reaction, P22 12 protein binds to single-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction (Wickner, S. (1984) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1510842445,"The addition of from 80 to 120 mM NaCl to a recA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange results in a significant increase in both the initial rate and extent of reaction. This increase results from the formation of a relatively stable recA protein-single-stranded DNA complex that is similar to the complex formed in the presence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein. In addition to increasing the rate and extent of strand exchange, the amount of recA protein and ATP hydrolysis needed to promote these reactions efficiently is reduced. However, single-stranded DNA-binding protein is significantly more effective than addition of 100 mM NaCl in promoting stable complex formation and stimulating strand exchange. These findings support the hypothesis that a stable recA protein-single-stranded DNA complex is required for efficient DNA strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1507693900,"rec1 protein slowly loses activity in synaptic pairing reactions. The explanation for this result would appear to be that the overall reaction is limited by a slow transition of the protein to an inactive state. When preincubated with single-stranded DNA and ADP, rec1 protein forms a dead-end complex that is unable to promote homologous pairing. Its pairing activity can be restored by lowering the temperature for several minutes or can be maintained if duplex DNA sharing no homology with the single-stranded DNA is also included. These results suggest a mechanism for attenuating pairing activity during recombination. After recognition of homologous sequences, rec1 protein undergoes a slow, ligand-induced conformational change to an inactive form."
https://openalex.org/W1600027978,"Mitochondria isolated from livers of rats treated briefly with glucagon show an increased ATPase activity in the presence of appropriate concentrations of protonophoric uncouplers (Yamazaki, R. K., Sax, R.D., and Hauser, M.A. (1977) FEBS Lett. 75, 295-299). With the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) the effect of glucagon treatment was most evident at concentrations of uncoupler higher than required for maximal stimulation of ATPase in control mitochondria. In this range of FCCP concentrations that produced the greatest contrast in ATPase activity of control and hormone-stimulated mitochondria, there were no significant differences in delta pH, delta psi, or delta p between the two groups. The presence of added succinate in the ATPase assay system mimicked the effect of glucagon treatment, permitting greater activity at high concentrations of uncoupler without significantly affecting delta p. No significant effect of glucagon treatment or uncoupler concentrations on mitochondrial volumes was observed. Following treatment with glucagon, the mitochondria retained a greater content of Mg+ and K+ throughout the range of FCCP concentrations tested. In the upper range of FCCP concentrations there was appreciable loss of K+ from the mitochondria which was greater in control mitochondria than in mitochondria from glucagon-treated rats or in mitochondria assayed in the presence of succinate. The activity of the uncoupler-dependent ATPase was greatly stimulated by increased concentrations of potassium chloride in the assay medium without significantly diminishing the hormone effect. It is proposed that the intrinsic peptide inhibitor of ATPase is dissociated from the enzyme to an increased degree following glucagon treatment and that high levels of uncoupler inhibit by causing an increased association of the enzyme and its inhibitor."
