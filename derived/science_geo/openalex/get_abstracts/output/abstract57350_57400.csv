https://openalex.org/W1984540625,"A cortical band of fine microfilaments is consistently observed in the beta cells of the rat pancreas. Alteration of this cell web by cytochalasin B is associated with an enhancement of glucose-induced secretion of insulin by isolated islets. The microfilamentous web of the beta cell may play an important role in the emiocytosis of insulin secretory granules, by controlling their access to the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2038069616,"K-region epoxides of the carcinogens benz[a] anthracene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, and 7-methylbenz[a] anthracene are mutagenic in strains of Salmonella typhimurium designed to detect frameshift mutagens. Parent hydrocarbons, K-region diols and phenols and some other epoxides are inactive as mutagens in these tests. Polycyclic hydrocarbon epoxides, and other presumed proximal carcinogens, are discussed as examples of intercalating agents with reactive side chains. It has been shown previously that intercalating agents with reactive side chains are potent frameshift mutagens."
https://openalex.org/W1567678295,"Putrescine is the polyamine present in highest concentration in Escherichia coli; however, few specific functions for it are known. We found that cells growing in nutrient broth supplemented with high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, or sucrose had greatly reduced levels of cellular putrescine. On the basis of osmotic strength, all four solutes produced similar decreases in putrescine content. In contrast, glycerol had little effect on the amount of cellular putrescine. Cellular spermidine content was not affected by any of the additives. When cells were grown in high NaCl, pools for most amino acids increased; a few remained the same or decreased slightly. A sudden increase in the osmolarity of the medium led to a rapid excretion of cellular putrescine while there was no decrease in spermidine or free amino acids. This loss of putrescine could be blocked by sodium azide or sodium arsenate. The mechanism of putrescine excretion has two components; one is dependent on high concentrations of potassium ion in the medium, and the other is not. Cells grown in the presence of 11 mm potassium and then put into high osmolarity medium lacking potassium failed to excrete [14C]putrescine rapidly. Replacing the potassium greatly stimulated putrescine excretion within 1 min. The rate of [14C]putrescine excretion was half-maximal at a potassium concentration of 0.69 mm. E. coli which were grown in medium containing 0.1 mm potassium and resuspended in 11 mm potassium initially could excrete [14C]putrescine only slowly but regained the ability to excrete putrescine maximally after 15 min. Sodium, magnesium, ammonium, and rubidium ions and pH from 6.4 to 7.3 did not affect the rate of [14C]putrescine excretion. A sudden increase in the osmolarity of the medium produces a rapid increase in the cellular potassium content. However, this rapid uptake of potassium was not dependent on excretion of large quantities of cellular putrescine. When cells growing in high salt medium were transferred to low salt medium, the putrescine content approached the low salt value only after 140 min. However, the ability of cells to take up [14C]putrescine from the medium did increase 6-fold within 2 min after resuspension in low salt medium. [14C]Spermidine was not metabolized to a measurable extent over 70 min in either low salt or high salt nutrient broth cultures. Because the cellular spermidine contents were similar in the two cultures and because [14C]spermidine was not catabolized in either culture, the rates of spermidine synthesis must also be similar, even though the precursor (putrescine) pool sizes are quite different."
https://openalex.org/W2090168621,HIGH resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on rat skeletal muscle have recently shown that cellular water produces an absorption line almost ten times as broad as the line width of pure water1. This suggests that these water molecules are at least partly bounded such that the proton correlation time is increased. Similar observations have also been made for deuterated water in skeletal muscle2 and for H2O in other tissues3–5. Our results further substantiate the notion that ordered water exists in biological tissue and rules out several criticisms of this interpretation.
https://openalex.org/W1514609269,"Abstract [3H]Leucine incorporation into insulin was studied in isolated rat pancreatic islets to determine whether glucose stimulates insulin biosynthesis at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. A rapid and specific immunoprecipitation technique for measuring [3H]leucine incorporation into insulin and proinsulin is presented. Islets incubated in 15.3 mm glucose incorporated twice as much [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein as in low glucose (2.8 mm) over a 90-min incubation; [3H]leucine incorporation into insulin was increased 7- to 8-fold by high glucose (15.3 mm). At 2.8 mm glucose, 6.1% of the label incorporated into islet protein appeared in insulin, and this fraction was increased to 21.8% in 15.3 mm glucose. [3H]Leucine incorporation into insulin was linear at 2.8 mm glucose over a 2-hour incubation. At 15.3 mm glucose, the rate of incorporation of labeled amino acid into insulin increased during the first 45 min and was then linear for the rest of the incubation; this indicated a lag in achieving the maximal rate of insulin synthesis in high glucose which was not present in low glucose. Next [3H]leucine incorporation into insulin at 2.8 and 15.3 mm glucose was studied in the presence of actinomycin D which blocked islet RNA synthesis by 90%. Under these conditions there was a constant 2-fold increase in insulin synthesis in 15.3 mm glucose. Islets in 15.3 mm glucose and actinomycin D incorporated label into insulin at a linear rate, and inhibition of RNA synthesis inhibited the glucose-stimulated increased rate of insulin synthesis during the 2nd hour of incubation. Further evidence that glucose stimulates insulin synthesis at the transcriptional level was obtained by previously incubating islets in 2.8 or 15.3 mm glucose for 45 min in the presence of cycloheximide sufficient to inhibit islet protein synthesis by 90%. Cycloheximide was then washed out and and the islets incubated in high (15.3 mm) glucose and [3H]leucine for 45 min. The islets previously incubated in high glucose incorporated twice as much label into insulin as did islets previously incubated in low glucose. Actinomycin D added during the preliminary incubation period obliterated this difference, which provided presumptive evidence that glucose induces mRNA for insulin. The conclusions from these experiments are (a) that glucose can increase insulin synthesis on previously existing mRNA (i.e. a post-transcriptional effect), and (b) that glucose stimulates insulin mRNA which further increases insulin synthesis (i.e. a transcriptional effect)."

https://openalex.org/W1990001089,"A stable equilibrium was obtained for two F(-) strains of Escherichia coli in a glucose minimal medium. This equilibrium cannot readily be explained by traditional models of population genetics and apparently violates some forms of the ecological principle of competition exclusion. A mechanism involving an inverse relationship between the growth rates of these strains at the exponential and ""stationary"" phases is suggested as a possible explanation for the observed stable equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1564710849,"Abstract Four classes of mutants constitutive for the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium, hisR, hisT, hisU, and hisW, were examined for a possible role in the production of histidine tRNA. The content of tRNAhis in tRNA isolated from each of the mutant types was compared to that of the wild type, and the chromatographic behavior of the tRNAhis obtained from the mutants and the wild type was examined. Chromatography of the tRNAhis of the wild type gave no evidence for multiple species. Two factors suggest that hisR is a structural gene for histidine tRNA. First, hisR strains were found to have 25 to 45% less tRNAhis than the wild type; and second, introduction of an episome carrying the hisR gene into the wild type resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the quantity of tRNAhis. The tRNAhis of a hisT mutant chromatographed differently from that of the wild type. Since the hisT gene has previously been shown to code for a dispensible protein, we conclude that this protein is involved in tRNAhis maturation. The tRNAhis from hisT mutants is present in normal amounts, is charged normally, and appears to behave normally in protein synthesis, although not in repression control. The tRNA from a cold-sensitive hisW mutant was found to have an altered acceptance for several amino acids. This indicates that hisW also codes for a tRNA maturation enzyme. No increase in tRNAhis levels was obtained when an episome carrying the hisW gene was inserted into the wild type, and the tRNAhis from a hisW mutant behaved as the tRNA from the wild type on chromatography. No difference was found between the tRNAhis of hisU mutants and that of the wild type."

On the basis of observed amino acid residue differences, and inferred nucleotide differences in the respective genes, similarity to the E. coli sequence decreases for the following species in the order: S. dysenteriae g (S. typhimurium, A. aerogenes) g P. putida. This order is examined in relation to the results of investigations employing other means of assessing genetic homology."
https://openalex.org/W1520261972,"The autolytic release of β-fructofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.26) and acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) from the cell wall of yeast was studied under different organic solvents and with a variety of pH and temperature conditions. β-Fructofuranosidase (but not acid phosphatase) was found to be a convenient marker for studying changes in the wall structure. The ethyl acetate-treated cell was characterized in terms of changes in cell volume, dry weight, total nitrogen, and phospholipid; and it was used as a model of wall structure. The β-fructofuranosidase content is little affected by ethyl acetate treatment, but a 2-day exposure completely inactivates the autolytic enzyme system. Approximately 50% of the marker can then be enzymatically released by incubation with a cell-free extract from fresh yeast. If ethyl acetate-treated cells are previously treated with dithiothreitol, 100% of the marker now becomes accessible and is liberated by cell-free extract. The effect of sulfhydryls was shown to be on a wall component. The cell-free extract was partially purified by heat treatment, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and dialysis with full retention of autolytic activity. Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography was used to resolve the extract into two active fractions. Fraction I is a β(1 → 6) glucanase, while Fraction II is a β(1 → 3) glucanase; both appear to be endohydrolases in their action pattern. Fractions I and II will account for, at most, 77% release of marker from ethyl acetate-treated cells. A third (or more) fraction(s) was clearly indicated but not identified. In living yeast cells the autolytic enzyme system is located internal to the protoplasmic membrane and, during toluene-induced autolysis, is retained by the cell at least until 20% of the marker has been liberated."

https://openalex.org/W1552507653,"Abstract A lambda immunoglobulin light chain from a myeloma patient, normal light chains, and fragments one-half the size of these chains have been examined by chemical and physical methods. Fragments produced from the λ chain with trypsin, pepsin, and papain, and free urinary fragments of this chain were isolated. Characterization of the various fragments of the λ chain by amino acid analyses, peptide mapping, NH2-terminal sequence determinations, gel chromatography, and ultracentrifugations suggested that the fragments consist of whole variable or constant halves, and that they extend one to five residues into the adjacent half. Thus, the region at the mid-point of the chain which is particularly susceptible to proteolysis apparently consists of a polypeptide stretch of less than ten residues. This region seems to be of similar size in normal light chains, since fragments of such chains had very similar Stokes' radii and molecular weights as halves of the λ chain. The urinary fragments of the λ chain were identical or similar to fragments formed by proteolysis. These fragments probably are of catabolic origin. The halves of the light chains had significantly lower frictional ratios than the intact chains, which suggests that whole light chains are more elongated than the halves or contain trapped water in the contact region between the halves (or both)."
https://openalex.org/W1536471043,"Biotin carboxylase, the component of Escherichia coli acetyl CoA carboxylase which carries out the ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin, catalyzes phosphoryl transfer from carbamyl phosphate to ADP to form ATP. The latter reaction is dependent upon free d-biotin and divalent cation and, like the carboxylation of free d-biotin, is activated by ethanol. The participation of carbamyl phosphate (an analogue of carbonyl phosphate) in the phosphoryl transfer reaction is consistent with a mechanism of carboxybiotin formation in which carbonyl phosphate is an intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1492057606,"Abstract Studies were designed to determine the effect of glucose on RNA metabolism in isolated Islets of Langerhans. [3H]Uridine incorporation into RNA by isolated islets was linear for 2 hours and was increased 2-fold by raising glucose in the incubation media from 2.8 to 15.3 mm. Previously incubating islets with [3H]uridine at 2.8 mm glucose and then transferring them into 15.3 mm glucose in the absence of [3H]uridine showed that [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA was stimulated by high glucose independent of effects on the intracellular transport of uridine. Glucose also stimulated the uptake and phosphorylation of uridine and increased the islet UTP pool size, but under the conditions of these studies the relative specific activity of the UTP pool was the same at 2.8 or 16.6 mm glucose. Since high glucose did not affect the rate of degradation of islet RNA, it was concluded that increasing the glucose concentration in the incubation medium increased the over-all rate of islet RNA synthesis. Base composition analysis of islet RNA labeled for 1 hour in 32PO4 revealed a guanosine + cytosine content of 29.6% for islets incubated in 2.8 mm glucose and a guanosine + cytosine content of 45.6% for islet RNA synthesized in 16.6 mm glucose. Sucrose gradient analysis indicated that the [3H]RNA synthesized after 1 hour of incubation was heterodisperse (i.e. from 4 S to g45 S), and that glucose stimulated the greater production of large molecular weight RNA. Islets pulsed with [3H]uridine for 1 hour in 16.6 mm glucose and then chased with cold uridine for 3 hours showed that much of the large molecular weight RNA was ribosomal precursor. Fractionation of islets into crude nuclear, soluble, and polysomal fractions revealed that glucose increased RNA synthesis in each fraction. After 1 hour of incubation, 65% of the labeled RNA was still in the nucleus. Glucose had no effect on distribution of RNA within these fractions. Sucrose gradient analysis of the RNA extracted from these subcellular fractions revealed a predominant 4 S peak for the soluble fraction, partially degraded RNA in the nuclear fraction, and a prominent 8 to 10 S peak for the polysomal fraction. DNA-RNA hybridization studies showed that RNA synthesized in 16.6 mm glucose hybridized to DNA in greater amounts than RNA labeled in 2.8 mm glucose. Thermal elution profiles showed that the RNA labeled in 16.6 mm glucose dissociated from the DNA at lower temperatures. These results indicate that glucose stimulates the over-all rate of islet RNA synthesis and alters the nature of the RNA species synthesized."

https://openalex.org/W2122877741,"Abstract Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation and intraoligomer cross-linking were used to further investigate the quaternary structure of α-isopropylmalate synthase. Analytical ultracentrifugation of enzyme denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol yielded a weight-average molecular weight for the polypeptide chain between 47,000 and 52,000, depending on the partial specific volume employed. This result is in good agreement with the value of approximately 50,000 established previously by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Gel electrophoresis in the presence of 5 m urea resulted in one protein band, further supporting the concept that the subunits are similar if not identical. Analysis of the association-dissociation equilibrium of the native enzyme by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation led to the conclusion that the system can be adequately described as an ideal monomer-tetramer equilibrium with an association constant, K4 = [A4]/[A]4, of 9 x 1016 m-3. Neither substrates, employed individually, nor products were found to have a significant effect on the equilibrium. However, when enzyme which had been reacted with the potential active site-labeling reagent bromopyruvate was analyzed in the presence of acetyl-CoA, the associated form of the enzyme was stabilized. Thus, taking into account the dissociative effect of leucine shown earlier, the substrates and the feedback inhibitor appear to influence the association-dissociation equilibrium in opposite directions. An enzymatically active, nondissociable tetrameric form of the enzyme was isolated by gel filtration following intraoligomer cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate in the presence of acetyl-CoA and α-ketoisocaproate. This form of the enzyme was largely desensitized against inhibition by leucine. The potential of the cross-linking method to isolate and characterize enzyme species of a defined state of aggregation, otherwise practically inaccessible because of rapid association-dissociation equilibrium, is indicated. The possible significance of the association-dissociation equilibrium for catalysis and regulation of α-isopropylmalate synthase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560012114,"Abstract Asparaginase from Escherichia coli B has been modified with increasing amounts of [14C]succinic anhydride. Enzyme activity is enhanced when 15% and 25% of the lysyl residues are succinylated. Up to 40% of the lysyl residues were succinylated without destroying enzyme activity and without causing dissociation of this oligomeric protein. More extensive succinylation causes dissociation into subunits which exposes further sites for reaction with the cyclic anhydride. The number of succinyl groups covalently bound far exceeds the content of lysine groups, indicating that although succinic anhydride prefers to react with the e-amino group of lysyl residues it will also react with the functional groups of other amino acids. The results suggest that asparaginase contains two distinct classes of lysyl residues. The first 40% react readily with succinic anhydride and are not essential for catalytic activity; nor are they involved in subunit interactions. The remaining 60% are much less reactive and become available to the reagent only after the subunit has dissociated and functional groups which were hidden or were involved in the association of subunits are now exposed. Succinyl asparaginase dissociated more rapidly in the presence of 4.6 m urea than the native enzyme. The succinylated subunits can be reconstituted in part to a catalytically active tetramer. The fraction which does not fully reassociate has a sedimentation of 3.3 S, an emission maximum at 330 nm, compared with 317 nm for the tetramer or 345 nm for the monomer, and appears to be a dimer based on its behavior in a sucrose gradient. Hybridization of native and succinyl asparaginase produces three bands in addition to the starting proteins on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. These results constitute evidence that the native and modified enzymes are composed of four identical subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1555441999,"When NaB3H4 is added to solutions containing Escherichia coli UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and substrates at equilibrium, substantial amounts of UDP-[3H]hexoses can be isolated if substrates and enzyme are incubated for 2 hours prior to adding NaB3H4. When NaB3H4 is added within 1 min after mixing the enzyme with UDP-glucose, the amount of radioactivity associated with sugar nucleotides is small, although slightly larger than that found in control experiments in which the enzyme is omitted. Incubation of substrates with this enzyme for 2 hours result in more than 70% reduction in catalytic activity; the activity loss is largely reversed when substrates are removed by gel filtration. The data indicate that production of tritiated sugar nucleotides, clearly shown by Maitra and Ankel to be UDP-[4-3H]glucose and UDP-[4-3H]galactose ((1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 68, 2660) in similar trapping experiments, may be related to the extensive reduction in catalytic activity resulting from extended preliminary incubation with substrates."

Changes in the NH2OH concentration result in a concomitant alteration in the rates of synthesis of γ-glutamylhydroxamate and anthranilate. However, the sum of the two products appears to be constant. Moreover, the degree of inhibition elicited by NH2OH at different concentrations is similar for the over-all reaction, i.e., formation of anthranilate and the partial reaction of glutamine hydrolysis also catalyzed by anthranilate synthase in the absence of Mg++. γ-Glutamylhydroxamate is hydrolyzed by anthranilate synthase and the slopes and Vmax for its hydrolysis as well as that of glutamine are similar. γ-Ethylglutamate is also hydrolyzed by anthranilate synthase and this reaction requires chorismate. Addition of NH2OH yields γ-glutamylhydroxamate. The Vmax for this substrate is again similar to that obtained with γ-glutamylhydroxamate. These studies suggest the participation of an acyl-enzyme complex in the reaction catalyzed by anthranilate synthase."
