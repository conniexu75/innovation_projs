https://openalex.org/W2022646701,"Liquid crystals are promising materials for optical switching and image storage because of their high resolution and sensitivity. Azobenzene liquid crystals (LCs) have been developed, in which azobenzene moieties play roles as both mesogens and photosensitive chromophores. Azobenzene LC films showed a nematic phase in trans isomers and no LC phase in cis isomers. Trans-cis photoisomerization of azobenzene with a laser pulse resulted in a nematic-to-isotropic phase transition with a rapid optical response of 200 microseconds."
https://openalex.org/W2007930875,"Polyisocyanates, long studied as theoretical models for wormlike chains in dilute solution and liquid crystals, differ from their biological helical analogs in the absence of a pre-determined helical sense. These polymers have an unusual sensitivity to chiral effects that arises from a structure in which alternating right- and left-handed long helical blocks are separated by infrequent and mobile helical reversals. Statistical thermodynamic methods yield an exact description of the polymer and the cooperative nature of its chiral properties. Minute energies that favor one of the helical senses drive easily measurable conformational changes, even though such energies may be extremely difficult to calculate from structural theory. In addition, the chiral nature of the polymer can be used to test theoretical ideas concerned with cholesteric liquid crystals, one of which solves the problem of assigning the helical sense."
https://openalex.org/W2024142792,"According to much current theory, organisms should be able to balance the conflicting demands of the need to feed efficiently and the need to avoid preadtors while feeding. In an experimental conflict situation, it was possible to evaluate the relative fitnesses associated with the available choices and to compare the observed behaviors with predictions derived from fitness considerations. A backswimmer, Notonecta hoffmanni, was capable of balancing these two conflicting factors adaptively."
https://openalex.org/W2084300697,"The network of internal gas spaces in the yellow water lily constitutes a pressurized flow-through system which forces oxygen to the roots and rhizome buried in the anaerobic sediment. By the purely physical processes of thermal transpiration and hygrometric pressure, several liters of air per day enter the young, newly emerged leaves of Nuphar luteum against a small pressure gradient. This air moves en masse down the petioles of the young leaves (at rates up to 50 centimeters per minute) to the rhizome, forcing a simultaneous flow of gas (rich in carbon dioxide) from the rhizome up the petioles of the older emergent leaves to the atmosphere. The ventilation system has important physiological and ecological consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1975479630,"In situ x-ray diffraction measurements revealed that FeS, a possible core material for the terrestrial planets, transforms to a hexagonal NiAs superstructure with axial ratio (c/a) close to the ideal close-packing value of 1.63 at high pressure and high temperature. The high-pressure-temperature phase has shorter Fe-Fe distances than the low-pressure phase. Significant shortening of the Fe-Fe distance would lead to metallization of FeS, resulting in fundamental changes in physical properties of FeS at high pressure and temperature. Calculations using the density of the high-pressure-temperature FeS phase indicate that the martian core-mantle boundary occurs within the silicate perovskite stability field."
https://openalex.org/W1978274243,"Discrete chemical reaction events occurring in solution have been observed by single photon detection of a bimolecular, chemiluminescent reaction. The reactants were generated from 9,10-diphenylanthracene in acetonitrile with potential pulses applied to an ultramicroelectrode. Electrogenerated radical ions of opposite sign react to yield the excited singlet state of the parent compound. The chemical reactions were restricted to a 20-femtoliter volume adjacent to the electrode by the use of rapid potential pulses. Individual chemical reaction events were stochastic and followed the Poisson distribution, and the interarrival time between successive reaction events was exponentially distributed."

https://openalex.org/W2083875714,"Over 5600 short-period recordings of teleseismic events were used to create deterministic maps of P-wave scatterers in the upper mantle beneath Southern California. Between depths of 50 and 200 kilometers, the southern flank of the slab subducting beneath the Transverse Ranges is marked by strong scattering. The marked scattering indicates that the edge of the slab is a sharp thermal boundary. Such a boundary could be produced by slab shearing or small-scale convection in the surrounding mantle. The northern limb of the slab is not a strong scatterer, consistent with thicker lithosphere north of the Transverse Ranges."
https://openalex.org/W2039110971,"Living organisms are known to create structures in ancient rocks that are indigenous but not primary and that have been mistaken for fossils. Examination of burrows recently reported as fossils from 10(9)-year-old sedimentary rocks indicates that they are not the same age as the rocks but were probably made by termites working down after water. The burrows are partially filled with material from a modern lateritic surface from which they descend into steeply dipping, decomposed silt-stones of the Zambian Copperbelt. In fact, no authentic record of Metazoa that are demonstrably coeval with rocks older than 680 million years is known."
https://openalex.org/W2044366140,"Associated locally with well-known tufa mounds and towers of Mono Lake, California, are subvertical, concretionary sand structures through which fresh calcium-containing artesian waters moved up to sites of calcium carbonate precipitation beneath and adjacent to the lake. The structures include closely spaced calcite-impregnated columns, tubes, and other configurations with subcylindrical to bizarre cross sections and predominantly vertical orientation in coarse, barely coherent pumice sands along the south shore of the lake. Many structures terminate upward in extensive calcareous layers of caliche and tufa. Locally they enter the bases of tufa mounds and towers. A common form superficially resembles root casts and animal burrows except that branching is mostly up instead of down. Similar defluidization structures in ancient sedimentary rocks have been mistakenly interpreted as fossil burrows."
https://openalex.org/W2073855722,"The Galileo Photopolarimeter Radiometer experiment made direct photometric observations at 678 and 945 nanometers of several comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 fragments impacting with Jupiter. Initial flashes occurred at (fragment G) 18 July 1994 07:33:32, (H) 18 July 19:31:58, (L) 19 July 22:16:48, and (Q1) 20 July 20:13:52 [equivalent universal time coordinated (UTC) observed at Earth], with relative peak 945-nanometer brightnesses of 0.87, 0.67, 1.00, and 0.42, respectively. The light curves show a 2-second rise to maximum, a 10-second plateau, and an accelerating falloff. The Q1 event, observed at both wavelengths, yielded a color temperature of more than 10,000 kelvin at its peak."
https://openalex.org/W2007124655,Observations of Io in eclipse demonstrate conclusively that Io emits substantial amounts of radiation at 4.8 and 3.8 micrometers and a measurable amount at 2.2 micrometers. Color temperatures derived from the observations fit blackbody emission at 560 K. The required source area to yield the observed 4.8-micrometer flux is approximately 5 x 10(-5) of the disk of Io and is most likely comprised of small hot spots in the vicinity of the volcanoes.

Times of deposition span the period of the Fraser Glaciation and intervals before and after it, and include the series of climates prevailing when vegetation west of the Cascade Range shifted between a park-tundra type and the modern western hemlock forest."
https://openalex.org/W2033120616,"A theory raising the possibility of atomic explosions in a nuclear waste dump is almost universally dismissed by researchers. But front-page newspaper coverage has turned it into a major part of public debate. This article describes the concerns as detailed in the 5 March New York Times and by the researcher in the center of the debate, Charles Bowman an expert on neutron physics at Los Alamos. The resulting reactions from Congress, from other scientists, from the press, and from US DOE are included, and the possible effect on the Yucca Mountain radioactive waste disposal site."

https://openalex.org/W2145924977,"The federal government-university relationship in scientific research has been eroded by excessive, unthinking regulations for the purposes of accountability. The Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-21 continues to jeopardize the quality of government-sponsored research in universities by demanding wasteful, meaningless work-load documentation. These regulatory demands must be revised to reflect the realistic obligations of accountability by a leadership capable of transcending special interests. Mutual respect between government and universities must be restored to achieve a partnership that helps better the national life while also protecting the integrity of the scientific faculty and its mission."
