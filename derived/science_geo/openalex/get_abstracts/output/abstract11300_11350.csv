https://openalex.org/W2018252071,"Degradation of acetylcholine receptors by cultured rat skeletal muscle cells was determined from the release of 125I from bound 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin. Addition of immunoglobulin from patients with myasthenia gravis to the culture medium accelerated the degradation rate to a mean of 8.51 +/- 0.44 percent per hour, compared with the mean control rate of 3.97 +/- 0.14 percent per hour (P less than .001). A similar mechanism may possibly be involved in the autoimmune pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis in man."
https://openalex.org/W1535089571,"Catalysis by beef heart submitochondrial particles of the medium Pi in equilibrium HOH, Pi in equilibrium ATP, and the ATP in equilibrium HOH exchanges is strongly inhibited while the ATPase and intermediate Pi in equilibrium HOH exchange are accelerated when medium ADP is removed by pyruvate kinase action. Arsenate readily blocks completely the Pi in equilibrium ATP and medium Pi in equilibrium HOH exchange reactions, but not the ATP in equilibrium HOH exchange reaction. The residual ATP in equilibrium HOH exchange in presence of arsenate is inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol. These results and other data are explained by an alternating site model for oxidative phosphorylation. In this model during net oxidative phosphorylation ATP is formed at one site but is transitorily tightly bound and not released until ADP and Pi bind at a second site and the membrane ATPase complex is energized. Under conditions of net ATP hydrolysis, ATP binding at one site is accompanied by hydrolysis of the transitorily tightly bound ATP as a second site. Attractive features are only one site of input for conformational energization of the membrane ATPase, a single conformational transition that accounts for both the promotion of ADP and Pi binding in a competent mode and the release of tightly bound ATP, and a symmetry of catalytic sites. The Pi in equilibrium ATP exchange is not inhibited by increase in MgADP and MgATP at constant ratios, and the energy-linked ADP in equilibrium ATP exchange is not inhibited by increased concentrations of MgATP and Pi at a constant ratio. Such exchange patterns indicate a random binding and release of ADP and Pi."
https://openalex.org/W1577347418,"Hemoglobin AIc is a minor component of normal adult erythrocytes whose concentration is elevated approximately 2-fold in patients with diabetes mellitus. Previous work suggested that the unique structural feature of hemoglobin AIc is the presence of a low molecular weight sugar moiety at the NH2-terminal valine of the beta chain. In this study the structure of the carbohydrate moiety and the nature of its linkage of the beta chain were investigated. Enzymatic digestion of borohydride-reduced betaAIc chains followed by ion exchange chromatography led to the isolation of two distinct NH2-terminal glycovalylhistidines. Comparison of these glycodipeptides with synthetic glycovalylhistidines by thin layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy gave direct evidence that the naturally derived materials correspond to glucitol and mannitol valylhistidines. Model reactions showed that glucose and mannose react with valine under mild conditions to form an adduct which upon sodium borohydride reduction yields in both cases glucitol and mannitol valines. This suggests a common intermediate, 1-deoxy-1-(N-valyl)fructose, for both reactions. From these studies we conclude that hemoglobin AIc has, as the NH2 terminus of the beta chain, 1-deoxy-1-(N-valyl)fructose. The possible biosynthetic pathways of hemoglobin AIc are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1540450900,"Affinity-purified phytohemagglutinin from red kidney bean resolves into five isolectins by SP-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography. Recoveries ranging from 30 to 130 mg of protein for each isolectin are easily achieved. The isolectins have similar amino acid compositions which differ only in threonine, lysine, and arginine. A distinguishing feature of the amino acid composition is the total lack of sulfur-containing amino acids. Each isolectin contains about 4% mannose and 2.2% N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. All isolectins on electrophoresis form single protein bands under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions in polyacrylamide gels, and all have apparent subunit molecular weights of 33,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isolectins are also homogeneous by ultracentrifugation and have apparent native molecular weights of 115,000 +/- 4,130, suggesting tetrameric quaternary structures. Whereas 80% of the starting erythroagglutinin activity is recovered, one of the five isolectins possesses 50% of that original activity. As sequentially eluted from the ion exchange column, each isolectin displays progressively higher erythroagglutinin and lower lymphocyte mitogenic activities. Based on their relative biological activities, the isolectins are assigned the structures L4, L3E1, L2E2, L1E3, and E4, where L and E represent lymphocyte- and erythrocyte-reactive subunits, respectively, and the subscripts represent the proposed subunit composition."
https://openalex.org/W1582978743,"CDP-hexanolamine agarose was used as an affinity adsorbent to purify a CMP-N-acetylneuraminate: beta-D-galactosyl-glycoprotein N-acetylneuraminyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) from bovine colostrum. Upon binding of the enzyme to the adsorbent, elution is achieved either nonspecifically, with 0.5 to 1.0 M sodium chloride, or specifically, with CDP. A highly purified sialyltransferase is obtained with a specific activity 440,000 times that of whole colostrum. Fractionation of the purified enzyme by gel filtration gives two species with different molecular weights but equal specific activities toward asialo-alpha1-acid glycoprotein (26.0 to 28.0 micronmol/min/mg of enzyme). The molecular weights of these two forms are about 56,000 and 43,000 as judged by sodium doedcyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium, and gel filtration. The catalytic properties of both forms have been examined (Paulson, J. C., Rearick, J. I., and Hill, R. L. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2363-2371). It is concluded that the lower molecular weight form may be a partially degraded species of the enzyme of higher molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1501475854,"The substrate specificity and kinetic properties of a pure sialyltransferase from bovine colostrum have been examined. The transferase appears to incorporate sialic acid into the sequence, NeuAcalpha2 leads to 6Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc, which is commonly found in glycoproteins. It has a strict substrate specificity for CMP-NeuAc and forms only the alpha2 leads to 6 sialyl linkage with beta-D-galactosides. N-Acetyllactosamine (Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc) and asialo-glycoproteins containing the N-acetyllactosaminyl linkage at the nonreducing ends of the oligosaccharides prosthetic groups are the best acceptor substrates. Isomers of N-acetyllactosamine with beta1 leads to 3 or beta1 leads to 6 glycosidic linkages are less than 1% as effective as acceptor substates as the beta1 leads to 4-linked isomer. Lactose (Galbeta1 leads to 4Glc) is also a poor acceptor, indicating the importance of the 2-acetamido group in the N-acetylglucosaminyl residues. The unnatural substrate beta-methyl-L-arabinopyrano-side, a five-carbon analog of beta-methyl-D-galactoside which contains no 6-hydroxyl, also acts as a poor acceptor of the transferase and the sialylated product has been partially characterized. Kinetic properties of the enzyme in the presence and absence of inhibitors suggest that the transferase has an equilibrium random order mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1981080444,"Cats were subjected to complete lower brainstem transection, and were then tested for learning ability according to a classical conditioning paradigm. An auditory stimulus was systematically paired with a brief shock to the eyelid. Within a few weeks after the operation, the decerebrate cats could learn the conditioned response with a tone frequency discrimination and then a discrimination reversal. Our results support the notion that the brainstem reticular formation can support a conditioned response which isbehaviorally similar to that obtained in the intact animal."
https://openalex.org/W2021330687,"A major monoaminergic innervation in infant rat neocortex, predominantly in layer IV, has been demonstrated by ultrastructural and biochemical studies after the administration of exogenous catecholamine precursors and congeners. One-third of all cortical synapses have an uptake-storage mechanism for catecholamines. In newborn cortex, the storage capacity for catecholamines is tenfold greater than the endogenous levels, and the uptake-storage mechanism matures earlier than the ability to synthesize neurotransmitter."
https://openalex.org/W1535298471,"Translation of messenger ribonucleic acids for alpha- and beta-globin chains was analyzed in an mRNA-dependent fractionated protein-synthesizing system derived from rabbit reticulocytes. The alpha/beta chain synthesis ratio is highly dependent on the concentration of unfractionated globin mRNAs; the ratio is 1.5 at low mRNA concentration and declines to 0.03 at a high concentration. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that this effect is caused by competitive binding of the messengers to an initiation factor which preferentially associates with the beta-mRNA. Such a discriminating factor is present in the 0.5 M KCl wash fraction from ribosomes and it elutes from a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose column between 0.10 and 0.21 M KCl. Studies using purified preparations of initiation factors suggest that IF-M3 and IF-M4 may act synergistically to produce the activity of the discriminating initiation factor. Although the discriminating factor is required for translation of both messengers, its apparent binding constant to beta-mRNA is 50 times larger than to alpha-mRNA. The concentration of discriminating factor-mRNA complex does not limit the overall rate of protein synthesis in this cell-free system. Nevertheless, the relative effectiveness of different messengers is determined by the relative concentrations of their complexes with the discriminating factor."
https://openalex.org/W1630572380,"Oxygen equilibrium curves of fresh, normal human blood have been measured by new methods which allow the control of pH, pCO2, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and which yield higher accuracy at the extremes of saturation than was possible previously. The curve determined by these techniques lies slightly to the right of the standard curve of Roughton et al. (Roughton, F.J.W., Deland, E.C., Kernohan, J.C., and Severinghaus, J.W. (1972) in Oxygen Affinity of Hemoglobin and Red Cell Acid Base Status (Astrup, P., and Rorth, M., eds) pp. 73-83, Academic Press, New York). The greatest difference is at low oxygen saturation, probably owing to the fact that the latter data were obtained under conditions which would lead to depletion of cellular 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The range of p50 (oxygen pressure at half-saturation) values for four normal subjects was 28.3 mm Hg to 29.0 mm Hg. Adair's stepwise oxygenation scheme has been used to analyze the curves with the result that a1 = 0.1514 X 10(-1) (+/- 10%) mm-1; a2 = 0.9723 X 10(-3) (+/- 8%) mm-2; a3 = 0.1703 X 10(-3) (+/- 50%) mm-3; a4 = 0.1671 X 10(-5) (+/- 2%) mm-4 for the best of four data sets. Because these constants are very sensitive to changes in the shape of the oxygenation curve, this analysis is much more useful than p50 measurements in the investigation of the various allosteric effectors of the function of hemoglobin within the red cell."
https://openalex.org/W1973145918,"Denervated skeletal muscle fibers of mice develop discrete patches of high acetylcholine receptor density. The patches vary in size from less than 1 micrometer up to 30 micrometers, depending on the muscle and the period of denervation. Within the patches the acetylcholine receptor density is some 20 times greater than elsewhere along the muscle fiber and probably approaches that in the subsynaptic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1997222908,"Veneral transmission of La Crosse virus by males of Aedes triseriatus was demonstrated. La Crosse virus was detected in the bursa of females after induced copulation, and disseminated infection was shown to occur occasionally. Since males of Aedes triseriatus have transovarial filial infection rates similar to those of females and can repeatedly mate, veneral transmission may be an important supplement to other natural endemic maintenance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1516918475,"We have studied the interactions among a varied group of neutral amino acids for uptake into two different animal tissue culture cell lines. 3T3 mouse cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells were used in these studies. The results showed that the affinities of the amino acids clustered into two groups, one including amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and the other group included amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. The specificities and properties of these systems are similar to those described earlier for the Ehrlich ascites cell, System A (alanine-preferring) and System L (leucine-preferring). System A is highly concentrative, sensitive to sodium ion, and serves only poorly for exchange while System L is not very concentrative or sensitive to alkali metal ion, although it serves very well for exchange with endogenous amino acids. The kinetic parameters for several amino acids are reported and other properties of the transport systems are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1581370988,"Evidence is presented that the 5.8 S 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-binding protein found in the cytosols of all nucleated rat tissues is formed from two macromolecular substances: a heat-stable 4.1 S 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-binding protein which behaves identically with the serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-binding protein, and a cytosolic heat-labile protein which appears to sediment around 4 S and does not show binding properties for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. The 5.8 S complex is formed in vitro by incubating cytosols with appropriate amounts of serum. The complex is dissociated by heating, leaving the serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-binding protein. Complex formation also occurred with serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-binding proteins from other species. The widespread occurrence of the 4 S cytosolic component raises the possibility that the high affinity binding proteins for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol observed in nucleated tissues are largely the result of plasma contamination."

https://openalex.org/W1559096866,"The output of triglyceride and cholesterol, and the activity of microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) were measured following perfusion of the isolated rat liver with a medium containing free fatty acids. The activity of the enzyme and the output of cholesterol and triglyceride are regulated by the quantity and structure of the free fatty acid. The activity of HMG-CoA reductase was linearly proportional to uptake of oleic acid (18:1) by the liver. Output of triglyceride and cholesterol in the presence of oleate was also stimulated although, under these experimental conditions, the maximal secretory rate for cholesterol was observed while reductase activity was still increasing. When equimolar quantities of palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), or linoleic acid (18:2) were infused, the observed activity of the enzyme was in the order 18:1 greater than 18:2 = 16:0. Output of triglyceride was in the order 18:1 = 18:2 greater than 16:0. Output of free and esterified cholesterol was in the order 18:1 greater than 18:2 greater than 16:0. The stimulation by free fatty acids of hepatic cholesterogenesis, as estimated by the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, probably is the result of stimulation by free fatty acids of secretion of triglyceride in the very low density lipoprotein, and the obligatory requirement for cholesterol as a component of the lipoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W2088175708,"Arsenazo III was used to measure changes in the free intracellular calcium concentration during spontaneous bursting pacemaker activity in the Aplysia R1K neuron. Intracellular calcium increased during the burst, and this increase was sufficient to cause the hyperpolarization that followed.

https://openalex.org/W2021209122,"A strain of Photobacterium fischeri that emits yellow light has been isolated from seawater. The bimodal spectrum, which is unique among the luminous bacteria, consists of a major band with a maximum at 545 nanometers and a minor band with a maximum at 500 nanometers. The former represents a heretofore unreported range of emission for luminous bacteria, while the latter coincides with the emission spectrum of typical blue-green-emitting strains of P. fischeri. The relative contributions of these two bands to the total in vivo luminescence changes as a function of ambient temperature. When luciferase is extracted and luminescence observed in vitro, the emission is entirely blue-green, identical with that of luciferase isolated from other strains of P. fischeri."
https://openalex.org/W2164247285,"Balb/3T3 mouse cells grown in cell culture contain the A and L systems for neutral amino acid transport. L-Alanine was used as a test amino acid for the A system and L-leucine for the L system. Transport activities for both transport systems are altered as the growth conditions for the cells are altered. When cell growth was arrested by allowing cells to approach confluency, or by the removal of serum or by the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors, System A transport activity decreased and System L activity increased significantly. The content of the cellular amino acids increased 2- to 3-fold whenever cell growth was arrested by the conditions stated above. Increased cellular amino acids, therefore, are associated with decreased transport activity of System A and increased activity of System L. Altering cellular amino acids by loading or depleting the cells produced the predicted responses for the rapidly exchanging L-system but System A was less responsive. It is possible that regulatory mechanisms operate for the A system other than the direct action of alterations in cellular amino acid levels. The implications of the amino acid transport activity changes observed here on various studies on the role of transport in cell growth regulation and malignant transformation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589403305,"Troponin-C (TnC) from rabbit skeletal muscle contains two high affinity Ca2+ binding sites (sites 1 and 2) that bind Mg2+ competitively (Ca2+-Mg2+ sites) and two Ca2+ binding sites (sites 3 and 4) of lower affinity that do not bind Mg2+ (Ca2+-specific sites). The free energy (deltaG0i), enthalpy (delta H0i) and entropy (deltaS0i) of binding Ca2+ to each of the four sites (i = 1 to 4) on TnC have been evaluated from microcalorimetry and equilibrium dialysis. The enthalpy of Ca2+ binding to each site was identical (-7.7 kcal mol-1); the entropy of Ca2+ binding to sites 1 and 2 was deltaS01,2 approximately equal to 14.7 e.u. whereas delta S03.4 approximately equal to 8.0 e.u. The positive entropy associated with Ca2+ binding to sites 1 and 2 is probably due to displacement of water produced by the alpha-helix formation, known to accompany the binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites. Thus, Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites is driven by both enthalpy and entropy and the lower Ca2+ affinity for sites 3 and 4 is reflected in the lower entropy of Ca2+-binding. The entropy associated with Ca2+ binding to sites 3 and 4 suggests that some change in protein conformation is occurring upon binding of Ca2+ to these sites."
https://openalex.org/W2072818420,Partial denervation of the rat extensor digitorum longus muscle was performed by sectioning only one of the sciatic nerve roots. Measurements of spike resistance to tetrodotoxin in individual muscle fibers revealed denervation changes not only in the denervated fibers but also in the adjacent innervated ones. The results support the concept that products of nerve degeneration play a role in the origin of muscle changes induced by denervation.
https://openalex.org/W2093528319,"Larvae of the bruchid beetle Caryedes brasiliensis feed exclusively on seeds of the Neotropical legume Dioclea megacarpa, which contains 13 percent L-canavanine by dry weight. L-Canavanine, a nonprotein amino acid analog of L-arginine, exhibits potent insecticidal properties. Most of the seed nitrogen is sequestered in canavanine, and bruchid beetle larvae do not simply excrete this toxic compound. Instead, these larvae possess extraordinarily high urease activity, which facilitates the conversion of canavanine to ammonia through urea. In this way, canavanine is effectively detoxified and a supply of nitrogen for fixation into organic linkage is ensured."
https://openalex.org/W1967741198,"Neonatal mice were inoculated intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM). These mice developed long-term persistent tolerant infections and when tested at 3.5 to 6.0 months of age they showed significant increases in behavioral latency when subjected to open-field tests, and significant decreases in the current level required to elicit to startle response and in locomotor activity in a running wheel. Comparable results were obtained with mice in which persistent infection was induced at 8 weeks of age and which were tested at 3.5 to 6.0 months of age. It was concluded that mice infected with LCM at birth or as adults exhibited long-lasting behavioral abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W1593541101,"The cytosolic fraction from rat liver enhanced the basal and glucagon-sensitive adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) of hepatic plasma membranes and revealed its (R)-(-)-epinephrine sensitivity. Such phenomena were usually obtained by the addition of low concentrations of GTP to the medium employed for the cyclase assay. Comparative studies of the behavior of the cytosolic factor and GTP in response to various treatments were performed. We present evidence that the stimulatory activity of the soluble factor was reduced after treatment by alkaline phosphatase, by the nucleotide phosphohydrolases present in the plasma membranes, and by trypsin. These results strongly suggest that the soluble activator is a nucleotide-protein complex and further demonstrate that GTP may be of physiological significance in the regulation of the adenylate cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1542816686,"Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin is formed in vivo by the combination of erythrocyte (E)-reactive and lymphocyte (L)-reactive subunits into five tetrameric isolectins:L4,L3E1, L2E2, L1E3, and E4. Evidence for phytohemagglutinin subunit structure is obtained by in vitro dissociation of native isolectins in 6 M guanidine HCl followed by removal of dissociating agents to allow subunit recombination. Dissociation and recombination of L4 yielded a single protein, electrophoretically indistinguishable from the native L4. Similar treatment of E4 also yielded a single protein indistinguishable from native E4. Treatment of L3E1, L2E2, L1E3, or a mixture of L4 and E4, yielded five distinct proteins electrophoretically similar to all five native phytohemagglutinin isolectins. Milligram quantities of all five recombinant isolectins were prepared either from L2E2 or a mixture of L4 and L1E3 proportioned to yield equimolar quantitives of the two subunits on dissociation. The recombinant isolectins were purified by affinity and SP-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography. Electrophoretic and chromatographic properties and the erythroagglutinating and mitogenic activities of recombinant isolectins were essentially identical with the native isolectins. The inclusion of 125I-labeled L4 in the dissociation results in a distribution of 125I-labeled L subunit among the purified recombinant isolectins proportional to their proposed subunit structures."
https://openalex.org/W1558373890,"The galactomannan of surface grown Aspergillus niger has been isolated by alkaline extraction of hyphal walls and characterized structurally. Its elution profile, from a column of Bio-Gel P-150, reveals a broad range of molecular sizes grouped into two fractions. Gas chromatographic and colorimetric analyses indicate that each fraction is composed of approximately equimolar quantities of galactose and mannose plus 12 to 14% glucose. Both have similar low optical rotations and contain acid labile galactose. Methylation, Smith degradation, acetolysis, reactivity with concanavalin A and beta-D-galactofuranosidase, plus digestionof galactose with D-galactose oxidase, were techniques employed to determine the polysaccharide's covalent structure. Results of these studies indicate that it is composed of a series of chains, 5 to 9 hexose units in length, connected by alpha1 leads to 6 bonds between mannopyranosyl moieties. The external portion of each chain consists of a galactose tri- or tetrasaccharide of the general structure Galf beta1 leads to 4 Galp(1-2) 1 leads to 4 Galp1 leads to. This segment is connected via a (1 leads to 2) linkage to the internal portion which is a di- to pentasaccharide of mannopyranosyl units joined in alpha1 leads to 2 glycoside linkage. Combination mild acid hydrolysis and methylation experiments indicate galactofuranosyl terminal units are attached only to galactose. The organization of glucose into the overall structure of the polymer has not been determined. Structural relationships of this polysaccharide to both fungal and yeast galactomannans are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589863512,"The sialo compounds in the synaptosomal membranes of young rat brain were specifically labeled in vivo by the intracranial injection of radioactive N-acetylmannosamine. More than 95% of the incorporated label was found in glycosidically bound sialic acid. Specific activities of sialic acid in the synaptic membrane gangliosides G71 (monosialo), GD1a (disialo), and GT1 (trisialo) were similar; labeling in GD1b (disialo) was consistently somewhat higher. The highest specific activity of rat brain sialidase was evenly distributed between myelin fragment and synaptosomal membrane fractions, and ouabain-sensitive (Na+, K+)-ATPase also was concentrated in the latter fraction. The greatest amount of bound sialic acid was found in these subcellular fractions having the highest sialidase activity. A microsomal fraction was discovered to contain a small amount of bound sialic acid with a very high degree of radioactive labeling, but no sialidase. Release of sialic acid from the relatively intact membrane preparations by intrinsic membrane-bound sialidase occurred in two recognizable stages. There was a rapid initial release, complete within 30 min, of approximately equal amounts of lipid- and protein-bound sialic acid, corresponding to roughly half of the enzymatically releasable protein-boudn, and somewhat less than one-third of the lipid-bound, sialic acid. The remainder of the membrane sialidase-susceptible sialic acid was released in a second, slower stage. The intrinsic sialidase released 16 +/- 1% of the total sialoprotein and 31 +/- 1% of the total sialolipid sialic acid. Approximately the same amount of sialic acid is releasable from membrane sialolipid by the action of exogenous Vibrio sialidase; almost twice as much is releasable from sialoglycoprotein by this enzyme as compared with the intrinsic membrane sialidase. Each of the various membrane gangliosides appeared to be equally available to the action of the membrane sialidase. The results of this study indicate that both glycolipid- and glycoprotein-bound sialic acid in the synaptic membrane are releasable in situ by the action of the intrinsic synaptic membrane sialidase, and they suggest that this enzyme may act to modulate the physical properties of the membrane. In addition to influencing the rate of hydrolysis of endogenous membrane sialo compounds by intrinsic sialidase, pH had an effect on availability of protein-bound sialic acid. At acid pH, lipid- and protein-bound sialic acid were similarly available, but near neutral pH, gangliosides appeared to be attacked preferentially."

The variability in flight directions of nocturnal migrants is significantly correlated with increasing geomagnetic disturbance as measured by both the K index and various components of the earth's magnetic field. The results indicate that such disturbances influence the orientation of free-flying migrants, but the evidence is not sufficient to show that geomagnetism is a cue in their orientation system."
https://openalex.org/W1562156815,"The 3-O-methyl-D-mannose-containing polysaccharide (MMP) from Mycobacterium smegmatis, first described by Gray and Ballou (Gray, G. R., and Ballou, C. E. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6835-6842) is now shown to be a mixture of at least four isomers separable by gel filtration owing to differences in size and degree of methylation. The major component is 3-O-methylmannose but all contain small amounts of mannose. The molecular weights range from 2040 to 2490 and all are nonreducing. After Smith degradation, all yield a single large and one or more small fragments that give 3-O-methylmannose as the sole product of complete acid hydrolysis. The large Smith-degraded MMP components (SD-MMP) are similar to intact MMP and vary from 1830 to 2130 daltons, consistent with the loss of a single mannose; whereas the smaller fragments are the size of tri- to hexasaccharides and result from fragmentation of incompletely methylated chains. Controlled acid hydrolysis of [methyl-3H]MMP releases 6% of the methyl groups as [3H]methanol at a rate characteristic for the hydrolysis of methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. Proton magnetic resonance spectra of MMP and SD-MMP show a major methyl ether proton peak and a second small peak at higher field equivalent to about one methyl group per molecule. The results are consistent with the presence of an alpha-methyl aglycon at the reducing end of the chains. Methylation analysis of MMP isomers purified by high pressure liquid chromatography confirms that they are linear and unbranched. Methylation of [methyl-3H]MMP yields unlabeled tetra-O-methylmannose, showing that the chains are terminated by mannose. However, digestion of [methyl-3H]MMP with alpha-mannosidase releases mannose and exposes [methyl-3H]3-O-methylmannose. Smith degradation of [methyl-3H]MMP III yields a penta-to hexasaccharide product that can be resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography into two components. The distribution of radioactivity between these two fragments suggests that the chain was cleaved near the middle and that there must be an unmethylated mannose at that position. We conclude that the 3-O-methylmannose polysaccharides are linear unbranched chains of 11 to 14 sugar units, each terminated by a single mannose at the nonreducing end and by a methyl aglycon at the reducing end. Each isomer shows microheterogeneity, with 1 or 2 unmethylated mannose units near the middle of some but not all of the chains."
https://openalex.org/W1569709276,"Abstract Arginine deiminase (EC 3.5.3.6) from Mycoplasma arthritidis ATCC 14152 has been purified 6-fold by a new procedure, protamine sulfate fractionation and DEAE-agarose chromatography. The yield was 75 to 85%. The homogeneity of the final preparation was demonstrated by gel filtration, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, NH2-terminal analysis, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at two pH values. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 80,000 as measured by gel filtration. The dimeric nature of the enzyme is suggested by the molecular weight of 49,000 from sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels showed a major band corresponding to an isoelectric point of 7.0 and sometimes minor bands having lower isoelectric points. The ultraviolet spectrum exhibits a maximum at 278 nm. The enzyme has high affinity for L-arginine, with a Km value of 4 +/- 1 micronM at pH 7.2, 25 degrees. Mycoplasma arthritidis produces two distinct forms of arginine deiminase. Deiminase I is isolated from cells harvested during logarithmic phase; deiminase II is obtained from late logarithmic or early stationary phase cells. The two forms are resolved by DEAE-agarose chromatography and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Deiminase II elutes later from a DEAE-agarose column and moves toward the anode faster than deiminase I at pH 9.5 The two forms also have different specific activities and 280:260 spectral ratios. Each form has the same Km and molecular weight. A third form of the enzyme, deiminase III, can be generated by incubating deiminase II at pH 9.8, or in 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, at 25 degrees. The transformation can be followed by chromatography and is completed within 10 h. The specific activity of deiminase III is 1.3 times that of deiminase II. No change in molecular weight or subunit dissociation was observed during the transformation. Deiminiase III has the same specific activity, absorbance ratio A280:A260, and electrophoretic properties as deiminase I. Deiminase I undergoes no change upon incubation at pH 9.8 for several days."
https://openalex.org/W1521827193,"Differential scanning calorimetric measurements of normal rat liver microsomes reveal a single thermal transition at about 50 degrees. This transition is assigned to irreversible prorein denaturation. There is no evidence for a reversible lipid phase transition at any temperature above 0 degrees, indicating that the microsomal membrane is in teh fluid state under these conditions. Rats fed a fat-free diet which increases the degree of saturation of fatty acids in the membrane lipids do produce microsomal membranes exhibiting a reversible lipid phase transition. The NADH=dependent and NADPH-dependent enzymatic reductions of cytochrome c show linear Arrhenius behavior in the normal rat liver microsomes but reveal discontinuities and breaks in the Arrhenius plots at approximately the calorimetrically determined phase transition temperatures in microsomes from rats fed the fat-free diet. Hence, the fluidity of cell membranes can be altered by diet with consequent effects on membrane-supported functions. The data further show that the lipid organization of the membrane is not independent of the protein component and supports models of membrane structure where a separate class of lipids forms a boundary between the bulk phase and the proteins."

The all-trans-beta-retinyl phosphate; all-trans-9-(4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylphenyl)-3,7-dimethyl-2,4,6,8-nonatetraene-1-yl phosphate; perhydromonoeneretinyl phosphate; all-trans-beta-retinoyl phosphate; 13-cis-beta-retinoyl phosphate derivatives were tested as acceptors of [14C]mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose in a reaction catalyzed by rat liver membranes. The phosphate esters all functioned as acceptors of mannose to give a product chromatographically indistinguishable from endogenous mannosylretinyl phosphate. The mixed anhydrides, however, did not function as mannosyl acceptors. Neither class of compounds had any effect on the biosynthesis of dolichylmannosyl phosphate. Rat liver membranes did not catalyze the transfer of [14C]galactose from UDP-[14C]galactose to retinyl phosphate even at a concentration of retinyl phosphate (0.73 mM) which stimulated formation o mannosylretinyl phosphate by more than 50-fold..."
https://openalex.org/W2068705420,"The concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was measured by means of a radioactive receptor assay in the plasma of cows during the period immediately prior to, during, and following parturition. Nonparetic cows showed initially a slight decrease in plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D which was followed by a significant increase during parturition and 2 days postpartum. The highest concentration achieved in the control or nonparetic cows was 100 picograms per milliliter. In the paretic animals the plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration increased sharply during the day preceding calving and reached a maximum of 200 picograms per milliliter at parturition. This level was maintained during the ensuing 2.5 days. These results demonstrate that parturient paresis cannot be the result of insufficient synthesis or secretion of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D."

For physical characters, assortative mating of unwed parents was similar to that of wed parents; for behavior characters, however, there was less assortative mating by the unwed parents. Because assortative mating inflates estimates of genetic parameters in adoption studies, future studies should collect information on both biological parents."

The identity of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was established by co-chromatography with 1,25-dihydroxy[23,24-3H]vitamin D3 on Sephadex LH-20 columns, microparticulate silica gel columns, a reversed-phase column developed under high pressure, and by a specific 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding assay. The chromatographic systems used are fully capable of resolving all of the known metabolites of vitamin D3. Serum of the S. glaucophyllum-treated rats showed 300 pg/ml of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and no detectable 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2. Similarly, intestine of such rats had 230 pg/g of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Control animals which received the vehicle instead of S. glaucophyllum had only 20 pg/ml of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in their serum and 4.4 pg/g of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 in their intestine. These results demonstrate that S. glaucophyllum extracts must be a source of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; thus a significant basis for the calcinogenic properties of S. glaucophyllum must be the presence of a conjugated form of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which is rendered available by digestion."

These data cast doubt on the generality of beliefs about the behavioral effects of brain stimulation reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W1521497539,"DL-threo-alpha-Methylisocitrate (3-hydroxy-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylate) is a substrate for bovine heart aconitase and an inhibitor of TPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase from liver and heart. The isomer of alpha-methylisocitrate formed from alpha-methyl-cis-aconitate (cis-2-butane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate) by aconitase inhibits TPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase and has been identified as D-threo-alpha-methylisocitrate (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylate) by optical rotation and circular dichroism studies. Mitochondrial bovine heart aconitase catalyzes a reversible reaction between D-threo-alpha-methylisocitrate (Km, 0.2 mM) and alpha-methyl-cis-aconitate (Km, 0.05 mM) at pH 7.4. However, formation of methylcitrate (2-hydroxy-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylate) from these substrates or utilization of synthetic methylcitrate for formation of these products could not be demonstrated with bovine heart aconitase. DL-threo-alpha-Methylisocitrate is also a substrate for aconitase from rat liver cytosol (Km, 0.1 mM); Vmax with citrate is approximately 1.4 times that with DL-threo-alpha-methylisocitrate. The ratio of activities for these substrates observed with the bovine heart enzyme is about 5. Formation of alpha-methyl-cis-aconitate from synthetic methylcitrate could not be detected spectrophotometrically with the liver aconitase; if it occurs with either the liver or the heart enzyme, the rate would be less than 0.1% that obtained with DL-threo-alpha-methylisocitrate. A new synthesis of methylcitric acid in good yields from diethyl alpha-methyl-beta-ketoglutarate (diethyl 2-methyl-3-oxoglutarate) and cyanide has been described. NMR spectroscopy indicates that this synthetic methylcitric acid contains the two racemic pairs of diastereoisomers."
https://openalex.org/W1511738796,"The activity of pancreatic phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) is controlled not only by the architecture of the catalytic site, but is also strongly dependent on the penetrating power of the interface recognition site and the packing density of the lipid-water interface. The influence of the latter two factors on the interface activity has been investigated using chemically modified phospholipases A2 in which the NH2-terminal L-Ala8 has been replaced by DL-[3-13C]Ala, or in which the polypeptide chain has been elongated with DL-[3-13C]Ala. The [DL-(3-13C)Ala8]phospholipase A2 could be resolved into the pure diastereoisomers, [D-(3-13C)Ala8]phospholipase A2 and [L-(3-13C)Ala8]phospholipase A2 by elution on Sephadex G-100 in the presence of a micellar lipid-water interface, as well as by conventional ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. Similar procedures did not effect, however, a separation of DL-[3-13C]Ala7-phospholipase A2 into their respective diasteroisomers, indicating the strategic role of the NH2-terminal L-Ala8 residue in the interaction process between the enzyme and lipid-water interfaces. Kinetic experiments using various micellar short chain lecithins revealed the apparent absence of an interface recognition site in [D-(3-13C)Ala8]- and DL-[3-13C]Ala7-phospholipase A2, while these proteins still possess considerable enzymatic activity toward monomeric substrates. In contrast, however, kinetic experiments using monomolecular surface films, allowing a continuous change in surface density of the substrate molecules, revealed that [D-(3-13C)Ala8]- and DL-[3-13C]Ala7-phospholipase A2 at low surface pressure possess about 60 and 30% of the interface activity of native phospholipase A2, respectively. These results therefore suggest that the modified phospholipases A2 do possess an interface recognition site although less powerful as compared to that of the native enzyme, enabling the estimation of the surface density of micellar short chain lecithins."
https://openalex.org/W1591027637,"The synthesis of UDP-MurNAc-Ala-DGlu-Lys[Nepsilon-dimethylaminonaphthalene sulfonyl (Dns)]-DAla-DAla provides a method for the specific introduction of a fluorescent reporter group into the membrane environment of nascent peptidoglycan synthesis. To assess the degree of perturbation of this environment caused by the introduction of the dansyl substituent, this nucleotide was compared with UDP-MurNAc-Ala-DGlu-Lys-DAla-DAla in the reaction catalyzed by phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (UDP-MurNAc-Ala-gammaDGlu-Lys-DAla-DAla:undecaprenyl phosphate phospho-MurNA-C-pentapeptide transferase) and in the membrane-associated synthesis of nascent peptidoglycan. Phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase in membrane fragments from Staphylococcus aureus Copenhagen catalyzed the transfer of phospho-MurNAc-Ala-DGlu-Lys(Nepsilon-Dns)-DAla-DAla to undecaprenyl phosphate with a Vmax/Km of 3.8 and a Vmax of 1.6 times the values for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. In the exchange reaction catalyzed by the translocase, the Rmax/Km and Rmax for the dansylated substrate were 1.8 and 0.78 times the respective values for the reference nucleotide. The equilibrium constant for the transfer reaction utilizing UDP-MurNAc-(Nepsilon-Dns)pentapeptide was 5.9 +/- 0.13 compared to 1.1 +/- 0.02 for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. With respect to the proposed reaction model (Pless, D. D., and Neuhaus, F. C. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1568-1576), the increase in Keq is consistent with a decrease in the affinity of undecaprenyl diphosphate-MurNAc-Ala-DGlu-Lys(Nepsilon-Dns)-DAla-DAla for the translocase. The fluorescence emission maximum of the phospho-MurNAc-(Nepsilon-Dns)pentapeptide moiety of UDP-MurNAc-(Nepsilon-Dns)pentapeptide was blue-shifted from 525 to 495 nm upon transfer from UMP to undecaprenyl phosphate with a 6-fold increase in quantum yield. These spectral changes provided a sensitive and continuous assay for the formation of undecaprenyl diphosphate-MurNAc-Ala-DGlu-Lys(Nepsilon-Dans)-DAla-DAla. The nascent peptidoglycan synthesizing system from Gaffkya homari utilized the dansylated nucleotide with a Vmax/Km of 0.05 and a Vmax of 0.10 times the values for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. These results demonstrate that phospho-MurNAc-Ala-DGlu-Lys(Nepsilon-Dns)-DAla-DAla linked to the undecaprenyl phosphate will serve as a precursor for the synthesis of nascent peptidoglycan and that the dansyl moiety will report on the membrane environment it experiences during this synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1546144537,"Abstract A primary cell culture technique was used to study the effects of lipoproteins on rat hepatocyte 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. In this system, lipoproteins prepared from normocholesterolemic rat and human plasma, including low density lipoproteins, did not inhibit hepatocyte HMG-CoA reductase activity whereas very low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins isolated from the same sources were stimulatory. A lipoprotein was isolated from the plasma of cholesterol-fed rats that did inhibit hepatocyte HMG-CoA reductase activity. An extensive chemical characterization of the inhibitory lipoprotein revealed that it was mainly d less than 1.019 g/ml and had beta mobility on lipoprotein electrophoresis. The lipoprotein was compared to the comparable density fraction in the normocholesterolemic rat plasma and there was no size difference appreciable by negatively stained electron micrographs. However, two important differences in chemical composition were evident: in the inhibitory lipoproteins the per cent of total apoprotein which was in the region of Mr = 35,000 was increased 1.5- to 2-fold, and there was a marked increase in cholesterol ester content. These chemical characteristics may be required for lipoproteins to regulate hepatocyte cholesterol synthesis. Primary cell culture of rat hepatocytes appears to be a useful system in which to study cholesterol metabolism in the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1600258676,"A chromatin fractionation procedure has been developed that involves the shearing of swollen chromatin and the separation of chromatin fragments by sucrose gradient centrifugation. When chromatin from rapidly growing HeLa cells was fractionated, four partially resolved peaks were obtained. Partial characterization of the chromatin fractions indicated that each contained similar lengths of DNA formed in a complex with histones in nucleosomes. The most likely difference between the fractions is the degree of intra-or interstrand association of the fibers of nucleosomes. Chromatins from chicken erythrocytes and mitotic chromosomes were analyzed by the procedure. These chromatins yielded gradient profiles that were distinctly different from each other and from interphase chromatin. These results suggested that the fractionation procedure reflected at least some of the differences in the structure of chromatin known to exist in vivo. The association of pulse-labeled RNA with a particular chromatin fraction is frequently used to support claims of successful separation of transcriptionally active chromatin from inactive chromatin. Since our data show that the slowly sedimenting fractions preferentially bind RNA whose synthesis was clearly not in progress at the start of the fractionation, this criterion is suspect. The presence of equal amounts of satellite DNA in all fractions of mouse L-cell chromatin indicated that the method did not fractionate on the basis of the in vivo transcriptional activity."

Each endonuclease nicks nucleosome DNA at the identical sites, supporting the idea that the conformation of the DNA within a nucleosome is the major factor influencing its nuclease susceptibility and indicating that nucleases can indeed yield important information as to nucleoprotein structure. On the other hand, the relaative susceptibility of a given site can differ for each nuclease, indicating that enzyme-substrate interactions unique for each enzyme influence the course of the reaction; this limits the structural information which can be obtained by using a single nuclease to study nucleoprotein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1610099723,"Rubredoxin, one of the three protein components of the epoxidation/hydroxylation system of Pseudomonas oleovorans was immobilized by attachment to CNBr-activated agarose (Sepharose 4B). Since this represents the first reported example of the preparation of a water-insoluble derivative of an enzyme of this type, the electron transfer and physical properties of the conjugate were examined in order to allow comparison with those of the soluble enzyme. Immobilized rubredoxin exhibits all of the major spectral properties of the soluble enzyme above 300 nm, but some distortion in the 280 nm abosrbance band was observed. The immobilized enzyme accepts electrons from dithionite or form NADPH in the presence of spinach ferredoxin-NADP reductase, and upon reduction the visible absorbance is bleached. Immobilized rubredoxin mediates the reduction of cytochrome c in the presence of NADPH and spinach reductase, although it is less efficient in this role than soluble rubredoxin. The oxidation-reduction potential of immobilized rubredoxin was determined and found to be similar to that of the soluble enzyme. In the presence of 2.5 m guanidine HCL, the immobilized enzyme is considerably more stable than soluble rubredoxin toward denaturation. After anaerobic reduction, iron was readily removed from immobilized rubredoxin by washing in 0.5 m Tris base, PH 9.5 containing 0.07 M mercaptoethanol, and the resulting immobilized apoenzyme could then be reconstituted to give back a conjugate with the original iron content, as judged from its absorbance at 497 NM. Reptition of the entire reduction-dissociation-reconstitution cycle gave the same results as were obtained after the initial reconstitution."

U.S.A. 73, 2574-2578) stimulated the incorporation of mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides using a particulate enzyme fraction from maturing cotton bolls. This lipid fraction did not stimulate mannose incorporation into the mannosylphosphorylpolyprenol. The 14C-oligosaccharides, formed in the presence or absence of the pig liver acceptor lipid, were released from the lipid-linked oligosaccharides by mild acid hydrolysis and were isolated by paper chromatography. Both sets of 14C-oligosaccharides had similar mobilities suggesting that they were qualitatively similar, except that those formed in the presence of acceptor lipid had much more radioactivity. The individual oligosaccharides were purified on a calibrated column of Sephadex G-25 and were then subjected to various treatments to obtain information about their structures. The molecular weights of the larger oligosaccharides ranged from about L1210 to 1720 indicating they probably contained from 6 to 10 sugar residues. Strong acid hydrolysis of the oligosaccharide with a molecular weight of 1350, followed by reduction with NaB3H4, gave a ratio of [3H]hexitol to [3H]hexosaminitol that was compatible with the molecular weight (about 5:2). However, the hexitol fraction contained small amounts of [3H]glucitol in addition to [3H]mannitol. Thus, this oligosaccharide may contain small amounts of glucose in addition to mannose and GlcNAc. When the smaller oligosaccharides (i.e. those having 5 or 6 sugars) were treated with alpha-mannosidase, essentially of all the 14C was released as mannose, but only 30 to 50% of the radioactivity could be released from the larger oligosaccharides by this enzyme. Acetolysis of the oligosaccharide with a molecular weight of 1720 released the radioactivity as mannobiose and mannotriose suggesting that these oligosaccharides contain di- and trisaccharide branches linked to the main chain in 1 leads to 6 linkages."

Acta 445, 518-520) suggests that pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase isolated from Clostridium pasteurianum consists of two separate enzymes: (a) pyruvate lyase, which catalyzes the CoA and electron acceptor-dependent decarboxylation of pyruvate, and (b) pyruvate synthase, which catalyzes the reduced ferredoxin-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate. The enzymes separated on Sephadex G-200 and with acrylamide gel electrophoresis but complete separation of one enzyme free of the other was not achieved. Extensive purification procedures were not used because both enzymes are unstable. The results confirm published reports that pyruvate lyase contains thiamin and a chromophore which participates in electron transfer. Pyruvate synthase, however, did not appear to be a thiamin enzyme and there was no evidence to indicate participation of an enzyme chromophore in the pyruvate synthase reaction."
