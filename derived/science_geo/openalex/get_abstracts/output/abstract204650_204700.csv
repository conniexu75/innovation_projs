https://openalex.org/W2048749798,"The analysis of the shear stress/shear rate relationship, and thus the viscosity/shear rate relation, of blood and plasma shows that (i) freshly drawn whole blood has a large shear rate dependence on viscosity (viscosity falls as shear rate increases), and (ii) the shear rate dependence of viscosity of whole blood, or plasma, that has not been treated to prevent clotting is substantially greater than that of whole blood or plasma treated with anticoagulants. The influence of this phenomenon upon the fluid mechanics of the microcirculation is commented upon."

https://openalex.org/W1966611340,"In studies of the living rat, it was observed that ionic calcium is transferred against a concentration gradient and an electropotential gradient by the duodenal membrane; this would constitute evidence for the active transport of calcium in intestinal absorption and corroborates earlier observations made in vitro. The significance of this process in regard to total calcium absorption is unknown at present."

https://openalex.org/W2080392379,"The effect of strychnine upon the electrical activity recorded from the axon and the soma of an isolated nerve cell (the nonadapting stretch receptor cell of the crayfish) was studied. Protracted exposure of the soma of the cell to strychnine prolongs the duration of the intracellulary recorded action potential, as has been described in other excitable tissues treated with quaternary ammonium ions. During the plateau in the falling phase of the soma spike, the axon is usually firing repetitively. The stimulation of the inhibitory fiber produces a premature termination of the prolonged spike."

https://openalex.org/W2046376355,An expression is derived for the steady-state diffusion rate of oxygen through a solution or suspension of oxygen-carrying particles. Several special cases of interest are discussed and compared with the data of Hemmingsen and Scholander. Their observed dependence of the rate of specific oxygen transport on pressure and pH is consistent with the present expression.

Concomitant determination of glucose oxidation, with C(14) glucose, revealed no inhibition of the hexosemonophosphate pathway. These results are at variance with recent studies in rat lens tissue, which suggests that intracellular galactose-1-phosphate depressed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and the oxidative pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2028534901,"THE local function of different regions of the lungs can be studied by the inhalation of various gases labelled with oxygen-15. Recently, water vapour has been labelled in this way. Oxygen-15 has a half-life of 2 min. and is produced by a continuous flow process by bombarding nitrogen with deuterons in the Medical Research Council cyclotron in the grounds of Hammersmith Hospital. Details of its preparation have been published1. The oxygen-15 is available in nitrogen containing 3 per cent oxygen as carrier at a flow of 0.45 litre per minute. Radioactive water vapour was prepared by adding 4 per cent hydrogen in nitrogen at a flow of 1 litre per minute and passing the resulting mixture over a palladium-type catalyst (‘Catalyst D’; Baker Platinum Co.). The effluent contained 2 per cent of water as a vapour and had an activity of about 10 mc. per litre. The absence of unconverted oxygen was checked with a mass spectrometer."

Incubation may follow completion of the nest although ovulation is suppressed. Reactions obtained in the breeding season suggest that the male does not initiate but accelerates oestrogen production through the stimulation he provides."
https://openalex.org/W1968628450,"A behavioral method is described in which increasing intensities of electric shocks were applied to the gasserian ganglia of alert monkeys. The animals were trained to press a lever to regulate the shock level. ""Pain thresholds"" were thereby obtained, and these thresholds were modified by varying the shock duration and by administration of morphine."

Amounts of radiozinc found in the biota diminished rapidly with the distance from the river mouth. The highest levels were found in plankton, algae, and mollusks. Of the human foods, oysters exhibited the highest levels."

https://openalex.org/W2052358387,"A VIRULENT actinophage destructive to S. aureofaciens cultures and chlortetracycline (the trade mark of American Cyanamid Company for chlortetracycline is ‘Aureomycin’) fermentations had previously been reported1. Limited data regarding its host-range obtained at that time showed that it was a monovalent phage. Since other actinophages have been noted to be either polyvalent or monovalent2, further tests have been made with the S. aureofaciens phage to establish more clearly the nature of its host-range."
https://openalex.org/W2028003750,"A simple numerical routine which mimics the effects of density-dependent factors and weather has been used to simulate insect pest population trends without control, and with a variety of insecticidal procedures. Results of the analysis suggest that apparent benefits from spraying are illusory, since spraying elicits homeostatic response by the pest population."

https://openalex.org/W1992196237,"SEVERAL coumarin and indanedione drugs are capable of inducing hypoprothrombinæmia, presumably by interfering with the cofactor role of vitamin K in prothrombin synthesis. This role of vitamin K, probably involving electron transport, can be competitively inhibited by coumarins, and the inhibition competitively overcome by large doses of vitamin K (ref. 1)."
