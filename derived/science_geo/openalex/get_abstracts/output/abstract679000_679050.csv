https://openalex.org/W3189587449,"Many college students register each semester for courses, leading to productive careers and fulfilled lives. During this time, the students have to manage many stressors stemming from academic, personal, and, sometimes, work lives. Students, who lack appropriate stress management skills, may find it difficult to balance these responsibilities.This study examined stress, coping mechanisms, and gender differences in undergraduate students towards the end of the semester.University students (n = 448) enrolled in three different undergraduate exercise science courses were assessed. Two instruments, the Perceived Stress Scale and Brief Cope, were administered during the twelfth week of the semester, four weeks prior to final exams. T-tests were used to detect gender differences for the stress levels and coping strategies.Overall, females indicated higher levels of stress than their male counterparts. Gender differences were evident in both coping dimensions and individual coping strategies used. Females were found to utilize the emotion-focused coping dimension and endorsed the use of four coping strategies more often than males. These included self-distraction, emotional support, instrumental support, and venting.This research adds to the existing literature by illuminating the level of perceived stress and different coping strategies used by undergraduate female and male students. In turn, students may need educational interventions to develop effective and healthy coping strategies to last a lifetime. Faculty and other university officials may want to highlight and understand these various factors to protect the students' wellbeing in their classes."
https://openalex.org/W3190250049,"Intensive care unit healthcare workers (ICU HCW) are at risk of mental health issues during emerging disease outbreaks. A study of ICU HCW from France revealed symptoms of anxiety and depression in 50.4% and 30.4% of workers at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. The level of COVID-19 exposure of these ICU HCW was very high. In Canada, ICU HCW experienced variable exposure to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, with some hospitals seeing large numbers of patients while others saw few or none. In this study we examined the relationship between COVID-19 exposure and mental health in Canadian ICU HCW. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of Canadian ICU HCW in April 2020, during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the pandemic. Psychosocial distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Participants were asked about sources of stress as well as about exposure to COVID-19 patients and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Factors associated with clinically-relevant psychosocial distress were identified. Responses were received from 310 Canadian ICU HCW affiliated with more than 30 institutions. Of these, 64.5% scored ≥ 3 points on the GHQ-12 questionnaire, indicating clinically-relevant psychosocial distress. The frequency of psychosocial distress was highest amongst registered nurses (75.7%) and lowest amongst physicians (49.4%). It was also higher amongst females (64.9%) than males (47.6%). Although PPE availability was good (&gt; 80% of participants reported adequate availability), there was significant anxiety with respect to PPE availability, with respect to the risk of being infected with COVID-19, and with respect to the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others. In multivariable regression analysis, Anxiety with respect to being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.53, CI 1.31–1.81) was the strongest positive predictor of clinically-relevant psychosocial distress while the Number of shifts with COVID-19 exposure (OR 0.86, CI 0.75–0.95) was the strongest negative predictor. In summary, clinically-relevant psychosocial distress was identified amongst a majority of ICU HCW during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those with minimal or no exposure to COVID-19. Strategies to support mental health amongst ICU HCW are required across the entire healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W3191435006,"This study presents a nature-inspired, and metaheuristic-based Marine predator algorithm (MPA) for solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The significant insight of MPA is the widespread foraging strategy called the Levy walk and Brownian movements in ocean predators, including the optimal encounter rate policy in biological interaction among predators and prey which make the method to solve the real-world engineering problems of OPF. The OPF problem has been extensively used in power system operation, planning, and management over a long time. In this work, the MPA is analyzed to solve the single-objective OPF problem considering the fuel cost, real and reactive power loss, voltage deviation, and voltage stability enhancement index as objective functions. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 30-bus test system and the obtained results by the proposed method are compared with recent literature studies. The acquired results demonstrate that the proposed method is quite competitive among the nature-inspired optimization techniques reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3188324350,"As society has moved past the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis that relied on broad-spectrum shutdowns as a stopgap method, industries and institutions have faced the daunting question of how to return to a stabilized state of activities and more fully reopen the economy. A core problem is how to return people to their workplaces and educational institutions in a manner that is safe, ethical, grounded in science, and takes into account the unique factors and needs of each organization and community. In this paper, we introduce an epidemiological model (the ""Community-Workplace"" model) that accounts for SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the workplace, within the surrounding community, and between them. We use this multi-group deterministic compartmental model to consider various testing strategies that, together with symptom screening, exposure tracking, and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as mask wearing and physical distancing, aim to reduce disease spread in the workplace. Our framework is designed to be adaptable to a variety of specific workplace environments to support planning efforts as reopenings continue. Using this model, we consider a number of case studies, including an office workplace, a factory floor, and a university campus. Analysis of these cases illustrates that continuous testing can help a workplace avoid an outbreak by reducing undetected infectiousness even in high-contact environments. We find that a university setting, where individuals spend more time on campus and have a higher contact load, requires more testing to remain safe, compared to a factory or office setting. Under the modeling assumptions, we find that maintaining a prevalence below 3% can be achieved in an office setting by testing its workforce every two weeks, whereas achieving this same goal for a university could require as much as fourfold more testing (i.e., testing the entire campus population twice a week). Our model also simulates the dynamics of reduced spread that result from the introduction of mitigation measures when test results reveal the early stages of a workplace outbreak. We use this to show that a vigilant university that has the ability to quickly react to outbreaks can be justified in implementing testing at the same rate as a lower-risk office workplace. Finally, we quantify the devastating impact that an outbreak in a small-town college could have on the surrounding community, which supports the notion that communities can be better protected by supporting their local places of business in preventing onsite spread of disease."
https://openalex.org/W3190447627,"This study was conducted in Farta district, south Gondar from 2019 to 2020 cropping years to identify rodent pest species and estimate damage caused on barley crops. Four independent barley crop fields (40 x 40 m each) were sampled randomly to estimate the loss. Two were located near Alemsaga Priority State Forest and the other two were away from the forest. Four (2 x 2 m) rodent exclusion plots were established at 10 m interval as control units in each selected experimental barley fields using fine wire mesh. Rodent pest species were collected using both Sherman and snap traps throughout the different crop growing stages. The damaged and undamaged barley tillers by pest rodents were counted on five 1 x 1 m randomly sampled quadrats for each selected experimental fields. Variations on pest rodent population between cropping years and sites were analyzed using Chi square test. The mean crop damages between cropping years and experimental field sites were analyzed using two way ANOVA. Arvicanthis abyssinicus , Mastomys natalensis , Arvicanthis dembeensis , Mus musculus , Lophuromys simensis , Tachyoryctes splendens and Hystrix cristata were identified as pest rodents in the study area. A total of 968 individual rodents (427 in 2019 and 541 in 2020) were trapped during the study period. There was a statistical variation (χ 2 = 13.42, df = 1 and P&lt;0.05) between trapped individuals of the two successive years. The crop fields near the forest were more vulnerable than away from the forest during both cropping years. Statistical variations was observed on mean crop losses between cropping years and experimental barley crop sites. The highest crop damage was seen at maturity stage and the lowest during sowing in all experimental plots and cropping years. The percentage of barley yield loss due to rodent pests was 21.7 kg ha -1 . The monetary value of this yield loss was equivalent to 4875 Birr (121.9 US$ h -1 ). Alemsaga Forest as shelter and conservation strategies like free of farmland from livestock and terracing for soil conservation have great role for the high rodent pest populations in the study area. Field sanitation, trapping and using restricted rodenticides like zinc phosphide are the possible recommendation to local farmers against rodent pests."
https://openalex.org/W3192561193,"Pair-bonding allows for division of labor across behavioral tasks such as protecting a territory, caring for pups or foraging for food. However, how these labor divisions are determined, whether they are simply intrinsic differences in the individual’s behavior or a coordinated behavioral response by the pair, remains unknown. We used the monogamous, biparental and territorial California mouse ( Peromyscus californicus ) to study how behavioral approach to an aggressive vocal stimulus in a novel environment was affected by pair-bonding. Using a three-chambered vocal playback paradigm, we first measured the amount of time individuals spent in close proximity to aggressive bark vocalizations. We found that animals could be categorized as either approachers or avoiders. We then paired individuals based on their initial approach behavior to an opposite sex individual who displayed either similar or different approach behaviors. These pairs were then retested for approach behavior as a dyad 10–11 days post-pairing. This test found that pairs showed convergence in their behavioral responses, such that pairs who were mismatched in their approach behaviors became more similar, and pairs that were matched remained so. Finally, we analyzed the ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) produced and found that pairs produced significantly more USVs than individuals. Importantly, increased USV production correlated with increasing behavioral convergence of pairs. Taken together, this study shows that pair-bonded animals alter their approach behaviors to coordinate their response with their partner and that vocal communication may play a role in coordinating these behavioral responses. Overall, our findings indicate that pair-bonding generates an emergent property in pairs, adjusting their combined approach behavior towards a new aggressive stimulus representing a potential challenge to the bonded pair. Such findings may be broadly important for social bonding in other social systems."
https://openalex.org/W3188688289,"Urbanization is a main driver of agricultural transition in the Global South but how it shapes trends of intensification or extensification is not yet well understood. The Indian megacity of Bengaluru combines rapid urbanization with a high demand for dairy products, which is partly supplied by urban and peri-urban dairy producers. To study the impacts of urbanization on dairy production and to identify key features of dairy production systems across Bengaluru's rural-urban interface, 337 dairy producers were surveyed on the socio-economic profile of their household, their dairy herd and management, resources availability and, in- and output markets. A two-step cluster analysis identified four spatially explicit dairy production systems based on urbanization level of their neighborhood, reliance on self-cultivated forages, pasture use, cattle in- and outflow and share of specialized dairy genotypes. The most extensive dairy production system, common to the whole rural-urban interface, utilized publicly available feed resources and pasture grounds rather than to cultivate forages. In rural areas, two semi-intensive and one intensive dairy production systems relying on self-cultivation of forage with or without pasture further distinguished themselves by their herd and breeding management. In rural areas, the village's dairy cooperative, which also provided access to inputs such as exotic genotype through artificial insemination, concentrate feeds and health care, was often the only marketing channel available to dairy producers, irrespective of the dairy production system to which they belonged. In urban areas, milk was mostly sold through direct marketing or a middleman. Despite rapidly progressing urbanization and a population of 10 million, Bengaluru's dairy sector still relies on small-scale family dairy farms. Shifts in resources availability, such as land and labor, are potential drivers of market-oriented intensification but also extensification of dairy production in an urbanizing environment."
https://openalex.org/W3189974599,"High-throughput imaging techniques have become widespread in many fields of biology. These powerful platforms generate large quantities of data that can be difficult to process and visualize efficiently using existing tools. We developed easyXpress to process and review C. elegans high-throughput microscopy data in the R environment. The package provides a logical workflow for the reading, analysis, and visualization of data generated using CellProfiler's WormToolbox. We equipped easyXpress with powerful functions to customize the filtering of noise in data, specifically by identifying and removing objects that deviate from expected animal measurements. This flexibility in data filtering allows users to optimize their analysis pipeline to match their needs. In addition, easyXpress includes tools for generating detailed visualizations, allowing the user to interactively compare summary statistics across wells and plates with ease. Researchers studying C. elegans benefit from this streamlined and extensible package as it is complementary to CellProfiler and leverages the R environment to rapidly process and analyze large high-throughput imaging datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3187939351,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive multifactorial neurodegenerative condition. Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM2) are at increased risk for developing PD, indicating a possible insulin-modulating role in this latter condition. We hypothesized that drugs similar to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), used in the treatment of T2DM2, may play a role in PD.The purpose of this study is to systematically review and meta-analyze data of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and GIP drugs in the treatment of PD.Two reviewers will independently evaluate the studies available in the Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Lilacs databases. Preclinical rodent or non-human primate studies and randomized controlled human clinical trials will be included, without language or publication period restrictions. Outcomes of interest in preclinical studies will be primarily locomotor improvements and adverse effects in animal models of PD. For clinical trials, we will evaluate clinical improvements rated by the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-parts I, II, III, and IV, and adverse effects. The risk of bias of preclinical studies will be assessed by the SYRCLE tool and CAMARADES checklist and the clinical studies by the Cochrane tool; the certainty of the evidence will be rated by GRADE.There is an urge for new PD treatments that may slow the progression of the disease rather than just restoring dopamine levels. This study will comprehensively review and update the state of the art of what is known about incretin hormones and PD and highlight the strengths and limitations of translating preclinical data to the clinic whenever possible.PROSPERO registration number CRD42020223435."
https://openalex.org/W3188519846,"Obesity has emerged as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To inform treatment considerations the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 complications and the influence of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors deserves continued attention.To determine if obesity is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 complications and mortality and examine the relationship between BMI, race, ethnicity, distressed community index and COVID-19 complications and mortality.A retrospective cohort study of 1,019 SARS-CoV-2 positive adult admitted to an academic medical center (n = 928) and its affiliated community hospital (n-91) in New York City from March 1 to April 18, 2020.Median age was 64 years (IQR 52-75), 58.7% were men, 23.0% were Black, and 52.8% were Hispanic. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 75.2%; median BMI was 28.5 kg/m2 (25.1-33.0). Over the study period 23.7% patients died, 27.3% required invasive mechanical ventilation, 22.7% developed septic shock, and 9.1% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). In the multivariable logistic regression model, BMI was associated with complications including intubation (Odds Ratio [OR]1.03, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]1.01-1.05), septic shock (OR 1.04, CI 1.01-1.06), and RRT (OR1.07, CI 1.04-1.10), and mortality (OR 1.04, CI 1.01-1.06). The odds of death were highest among those with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 (OR 2.05, CI 1.04-4.04). Mortality did not differ by race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic distress score, though Black and Asian patients were more likely to require RRT.Severe complications of COVID-19 and death are more likely in patients with obesity, independent of age and comorbidities. While race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status did not impact COVID-19 related mortality, Black and Asian patients were more likely to require RRT. The presence of obesity, and in some instances race, should inform resource allocation and risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3189779528,"Background University students have higher average number of contacts than the general population. Students returning to university campuses may exacerbate COVID-19 dynamics in the surrounding community. Methods We developed a dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in a mid-sized city currently experiencing a low infection rate. We evaluated the impact of 20,000 university students arriving on September 1 in terms of cumulative COVID-19 infections, time to peak infections, and the timing and peak level of critical care occupancy. We also considered how these impacts might be mitigated through screening interventions targeted to students. Results If arriving students reduce their contacts by 40% compared to pre-COVID levels, the total number of infections in the community increases by 115% (from 3,515 to 7,551), with 70% of the incremental infections occurring in the general population, and an incremental 19 COVID-19 deaths. Screening students every 5 days reduces the number of infections attributable to the student population by 42% and the total COVID-19 deaths by 8. One-time mass screening of students prevents fewer infections than 5-day screening, but is more efficient, requiring 196 tests needed to avert one infection instead of 237. Interpretation University students are highly inter-connected with the surrounding off-campus community. Screening targeted at this population provides significant public health benefits to the community through averted infections, critical care admissions, and COVID-19 deaths."
https://openalex.org/W3190566713,"Murine syngeneic tumor models have revealed efficacious systemic antitumor responses following primary tumor in situ vaccination combined with targeted radionuclide therapy to secondary or metastatic tumors. Here we present studies on the safety and feasibility of this approach in a relevant translational companion dog model (n = 17 dogs) with advanced cancer.The three component of the combination immuno-radiotherapy approach were employed either separately or in combination in companion dogs with advanced stage cancer. In situ vaccination was achieved through the administration of hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy and intratumoral hu14.18-IL2 fusion immunocytokine injections to the index tumor. In situ vaccination was subsequently combined with targeted radionuclide therapy using a theranostic pairing of IV 86Y-NM600 (for PET imaging and subject-specific dosimetry) and IV 90Y-NM600 (therapeutic radionuclide) prescribed to deliver an immunomodulatory 2 Gy dose to all metastatic sites in companion dogs with metastatic melanoma or osteosarcoma. In a subset of dogs, immunologic parameters preliminarily assessed.The components of the immuno-radiotherapy combination were well tolerated either alone or in combination, resulting in only transient low grade (1 or 2) adverse events with no dose-limiting events observed. In subject-specific dosimetry analyses, we observed 86Y-NM600 tumor:bone marrow absorbed-dose differential uptakes ≥2 in 4 of 5 dogs receiving the combination, which allowed subsequent safe delivery of at least 2 Gy 90Y-NM600 TRT to tumors. NanoString gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry from pre- and post-treatment biopsy specimens provide evidence of tumor microenvironment immunomodulation by 90Y-NM600 TRT.The combination of external beam radiotherapy, intratumoral immunocytokine, and targeted radionuclide immuno-radiotherapy known to have activity against syngeneic melanoma in murine models is feasible and well tolerated in companion dogs with advanced stage, spontaneously arising melanoma or osteosarcoma and has immunomodulatory potential. Further studies evaluating the dose-dependent immunomodulatory effects of this immuno-radiotherapy combination are currently ongoing."
https://openalex.org/W3190689743,"The interaction between a consumer (such as, a predator or a parasitoid) and a resource (such as, a prey or a host) forms an integral motif in ecological food webs, and has been modeled since the early 20th century starting from the seminal work of Lotka and Volterra. While the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model predicts a neutrally stable equilibrium with oscillating population densities, a density-dependent predator attack rate is known to stabilize the equilibrium. Here, we consider a stochastic formulation of the Lotka-Volterra model where the prey's reproduction rate is a random process, and the predator's attack rate depends on both the prey and predator population densities. Analysis shows that increasing the sensitivity of the attack rate to the prey density attenuates the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations in the population densities. In contrast, these fluctuations vary non-monotonically with the sensitivity of the attack rate to the predator density with an optimal level of sensitivity minimizing the magnitude of fluctuations. Interestingly, our systematic study of the predator-prey correlations reveals distinct signatures depending on the form of the density-dependent attack rate. In summary, stochastic dynamics of nonlinear Lotka-Volterra models can be harnessed to infer density-dependent mechanisms regulating predator-prey interactions. Moreover, these mechanisms can have contrasting consequences on population density fluctuations, with predator-dependent attack rates amplifying stochasticity, while prey-dependent attack rates countering to buffer fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W3190804244,"The commensal microbiota regulates susceptibility to enteric pathogens by fine-tuning mucosal innate immune responses, but how susceptibility to enteric viruses is shaped by the microbiota remains incompletely understood. Past reports have indicated that commensal bacteria may either promote or repress rotavirus replication in the small intestine of mice. We now report that rotavirus replicated more efficiently in the intestines of germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice compared to animals with an unmodified microbiota. Antibiotic treatment also facilitated rotavirus replication in type I and type III interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice, revealing IFN-independent proviral effects. Expression of interleukin-22 (IL-22) was strongly diminished in the intestine of antibiotic-treated mice. Treatment with exogenous IL-22 blocked rotavirus replication in microbiota-depleted wild-type and Stat1 -/- mice, demonstrating that the antiviral effect of IL-22 in animals with altered microbiome is not dependent on IFN signaling. In antibiotic-treated animals, IL-22-induced a specific set of genes including Fut2 , encoding fucosyl-transferase 2 that participates in the biosynthesis of fucosylated glycans which can mediate rotavirus binding. Interestingly, IL-22 also blocked rotavirus replication in antibiotic-treated Fut2 -/- mice. Furthermore, IL-22 inhibited rotavirus replication in antibiotic-treated mice lacking key molecules of the necroptosis or pyroptosis pathways of programmed cell death. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IL-22 determines rotavirus susceptibility of antibiotic-treated mice, yet the IL-22-induced effector molecules conferring rotavirus resistance remain elusive."
https://openalex.org/W3191638412,"Canine bocaviruses (CBoVs) have been recognized as pathogens associated with intestinal diseases. Hematogenous spreading caused by CBoV has been documented and may potentiate the virus entry across the blood-brain barrier to initiate a brain infection. This study focused attention on CBoV detection in cases of encepahlopathy and attempted to determine its viral localization. A total of 107 dog brains that histologically exhibited encephalopathy (ED) were investigated for the presence of CBoVs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirty-three histologically normal brain samples from dogs were used as a control group (CD). CBoV-2 was detected in 15 ED dogs (14.02%) but not in CD dogs ( p = 0.02), while no CBoV-1 and -3 were detected. Among the CBoV-2 positive dogs, brain histological changes were characterized by nonsuppurative encephalitis, with inclusion body-like materials in some brains. In situ hybridization (ISH) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence of CBoV-2 viral particles in glial cells, supporting neurotropism of this virus. ISH signals were also detected in the intestines, lymphoid organs, and the heart, suggesting both enteral and parenteral infections of this virus. Whole genome characterization and evolutionary analysis revealed genetic diversity of CBoV-2 sequences and it was varying among the different countries where the virus was detected. This study points to a possible association of CBoV-2 with encephalopathy in dogs. It also highlights the genetic diversity and cellular tropism of this virus."

We also evaluated the antibacterial activity of these symbiotic bacteria. The recovery rate of EPNs was 7.82% (113/1445). A total of 62 Xenorhabdus and 51 Photorhabdus strains were isolated from the EPNs. Based on recA sequencing and phylogeny, Xenorhabdus isolates were identified as X. stockiae (n = 60), X. indica (n = 1) and X. eapokensis (n = 1). Photorhabdus isolates were identified as P. luminescens subsp. akhurstii (n = 29), P. luminescens subsp. hainanensis (n = 18), P. luminescens subsp. laumondii (n = 2), and P. asymbiotica subsp. australis (n = 2).

https://openalex.org/W3190642363,"Objective To assess the availability, price, and affordability of cardiovascular, diabetes, and global medicines in Abuja, Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional survey involving 27 private pharmacies, 13 public pharmacies, and 25 private hospital pharmacies in Abuja was conducted using the standardized World Health Organization/Health Action International methodology. The availability percentage for each pharmacy sector and each medicine was analyzed. The median price ratio (MPR) (ratio of the median price to the international reference prices) of the medicines were evaluated accordingly. Affordability was assessed by calculating the number of days’ wages the lowest-paid unskilled government worker required to purchase a month worth of the standard treatment for a chronic condition. Results The availability of cardiovascular (CV) medicines ranged from 28.4% (in private hospital pharmacies) to 59.9% (in private pharmacies). There was mixed variability in the mean availability of Originator Brands (OBs) and Lowest Priced Generics (LPGs) anti-diabetic drugs with the highest availability being OBs 36% and LPGs 40.2%, in private pharmacies and public pharmacies, respectively. The availability of global drugs ranged from 49.7% in private hospitals to 68.8% in private pharmacies. Two cardiovascular and four global medicines had greater than 80% availability across the pharmaceutical sectors. The median price ratio for OBs and LPGs was 9.60 and 1.72 for procurement, it was 8.08 and 2.60 in private pharmacies, 13.56 and 2.66 in public hospitals, and 16.38 and 7.89 in private hospitals. The percentage markup on LPG was 49.4% in public hospitals, 51.4% in private pharmacies, and 323% in private hospitals. Only nine medicines in both public hospitals and private pharmacies and two in the private hospital pharmacies required less than the daily wage of the lowest-paid government worker. Conclusion The availability of cardiovascular, diabetes, and global medicines was below 80% across the different pharmaceutical sectors in Abuja and the medicines were unaffordable. Although the prices were generally exorbitant, private pharmacies offered the best options in terms of availability, pricing, and affordability of medicines. Therefore, the results of this study emphasize the pertinence of enforcing policies that facilitate the availability, pricing, and affordability of cardiovascular, diabetes, and global medicines."
https://openalex.org/W3192199385,"Maya archaeologists have long been interested in understanding ancient diets because they provide information about broad-scale economic and societal transformations. Though paleodietary studies have primarily relied on stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopic analyses of human bone collagen to document the types of food people consumed, stable sulfur (δ34S) isotope analysis can potentially provide valuable data to identify terrestrial, freshwater, or marine/coastal food sources, as well as determine human mobility and migration patterns. Here we assess applications of δ34S for investigating Maya diet and migration through stable isotope analyses of human bone collagen (δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S) from 114 individuals from 12 sites in the Eastern Maya lowlands, temporally spanning from the Late Preclassic (300 BCE-300 CE) through Colonial periods (1520-1800 CE). Results document a diet dominated by maize and other terrestrial resources, consistent with expectations for this inland region. Because δ34S values reflect local geology, our analyses also identified recent migrants to the Eastern lowlands who had non-local δ34S signatures. When combined with other indicators of mobility (e.g., strontium isotopes), sulfur isotopic data provide a powerful tool to investigate movement across a person's lifespan. This study represents the largest examination of archaeological human δ34S isotope values for the Maya lowlands and provides a foundation for novel insights into both subsistence practices and migration."
https://openalex.org/W3193203587,"The purpose of this study was to assess whether microRNA (miR)-1285 can suppress the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Expression of miR-1285 was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The features of EMT were assessed using Western blotting, immunocytochemical staining, scratch wound healing tests, modified Boyden chamber assay, and collagen gel contraction assay. A rabbit model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) was used for in vivo testing, which involved the induction of PVR by injection of transfected ARPE cells into the vitreous chamber. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the putative target of miR-1285. The expression of miR-1285 was downregulated in ARPE-19 cells treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Overexpression of miR-1285 led to upregulation of zonula occludens-1, downregulation of α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin, cell migration and cell contractility-all EMT features-in the TGF-β2-treated ARPE-19 cells. The reporter assay indicated that the 3' untranslated region of Smad4 was the direct target of miR1285. PVR progression was alleviated in the miR-1285 transfected rabbits. In conclusion, overexpression of miR-1285 attenuates TGF-β2-induced EMT in a rabbit model of PVR, and the effect of miR-1285 in PVR is dependent on Smad4. Further research is warranted to develop a feasible therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of PVR."

Method 3743 grade 8 learners (2118 girls and 1625 boys) from 24 selected public schools in Tshwane, South Africa, enrolled in a cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating a multi-component school-based intervention to prevent intimate partner violence, and completed self-administered questionnaires. We carried out descriptive analysis, simple linear and structural equation modelling to examine factors and pathways to the learners’ experience of CP at school. Results About 52% of learners had experienced CP at school in the last 6 months. It was higher among boys compared to girls. Experience of CP at school amongst learners was associated with learner behavior, home environment, and school environment. Learners from households with low-socio economic status (SES) had an increased risk of CP experience at school. Amongst boys, low family SES status was associated with a negative home environment and had a direct negative impact on a learner’s mental health, directly associated with misbehavior. Conclusion CP in public schools in South Africa continues despite legislation prohibiting its use. While addressing learner behaviour is critical, evidence-based interventions addressing home and school environment are needed to change the culture among teachers of using corporal punishment to discipline adolescents and inculcate one that promotes positive discipline."

The problems of low efficiency and high cost in bridge inspection are becoming more and more prominent, which threaten people's life safety. In this paper, the deterioration state prediction model of concrete beam bridge under Boosting DT C5.0 was established as the basis, and optimization suggestions were put forward in terms of bridge inspection standards and processes, which aims to perfect the bridge inspection mechanism, realize the fine management of the bridge and prolong the service life of the bridge. Research shows that: first, the bridge inspection standard with a single index should be improved into the bridge inspection standard with multiple indexes, so as to scientifically determine the bridges that need to be inspected and optimize the allocation of maintenance resources. Second, the bridge deterioration state prediction model is used to add a screening mechanism for the bridge in the inspection plan, which can effectively reduce the workload of bridge inspection and enhance the inspection efficiency. Third, the deterioration phenomenon of coexistence between adjacent traffic assets should be fully considered and the linkage inspection mechanism of adjacent traffic assets should be established to improve the effect of bridge inspection."
https://openalex.org/W3189230106,"The growth of fishes and their metabolism is highly variable in fish species and is an indicator for fish fitness. Therefore, somatic growth, as a main biological process, is ecologically and economically significant. The growth differences of two closely related salmonids, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and maraena whitefsh (Coregonus maraena), have not been adequately studied as a comparative study and are therefore insufficiently understood. For this reason, our aim was to examine muscle growth in more detail and provide a first complex insight into the growth and muscle metabolism of these two fish species at slaughter size. In addition to skeletal muscle composition (including nuclear counting and staining of stem and progenitor cells), biochemical characteristics, and enzyme activity (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase) of rainbow trout and maraena whitefish were determined. Our results indicate that red muscle contains cells with a smaller diameter compared to white muscle and those fibres had more stem and progenitor cells as a proportion of total nuclei. Interestingly, numerous interspecies differences were identified; in rainbow trout muscle RNA content, intermediate fibres and fibre diameter and in whitefish red muscle cross-sectional area, creatine kinase activity were higher compared to the other species at slaughter weight. The proportional reduction in red muscle area, accompanied by an increase in DNA content and a lower activity of creatine kinase, exhibited a higher degree of hypertrophic growth in rainbow trout compared to maraena whitefish, which makes this species particularly successful as an aquaculture species."
https://openalex.org/W3189893067,"In searching for novel targeted therapeutic agents for lung cancer treatment, norcycloartocarpin from Artocarpus gomezianus was reported in this study to promisingly interacted with Akt and exerted the apoptosis induction and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition suppression. Selective cytotoxic profile of norcycloartocarpin was evidenced with approximately 2-fold higher IC50 in normal dermal papilla cells (DPCs) compared with human lung cancer A549, H460, H23, and H292 cells. We found that norcycloartocarpin suppressed anchorage-independent growth, cell migration, invasion, filopodia formation, and decreased EMT in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h, which were correlated with reduced protein levels of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug, p-FAK, p-Akt, as well as Cdc42. In addition, norcycloartocarpin activated apoptosis caspase cascade associating with restoration of p53, down-regulated Bcl-2 and augmented Bax in A549 and H460 cells. Interestingly, norcycloartocarpin showed potential inhibitory role on protein kinase B (Akt) the up-stream dominant molecule controlling EMT and apoptosis. Computational molecular docking analysis further confirmed that norcycloartocarpin has the best binding affinity of -12.52 kcal/mol with Akt protein at its critical active site. As Akt has recently recognized as an attractive molecular target for therapeutic approaches, these findings support its use as a plant-derived anticancer agent in cancer therapy."

The aim of the study was to assess changes in ion transport, measured as values of transepithelial electric resistance and potential difference in stationary conditions and during mechanical-chemical stimulations, depending on the hydration status of isolated rabbit skin specimens. The specimens were divided into five groups: control (n = 22), dehydrated in 10% NaCl (n = 30), rehydrated after dehydration (n = 26), dried at 37°C (n = 26), and rehydrated after drying (n = 25). Dehydrated tissue samples showed altered resistance compared to the control; this change was maintained regardless of rehydration. In the dehydrated samples, changes in the measured electric potential were also noted, which returned to values comparable with the control after rehydration. Dehydrated skin, regardless of the cause of dehydration, responds with changes in the transport of sodium and chloride ions and the altered cellular microenvironment. It could influence the perception of stimuli, particularly pain, and slow down the regeneration processes."
https://openalex.org/W3191420269,"Objective To explore the regulation of microRNA-29a (miR-29a) on FOS in human nasal epithelial cells and its molecular mechanism, as well as the effects of miR-29a on the cell proliferation and apoptosis. Methods By cell transfection, gene silencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry and TUNEL assay (for cell apoptosis), CCK-8 assay (for cell proliferation), dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Western Blot, it was validated that miR-29a promoted the proliferation of human nasal epithelial cells and inhibited their apoptosis by down-regulating FOS expression in RPMI2650 and HNEpC cell lines. Results ①Compared with healthy controls, miR-29a expression was up-regulated and FOS mRNA expression was down-regulated in the nasal tissues from the patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). ②MiR-29a over-expression promoted the proliferation of RPMI2650 cells and HNEpC cells but inhibited their apoptosis. ③MiR-29a targeted at FOS. ④MiR-29a over-expression and FOS silencing both significantly promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis. After transfection with both miR-29a and FOS, there was a decrease in the proliferation but an increase in the apoptosis of cells.⑤MiR-29a promoted the proliferation of human nasal epithelial cells and inhibited their apoptosis by down-regulating FOS expression. Conclusion MiR-29a-/FOS axis can be regarded as a potential marker and a new therapy for AR."
https://openalex.org/W3192409132,"Association between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) morbidity and ambient temperature has been examined with generalized linear model (GLM) or generalized additive model (GAM). However, the effect size by these two methods might be biased due to the autocorrelation of time series data and arbitrary selection of degree of freedom of natural cubic splines. The present study analyzed how the climatic factors affected AMI morbidity for older adults in Shanghai with Mixed generalized additive model (MGAM) that addressed these shortcomings mentioned. Autoregressive random effect was used to model the relationship between AMI and temperature, PM 10 , week days and time. The degree of freedom of time was chosen based on the seasonal pattern of temperature. The performance of MGAM was compared with GAM on autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF) and goodness of fit. One-year predictions of AMI counts in 2011 were conducted using MGAM with the moving average. Between 2007 and 2011, MGAM adjusted the autocorrelation of AMI time series and captured the seasonal pattern after choosing the degree of freedom of time at 5. Using MGAM, results were well fitted with data in terms of both internal (R 2 = 0.86) and external validity (correlation coefficient = 0.85). The risk of AMI was relatively high in low temperature (Risk ratio = 0.988 (95% CI 0.984, 0.993) for under 12°C) and decreased as temperature increased and speeded up within the temperature zone from 12°C to 26°C (Risk ratio = 0.975 (95% CI 0.971, 0.979), but it become increasing again when it is 26°C although not significantly (Risk ratio = 0.999 (95% CI 0.986, 1.012). MGAM is more appropriate than GAM in the scenario of response variable with autocorrelation and predictors with seasonal variation. The risk of AMI was comparatively higher when temperature was lower than 12°C in Shanghai as a typical representative location of subtropical climate."
https://openalex.org/W3192437827,"Background Global mortality attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occurs in more than 36 million people annually with 80% of these deaths occurring in resource limited countries. Among people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA) studies have reported higher prevalence’s of NCDs compared to the general population but most studies do report a narrow range of NCDs commonly hypertension, diabetes and neoplasms and not all. In addition, there is limited reporting, integration of systematic screening and treatment for all NCDs among PLHA attending care, suggesting the NCD burden among PLHA is likely an underestimate. Little is known about factors facilitating or hindering integration of the care and treatment of NCDs within HIV care and treatment clinics (CTCs) in Tanzania. Objective To explore the perceptions of PLHA and health workers on factors facilitate or hinder the recognition and integration of care for NCDs within CTCs in Dar es Salaam. Methods Inductive content analysis of transcripts from 41 in-depth interviews were conducted with 5 CTC managers (CTC Managers), 9 healthcare providers (DHCP) and 27 people living with HIV (PLHA) attending CTCs and with co-morbid NCDs. Results Four themes emerged; the current situation of services available for care and treatment of NCDs among PLHA in CTCs, experiences of PLHA with co-morbid NCDs with access to care and treatment services for NCDs, facilitators of integrating care and treatment of NCDs within CTCs and perceived barriers for accessing and integration of care and treatment of NCDs within CTCs. Conclusions There was a positive attitude among PLHA and healthcare workers towards integration of NCD services within CTC services. This was enhanced by perceived benefits inherent to the services. Factors hindering integration of NCD care and services included; limited and inconsistent supplies such as screening equipment, medications; insufficient awareness of NCDs within PLHA; lack of adequate training of healthcare workers on management of NCD and treatment costs and payment systems."
https://openalex.org/W3192935609,"Purpose To evaluate the reliability of ultrasound hepatorenal index (US-HRI) and magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) techniques in the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis, with magnetic resonance spectroscopy proton density fat fraction (MRS-PDFF) as the reference standard. Materials and methods Fifty-two adult volunteers (30 men, 22 women; age, 31.5 ± 6.5 years) who had no history of kidney disease or viral/alcoholic hepatitis were recruited to undergo abdominal US, MRI, and MRS examinations. US-HRI was calculated from the average of three pairs of regions of interest (ROIs) measurements placed in the liver parenchyma and right renal cortex. On MRI, the six-point Dixon technique was employed for calculating proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). An MRS sequence with a typical voxel size of 27 ml was chosen to estimate MRS-PDFF as the gold standard. The data were evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results The Pearson correlation coefficients of US-HRI and MRI-PDFF with MRS-PDFF were 0.38 ( p = 0.005) and 0.95 ( p &lt;0.001), respectively. If MRS-PDFF ≥5.56% was defined as the gold standard of fatty liver disease, the areas under the curve (AUCs), cut-off values, sensitivities and specificities of US-HRI and MRI-PDFF were 0.74, 1.54, 50%, 91.7% and 0.99, 2.75%, 100%, 88.9%, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of US-HRI and MRI-PDFF were 0.70 and 0.85. Conclusion MRI-PDFF was more reliable than US-HRI in diagnosing hepatic steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W3193224802,"The essential medicine——insulin cannot be easily accessed and afforded in many countries. To help address this issue, we evaluated the availability, affordability and price of insulin products in Nanjing, eastern China. Two cross-sectional studies were conducted in 2016 and 2018. A total of 56 hospital pharmacies were sampled, using a simplified and adapted World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Prices were expressed as Median Price Ratios (MPRs) to Australian Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) prices. In addition, we investigated the price components of seven selected insulin products as a case study before and after the Online Centralized Procurement Policy for Hospital Drugs in May, 2018. Affordability was presented as the number of daily wages of the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) required to purchase 1000IU of insulin based on the average courses of treatment, approximately 30 days’ treatment. The availability of insulin products was very high in secondary hospitals and tertiary hospitals both in 2016 and 2018, but in community hospitals was very low. In 2018, the availability of prandial insulin products showed fluctuation compared to 2016. The availability of pre-mixed human insulin products was over 95% overall, and also very high (80%) in community hospitals in 2018. The prices of insulin products were much lower than PBS prices of Australian in this study, with the MPRs less than 1 (0.32 to 0.71 in 2016 vs. 0.30 to 0.68 in 2018) for all insulin types. But insulin products in Nanjing in 2016 and 2018 were considered unaffordable, because the number of daily wages of the LPGW needed to purchase for the 30 days treatment of insulin products ranged from 2.26 to 8.49 in 2016 and 1.88 to 7.09 in 2018. The manufacturers’ selling price contributed the main part (74.15% to 77.70% before and 74.86% to 91.51% after the implementation of the bidding policy) of the price components of target insulin brands. The availability of insulin products was high in secondary hospitals and tertiary hospitals, but lower in community hospitals. However, the affordability in community hospitals was better than other hospitals, but the insulin products were still unaffordable for patients on low incomes. Further improvements of the availability accessibility and affordability of medicines in advancing health insurance policies and lowering drug prices should be put forward."
https://openalex.org/W3188137997,"Indirect reciprocity has been proposed to explain prosocial behavior among strangers, whereby the prosocial act is returned by a third party. However, what happens if the prosocial act cannot be observed by the third party? Here, we examine whether empathy serves as a clue for prosociality and whether people are more generous toward more empathetic people. In a laboratory study, we measured prosocial behavior as the amount sent in the dictator game and empathy based on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). By using an incentivized task, we find that people believe that more empathetic participants send more money in the dictator game. Thus, people see empathy as a clue for prosocial behavior. Furthermore, in a second dictator game, participants indirectly reciprocate by sending more money to more empathetic recipients. Therefore, we suggest that empathy can replace a reputation derived from observable prosocial behavior in triggering indirect reciprocity."
https://openalex.org/W3188814933,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is an important gene complex contributing to adaptive immunity. Studies of platyrrhine MHC have focused on identifying experimental models of immune system function in the equivalent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA). These genes have thus been explored primarily in captive platyrrhine individuals from research colonies. However, investigations of standing MHC variation and evolution in wild populations are essential to understanding its role in immunity, sociality and ecology. Capuchins are a promising model group exhibiting the greatest habitat diversity, widest diet breadth and arguably the most social complexity among platyrrhines, together likely resulting in varied immunological challenges. We use high-throughput sequencing to characterize polymorphism in four Class II DR and DQ exons for the first time in seven capuchin species. We find evidence for at least three copies for DQ genes and at least five for DRB, with possible additional unrecovered diversity. Our data also reveal common genotypes that are inherited across our most widely sampled population, Cebus imitator in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Notably, phylogenetic analyses reveal that platyrrhine DQA sequences form a monophyletic group to the exclusion of all Catarrhini sequences examined. This result is inconsistent with the trans -species hypothesis for MHC evolution across infraorders in Primates and provides further evidence for the independent origin of current MHC genetic diversity in Platyrrhini. Identical allele sharing across cebid species, and more rarely genera, however, does underscore the complexity of MHC gene evolution and the need for more comprehensive assessments of allelic diversity and genome structure."
https://openalex.org/W3188962242,"Background This study aimed to describe the burden, treatment patterns and, age threshold for predicting hypertension among rural adults in Nyive in the Ho Municipality of the Volta Region, Ghana. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study design was employed. A total of 417 adults aged 20 years and above were randomly selected from households within the Nyive community. The WHO STEPwise approach for non-communicable diseases risk factor surveillance (STEPS) instrument was used to obtain socio-demographic and clinical information including age, gender, educational background, marital status, and occupation as well as hypertension treatment information. Blood pressure was measured using standard methods. The risk of hypertension and the critical age at risk of hypertension was determined using binary logistic regression model and the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results The direct and indirect age-standardized hypertension prevalence was higher in males (562.58/487.34 per 1000 residents) compared to the females (489.42/402.36 per 1000 residents). The risk of hypertension among the study population increased by 4.4% (2.9%-5.9% at 95% CI) for one year increase in age while the critical age at risk of hypertension was &gt;39 years among females and &gt;35 years among males. About 64(46.72%) of the hypertensive participants were not on treatment whereas only 42(30.66%) had their blood pressure controlled. Conclusion Rural hypertension is high among adults in Nyive. The critical age at risk of hypertension was lower among males. The estimated annual increase of risk of hypertension was 4.7% for females and 3.1% for males. High levels of undiagnosed and non-treatment of hypertension and low levels of blood pressure control exist among the rural folks."

However, little attention has been paid to how antecedent childhood trauma among PWUD may contribute to the risk of victimization in adulthood.This study sought to examine the relationship between childhood physical abuse and victimization by physical assault among adult PWUD.Data were derived from three prospective cohorts of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada between 2005 and 2018.Childhood physical abuse was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Generalized linear mixed modeling was used to estimate the relationship between childhood physical abuse and subsequent violent victimization, after adjustment for potential confounders.Among 2960 PWUD, including 1018 (34.39%) female participants, 1030 (34.8%) participants reported a history of moderate to severe childhood physical abuse, and 949 (32.06%) participants reported recent violent victimization at baseline. In a multivariate analysis, childhood physical abuse (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.46) remained independently associated with violent victimization after adjustment for potential confounders.This study found a high prevalence of childhood physical abuse and that this was associated with a higher risk of subsequent violent victimization among PWUD in this setting. Greater support for PWUD with a history of childhood physical abuse is needed to decrease existing vulnerability to violence, including screening for and treatment of childhood trauma and related violence prevention."

Method This is a population-based study using the National Treatment Service Information System. The sample consists of persons 15 years and older, placed on treatment before and after Treat All was implemented, across all 4 regional health authorities in Jamaica. Patients were assessed for two binary outcomes: 1. stage at HIV diagnosis (early/baseline CD4 cell count ≧350 cells/mm 3 , or late/ baseline CD4 &lt;350 cells/mm 3 ), 2. viral load status achieved after ART initiation (suppressed/&lt;1000 copies/ml or non-suppressed/ ≥1000 copies/ml). Categorical variables: age/years, gender and health regions, were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported. Results After Treat All, there was an increase in median baseline CD4 results as the proportion of late diagnoses decreased from 60% to 39%. There was a small increase in viral suppression from 76% to 80%, a decrease in baseline viral load testing from 61% to 46% and an increase in the uptake of first viral load testing after starting treatment from 13% to 19%. Males and persons 40+ years had higher odds of late diagnosis before and after Treat All. Conclusion Jamaica’s HIV program outcomes have improved after Treat All was implemented. ART initiation time significantly decreased. Early diagnosis, viral load testing uptake and viral suppression increased. However, there is a need to implement targeted testing for men and persons over 40 years to decrease the frequency of late diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3189760113,"Objectives To assess the interobserver agreement in categories of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities using the Minnesota Code criteria. Methods We used a random sample of 180 ECGs from people with type 2 diabetes. ECG abnormalities were classified and coded using the Minnesota ECG Classification. Each ECG was independently rated on several abnormalities by an experienced rater (rater 1) and by two cardiologists (raters 2 and 3) trained to apply the Minnesota codes on four Minnesota codes; 1-codes as an indication for myocardial infarction, 4 en 5-codes as an indication for ischemic abnormalities, 3-codes as an indication for left ventricle hypertrophy, 7-1-codes as an indication for ventricular conduction abnormalities, and 8-3-codes as an indication for atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter. After all pairwise tables were summed, the overall agreement, the specific positive and negative agreement were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each abnormality. Also, Kappa’s with a 95% CI were calculated. Results The overall agreement (with 95% CI) were for myocardial infarction, ischemic abnormalities, left ventricle hypertrophy, conduction abnormalities and atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter respectively: 0.87 (0.84–0.91), 0.79 (0.74–0.84), 0.81 (0.76–0.85), 0.93 (0.90–0.95), 0.96 (0.93–0.97).

https://openalex.org/W3190112154,"Purpose The role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in orbital fibroblasts (OFs) is rarely known. In this study, we investigated the effect of FGF10 on fibrosis and the inflammation mechanism of Graves′ orbitopathy (GO). Methods Orbital tissue from GO (n = 15) and non-GO (n = 15) was obtained for this study. The mRNA and protein expression levels of FGF10 and FGF receptor 2b (FGFR2b) in orbital tissue were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and confocal microscopy. The effects of FGF10 on transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 induced fibrotic proteins and interleukin (IL)-1β- or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α- induced inflammatory proteins were investigated using recombinant human (rh) FGF10 and small interfering (si) RNA transfection against FGF10. Results FGF10 and FGFR2b mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in GO orbital tissues than in non-GO orbital tissues (p = 0.009 and 0.005, respectively). Immunostaining of FGF10 in orbital adipose tissues showed differences in FGF10 expression between GO and control samples. Immunostaining of FGF10 was very weak in the orbital tissues of GO patients. TGF-β1-induced fibronectin, collagen Iα, α-smooth muscle actin protein expression in GO OFs was attenuated by rhFGF10 treatment and increased by knockdown of FGF10 via siFGF10 transfection. Similarly, IL-1β- or TNF-α-induced IL-6, IL-8, and cyclooxygenase-2 protein production in GO OFs was either blocked by rhFGF10 treatment or further upregulated by inhibition of FGF10 via siFGF10 transfection. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that FGF10 has beneficial effects on the inflammatory and fibrotic mechanisms of GO in primary cultured OFs, providing new insights into GO pathology and the discovery of FGF10 as a promising novel therapeutic application for the treatment of GO."
https://openalex.org/W3190157138,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a highly prevalent herpes virus which persists as a latent infection and has been detected in several different tumor types. HCMV disease is rare but may occur in high-risk settings, often manifesting as a pulmonary infection. To date HCMV has not been investigated in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). In a consecutive case series of 144 MPM patients we evaluated two biomarkers of HCMV: IgG serostatus (defined as positive and negative) and DNAemia (>100 copies/mL of cell free HCMV DNA in serum). Approximately half of the MPM patient population was HCMV IgG seropositive (51%). HCMV DNAemia was highly prevalent (79%) in MPM and independent of IgG serostatus. DNAemia levels consistent with high level current infection (>1000 copies/mL serum) were present in 41% of patients. Neither IgG serostatus nor DNAemia were associated with patient survival. In tissues, we observed that HCMV DNA was present in 48% of tumors (n = 40) and only 29% of normal pleural tissue obtained from individuals without malignancy (n = 21). Our results suggest nearly half of MPM patients have a high level current HCMV infection at the time of treatment and that pleural tissue may be a reservoir for latent HCMV infection. These findings warrant further investigation to determine the full spectrum of pulmonary infections in MPM patients, and whether treatment for high level current HCMV infection may improve patient outcomes."

One pathway that DREAMS seeks to impact is to support AGYW to stay in school and achieve secondary education. We assessed the impact of DREAMS on educational outcomes among AGYW in Nairobi, Kenya.In two informal settlements in Nairobi, 1081 AGYW aged 15-22 years were randomly selected in 2017 and followed-up to 2019. AGYW reporting invitation to participate in DREAMS during 2017-18 were classified as ""DREAMS beneficiaries"". Our main outcome was being in school and/or completed lower secondary school in 2019. We used multivariable logistic regression to quantify the association between being a DREAMS beneficiary and the outcome; and a causal inference framework to estimate proportions achieving the outcome if all, versus no, AGYW were DREAMS beneficiaries, adjusting for the propensity to be a DREAMS beneficiary. Of AGYW enrolled in 2017, 79% (852/1081) were followed-up to 2019. In unadjusted analysis, DREAMS beneficiaries had higher attainment than non-beneficiaries (85% vs 75% in school or completed lower secondary school, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.9; 95%CI: 1.3,2.8). The effect weakened with adjustment for age and other confounders, (adjusted OR = 1.4; 95%CI: 0.9,2.4). From the causal analysis, evidence was weak for an impact of DREAMS (estimated 83% vs 79% in school or completed lower secondary school, if all vs no AGYW were beneficiaries, difference = 4%; 95%CI: -2,11%). Among AGYW out of school at baseline, the estimated differences were 21% (95%CI: -3,43%) among 15-17 year olds; and 4% (95%CI: -8,17%) among 18-22 year olds.DREAMS had a modest impact on educational attainment among AGYW in informal settlements in Kenya, by supporting both retention and re-enrolment in school. Larger impact might be achieved if more AGYW were reached with educational subsidies, alongside other DREAMS interventions."

However, knowledge of microbial ecology and microbial interactions determining the efficiency of plants for oil-produced wastewater is limited. Here, we performed 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to elucidate the microbial composition and potential microbial functions in a full-scale well-worked offshore oil-produced wastewater treatment plant. Results showed that microbes that inhabited the plant were diverse and originated from oil and marine associated environments. The upstream physical and chemical treatments resulted in low microbial diversity. Organic pollutants were digested in the anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) dominantly through fermentation combined with sulfur compounds respiration. Three aerobic parallel reactors (APRs) harbored different microbial groups that performed similar potential functions, such as hydrocarbon degradation, acidogenesis, photosynthetic assimilation, and nitrogen removal. Microbial characteristics were important to the performance of oil-produced wastewater treatment plants with biological processes."

There is no adequately validated Arabic instrument that examines the level of assertiveness among Arabic-speaking undergraduate nursing students.The purpose of this study was to translate, then evaluate the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Irish Assertiveness Scale among Saudi undergraduate nursing students and interns.Cross-sectional survey.Three nursing colleges from three provinces in Saudi Arabia: Riyadh, Eastern and Makkah provinces.283 questionnaires were completed by 3rd and 4th year undergraduate nursing students, and nursing interns.A standard procedure including forward-backward translation, cultural adaptation and pilot testing was adopted to translate the Irish Assertiveness Scale into Arabic language. Content validity was measured using content validity index. Scale reliability was measured using cronbach's alpha coefficient and mean inter-item correlation. The sample was randomly split, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was then conducted on each sample to examine the construct validity of the proposed scale. A subsequent convergent validity and discriminant validity were also tested.The item-level content validity index ranged from 0.9 to 1.0, and the overall content validity index was 0.93. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in 23-items, four-factor solution explaining 49.4% of the total variance. The mean inter-item correlation for each factor ranged between 0.22 and 0.4. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the overall scale was 0.80. The confirmatory factor analysis showed that the proposed four-factor solution had the best model fit. Whilst discriminant validity was supported in the new model, convergent validity was partially met.This study contributed toward establishing the Arabic version of the Irish Assertiveness Scale. Considering the limitations of the convergent validity demonstrated in the new instrument, a modified version of the Irish Assertiveness Scale might be needed to ascertain the most feasible model which best captures the level of assertiveness in Arabic cultural context."
https://openalex.org/W3187970018,"It can be difficult for anesthesiologists to determine the optimal dose of propofol for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients due to changes in drug disposition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potency of propofol for inducing loss of consciousness in ESKD patients. Patients with normal kidney function (Control group, n = 15), those with ESKD (ESKD group, n = 15), and those with ESKD undergoing cervical epidural anesthesia (ESKD-CEB group, n = 15) were administered propofol by target-controlled infusion (TCI) using the Schneider model. The effect-site concentration ( Ce ) of propofol started at 0.5 μg/ml and increased in increments of 0.5 μg/ml until the patient did not respond to verbal commands. The relationship between the probability ( P ) of loss of consciousness and the Ce of propofol was analyzed in each group using logistic regression. The Ce values of propofol at the time of loss of consciousness were 4.3 ± 0.9, 3.7 ± 0.9, and 3.3 ± 1.0 μ g/ml for the Control, ESKD, and ESKD-CEB* groups, respectively (*significant difference vs. control, P &lt; 0.05). The estimated Ce 50 values for lost ability to respond to verbal command were 4.56, 3.75, and 3.21 μ g/ml for the Control, ESKD, and ESKD-CEB groups, respectively. In conclusion, when inducing anesthesia in ESKD patients, we recommend using an initial dose similar to that of patients with normal kidney function, or rather starting with a lower dose."
https://openalex.org/W3188448692,"Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi infection. It is a neglected tropical disease with considerable impact on the physical, psychological, familiar, and social spheres. The Valle Alto of Cochabamba is a hyperendemic region of Bolivia where efforts to control the transmission of the disease have progressed over the years. However, many challenges remain, above all, timely detection and health-care access.Following the Science Shop process, this bottom-up research emerged with the participation of the civil society from Valle Alto and representatives of the Association of Corazones Unidos por el Chagas from Cochabamba. The aim of this study is to explore the social determinants in the living realities of those affected by Chagas disease or the silent infection and how families in the Valle Alto of Cochabamba cope with it. An interdisciplinary research team conducted a case study of the life stories of three families using information from in-depth interviews and performed a descriptive qualitative content analysis and triangulation processes.Findings provide insights into social circumstances of the research subjects' lives; particularly, on how exposure to Trypanosoma cruzi infection affects their daily lives in terms of seeking comprehensive health care. Research subjects revealed needs and shared their experiences, thus providing an understanding of the complexity of Chagas disease from the socioeconomic, sociocultural, political, and biomedical perspectives. Results enlighten on three dimensions: structural, psychosocial, and plural health system. The diverse perceptions and attitudes toward Chagas within families, including the denial of its existence, are remarkable as gender and ethnocultural aspects. Findings support recommendations to various stakeholders and translation materials.Intersectional disease management and community involvement are essential for deciding the most appropriate and effective actions. Education, detection, health care, and social programs engaging family units ought to be the pillars of a promising approach."
https://openalex.org/W3188486624,"The recent research recommendations on the adaptations of poor are toward local specific investigations, aimed at a comprehensive understanding of the adaptation strategies through in-depth analysis of the status, and the explicit on how climate and non-climate global change processes constrain the inherent strategies. Intent to this idea, we have designed this study to assess the small-scale farmers' adaptation and coping strategies in southwestern Ethiopia.The agroecology approach steered in case-study design was used for the conceptual and analytical framework. The data collected from 335 households were analyzed for descriptive and multivariate analysis of variance and substantiated by qualitative data obtained through focused group discussion, interview, and observations.The significant differences were observed in the watershed among households in the case studies on their adoption of the identified adaptation and coping strategies. The sustainability of preferred strategies was different along case studies, solely determined by the impact magnitude of the adaptations constraining factors. Although free ecosystem-based strategies become less practical and replacing by new strategies in the watershed, the processes were gradual, internal to the community and managed through adaptive learning in the highland. However, the paths were perceived as toward maladaptive, resulted by the state interventions which disrupted free adaptations, deteriorated adaptive learning of the community, and shaped the adaptation responses toward the interventions in the kolla agroecology.The study implies that the situations of households' adaptation strategies are beyond the reflections of their respective production ecology, designated within climate variability in the previous studies. The structural land use dynamics and associated resource tenure insecurity have greater constraining effects on the strategies than the impacts of climate variability in the kolla. Thus, subsequent research interested in such contexts, and any plan for the development interventions should (re)consider the impacts of non-climate national/and global environmental change in shaping the adaptation and coping strategies of the local community."
https://openalex.org/W3188515167,"Background Successful health care and clinical services essentially depend on patients’ realization of ones’ rights, and health workers’ and facilities’ fulfillments and protections of these rights. However, little is documented about how patients and health workers perceive patients’ rights during care-seeking practices. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in four hospitals in Ethiopia through 8 focus group discussions with patients and 14 individual interviews with diverse groups of patients, caretakers, and 14 interviews with health workers. Participants were recruited through a purposive sampling method to meet the saturation of ideas about patients’ rights. The sampled patients, caretakers, and professionals were enlisted from various departments in the hospitals. The data analysis was assisted by ATLAS.ti 7.1.4 Results The study identified three major categories of healthcare rights (clinical, socio-cultural, and organizational), incorporating supporting elements of education, engagement, and empowerment. Study participants reported detailed rights the patients would have during hospital visits which included the right to timely access to care and treatment, adequate medications) with full respect, dignity, and without any discrimination. Patients widely perceived that they had the right to tell their illness history and know their illness in the language they can understand. It was also widely agreed that patients have the right to be educated and guided to make informed choices of services, procedures, and medications. Additionally, patients reported that they had the right to be accompanied by caretakers together with the right to use facilities and resources and get instructions on how to utilize these resources, the right to be protected from exposure to infections and unsafe conditions in hospitals, right to get a diet of their preference, and right to referral for further care. Nevertheless, there was a common concern among patients and caretakers that these rights were mostly non-existent in practice which were due to barriers related to patients (fear of consequence; a sense of dependency, feeling of powerlessness, perceptions of low medical literacy), health workers (negligence, lack of awareness and recognition of patient rights, undermining patients), and facilities’ readiness and support, including lack of guiding framework. Conclusions Perceived patients’ rights in the context of hospital visits were profoundly numerous, ranging from the right to access clinical and non-clinical services that are humanely respectful, fulfilling socio-cultural contexts, and in a manner that is organizationally coordinated. Nonetheless, the rights were not largely realized and fulfilled. Engaging, educating, and empowering patients, caretakers, and health care providers supported with policy framework could help to move towards patient-centered and right-based healthcare whereby patients’ rights are protected and fulfilled in such resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3191435276,"Mitral valve disease (MVD) is an important and most frequently acquired heart disease found in dogs. MVD is classified into different stages according to its severity. There is a challenge in differentiation between asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of the MVD. Moreover, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication in dogs affected by MVD. In clinical practice, there are also some limitations to identify PH. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a technique that can characterize specific patterns of peptide mass called peptide barcodes from various samples. Besides, in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), potential peptide sequences associated with specific conditions could be identified. The present study aimed to use MALDI-TOF coupled with LC-MS/MS to characterize specific peptide barcodes and potential peptide candidates in serum samples from healthy dogs, dogs with MVD stage B (MVD B, asymptomatic stage), MVD stage C (MVD C, symptomatic stage), MVD stage B with PH (MVD B PH), and MVD stage C with PH (MVD C PH). Discrete clusters of the 5 sample groups were identified by 3D plot analysis. Peptide barcodes also revealed differences in peptide patterns among the 5 groups. Six amino acid sequences of peptide candidates at 1,225.60, 1,363.85, 1,688.71, 1789.52, 2020.21, and 2156.42 Da were identified as part of the proteins CLCN1, CLUL1, EDNRA, PTEN, SLC39A7, and CLN6, respectively. The network interactions between these discovered proteins and common cardiovascular drugs were also investigated. These results demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS has promise as an optional technique for diagnosing dogs affected by asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of MVD with and without PH. Further studies are required to identify peptide barcodes in dogs with other diseases to create peptide barcode databases in veterinary medicine before using this method as a novel diagnostic tool in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3192332439,"Pneumonia is a common and severe complication of abdominal surgery, it is associated with increased length of hospital stay, healthcare costs, and mortality. Further, pulmonary complication rates have risen during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This study explored the potential cost-effectiveness of administering preoperative chlorhexidine mouthwash versus no-mouthwash at reducing postoperative pneumonia among abdominal surgery patients.A decision analytic model taking the South African healthcare provider perspective was constructed to compare costs and benefits of mouthwash versus no-mouthwash-surgery at 30 days after abdominal surgery. We assumed two scenarios: (i) the absence of COVID-19; (ii) the presence of COVID-19. Input parameters were collected from published literature including prospective cohort studies and expert opinion. Effectiveness was measured as proportion of pneumonia patients. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of parameter uncertainties. The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were presented using cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.In the absence of COVID-19, mouthwash had lower average costs compared to no-mouthwash-surgery, $3,675 (R 63,770) versus $3,958 (R 68,683), and lower proportion of pneumonia patients, 0.029 versus 0.042 (dominance of mouthwash intervention). In the presence of COVID-19, the increase in pneumonia rate due to COVID-19, made mouthwash more dominant as it was more beneficial to reduce pneumonia patients through administering mouthwash. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves shown that mouthwash surgery is likely to be cost-effective between $0 (R0) and $15,000 (R 260,220) willingness to pay thresholds.Both the absence and presence of SARS-CoV-2, mouthwash is likely to be cost saving intervention for reducing pneumonia after abdominal surgery. However, the available evidence for the effectiveness of mouthwash was extrapolated from cardiac surgery; there is now an urgent need for a robust clinical trial on the intervention on non-cardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3193188514,"The importance of an interaction between trunk stability muscles and hip muscle function has been suggested. However, reported exercises rarely act on the trunk and hip muscles simultaneously. Here, we devised an abdominal oblique and hip muscle exercise, the Self-oblique exercise (SOE). We examined whether SOE activated abdominal and hip muscles in the supine and half-kneeling positions, compared with abdominal crunch (AC) and plank exercises; and whether participants could modulate the exercise load. Participants were 20 healthy males with some sports experience such as football and baseball on average 10.5 ± 4.0 years. Participants applied self-pressure to their right thighs using the contralateral upper limb with 40% or 70% of the maximum force in Supine SOE and Half- kneeling SOE. The following abdominal and hip muscles were measured using surface electromyography: bilateral external obliques (EO), bilateral internal obliques (IO), right rectus abdominis, right gluteus medius (GMed), and right adductor longus (ADD). All evaluated muscle groups showed significant differences between exercises (p < 0.001). Supine SOE-70% showed 80.4% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for left EO (p < 0.017), 61.4% MVC for right IO (p < 0.027), 24.3% MVC for GMed (p < 0.002), and 42.4% MVC for ADD (p < 0.004); these were significantly greatest among all exercises. Muscle activity during Supine SOE-70% was greater than that during Supine SOE-40%. Similarly, Half-kneeling SOE-40% promoted abdominal and hip muscle exertion, and showed more significant activity in GMed (p < 0.006) and ADD (p < 0.001) than AC and plank. SOE could activate abdominal and hip muscles depends on the pressure applied by upper limb. Also, SOE allows participants to modulate the exercise load in a self-controlled step by step manner. Modulation of the exercise load is difficult in AC or plank compared to SOE, and AC or plank cannot obtain simultaneous oblique and hip muscle activity. SOE could be practiced anywhere, in various positions, without any tools."
https://openalex.org/W3187148614,"Aim To describe the prevalence of health care utilisation and out-of-pocket expenditure associated with the management of diabetes among Australian women aged 45 years and older. Design Cross-sectional survey design. Methods The questionnaire was administered to 392 women (a cohort of the 45 and Up Study) reporting a diagnosis of diabetes between August and November 2016. It asked about the use of conventional medicine, complementary medicine (CM) and self-prescribed treatments for diabetes and associated out-of-pocket spending. Results Most women (88.3%; n = 346) consulted at least one health care practitioner in the previous 12 months for their diabetes; 84.6% (n = 332) consulted a doctor, 44.4% (n = 174) consulted an allied health practitioner, and 20.4% (n = 80) consulted a CM practitioner. On average, the combined annual out-of-pocket health care expenditure was AU$492.6 per woman, which extrapolated to approximately AU$252 million per annum. Of this total figure, approximately AU$70 million was spent on CM per annum. Conclusions Women with diabetes use a diverse range of health services and incur significant out-of-pocket expense to manage their health. The degree to which the health care services women received were coordinated, or addressed their needs and preferences, warrants further exploration. Limitations of this study include the use of self-report and inability to generalise findings to other populations."
https://openalex.org/W3189056947,"Objective Cesarean section (CS) rates are rising rapidly around the world but no conclusive evidence has been obtained about the possible short- and long-term effects of CS on child behavior. We evaluated prospectively the association between CS and infant temperament across the first 9 postpartum months, controlling for indications for CS and investigating parity and infant sex as moderators. Methods The sample consisted of mothers and their healthy infants. Infant temperament was measured using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire completed by the mothers at 6 weeks (n = 452) and 9 months (n = 258) postpartum. Mode of birth was classified into spontaneous vaginal birth (n = 347 for 6 weeks sample; 197 for 9 months sample), CS planned for medical reasons (n = 55; 28) and emergency CS (n = 50; 33). Results Multiple regression analysis revealed no main effects of birth mode, but showed a significant interaction between birth mode and parity indicating that emergency CS in firstborn infants was associated with more difficult temperament at 6 weeks. There were no significant associations between indications for CS and infant temperament, although breech presentation predicted difficult temperament at 9 months. Conclusion We largely failed to support the association between CS and infant temperament. Although our results suggest that emergency CS may be associated with temperament in firstborns, further research is needed to replicate this finding, preferably using observational measures to assess child temperament."
