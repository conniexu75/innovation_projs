https://openalex.org/W2107369528,"The gastrointestinal tract of mammals is inhabited by hundreds of distinct species of commensal microorganisms that exist in a mutualistic relationship with the host. How commensal microbiota influence the host immune system is poorly understood. We show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB), is sufficient to induce the appearance of CD4+ T helper cells that produce IL-17 and IL-22 (Th17 cells) in the lamina propria. SFB adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with Th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few Th17 cells. Colonization with SFB was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and antimicrobial defenses and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Thus, manipulation of this commensal-regulated pathway may provide new opportunities for enhancing mucosal immunity and treating autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2004849589,"Circadian clocks coordinate behavioral and physiological processes with daily light-dark cycles by driving rhythmic transcription of thousands of genes. Whereas the master clock in the brain is set by light, pacemakers in peripheral organs, such as the liver, are reset by food availability, although the setting, or ""entrainment,"" mechanisms remain mysterious. Studying mouse fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks. Thus, phosphorylation by AMPK enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral organs."
https://openalex.org/W2043930451,"Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) present a barrier to axon regeneration. However, no specific receptor for the inhibitory effect of CSPGs has been identified. We showed that a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPsigma, binds with high affinity to neural CSPGs. Binding involves the chondroitin sulfate chains and a specific site on the first immunoglobulin-like domain of PTPsigma. In culture, PTPsigma(-/-) neurons show reduced inhibition by CSPG. A PTPsigma fusion protein probe can detect cognate ligands that are up-regulated specifically at neural lesion sites. After spinal cord injury, PTPsigma gene disruption enhanced the ability of axons to penetrate regions containing CSPG. These results indicate that PTPsigma can act as a receptor for CSPGs and may provide new therapeutic approaches to neural regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2157197837,"Background Listening to music is amongst the most rewarding experiences for humans. Music has no functional resemblance to other rewarding stimuli, and has no demonstrated biological value, yet individuals continue listening to music for pleasure. It has been suggested that the pleasurable aspects of music listening are related to a change in emotional arousal, although this link has not been directly investigated. In this study, using methods of high temporal sensitivity we investigated whether there is a systematic relationship between dynamic increases in pleasure states and physiological indicators of emotional arousal, including changes in heart rate, respiration, electrodermal activity, body temperature, and blood volume pulse. Methodology Twenty-six participants listened to self-selected intensely pleasurable music and “neutral” music that was individually selected for them based on low pleasure ratings they provided on other participants' music. The “chills” phenomenon was used to index intensely pleasurable responses to music. During music listening, continuous real-time recordings of subjective pleasure states and simultaneous recordings of sympathetic nervous system activity, an objective measure of emotional arousal, were obtained. Principal Findings Results revealed a strong positive correlation between ratings of pleasure and emotional arousal. Importantly, a dissociation was revealed as individuals who did not experience pleasure also showed no significant increases in emotional arousal. Conclusions/Significance These results have broader implications by demonstrating that strongly felt emotions could be rewarding in themselves in the absence of a physically tangible reward or a specific functional goal."
https://openalex.org/W1988201931,"The processes that drive fibrotic diseases are complex and include an influx of peripheral blood monocytes that can differentiate into fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes. Monocytes can also differentiate into other cell types, such as tissue macrophages. The ability to discriminate between monocytes, macrophages, fibrocytes, and fibroblasts in fibrotic lesions could be beneficial in identifying therapies that target either stromal fibroblasts or fibrocytes.We have identified markers that discriminate between human peripheral blood monocytes, tissue macrophages, fibrocytes, and fibroblasts. Amongst these four cell types, only peripheral blood monocytes express the combination of CD45RO, CD93, and S100A8/A9; only macrophages express the combination of CD45RO, 25F9, S100A8/A9, and PM-2K; only fibrocytes express the combination of CD45RO, 25F9, and S100A8/A9, but not PM-2K; and only fibroblasts express the combination of CD90, cellular fibronectin, hyaluronan, and TE-7. These markers are effective both in vitro and in sections from human lung. We found that markers such as CD34, CD68, and collagen do not effectively discriminate between the four cell types. In addition, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, IFN-gamma, and SAP differentially regulate the expression of CD32, CD163, CD172a, and CD206 on both macrophages and fibrocytes. Finally, CD49c (alpha3 integrin) expression identifies a subset of fibrocytes, and this subset increases with time in culture.These results suggest that discrimination of monocytes, macrophages, fibrocytes, and fibroblasts in fibrotic lesions is possible, and this may allow for an assessment of fibrocytes in fibrotic diseases."

The recently launched Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has completed its first all-sky maps of the interstellar interaction at the edge of the heliosphere by imaging energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) emanating from this region. We found a bright ribbon of ENA emission, unpredicted by prior models or theories, that may be ordered by the local interstellar magnetic field interacting with the heliosphere. This ribbon is superposed on globally distributed flux variations ordered by both the solar wind structure and the direction of motion through the interstellar medium. Our results indicate that the external galactic environment strongly imprints the heliosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1967999836,"Placebo analgesia is a prime example of the impact that psychological factors have on pain perception. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human spinal cord to test the hypothesis that placebo analgesia results in a reduction of nociceptive processing in the spinal cord. In line with behavioral data that show decreased pain responses under placebo, pain-related activity in the spinal cord is strongly reduced under placebo. These results provide direct evidence for spinal inhibition as one mechanism of placebo analgesia and highlight that psychological factors can act on the earliest stages of pain processing in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2152269520,"Golgi membranes, from yeast to humans, are uniquely enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), although the role of this lipid remains poorly understood. Using a proteomic lipid-binding screen, we identify the Golgi protein GOLPH3 (also called GPP34, GMx33, MIDAS, or yeast Vps74p) as a PtdIns(4)P-binding protein that depends on PtdIns(4)P for its Golgi localization. We further show that GOLPH3 binds the unconventional myosin MYO18A, thus connecting the Golgi to F-actin. We demonstrate that this linkage is necessary for normal Golgi trafficking and morphology. The evidence suggests that GOLPH3 binds to PtdIns(4)P-rich trans-Golgi membranes and MYO18A conveying a tensile force required for efficient tubule and vesicle formation. Consequently, this tensile force stretches the Golgi into the extended ribbon observed by fluorescence microscopy and the familiar flattened form observed by electron microscopy."

Mutations in the Frizzled-4 (Fz4) receptor, Lrp5 coreceptor, or Norrin ligand cause retinal hypovascularization, but the mechanisms by which Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling controls vascular development have not been defined. Using mouse genetic and cell culture models, we show that loss of Fz4 signaling in endothelial cells causes defective vascular growth, which leads to chronic but reversible silencing of retinal neurons. Loss of Fz4 in all endothelial cells disrupts the blood brain barrier in the cerebellum, whereas excessive Fz4 signaling disrupts embryonic angiogenesis. Sox17, a transcription factor that is upregulated by Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling, plays a central role in inducing the angiogenic program controlled by Norrin/Fz4/Lrp.

The mature vasculature can be divided into arteries, veins, and capillaries, and vascular cells into endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells (MCs), with additional anatomic, cellular, and molecular diversity in each of these categories. The vasculature is generated by precisely orchestrated patterns of vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis followed by remodeling and stabilization concurrent with the establishment of EC-MC interactions (Armulik et al., 2005Armulik A. Abramsson A. Betsholtz C. Endothelial/pericyte interactions.Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). In keeping with the complexity of vascular development and structure, multiple cell signaling systems—including the VEGF, Netrin, Ephrin, Notch, and Angiopoietin systems—have been implicated in coordinating the proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation of vascular cells (Adams and Alitalo, 2007Adams R.H. Alitalo K. Molecular regulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the retinal vasculature. This vasculature plays a central role in a variety of ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (Gariano and Gardner, 2005Gariano R.F. Gardner T.W. Retinal angiogenesis in development and disease.Nature. 2005; 438: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The retinal vasculature presents a simple and stereotyped architecture. The major arteries and veins reside on the vitreal face of the retina and are oriented radially from their origin at the optic disc. They give rise to a series of smaller vessels that penetrate the retina and connect to a pair of planar capillary beds flanking a central layer of neurons (the inner nuclear layer). In the mouse, as in other mammals, the initial phase of retinal vascular development is characterized by radial growth from the optic disc, followed by the development of the intraretinal capillaries. An unusual signaling system with profound effects on retinal vascular development has emerged from the study of Norrie disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), and osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (Berger and Ropers, 2001Berger W. Ropers H.H. Norrie disease.in: Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Eighth Edition.

In these genetic diseases, retinal hypovascularization is caused by partial or complete loss-of-function mutations in the genes coding for the cystine knot protein Norrin, the integral membrane receptor Frizzled-4 (Fz4), or the Fz4 coreceptor Lrp5, respectively. The similar retinal hypovascularization phenotypes observed in Ndp (Norrie disease protein), Fz4, or Lrp5 loss-of-function mouse models, the high affinity and specificity of Norrin-Fz4 binding, and the potent activation of canonical Wnt signaling following coexpression of Norrin, Fz4, and Lrp5 imply that Norrin is an in vivo ligand for Fz4 (Kato et al., 2002Kato M.

These observations raise a series of interrelated questions that are central to understanding the cellular basis and functional significance of Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling. Is the primary site of Fz4 signaling—and hence the primary cellular defect in inherited diseases in which this system is impaired—neuronal, glial, or vascular? At the physiological and behavioral levels, what aspects of visual function are impaired by vascular defects that result from loss of Fz4 signaling? What cellular processes in vascular development require Fz4 signaling in the intact animal and in cell culture? Is Fz4 signaling a general feature of vascular development outside of the retina? Does Fz4 signaling alter gene expression, and, if so, how does this relate to vascular development? In the present work, we have addressed these questions by studying the effects of gain and/or loss of Fz4 signaling in vivo and in cell culture. To assess the pattern of Fz4 expression and to permit cell type-specific deletion of Fz4 while simultaneously marking cells, we generated the Fz4 conditional knockout (CKO) allele Fz4CKOAP (Figure 1A). In the absence of Cre-mediated recombination, Fz4CKOAP functions as a wild-type (WT) allele and the distal alkaline phosphatase (AP) is not expressed. Cre-mediated recombination excises the Fz4 coding and 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and places AP under the control of the Fz4 promoter. Thus, Cre-mediated recombination converts Fz4CKOAP/+ cells into phenotypically WT Fz4AP/+ cells. When Fz4CKOAP is in combination with a conventional Fz4 knockout allele (Wang et al., 2001Wang Y. Huso D. Cahill H. Ryugo D. Nathans J. Progressive cerebellar, auditory, and esophageal dysfunction caused by targeted disruption of the frizzled-4 gene.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4761-4771PubMed Google Scholar), Cre-mediated recombination converts phenotypically WT Fz4CKOAP/− cells into mutant Fz4AP/− cells. In Fz4CKOAP/+;Sox2-Cre mice, which produce Cre ubiquitously (Hayashi et al., 2002Hayashi S. Lewis P. Pevny L. McMahon A.P. Efficient gene modulation in mouse epiblast using a Sox2Cre transgenic mouse strain.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2002; 2: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the AP reporter is seen throughout the vasculature starting at embryonic day (E)8. Following Cre-mediated recombination in ECs (Fz4CKOAP/+;Tie2-Cre; Figure 1B; Kisanuki et al., 2001Kisanuki Y.Y. Hammer R.E. Miyazaki J. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Yanagisawa M.

Shani M. Zicha D. Adams R.H. Ephrin-B2 controls cell motility and adhesion during blood-vessel-wall assembly.Cell. 2006; 124: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), Fz4AP expression is maintained through adulthood (Figure S1 available online). In the retina, Fz4 is expressed in ECs, MCs, photoreceptors, and a subset of inner retinal neurons (Figure S1C–S1E; Wang et al., 2001Wang Y. Huso D. Cahill H. Ryugo D. Nathans J. Progressive cerebellar, auditory, and esophageal dysfunction caused by targeted disruption of the frizzled-4 gene.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4761-4771PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the cell type(s) responsible for the Fz4−/− retinal vascular phenotype, we deleted Fz4 in ECs with Tie2-Cre, in MCs with PDGFRB-Cre (Cre-mediated recombination in this case is incomplete), and in most or all retinal neurons and glia with Rx-Cre (Swindell et al., 2006Swindell E.C. Bailey T.J. Loosli F. Liu C. Amaya-Manzanares F. Mahon K.A. Wittbrodt J. Jamrich M. Rx-Cre, a tool for inactivation of gene expression in the developing retina.Genesis. 2006; 44: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the latter two cases, there was little or no change in retinal vascular morphology (Figure S2), although, as described more fully below, the Fz4AP/− MCs in the Fz4CKOAP/−;PDGFRB-Cre retina are abnormal. By contrast, in adult Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre mice, intraretinal capillaries are completely absent, vessels penetrating from the vitreal surface terminate in ball-like clusters, large vessels are dilated and form arterio-venous anastomoses, and intraocular hemorrhages are common (Figure 1C). These retinal vascular defects closely resemble those seen in Fz4−/−, Lrp5−/−, and Ndp− mice (see Figure 3A below; Xu et al., 2004Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C.

A model for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy caused by LPR5 mutations.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), indicating that defective Fz4 signaling in retinal ECs (RECs) recapitulates these loss-of-function phenotypes. To determine whether Fz4 acts in a cell-autonomous manner, we took advantage of the observation that ∼5% of Fz4CKOAP/+;Tie2-Cre and Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre retinas exhibit incomplete Cre-mediated recombination (Figure 1D). In incompletely recombined Fz4CKOAP/+;Tie2-Cre retinas, Fz4AP/+ RECs populate relatively contiguous territories encompassing both large and small vessels within all three vascular layers. Each of these contiguous territories is presumably composed of the clonal progeny of one or more REC progenitors that underwent a Cre-mediated recombination event (Figure 1Da). Several distinctive features characterize Fz4AP/− RECs in Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre retinas with incomplete recombination (Figures 1Db–1Dd). First, there was a strong predilection for Fz4AP/− RECs to remain confined to vessels at the vitreal surface, implicating a requirement for Fz4 signaling specifically in the development of intraretinal capillaries. Second, in contiguous territories populated by Fz4AP/− RECs, ball-like clusters of RECs characteristic of the Fz4−/− vasculature were seen instead of intraretinal capillaries. Third, at the boundaries of large clones of Fz4AP/− RECs, some Fz4AP/− RECs were integrated into the adjacent WT capillary network, suggesting that close proximity between WT and Fz4AP/− RECs can partially correct the defects associated with loss of Fz4. Fourth, in regions of retina populated by nonrecombined (i.e., AP-negative) RECs, rare Fz4AP/− RECs were observed in all classes of blood vessels, including intraretinal capillaries. These Fz4AP/− RECs likely arose from late Cre-mediated recombination events among Fz4CKOAP/− RECs that were already part of a capillary network, implying that Fz4 is not absolutely or immediately required to maintain the capillary REC phenotype once that phenotype has been established. To localize the site(s) of Ndp expression, we inserted an AP reporter into exon 2 in the Ndp 5′ UTR (Figure 1E). Ndp is X-linked, and histochemical staining for AP in NdpAP males showed homogeneous AP staining throughout the retina at postnatal day (P)4, P7, and in adulthood. To visualize individual cell morphologies, we took advantage of the tissue mosaicism generated by X chromosome inactivation in NdpAP/+ females. At P4, P7, and adulthood, AP activity was localized to vertical stripes spanning the full thickness of the retina, indicative of expression in Muller glia (Figure 1F). Flat mounts of NdpAP/+ female retinas at P7 show no detectable AP expression in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) or astrocytes (Figure 1F). Thus, Muller glia produce Norrin, which then activates Fz4 on RECs. Vision loss is a hallmark of FEVR, but it is not known whether this is entirely due to vascular insufficiency or whether there are contributions from the loss of Fz4 signaling in neurons. To characterize the type, severity, and anatomic origin of visual deficits associated with loss of Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling, we measured rod- and cone-mediated full-field electroretinographic (ERG) responses in Fz4−/−, Fz4CKOAP/−;Rx-Cre, and Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre mice and in control WT, Fz4CKOAP/+;Rx-Cre, and Fz4CKOAP/+;Tie2-Cre mice (Figures 2A–2C), then analyzed each retina by whole-mount AP histochemistry. Photoreceptor (a-wave) and inner retinal (b-wave) ERG responses in the pan-neuronal/pan-glial Fz4 knockout retina (Fz4CKOAP/−;Rx-Cre) were indistinguishable from WT. By contrast, in Fz4−/− and Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre mice, the a-wave was unaffected, but the b-wave was markedly reduced, indicating a defect in the inner retinal ON pathway (McCall and Gregg, 2008McCall M.A. Gregg R.G. Comparisons of structural and functional abnormalities in mouse b-wave mutants.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This ERG phenotype matches that reported previously for Ndp− mice (Luhmann et al., 2005bLuhmann U.F. Lin J. Acar N. Lammel S. Feil S. Grimm C. Seeliger M.W. Hammes H.P. Berger W. Role of the Norrie disease pseudoglioma gene in sprouting angiogenesis during development of the retinal vasculature.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 3372-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Despite the expression of Fz4 in photoreceptors and other retinal neurons, these observations indicate that the ERG defect is caused by the absence of Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling in the vasculature rather than in neurons. To assess the behavioral consequences of retinal vascular dysfunction, we tested the optokinetic reflex (OKR) and the pupillary light response. OKR testing showed that, in the absence of Fz4, rod and cone signals are not transmitted effectively, and this block arises from a primary defect in the vasculature (Figures 2D and 2E). Interestingly, the OKR defect in Fz4−/− and Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre mice is more severe than the OKR defect associated with genetic silencing of the ON pathway in mGluR6−/− mice (Iwakabe et al., 1997Iwakabe H. Katsuura G. Ishibashi C. Nakanishi S. Impairment of pupillary responses and optokinetic nystagmus in the mGluR6-deficient mouse.Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), consistent with a model in which the OKR is driven by both the ON and OFF pathways and indicating that both pathways are compromised in Fz4−/− and Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre mice. In contrast to the OKR, light-dependent pupil constriction is minimally impaired by the loss of Fz4 (Figure 2F), indicating that the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive RGCs, which control pupil constriction (Hattar et al., 2003Hattar S. Lucas R.J. Mrosovsky N. Thompson S. Douglas R.H. Hankins M.W. Lem J. Biel M. Hofmann F. Foster R.G. Yau K.W. Melanopsin and rod-cone photoreceptive systems account for all major accessory visual functions in mice.Nature. 2003; 424: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), remain active in the Fz4−/− retina. These data are consistent with earlier studies showing an absent OKR and nearly normal pupil response in mice that are missing both rod and cone function (Hattar et al., 2003Hattar S. Lucas R.J. Mrosovsky N. Thompson S. Douglas R.H. Hankins M.W. Lem J. Biel M. Hofmann F. Foster R.G. Yau K.W.

Nathans J. The optokinetic reflex as a tool for quantitative analysis of nervous system function in mice: application to genetic and drug-induced variation.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2055https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002055Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite a chronic vascular insufficiency that precludes normal responses of horizontal, bipolar, and/or amacrine cells in Ndp−, Fz4−/−, and Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre retinas, the mutant retinas appear surprisingly normal (Figures 3A, S3, and S4). This observation suggested that it might be possible to revive these neurons to the point where they could transmit photoreceptor signals. To test this idea, we recorded light responses from the ganglion cell layer in WT and Fz4−/− retinas ex vivo using a multielectrode array (Meister et al., 1994Meister M. Pine J. Baylor D.A. Multi-neuronal signals from the retina: acquisition and analysis.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In this preparation, oxygen, glucose, and other small molecules passively diffuse into the retina, obviating any need for the vasculature. As seen in Figure 2G, ganglion cell layer neurons in the adult Fz4−/− retina exhibit ON, OFF, and ON-OFF action potential responses to local changes in illumination. The number of ON, OFF, and ON-OFF subtypes identified in the retinas of Fz4−/− mice were 4, 55, and 12, respectively; the number of ON, OFF, and ON-OFF subtypes identified in the retinas of WT littermates were 19, 21, and 16, respectively. In sum, the ERG, OKR, pupil constriction, and multielectrode array experiments indicate that a chronic absence of intraretinal capillaries leads to a severe and localized—but still largely reversible—block to neurotransmission through the inner nuclear layer. To assess the relative contributions of Norrin, Fz4, and Lrp5 to retinal vascular growth and patterning, we compared WT, Fz4−/−, Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre, Lrp5−/−, and Ndp− mice with respect to (1) the appearance of the vasculature in the adult (Figure 3A), (2) vascular growth during the first postnatal week (Figures 3B and 3C), and (3) vascular density at P7 (Figure 3D). Although the initial vascular invasion of the retina was unaffected by any of the mutations, Fz4−/−, Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre, and Ndp− retinas exhibited retarded vascular growth and sparse vascular coverage, as reported previously in Fz4−/− and Ndp− retinas (Xu et al., 2004Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C. Kelley M.W. Jiang L. Tasman W. Zhang K. Nathans J.

Sci. 2005; 46: 3372-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). By each of these measures, Lrp5−/− retinas show a more modest phenotype. These observations suggest that Norrin is the only Fz4 ligand relevant to retinal angiogenesis, and that there may be a partial contribution to coreceptor function from Lrp6, a close homolog of Lrp5. MCs are required both to stabilize the nascent vasculature and to maintain the permeability barrier of the mature vasculature and, in particular, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the blood retina barrier (BRB) (Armulik et al., 2005Armulik A. Abramsson A. Betsholtz C. Endothelial/pericyte interactions.Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). The sparse vasculature in Fz4−/− and Ndp− retinas (Figures 3B and 3D), the defective cerebellar BBB associated with loss of Fz4 (see Figure 4A below), and the defective BRB associated with loss of Ndp or Fz4 (Xu et al., 2004Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C. Kelley M.W. Jiang L. Tasman W. Zhang K. Nathans J.

Sci. 2005; 46: 3372-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) suggested that Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling might control EC-MC interactions. This hypothesis is consistent with the expression of Fz4 in both ECs and MCs, and, as described below, it is strongly supported by the observation of defective EC-MC interactions in the absence of Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling. At P2, at the start of REC outgrowth, EC-MC interactions are already strikingly aberrant in Fz4−/− retinas, indicating an initial failure of EC-MC recognition or adhesion (Figure 3E). At P7, in both Fz4−/− and Ndp− retinas, MCs are thinner and MC density is lower than in WT retinas, resulting in incomplete coverage of veins and capillaries (Figure 3F). In contrast, arterial coverage by vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) is minimally affected in Fz4−/− and Norrin− retinas. Quantification of MC coverage of the radial veins at P7 shows a defect in Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre retinas that is almost as severe as that found in Fz4−/− and Ndp− retinas; a milder defect is found in Lrp5−/− retinas (Figure 3G). Interestingly, between P7 and P9, MC coverage of veins in Fz4CKOAP/-;Tie2-Cre retinas increased significantly (p < 0.0001, Student's t test), and by P9 it was higher than that in Fz4−/− or Norrin− retinas (p < 0.0001, ANOVA). The difference in the severity of MC coverage defects between Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre and Fz4−/− retinas (Figure 3G) indicates that EC-MC interactions depend on Fz4 function in at least one cell type in addition to ECs. To test the obvious possibility that the additional cell type is the MC, we visualized Fz4AP/+ MCs in Fz4CKOAP/+;PDGFRB-Cre retinas and Fz4AP/− MCs in Fz4CKOAP/−;PDGFRB-Cre retinas (Figure 3H). Whereas Fz4AP/+ MCs efficiently cover both arteries and veins, Fz4AP/− MCs provide substantially lower coverage of veins: in control Fz4CKOAP/+;PDGFRB-Cre retinas at P30, 65% of veins and 63% of arteries show >90% coverage by AP-expressing MCs, whereas in Fz4CKOAP/−;PDGFRB-Cre retinas at P30, 55% of arteries and only 8% of veins show >90% coverage. These results demonstrate an essential role for Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling in ECs to promote vascular growth, and in both ECs and MCs to promote their mutual interactions. In addition to retinal vascular defects, Fz4−/− mice exhibit a progressive cerebellar degeneration (Wang et al., 2001Wang Y. Huso D. Cahill H. Ryugo D. Nathans J. Progressive cerebellar, auditory, and esophageal dysfunction caused by targeted disruption of the frizzled-4 gene.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4761-4771PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ndp− mice do not exhibit this phenotype, both Fz4−/− and Ndp− mice show a progressive reduction in vascular density in the cerebellum, suggesting a defect in vascular integrity and/or stability (Xu et al., 2004Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C. Kelley M.W. Jiang L. Tasman W. Zhang K. Nathans J.

Neidhardt J. Kloeckener-Gruissem B. Schäfer N.F. Glaus E. Feil S. Berger W. Vascular changes in the cerebellum of Norrin/Ndph knockout mice correlate with high expression of Norrin and Frizzled-4.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we commonly observe hemorrhages in the cerebellum but not in the cerebral cortex in Fz4−/− brains. To test the role of Fz4 signaling in the cerebellar vasculature, we monitored the BBB by immunostaining for mouse IgG in freshly frozen sections of Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre, control Fz4CKOAP/+;Tie2-Cre, and Ndp− brains. In the absence of an intact BBB, IgG can pass from the intravascular space into the surrounding tissues. As seen in Figure 4A, in brain sections that include both cerebellum and cortex, only the Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre cerebellum showed a defect in BBB integrity. An identical vascular phenotype was seen in Fz4−/− brains (data not shown), and transmission electron microscopy of WT and Fz4−/− cerebella shows, in the latter, misshapen capillaries and protrusions of endothelial processes into the vessel lumen (Figure S5). Importantly, quantification of granule cell apoptosis in WT, Fz4CKOAP/−;Tie2-Cre, and Fz4−/− cerebella at P18 demonstrate that the Fz4−/− cerebellar degeneration is of vascular origin (Figures 4B and 4C). These experiments indicate a major role for Fz4 signaling in maintaining the integrity of the cerebellar vasculature, presumably in response to Norrin and/or Wnt binding. Consistent with this conclusion, recent evidence indicates that Wnt7a and Wnt7b expressed in the developing central nervous system (CNS) promote CNS-type vascular development, including BBB development (Stenman et al., 2008Stenman J.M.

A screen for genes specifically expressed in these cells revealed the gene encoding carbonic anhydrase 4, which catalyzes hydration of CO 2 to form bicarbonate and free protons. Knockout animals not expressing the carbonic anhydrase 4 gene also showed diminished sensation of CO 2 . The protons produced by the enzyme appear to be the actual molecules sensed by the sour-sensitive cells. This process, combined with tactile sensations, appears to be the source of the popular fizzy sensation."
https://openalex.org/W2114185268,"Mutations in the genes encoding the Wnt receptor Frizzled-4 (FZD4), coreceptor LRP5, or the ligand Norrin disrupt retinal vascular development and cause ophthalmic diseases. Although Norrin is structurally unrelated to Wnts, it binds FZD4 and activates the canonical Wnt pathway. Here we show that the tetraspanin Tspan12 is expressed in the retinal vasculature, and loss of Tspan12 phenocopies defects seen in Fzd4, Lrp5, and Norrin mutant mice. In addition, Tspan12 genetically interacts with Norrin or Lrp5. Overexpressed TSPAN12 associates with the Norrin-receptor complex and significantly increases Norrin/beta-catenin but not Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, whereas Tspan12 siRNA abolishes transcriptional responses to Norrin but not Wnt3A in retinal endothelial cells. Signaling defects caused by Norrin or FZD4 mutations that are predicted to impair receptor multimerization are rescued by overexpression of TSPAN12. Our data indicate that Norrin multimers and TSPAN12 cooperatively promote multimerization of FZD4 and its associated proteins to elicit physiological levels of signaling."

An unresolved imbalance in the oceanic nitrogen budget suggests that there may be additional sources of biological nitrogen fixation in the deep sea. Using high-resolution imaging techniques, Dekas et al. (p. 422 ; see the Perspective by Fulweiler ) observed direct assimilation of isotopically labeled N 2 by anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea from deep marine sediment and the subsequent transfer of nitrogen to their sulfate-reducing bacterial symbionts. This slow and energetically costly conversion by archaea is dependent upon methane and requires physical contact with the associated bacterial partner. Such syntrophic consortia represent a potential source of nitrogen in the oceans and may help to balance the global nitrogen budget."
https://openalex.org/W2003933044,"We present a 3D multi-cell simulation of a generic simplification of vascular tumor growth which can be easily extended and adapted to describe more specific vascular tumor types and host tissues. Initially, tumor cells proliferate as they take up the oxygen which the pre-existing vasculature supplies. The tumor grows exponentially. When the oxygen level drops below a threshold, the tumor cells become hypoxic and start secreting pro-angiogenic factors. At this stage, the tumor reaches a maximum diameter characteristic of an avascular tumor spheroid. The endothelial cells in the pre-existing vasculature respond to the pro-angiogenic factors both by chemotaxing towards higher concentrations of pro-angiogenic factors and by forming new blood vessels via angiogenesis. The tumor-induced vasculature increases the growth rate of the resulting vascularized solid tumor compared to an avascular tumor, allowing the tumor to grow beyond the spheroid in these linear-growth phases. First, in the linear-spherical phase of growth, the tumor remains spherical while its volume increases. Second, in the linear-cylindrical phase of growth the tumor elongates into a cylinder. Finally, in the linear-sheet phase of growth, tumor growth accelerates as the tumor changes from cylindrical to paddle-shaped. Substantial periods during which the tumor grows slowly or not at all separate the exponential from the linear-spherical and the linear-spherical from the linear-cylindrical growth phases. In contrast to other simulations in which avascular tumors remain spherical, our simulated avascular tumors form cylinders following the blood vessels, leading to a different distribution of hypoxic cells within the tumor. Our simulations cover time periods which are long enough to produce a range of biologically reasonable complex morphologies, allowing us to study how tumor-induced angiogenesis affects the growth rate, size and morphology of simulated tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2014373659,"Background Large-scale plant diversity inventories are critical to develop informed conservation strategies. However, the workload required for classic taxonomic surveys remains high and is particularly problematic for megadiverse tropical forests. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a comprehensive census of all trees in two hectares of a tropical forest in French Guiana, we examined whether plant DNA barcoding could contribute to increasing the quality and the pace of tropical plant biodiversity surveys. Of the eight plant DNA markers we tested (rbcLa, rpoC1, rpoB, matK, ycf5, trnL, psbA-trnH, ITS), matK and ITS had a low rate of sequencing success. More critically, none of the plastid markers achieved a rate of correct plant identification greater than 70%, either alone or combined. The performance of all barcoding markers was noticeably low in few species-rich clades, such as the Laureae, and the Sapotaceae. A field test of the approach enabled us to detect 130 molecular operational taxonomic units in a sample of 252 juvenile trees. Including molecular markers increased the identification rate of juveniles from 72% (morphology alone) to 96% (morphology and molecular) of the individuals assigned to a known tree taxon. Conclusion/Significance We conclude that while DNA barcoding is an invaluable tool for detecting errors in identifications and for identifying plants at juvenile stages, its limited ability to identify collections will constrain the practical implementation of DNA-based tropical plant biodiversity programs."

We studied the effect of PD risk-associated variants at SNCA 5′ and 3′regions on SNCA-mRNA levels in vivo in 228 human brain samples from three structures differentially vulnerable to PD pathology (substantia-nigra, temporal- and frontal-cortex) obtained from 144 neurologically normal cadavers. The extensively characterized PD-associated promoter polymorphism, Rep1, had an effect on SNCA-mRNA levels. Homozygous genotype of the ‘protective’, Rep1-259 bp allele, was associated with lower levels of SNCA-mRNA relative to individuals that carried at least one copy of the PD-risk associated alleles, amounting to an average decrease of ∼40% and >50% in temporal-cortex and substantia-nigra, respectively. Furthermore, SNPs tagging the SNCA 3′-untranslated-region also showed effects on SNCA-mRNA levels in both the temporal-cortex and the substantia-nigra, although, in contrast to Rep1, the ‘decreased-risk’ alleles were correlated with increased SNCA-mRNA levels. Similar to Rep1 findings, no difference in SNCA-mRNA level was seen with different SNCA 3′SNP alleles in the frontal-cortex, indicating there is brain-region specificity of the genetic regulation of SNCA expression.

https://openalex.org/W2137284086,"Protein kinases are the most common protein domains implicated in cancer, where somatically acquired mutations are known to be functionally linked to a variety of cancers. Resequencing studies of protein kinase coding regions have emphasized the importance of sequence and structure determinants of cancer-causing kinase mutations in understanding of the mutation-dependent activation process. We have developed an integrated bioinformatics resource, which consolidated and mapped all currently available information on genetic modifications in protein kinase genes with sequence, structure and functional data. The integration of diverse data types provided a convenient framework for kinome-wide study of sequence-based and structure-based signatures of cancer mutations. The database-driven analysis has revealed a differential enrichment of SNPs categories in functional regions of the kinase domain, demonstrating that a significant number of cancer mutations could fall at structurally equivalent positions (mutational hotspots) within the catalytic core. We have also found that structurally conserved mutational hotspots can be shared by multiple kinase genes and are often enriched by cancer driver mutations with high oncogenic activity. Structural modeling and energetic analysis of the mutational hotspots have suggested a common molecular mechanism of kinase activation by cancer mutations, and have allowed to reconcile the experimental data. According to a proposed mechanism, structural effect of kinase mutations with a high oncogenic potential may manifest in a significant destabilization of the autoinhibited kinase form, which is likely to drive tumorigenesis at some level. Structure-based functional annotation and prediction of cancer mutation effects in protein kinases can facilitate an understanding of the mutation-dependent activation process and inform experimental studies exploring molecular pathology of tumorigenesis."

Methodology and Principal Findings Pooled data from 2 cohorts: in urban West Africa where breastfeeding cessation at 4 months was recommended but exclusive breastfeeding was rare (Ditrame Plus, DP); in rural South Africa where high rates of exclusive breastfeeding were achieved, but with longer duration (Vertical Transmission Study, VTS). 18-months HIV postnatal transmission (PT) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier in infants who were HIV negative, and assumed uninfected, at age >1 month. Censoring with (to assess impact of mode of breastfeeding) and without (to assess effect of breastfeeding duration) breastfeeding cessation considered as a competing event. Of 1195 breastfed infants, not HIV-infected perinatally, 38% DP and 83% VTS children were still breastfed at age 6 months. By age 3 months, 66% of VTS children were exclusively breastfed since birth and 55% of DP infants predominantly breastfed (breastmilk+water-based drinks). 18-month PT risk (95%CI) in VTS was double that in DP: 9% (7–11) and 5% (3–8), respectively (p = 0.03). However, once duration of breastfeeding was allowed for in a competing risk analysis assuming that all children would have been breastfed for 18-month, the estimated PT risk was 16% (8–28) in DP and 14% (10–18) in VTS (p = 0.32). 18-months PT risk was 3.9% (2.3–6.5) among infants breastfed for less than 6 months, and 8.7% (6.8–11.0) among children breastfed for more than 6 months; crude hazard ratio (HR): 2.1 (1.2–3.7), p = 0.02; adjusted HR 1.8 (0.9–3.4), p = 0.06. In individual analyses of PT rates for specific breastfeeding durations, risks among children exclusively breastfed were very similar to those in children predominantly breastfed for the same period. Children exposed to solid foods during the first 2 months of life were 2.9 (1.1–8.0) times more likely to be infected postnatally than children never exposed to solids this early (adjusted competing risk analysis, p = 0.04). Conclusions Breastfeeding duration is a major determinant of postnatal HIV transmission. The PT risk did not differ between exclusively and predominantly breastfed children; the negative effect of mixed breastfeeding with solids on PT were confirmed."

This has been studied using in situ electron microscopy, but in most cases the volume of the material is not constrained. Holmberg et al. (p. 405 ) studied the thermodynamics of a germanium nanowire attached to a gold seed and coated with a carbon shell to restrict its volume, measuring the reaction temperature, as well as the liquid composition without changes in volume throughout the heating cycle. This enabled monitoring of phase behavior while the germanium was being heated, and tracking solid-state diffusion across the confined interface."
https://openalex.org/W2101217287,"Background Telomere length (TL) has been found to be associated with life span in birds and humans. However, other studies have demonstrated that TL does not affect survival among old humans. Furthermore, replicative senescence has been shown to be induced by changes in the protected status of the telomeres rather than the loss of TL. In the present study we explore whether age- and sex-specific telomere dynamics affect life span in a long-lived snake, the water python (Liasis fuscus). Methodology/Principal Findings Erythrocyte TL was measured using the Telo TAGGG TL Assay Kit (Roche). In contrast to other vertebrates, TL of hatchling pythons was significantly shorter than that of older snakes. However, during their first year of life hatchling TL increased substantially. While TL of older snakes decreased with age, we did not observe any correlation between TL and age in cross-sectional sampling. In older snakes, female TL was longer than that of males. When using recapture as a proxy for survival, our results do not support that longer telomeres resulted in an increased water python survival/longevity. Conclusions/Significance In fish high telomerase activity has been observed in somatic cells exhibiting high proliferation rates. Hatchling pythons show similar high somatic cell proliferation rates. Thus, the increase in TL of this group may have been caused by increased telomerase activity. In older humans female TL is longer than that of males. This has been suggested to be caused by high estrogen levels that stimulate increased telomerase activity. Thus, high estrogen levels may also have caused the longer telomeres in female pythons. The lack of correlation between TL and age among old snakes and the fact that longer telomeres did not appear to affect python survival do not support that erythrocyte telomere dynamics has a major impact on water python longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2125204961,"Background Understanding the interactions between ion channels and blockers remains an important goal that has implications for delineating the basic mechanisms of ion channel function and for the discovery and development of ion channel directed drugs. Methodology/Principal Findings We used genetic selection methods to probe the interaction of two ion channel blockers, barium and amantadine, with the miniature viral potassium channel Kcv. Selection for Kcv mutants that were resistant to either blocker identified a mutant bearing multiple changes that was resistant to both. Implementation of a PCR shuffling and backcrossing procedure uncovered that the blocker resistance could be attributed to a single change, T63S, at a position that is likely to form the binding site for the inner ion in the selectivity filter (site 4). A combination of electrophysiological and biochemical assays revealed a distinct difference in the ability of the mutant channel to interact with the blockers. Studies of the analogous mutation in the mammalian inward rectifier Kir2.1 show that the T→S mutation affects barium block as well as the stability of the conductive state. Comparison of the effects of similar barium resistant mutations in Kcv and Kir2.1 shows that neighboring amino acids in the Kcv selectivity filter affect blocker binding. Conclusions/Significance The data support the idea that permeant ions have an integral role in stabilizing potassium channel structure, suggest that both barium and amantadine act at a similar site, and demonstrate how genetic selections can be used to map blocker binding sites and reveal mechanistic features."
https://openalex.org/W2105782941,"An incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for myometrial activation from the quiescent pregnant state to the active contractile state during labor has hindered the development of effective therapies for preterm labor. Myometrial stretch has been implicated clinically in the initiation of labor and the etiology of preterm labor, but the molecular mechanisms involved in the human have not been determined. We investigated the mechanisms by which gestation-dependent stretch contributes to myometrial activation, by using human uterine samples from gynecologic hysterectomies and Cesarean sections. Here we demonstrate that the Ca requirement for activation of the contractile filaments in human myometrium increases with caldesmon protein content during gestation and that an increase in caldesmon phosphorylation can reverse this inhibitory effect during labor. By using phosphotyrosine screening and mass spectrometry of stretched human myometrial samples, we identify 3 stretch-activated focal adhesion proteins, FAK, p130Cas, and alpha actinin. FAK-Y397, which signals integrin engagement, is constitutively phosphorylated in term human myometrium whereas FAK-Y925, which signals downstream ERK activation, is phosphorylated during stretch. We have recently identified smooth muscle Archvillin (SmAV) as an ERK regulator. A newly produced SmAV-specific antibody demonstrates gestation-specific increases in SmAV protein levels and stretch-specific increases in SmAV association with focal adhesion proteins. Thus, whereas increases in caldesmon levels suppress human myometrium contractility during pregnancy, stretch-dependent focal adhesion signaling, facilitated by the ERK activator SmAV, can contribute to myometrial activation. These results suggest that focal adhesion proteins may present new targets for drug discovery programs aimed at regulation of uterine contractility."
https://openalex.org/W2097234404,"The leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) B4 belongs to a family of cell surface receptors that possesses cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). LILRB4 is believed to down-regulate activation signals mediated by non-receptor tyrosine kinase cascades through the recruitment of SHP-1. However, the exact mechanisms of LILRB4-mediated inhibition are not fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate high level surface expression of LILRB4 on THP-1 cells and primary peripheral blood monocytes, which profoundly inhibited production of a key pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFalpha) induced by FcgammaRI (CD64). We also report that LILRB4 aggregated to sites of activation upon co-ligation with CD64 and that this may enhance its inhibitory effects. Cross-linking of CD64 on THP-1 cells markedly increased phosphorylation of multiple proteins including tyrosine kinases and signaling molecules (Lck, Syk, LAT, and Erk), an adaptor protein that targets protein-tyrosine kinases for degradation (c-Cbl) and a protein involved in the formation of actin cytoskeletal rearrangement (alpha-actinin-4). Co-ligation of LILRB4 considerably reduced CD64-mediated phosphorylation of Lck, Syk, LAT, Erk, and c-Cbl but not alpha-actinin-4, suggesting selective inhibition of signaling molecules. Treatment of cells with a broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor, sodium pervanadate (SP), significantly reversed LILRB4-mediated inhibition of TNFalpha production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In comparison, treatment with an SHP-1 specific inhibitor, sodium stibogluconate (SS) has no effects indicating involvement of phosphatase(s) other than SHP-1 in LILRB4 signaling. Collectively, our data show LILRB4 is a potent inhibitor of monocytes activation. This may provide a new potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory conditions characterized by excessive TNFalpha production."

Analyses of these data focused primarily measuring the relative abundance of transcripts of a gene, while treating most or all transcript isoforms as equivalent. Differences in the selection between transcript isoforms can, however, represent critical changes to either the protein product or the posttranscriptional regulation of the transcript. Novel analyses on existing microarray data provide fresh insights and new interpretations into transcriptome-wide changes in expression.A probe-level analysis of existing gene expression arrays revealed differences in mRNA processing, primarily affecting the 3'-untranslated region. Working with the example of microarrays drawn from a transcriptionally silent period of mouse oocyte development, probe-level analysis (implemented here as rmodel) identified genes whose transcript isoforms have differing stabilities. Comparison of micorarrays measuring cDNA generated from oligo-dT and random primers revealed further differences in the polyadenylation status of some transcripts. Additional analysis provided evidence for sequence-targeted cleavage, including putative targeting sequences, as one mechanism of degradation for several hundred transcripts in the maturing oocyte.The capability of probe-level analysis to elicit novel findings from existing expression microarray data was demonstrated. The characterization of differences in stability between transcript isoforms in maturing mouse oocytes provided some mechanistic details of degradation. Similar analysis of existing archives of expression microarray data will likely provide similar discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W2090110430,"A robust marker to describe mass, hydrophobicity and polarizability distribution holds the key to deciphering structural and folding constraints within proteins. Since each of these distributions is inhomogeneous in nature, the construct should be sensitive in describing the patterns therein. We show, for the first time, that the hydrophobicity and polarizability distributions in protein interior follow fractal scaling. It is found that (barring ‘all-α’) all the major structural classes of proteins have an amount of unused hydrophobicity left in them. This amount of untapped hydrophobicity is observed to be greater in thermophilic proteins, than that in their (structurally aligned) mesophilic counterparts. ‘All-β’(thermophilic, mesophilic alike) proteins are found to have maximum amount of unused hydrophobicity, while ‘all-α’ proteins have been found to have minimum polarizability. A non-trivial dependency is observed between dielectric constant and hydrophobicity distributions within (α+β) and ‘all-α’ proteins, whereas absolutely no dependency is found between them in the ‘all-β’ class. This study proves that proteins are not as optimally packed as they are supposed to be. It is also proved that origin of α-helices are possibly not hydrophobic but electrostatic; whereas β-sheets are predominantly hydrophobic in nature. Significance of this study lies in protein engineering studies; because it quantifies the extent of packing that ensures protein functionality. It shows that myths regarding protein interior organization might obfuscate our knowledge of actual reality. However, if the later is studied with a robust marker of strong mathematical basis, unknown correlations can still be unearthed; which help us to understand the nature of hydrophobicity, causality behind protein folding, and the importance of anisotropic electrostatics in stabilizing a highly complex structure named ‘proteins’."
https://openalex.org/W2067240679,"Background The aim of our work was to identify the genes specifically altered in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and especially those that are altered early in cancer development. Methodology/Principal Findings Gene copy number was systematically assessed with an ultra-high resolution CGH oligonucleotide microarray in DNA from samples of pancreatic cancer. Several new cancer-associated variations were observed. In this work we focused on one of them, involving the reg4 gene. Gene copy number gain of the reg4 gene was confirmed by qPCR in 14 cancer samples. It was also found with increased copy number in most PanIN3 samples. The relationship betweena gain in reg4 gene copy number and cancer development was investigated on the human pancreatic cancer cell line Mia-PaCa2 xenografted under the skin of nude mice. When cells were transfected with a vector allowing reg4 expression, they generated tumors almost twice larger in size. In addition, these tumors were more resistant to gemcitabine treatment than control tumors. Interestingly, weekly intraperitoneal administration of a monoclonal antibody to reg4 halved the size of tumors generated by Mia-PaCa2 cells, suggesting that the antibody interfered with a paracrine/autocrine mechanism involving reg4 and stimulating cancer progression. The addition of gemcitabine resulted in further reduction, tumors becoming 5 times smaller than control. Exposure to reg4 antibody resulted in a significant decrease in intra-tumor levels of pAkt, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, survivin and cyclin D1. Conclusions/Significance It was concluded that adjuvant therapies targeting reg4 could improve the standard treatment of pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine."
https://openalex.org/W2089364186,"Peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNTs) share a common origin in the sympathetic nervous system, but manifest variable differentiation and growth potential. Malignant neuroblastoma (NB) and benign ganglioneuroma (GN) stand at opposite ends of the clinical spectrum. We hypothesize that a common PNT progenitor is driven to variable differentiation by specific developmental signaling pathways. To elucidate developmental pathways that direct PNTs along the differentiation spectrum, we compared the expression of genes related to neural crest development in GN and NB. In GNs, we found relatively low expression of sympathetic markers including adrenergic biosynthesis enzymes, indicating divergence from sympathetic fate. In contrast, GNs expressed relatively high levels of enteric neuropeptides and key constituents of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, including Dhh, Gli1 and Gli3. Predicted HH targets were also differentially expressed in GN, consistent with transcriptional response to HH signaling. These findings indicate that HH signaling is specifically active in GN. Together with the known role of HH activity in enteric neural development, these findings further suggested a role for HH activity in directing PNTs away from the sympathetic lineage toward a benign GN phenotype resembling enteric ganglia. We tested the potential for HH signaling to advance differentiation in PNTs by transducing NB cell lines with Gli1 and determining phenotypic and transcriptional response. Gli1 inhibited proliferation of NB cells, and induced a pattern of gene expression that resembled the differential pattern of gene expression of GN, compared to NB (p<0.00001). Moreover, the transcriptional response of SY5Y cells to Gli1 transduction closely resembled the transcriptional response to the differentiation agent retinoic acid (p<0.00001). Notably, Gli1 did not induce N-MYC expression in neuroblastoma cells, but strongly induced RET, a known mediator of RA effect. The decrease in NB cell proliferation induced by Gli1, and the similarity in the patterns of gene expression induced by Gli1 and by RA, corroborated by closely matched gene sets in GN tumors, all support a model in which HH signaling suppresses PNT growth by promoting differentiation along alternative neural crest pathways."

The MEK/ERK signaling pathway positively regulates replication of many RNA viruses. However, whether and how this signaling pathway affects hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and production is not well understood.In this study, we took advantage of two well-characterized MEK/ERK inhibitors and MEK/ERK dominant negative mutants and investigated the roles of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in HCV gene expression and replication. We showed that inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling enhanced HCV gene expression, plus- and minus-strand RNA synthesis, and virus production. In addition, we showed that this enhancement was independent of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) antiviral activity and did not require prior activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, we showed that only MEK and ERK-2 but not ERK-1 was involved in HCV replication, likely through regulation of HCV RNA translation.Taken together, these results demonstrate a negative regulatory role of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in HCV replication and suggest a potential risk in targeting this signaling pathway to treat and prevent neoplastic transformation of HCV-infected liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W2054224964,"GRAIL (gene related to anergy in lymphocytes), is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with increased expression in anergic CD4+ T cells. The expression of GRAIL has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the induction of T cell (T) anergy. To date, several subsets of anergic T cells have demonstrated altered interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APC) and perturbed TCR-mediated signaling. The role of GRAIL in mediating these aspects of T cell anergy remains unclear. We used flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to examine T/APC interactions in GRAIL-expressing T cells. Increased GRAIL expression resulted in reduced T/APC conjugation efficiency as assessed by flow cytometry. Examination of single T/APC conjugates by confocal microscopy revealed altered polarization of polymerized actin and LFA-1 to the T/APC interface. When GRAIL expression was knocked down, actin polarization to the T/APC interface was restored, demonstrating that GRAIL is necessary for alteration of actin cytoskeletal rearrangement under anergizing conditions. Interestingly, proximal TCR signaling including calcium flux and phosphorylation of Vav were not disrupted by expression of GRAIL in CD4+ T cells. In contrast, interrogation of distal signaling events demonstrated significantly decreased JNK phosphorylation in GRAIL-expressing T cells. In sum, GRAIL expression in CD4+ T cells mediates alterations in the actin cytoskeleton during T/APC interactions. Moreover, in this model, our data dissociates proximal T cell signaling events from functional unresponsiveness. These data demonstrate a novel role for GRAIL in modulating T/APC interactions and provide further insight into the cell biology of anergic T cells."

The extracellular IgV domain of CRIg (CRIg-ECD) holds considerable promise as a potential therapeutic because it selectively inhibits the alternative pathway of complement by binding to C3b and inhibiting proteolytic activation of C3 and C5. However, CRIg binds weakly to the convertase subunit C3b (KD = 1.1 μm), and thus a relatively high concentration of protein is required to reach nearly complete complement inhibition. To improve therapeutic efficacy while minimizing risk of immunogenicity, we devised a phage display strategy to evolve a high affinity CRIg-ECD variant with a minimal number of mutations. Using the crystal structure of CRIg in complex with C3b as a guide for library design, we isolated a CRIg-ECD double mutant (Q64R/M86Y, CRIg-v27) that showed increased binding affinity and improved complement inhibitory activity relative to CRIg-ECD. In a mouse model of arthritis, treatment with a Fc fusion of CRIg-v27 resulted in a significant reduction in clinical scores compared with treatment with an Fc fusion of CRIg-ECD.

This study clearly illustrates how phage display technology and structural information can be combined to generate proteins with nearly natural sequences that act as potent complement inhibitors with greatly improved therapeutic efficacy. Complement consists of serum proteins that, upon target recognition, interact to initiate a cascade of proteolytic reactions leading to coating of pathogens with complement components, formation of a membrane attack complex, and induction of an inflammatory response. As such, the complement system acts as a first line of innate immune defense protecting the host against bacterial and viral infections. Complement activation, initiated by the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways, is tightly controlled by membrane-bound and soluble regulators (1.Kim D.D. Song W.C. Clin. Immunol. 2006; 118: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2.Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar). Under circumstances of complement regulator deficits or mutations that lead to blockade of the regulatory function, complement activation can escalate and cause inflammation and tissue damage (3.Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). There is now accumulating genetic, preclinical, and clinical evidence for complement being a major contributor to the pathophysiology of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II, age-related macular degeneration, and ischemia/reperfusion (4.Holers V.M. Immunol. Rev. 2008; 223: 300-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5.Jha P. Bora P.S. Bora N.S. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Complement component C3, following conversion to C3b, constitutes a central subunit of the alternative pathway convertases that proteolytically converts C3 and C5 to the active products, C3a and C3b or C5a and C5b, respectively (6.Müller-Eberhard H.J. Götze O. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 135: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).

Immunol. 1976; 24: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting C3b could provide a powerful approach to therapeutic intervention in complement-mediated diseases. CRIg is a recently discovered complement receptor expressed on a subpopulation of tissue resident macrophages. CRIg binds C3b, iC3b, and C3c but not the parent molecule C3 and efficiently clears complement-coated particles from the circulation (8.Helmy K.Y. Katschke Jr., K.J. Gorgani N.N. Kljavin N.M.

Phage-displayed libraries were generated in which codons encoding residues of CRIg-ECD that contact C3b were subjected to limited randomization. Phage-displayed CRIg-ECD variants with improved binding affinity for C3b were selected and sequenced, and recombinant mutant CRIg-ECD proteins were expressed and purified. Two mutations together improved the affinity of CRIg-ECD for C3b by more than an order of magnitude without compromising selectivity for C3b. As a result, in vitro potency of the affinity-matured CRIg-ECD variant was improved by 6-fold relative to the wild type (WT). Finally, recombinant proteins consisting of affinity-matured CRIg-ECD fused to the Fc portion of murine IgG1 showed significantly improved inhibitory potency in the K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis (10.Kouskoff V.

The resulting phagemid contained a gene under the control of the Ptac promoter, encoding for the following open reading frame: the maltose-binding protein secretion signal, followed by an epitope tag (gD-tag, amino acid sequence SMADPNRFRGKDLGS), followed by human CRIg-ECD (residues 20–137), followed by the C-terminal domain of the gene-3 minor coat protein. The phagemid was used as the template to construct phage-displayed libraries, as described (12.Fellouse F.A. Sidhu S.S. Making and Using Antibodies.in: Howard G.C. Kaser M.R.

Briefly, for each library, a “stop template” version of the phagemid (containing TAA stop codons in positions to be mutated) was used as the template for the Kunkel mutagenesis method (14.Kunkel T.A.

Phage solutions from each library (1012 phage/ml) were added to the coated immunoplates, incubated for 3 h at 25 °C to allow for binding, and washed 12 times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (PT buffer). Bound phage particles were eluted with 0.1 m HCl for 10 min, and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 m Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in E. coli XL1-blue (Stratagene) with M13-KO7 helper phage and used for further rounds of selection. After five rounds of selection, individual phage clones that bound to C3b were identified by phage ELISA and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Phagemids representing selected CRIg-ECD variants were modified using standard molecular biology techniques to produce expression vectors designed for the secretion of CRIg protein into the E. coli periplasm. The gene encoding for the CRIg-ECD fusion protein was modified as follows. The region encoding the gD-tag was removed, a sequence encoding for a His tag (GGGHHHHH) was fused to the C terminus of CRIg-ECD, and an amber stop codon was inserted between the His-tag and the gene-3 minor coat protein. A single colony of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the expression plasmid was inoculated into 30 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin (LB/carb medium) and was grown overnight at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested, washed, resuspended, and inoculated into 500 ml of LB/carb medium. The culture was grown at 37 °C to midlog phase (A600 = 0.8). Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture was grown for 24 h at 30 °C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen for 8 h at −80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed with an Ultra-Turrax T8 homogenizer (IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) and an M-110F Microfluidizer® processor (Microfluidics). The CRIg-ECD variant proteins were purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and gel filtration chromatography. CRIg-ECD-Fc was generated by subcloning the CRIg-ECD (residues 1–175) into a modified pRK5 expression vector encoding the murine IgG1 Fc region. The CRIg-v27-Fc expression vector was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The Fc fusion proteins were produced by transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with the expression vectors followed by purification of secreted proteins by protein A affinity chromatography as described (8.Helmy K.Y. Katschke Jr., K.J. Gorgani N.N. Kljavin N.M. Elliott J.M. Diehl L. Scales S.J. Ghilardi N. van Lookeren Campagne M.

Maxisorp plates (384-well, Nunc (Neptune, NJ)) were coated overnight at 4 °C with huCRIg(L)-LFH (2 μg/ml), a construct consisting of the C terminus of the CRIg-ECD fused with a leucine zipper, a FLAG tag, and a His6 tag (9.Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The plates were washed three times with PT buffer and blocked for 2 h with bovine serum albumin. C3b protein (10 nm) was incubated for 1 h with serial dilutions of CRIg-ECD-Fc in PBT buffer, and the mixture was added to the blocked plates and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed, and bound C3b was detected by the addition of an anti-human C3b antibody (clone 5F202, U.S. Biological (Swampscott, MA)), horseradish peroxidase-anti-murine IgG antibody conjugate (1:2000 dilution in PBT buffer) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), and TMB substrate. Color development was quenched with 1.0 m H3PO4, and the plates were read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The ability of CRIg-ECD-Fc to inhibit complement activation was evaluated using the WieslabTM complement system alternative pathway kit (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Serially diluted CRIg-ECD-Fc (400 to 0.2 nm) and C1q-deficient human serum (5%) (Complement Technology, Tyler, TX) were prepared at twice the final desired concentration, mixed 1:1, and preincubated for 5 min on an orbital shaker at 300 rpm prior to adding to the lipopolysaccharide-coated ELISA plates (100 μl/well). The remainder of the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the activity of the alternative complement pathway, a hemolysis assay using rabbit red blood cells (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO) was performed as described (9.Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The extent of hemolysis was determined spectrophotometrically, and the results were expressed as a percentage of hemolysis observed in the absence of inhibitor. The effect of CRIg-ECD-Fc, CRIg-v27-Fc, and a control Fc fusion protein (anti-gp120) on C3a des-Arg and C5a des-Arg production in mouse serum was determined as described (15.Katschke Jr., K.J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Xi H. Yin J. Lee W.P. Gribling P. Barck K.H. Carano R.A. Taylor R.E. Rangell L. Diehl L. Hass P.E. Wiesmann C. van Lookeren Campagne M. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The potential cross-reactivity of the CRIg-ECD variant to C3 was evaluated using the AlphaScreen® histidine (nickel chelate) detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Serially diluted human C3 and C3b (3000 to 0.7 nm), as well as fixed concentrations of biotinylated iC3b (30 nm, Complement Technology), and the wild type or variant CRIg-ECD (15–60 nm) were prepared at three times the final desired concentration, mixed 1:1:1, and preincubated at ambient temperature for 30 min on an orbital shaker at 3000 rpm. A 1:1 mixture of streptavidin donor beads and nickel chelate acceptor beads (0.1 mg/ml each) was prepared at 4 times the final desired concentration and added to the reaction. The reaction plate was protected from light and incubated at ambient temperature for 60 min on an orbital shaker at 3000 rpm. The plate was analyzed on an AlphaQuest®-HTS microplate analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Affinities of C3b for mutant and wild type CRIg were determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements on a Biacore® A100 instrument (GE Healthcare). An anti-Fc capture format was employed, and the KD was calculated from equilibrium binding measurements. The sensor chip was prepared using the anti-muFc capture kit (catalog number BR-1008-38) following instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Mutant or wild type CRIg was diluted in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) to 1 μg/ml, and injections of 60 μl were made such that ∼100 response units of fusion protein were captured on one spot of the chip surface. Sensorgrams were recorded for 10-min injections of solutions of varied C3b concentration over the CRIg spot with subtraction of signal for a reference spot containing the capture antibody but no CRIg. Data were obtained for a 2-fold dilution series of C3b ranging in concentration from 4 μm to 15.6 nm with a flow rate at 10 μl/min and at a temperature of 25 °C. The surface was regenerated between binding cycles by a 30-s injection of 10 mm Gly-HCl, pH 1.7. Plateau values obtained at the end of each C3b injection were used to calculate KD using the Affinity algorithm of the Biacore A100 Evaluation software, version 1.1. All animals were held under sterile pathogen-free conditions, and animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Genentech. Arthritis was induced in BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories) by injection of 50 μl of serum obtained from a pooled cohort of K/BxN mice as described (16.Ji H. Ohmura K. Mahmood U. Lee D.M. Hofhuis F.M. Boackle S.A. Takahashi K. Holers V.M. Walport M. Gerard C. Ezekowitz A. Carroll M.C. Brenner M. Weissleder R. Verbeek J.S. Duchatelle V. Degott C. Benoist C. Mathis D. Immunity. 2002; 16: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Mice received daily subcutaneous injections of 300 μg of fusion protein starting the day prior to serum injection and were scored daily. The extent of disease was scored by visual observation as follows: 0, no evidence of erythema and swelling; 1, erythema and mild swelling confined to the midfoot (tarsal) or ankle; 2, erythema and mild swelling extending from the ankle to the midfoot; 3, erythema and moderate swelling extending from the ankle to the metatarsal joints; 4, erythema and severe swelling encompassing the ankle, foot, and digits. The mean score reflects the sum of the scores over four paws. All mice were sacrificed at the peak of disease 6 days following serum transfer, and paws were processed for histological evaluation as described (15.Katschke Jr., K.J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Xi H. Yin J. Lee W.P. Gribling P. Barck K.H. Carano R.A. Taylor R.E. Rangell L. Diehl L. Hass P.E. Wiesmann C. van Lookeren Campagne M. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All p values were calculated with an unpaired, two-tailed, Student's t test assuming equal variance. To generate CRIg variants with improved affinity for C3b, we displayed CRIg-ECD on phage and designed libraries targeting the epitope for binding to C3b. Five independent libraries were constructed to cover a total of 32 CRIg residues that make contact with C3b in the crystal structure of the CRIg-C3b complex (Fig. 1) (9.Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). At each randomized position, the library was designed to encode ∼50% of the WT amino acid and ∼50% of a mixture of the other 19 genetically encoded amino acids. Following rounds of selection for binding to immobilized C3b, 24 clones were sequenced from each library and unique sequences were aligned to reveal that 15 of the 32 targeted positions had accumulated mutations (supplemental Fig. S1). For the purposes of affinity maturation, we decided to focus on 11 positions at which most of the sequences were mutated, suggesting that mutations at these positions are well tolerated structurally and may improve affinity for C3b. Because our goal was to minimize the number of mutations required to affinity-mature CRIg for binding to C3b, we constructed a panel of CRIg-ECD point mutants with mutations that occurred at the 11 heavily mutated positions described above (Table 1). We relied on two distinct assays to compare these mutants to the WT CRIg-ECD. In the first assay, we estimated the improvement in affinity in a fluid phase competitive ELISA. In the second assay, we assessed the improvement in biological activity using purified proteins in a hemolysis assay that measures the ability of CRIg-ECD to inhibit the lysis of rabbit red blood cells. In total, 21 CRIg-ECD point mutants were tested, and many showed improvements in affinity and/or activity, but notably, improvements in the two assays were not strongly correlated, suggesting that improved affinity does not necessarily translate directly to improved biological activity.TABLE 1Relative C3b affinity and biological activity of CRIg variantsVariantMutationsIC50 (WT)/IC50 (variant)AffinityActivityv1E8Y0.91v2E8W24v3W14F0.42v4G42D0.71v5D44H10.5v6P45F0.31v7Q60I0.95v8Q64R102v9M86Y35v10M86W43v11M86F0.54v12Q99K11v13Q99R0.20.8v14Q99Y0.70.4v15Q99F10.9v16Q99L0.20.8v17Q105R0.50.9v18Q105K0.61v19K110D23v20K110N22v21K110H0.30.5v22E8W/G42D10.3v23E8W/M86W61v24E8W/K110N11v25Q64R/E8Y21v26Q64R/G42D12v27Q64R/M86Y186v28Q64R/M86W133v29Q64R/Q99Y11v30Q64R/Q99F10.8v31Q64R/Q105K32v32M86Y/E8Y62v33M86Y/Q99K54v34M86Y/Q99R32v35M86Y/Q105R122v36M86Y/Q105K94 Open table in a new tab To further improve the affinity and activity of CRIg-ECD, we next constructed a panel of double mutants by combining single mutations selected from different libraries. We chose to combine three mutations that appeared to improve both affinity and activity (E8W, Q64R, and M86Y) with a diverse array of other mutations. In total, we screened 15 CRIg-ECD double mutants and found that CRIg-v27, which contained the mutations Q64R/M86Y, exhibited the highest affinity for C3b and the highest biological activity. Thus, we chose CRIg-v27 for further analysis. We used surface plasmon resonance analysis to compare binding affinity of WT CRIg-ECD and CRIg-v27 for C3b (Fig. 2). Consistent with the results from the fluid phase phage ELISA, the affinity of CRIg-v27 (KD = 200 nm) as measured by surface plasmon resonance was improved ∼5-fold over the WT (KD = 1100 nm). Previous studies have shown that CRIg selectively binds to C3b but not to native C3 (9.Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because mutagenesis may influence this selectivity, we compared the affinity of CRIg-v27 for C3b and C3 in a fluid phase competition assay. CRIg-v27 bound soluble C3b, but not soluble C3, indicating that the mutations did not affect selectivity for the active component C3b (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3CRIg-v27 is selective for C3b over C3. AlphaScreen competitive assay shows a dose-dependent decrease in the binding of CRIg-v27 to bead-bound iC3b (y axis) in response to increasing concentrations of solution phase C3b (filled circles) but not C3 (open squares) (x axis). The slight decrease in signal at the highest C3 concentration is also observed for the binding of WT CRIg-ECD (data not shown). RFU, relative units of fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the improved affinity and conserved selectivity of CRIg-v27 for C3b translates into improved efficacy, we tested the activity of CRIg-v27 compared with WT CRIg-ECD in an erythrocyte-based activity assay selective for the alternative pathway of complement. CRIg-v27 showed a 5-fold improved efficacy in the assay relative to WT CRIg-ECD (Fig. 4A). To further substantiate improved potency of alternative pathway complement inhibition, we compared the inhibitory activities of CRIg-v27 and WT CRIg-ECD in an ELISA selective for the alternative pathway of complement. Consistent with the hemolytic assay results, CRIg-v27 showed ∼6-fold better potency than WT CRIg-ECD (Fig. 4B). Similar to WT CRIg-ECD (9.Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), CRIg-v27 did not inhibit classical pathway complement activation (results not shown). In addition, CRIg-v27 showed superior blockade of alternative pathway activation in mouse serum compared with WT CRIg-ECD, and thus, the variant also exhibits enhanced activity against mouse C3b (supplemental Fig. S2). In summary, two amino acid substitutions in the CRIg binding site for C3b result in improved binding affinity and superior complement-inhibitory activity across species while retaining selectivity for C3b and the alternative pathway of complement. To determine whether increased binding affinity and potency may translate into improved therapeutic efficacy, we compared the effects of systemically delivered CRIg-v27 or WT CRIg-ECD on complement-mediated inflammation in vivo. Previous studies have shown that CRIg inhibits inflammation and bone destruction in two preclinical models of arthritis (15.Katschke Jr., K.J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Xi H. Yin J. Lee W.P. Gribling P. Barck K.H. Carano R.A. Taylor R.E. Rangell L. Diehl L. Hass P.E. Wiesmann C. van Lookeren Campagne M. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Efficacy of WT CRIg-ECD and CRIg-v27 were compared in a third preclinical model of immune complex-mediated arthritis induced by transfer of serum from K/BxN T cell receptor transgenic mice to WT recipients. Serum transfer results in rapid and robust symmetric inflammation of the joints induced by anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase autoantibodies (10.Kouskoff V. Korganow A.S. Duchatelle V. Degott C. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1996; 87: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Importantly, induction of joint inflammation is fully dependent both on an intact alternative complement pathway and on Fc receptor γ function (16.Ji H. Ohmura K. Mahmood U. Lee D.M. Hofhuis F.M. Boackle S.A. Takahashi K. Holers V.M. Walport M. Gerard C. Ezekowitz A. Carroll M.C. Brenner M. Weissleder R. Verbeek J.S. Duchatelle V. Degott C. Benoist C. Mathis D.

Degott C. van Regenmortel M. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To increase serum half-life in vivo, CRIg-v27 or WT CRIg-ECD was fused to the Fc portion of mouse IgG1. Due to the rapid onset and increased disease severity in the K/BxN model of arthritis as compared with the previously tested anti-collagen antibody-mediated arthritis models, treatment with WT CRIg-ECD-Fc fusion protein reduced arthritis scores by only 22% as compared with mice treated with a control protein (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, treatment with CRIg-v27-Fc fusion protein showed a reduction in arthritis scores by 66%. Infiltration of immune cells, consisting primarily of neutrophils and macrophages, was significantly reduced in mice treated with CRIg-v27-Fc relative to those treated with WT CRIg-ECD-Fc or control-Fc (Fig. 5, C and D). Serum concentrations of WT CRIg-ECD-Fc and CRIg-v27-Fc were similar (results not shown), indicating that the improved in vivo efficacy of CRIg-v27 compared with WT CRIg-ECD-Fc was not due to target-mediated differences in the half-lives of the two proteins. Thus, we show that increased binding affinity of CRIg for C3b translates into a significantly improved complement-inhibitory activity in vitro and a significantly better therapeutic efficacy in vivo. A key role for the complement alternative pathway in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases has become widely accepted (4.Holers V.M. Immunol. Rev. 2008; 223: 300-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and consequently, the development of therapeutics that selectively target the alternative pathway has become a high priority (18.Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Along with a renewed interest in the complement pathway, the elucidation of x-ray structures for a number of complement components and regulators has enhanced our understanding of the mechanistic basis for complement activation and inhibition (9.Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a next step, structural insights into the molecular basis for complement regulation should be applied to the design of more potent inhibitors of the complement cascade. Here, we used the crystal structure of CRIg in complex with C3b as a guide to create a more potent inhibitor of the complement alternative pathway. CRIg-v27 contains only two amino acid changes relative to WT CRIg but showed improved potency in vitro and enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo, thus illustrating how structural information can be used to create more potent complement inhibitors with only minimal changes to natural proteins. The crystal structure of the complex between CRIg and C3c (9.Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) provides insights into possible molecular mechanisms behind the enhanced affinity of CRIg-v27 for C3b (Fig. 6). Gln-64 in WT CRIg-ECD does not form any hydrogen bonds with C3c, but it is possible that the longer Arg-64 side chain in CRIg-v27 could form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of either Arg-551 or Glu-800 of C3c. Met-86 in WT CRIg-ECD resides on the periphery of binding interface, and the most likely interaction formed by Tyr-86 in CRIg-v27 is a hydrogen bond between the phenol group of the tyrosine side chain and the Glu-227 side chain of C3c. It is likely that the affinity of CRIg for C3b could be improved further with additional mutations, but our goal was to create a potential therapeutic candidate, and thus, we limited the number of mutations to minimize the risk of immunogenicity. Because affinity and activity were not well correlated, we chose the double mutant that exhibited the largest improvements in both properties. Alternatively, if improved in vitro activity is the dominant factor for improved in vivo efficacy, it is possible that even a single mutation (e.g. CRIg-v9) could provide improved efficacy comparable with the effects of the two mutations incorporated in CRIg-v27. However, testing of this idea would require further in vivo studies with additional CRIg variants. CRIg-v27 did not bind C3 and retained selectivity for C3 fragments C3b, iC3b, and C3c. From a therapeutic point of view, this selectivity is highly desirable, because the plasma concentration of C3 fragments is ∼200-fold lower than that of native C3 (23.Katschke Jr., K.J. Stawicki S. Yin J. Steffek M. Xi H. Sturgeon L. Hass P.E. Loyet K.M. Deforge L. Wu Y. van Lookeren Campagne M. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10473-10479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consequently, targeting of native C3 would require a high dose of therapeutic to achieve favorable pharmacokinetics. In addition to retaining selectivity for C3 fragments, CRIg-v27 specifically inhibited activation of the complement alternative pathway, leaving the classical and mannose-binding lectin pathways intact to mount an appropriate host response to pathogens. Importantly, although CRIg has the advantage of specificity and selectivity, its critical role in first line host defense against pathogens (8.Helmy K.Y. Katschke Jr., K.J. Gorgani N.N. Kljavin N.M. Elliott J.M. Diehl L. Scales S.J. Ghilardi N. van Lookeren Campagne M. Cell. 2006; 124: 915-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) should be taken into consideration when developing CRIg for therapeutic use. Because systemic treatment with CRIg-ECD proteins could potentially interfere with the function of CRIg as a macrophage receptor, CRIg-ECD variants may prove most valuable as potential therapeutics for disease indications where CRIg can be delivered locally (e.g. intraoculary to treat age-related macular degeneration) or acutely (e.g. in ischemia/reperfusion). Our study should further stimulate the design of potent and selective inhibitors targeting one of three complement pathways, which, subject to appropriate considerations for mode of delivery and indication, should lead to the generation of a new class of complement therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W2039852888,"Many techniques for the study of complex populations provide either specific information on a small number of variants or general information on the entire population. Here we describe a powerful new technique for elucidating mutation frequencies at each genomic position in a complex population. This single base extension (SBE) based microarray platform was designed and optimized using poliovirus as the target genotype, but can be easily adapted to assay populations derived from any organism. The sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by accurate and consistent readouts from a controlled population of mutant genotypes. We subsequently deployed the technique to investigate the effects of the nucleotide analog ribavirin on a typical poliovirus population through two rounds of passage. Our results show that this economical platform can be used to investigate dynamic changes occurring at frequencies below 1% within a complex nucleic acid population. Given that many key aspects of the study and treatment of disease are intimately linked to population-level genomic diversity, our SBE-based technique provides a scalable and cost-effective complement to both traditional and next generation sequencing methodologies."

In the present study, we show that antigen expression is modified by type II NKT cells, after interaction with a β2-microglobulin-independent CD1d receptor. After activation, during the first days following plasmid DNA vaccination, NKT cells release IL-5 and MCP-1, leading to a T helper 0 (TH0) cytokine/chemokine profile and a stronger CD8+/CD4+ T cell immune response. Our data indicate that this phenomenon was induced through the strong TH1 chemokine MCP-1 during the early phases of plasmid DNA vaccination because injecting the type II NKT cell-associated MCP-1 during the first 5 days led to 2–3-fold increases in vaccine-elicited T cell responses.

NK cell effector function is regulated by a balance between opposing signals delivered by inhibitory and activating receptors. A number of surface molecules expressed by NK cells, including CD2, CD16, CD69, and DNAM-1 have been implicated in the triggering of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, the activating counterparts of the MHC-specific receptor p50 and the CD94/NKG2C molecules trigger NK-mediated cytotoxicity against MHC class I-expressing target cells. MHC class I negative targets are lysed after recognition by the cytotoxicity receptors NKp46, NKp44, and NKp30 (3.Moretta A. Bottino C. Vitale M. Pende D. Cantoni C. Mingari M.C. Biassoni R.

The majority of NKT cells express the NK lineage-specific receptor NK1.1 (CD161) and secrete cytokines upon recognition of CD1d. CD1d can present lipids and glycolipids as well as peptides to NKT cells. Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells or type I NKT cells make use of a restricted TCR repertoire, using an invariant TCR Vα14-Jα281 rearrangement and a limited set of TCR Vβ segments, suggesting that they recognize a limited set of CD1d-associated ligands (8.Kronenberg M. Gapin L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 9.Kronenberg M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 877-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). A second group of CD1d-reactive NKT cells, referred to as type II NKT cells, use a diverse TCR repertoire that allows them to recognize a diversity of ligands presented on CD1d (8.Kronenberg M. Gapin L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Because plasmid DNA antigen clearance has been shown to be β2m-independent (22.Geiben-Lynn R. Greenland J.R. Frimpong-Boateng K. van Rooijen N. Hovav A.H. Letvin N.L. Blood. 2008; 112: 4585-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether NK or NKT cells influence this process. The present studies demonstrate that β2m-independent CD1d-restricted type II NKT cells influence the speed of plasmid antigen clearance, and consequently the magnitude of the cellular and humoral immune response to DNA vaccination. 6–8-week female C57BL/6, CD1d KO (CD1.1/CD1.2 KO on BALB/c background), BALB/c, and beige mice (C57BL/6-Lystbg) (23.Gallin J.I.

Nature. 1979; 278: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Jα18 KO mice (iNKT KO), mice missing the Vα14-Jα18 NKT cells, were a gift from Dr. Mark E. Exley (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). All animals were housed and maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (26.Orlans F.B. Ethics Behav. 1997; 7: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and all studies and procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The plasmid DNA-Luciferase (DNA-Luc) construct with the AL11-Gag tag was constructed as described previously (27.Greenland J.R. Geiben R. Ghosh S. Pastor W.A. Letvin N.L. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This vector contains the GL4.10 luciferase gene (Promega, Madison, WI) and the immunodominant H-2Db-restricted SIV-Gag AL11 epitope flanked by triple alanine spacers. Plasmid DNA was prepared using an endotoxin-free Qiagen Giga-prep kit. For immunizations, 50 μg of plasmid DNA in 100 μl of sterile saline were divided between quadriceps muscles by intramuscular (i.m.) inoculation. DNA endotoxin concentration was determined with the E-Toxate kit (Sigma), and was below 0.1 unit/μg in all vaccine preparations used in these studies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, allophyo-cyanin (APC)-, and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled antibodies were used for the flow cytometric analysis. The dye-coupled antibodies anti-NK1.1-FITC (mC5-3), anti-CD8α-APC (53-6.7), CD4-APC-Cy7 (GK1.5), and anti-CD3e-PE (JES6-5H4), anti-CD69-APC were purchased from BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA). CD1d-PBS57 and control PE-conjugated tetramers were provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Tetramer Facility (Emory University Vaccine Center, Atlanta, GA) and used as described earlier (28.Sada-Ovalle I. Chiba A. Gonzales A. Brenner M.B. Behar S.M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000239Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Various reagents, including d-glucosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C8), d-galactosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C8), d-glucosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C12), and d-galactosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C12), were purchased from AvantiLipids (Alabaster, AL). All ceramide reagents were first dissolved in DMSO, then diluted in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (29.Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Bere Jr., E.W. Murphy W.J. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The same vehicle diluent was used as a control for all studies. Ceramides were injected via the intraperitoneal (intraperitoneal) route 3 days prior to plasmid DNA inoculations at a dose of 10 μg in 200 μl of sterile PBS, a dose at which the d-glucosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C12) has been shown to totally deplete NKT function (29.Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Bere Jr., E.W. Murphy W.J. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). d-Glucosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C8), d-galactosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C8), and d-galactosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C12) were used as controls. IL-13 and MCP-1 were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Proteins were reconstituted in PBS and administered at 50, 100, 500, and 1000 ng together with 50 μg of the plasmid DNA-Luc construct in a total of 100 μl of PBS divided equally between the quadriceps muscles. A similar protocol was used for injecting the proteins via the i.m. route without the plasmid DNA at days 3 and 5. H-2Db/AL11 tetramers were prepared and used to stain epitope-specific CD8+ T cells as previously described (30.Barouch D.H. Pau M.G. Custers J.H. Koudstaal W. Kostense S. Havenga M.J. Truitt D.M. Sumida S.M. Kishko M.G. Arthur J.C. Korioth-Schmitz B. Newberg M.H. Gorgone D.A. Lifton M.A. Panicali D.L. Nabel G.J. Letvin N.L. Goudsmit J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6290-6297Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood was collected and lysed with BD Pharmlyse buffer (BD Bioscience). The samples were then analyzed on a FACS Array (BD Bioscience), and CD8+ T lymphocytes were examined by staining with the Db/AL11 tetramer. CD8+ T lymphocytes from control mice immunized with untagged plasmid DNA-Luc exhibited ≤0.1% tetramer staining. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) was performed as previously described (31.Hovav A.H. Cayabyab M.J. Panas M.W. Santra S. Greenland J. Geiben R. Haynes B.F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Letvin N.L. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For T cell stimulations, cells were incubated with a luciferase (Luc) peptide pool at 2 μg/ml for each peptide. The Luc peptide pool of 67 18-mers, overlapping by 10 amino acids, was synthesized by Quality Control Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). ELISpot assays were performed as previously described with a Luc peptide pool at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for each peptide (32.Greenland J.R. Liu H. Berry D. Anderson D.G. Kim W.K. Irvine D.J. Langer R. Letvin N.L. Mol. Ther. 2005; 12: 164-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mice were injected by intraperitoneal route with 100 μl of a 30 mg/ml solution of firefly luciferin (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) in PBS, as well as 100 μl of a 20 mg/ml ketamine and 1.72 μg/ml xylazine mixture. After 20 min, imaging was performed using the IVIS Series 100 (Xenogen) with an integration time of 1 min. Overlay images and luminescence measurements were made using Living Image softwareTM (Version2.50.1, Xenogen). To convert the in vivo bioluminescence Relative Light Units (RLU) of the different vectors into quantity of antigen expressed, we prepared a calibration curve with values of emitted light per min for different amounts of recombinant Luc protein (Promega). There was a linear correlation between amount of protein injected (10 ng to 50 μg) and light emitted, enabling us to calculate antigen expression from the different vectors according to the following formula: concentration of antigen in ng = antilog [(log RLU − 4.2)/0.76]. Both NK and NKT cell depletion were performed with the anti-asialo GM1 antibody (ASGM1) (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) using 50-μl infusions as described earlier (33.Shirahata T. Shimoi A. Kanda H. Goto H. Nakane A. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1994; 56: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Nonimmune rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a control. The ASGM1 depletion achieved greater than 80% depletion of NK or NKT cells at days 14 and 21 as confirmed by monoclonal anti-CD3 and anti-NK1.1 antibody (BD Bioscience) staining and flow cytometric analysis. To block CD1d interaction the anti-CD1d antibody (3C11, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), which can recognize the β2m-dependent and β2m-independent forms of CD1d (34.Amano M. Baumgarth N. Dick M.D. Brossay L. Kronenberg M. Herzenberg L.A. Strober S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1710-1717PubMed Google Scholar), was used and compared with an isotype control antibody (eBioscience). All antibodies were administered via the intraperitoneal route (250 μg antibody per mice per inoculation) 3 days prior to plasmid DNA inoculation and every 3 days thereafter. To test for 20 cytokines and chemokines in mouse serum the QuantibodyTM Mouse Array 1 chip (cat. QAM-CYT-1) from RayBiotech (Norcross, GA) was used according the manufacturer's protocol. This enabled testing for GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, KC, MCP-1, M-CSF, RANTES, TNF-α, and VEGF at the same time. Statistical differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Statistical calculations were performed using the GraphPad PrismTM program (version 4.03). Error bars represent the S.E. We have previously shown that antigen expression during the first 3 days following plasmid DNA inoculation influenced the strength of the vaccine-induced memory T cell immune response (1.Geiben-Lynn R. Greenland J.R. Frimpong-Boateng K. Letvin N.L. Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2008; 15: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because DNA vaccination is associated with the accumulation of both NK and NKT cells at the site of inoculation (2.Stan A.C. Casares S. Brumeanu T.D. Klinman D.M. Bona C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether these cell populations modulate plasmid DNA-elicited adaptive immune responses. We did this by depleting both NK and NKT cells following DNA vaccination to test the influence of these cells on vaccine antigen clearance and vaccine-elicited immune responses. This was accomplished by treatment of vaccinated mice with an anti-ASGM1 antibody. To measure vaccine antigen clearance in vivo and CD8+ T cell immune responses simultaneously without resorting to serial animal sacrifice, we immunized mice via the i.m. route with a plasmid DNA-Luc construct, which has the H-2Db-restricted CTL epitope SIV-Gag AL11 added at the N terminus of the luciferase gene. Monoclonal antibody staining and flow cytometric analysis confirmed that greater than 80% of NK cells (p = 0.02, n = 4) and greater 95% of NKT cells (p = 0.01, n = 4) were depleted in peripheral blood after anti-ASGM1 treatment at day 14 (Fig. 1A) and day 21. The depleting efficacy of anti-ASGM1 antibody was lost at the 28 day time point, and NK and NKT cells recover to the levels seen in control animal levels. We found that NK/NKT cell depletion prevented the clearance of antigen expression normally seen by day 21 after plasmid DNA inoculation (Fig. 1B). To determine if NK/NKT cell depletion influenced the Gag-specific CD8+ T cell response, we stained the PBMC of these mice with the AL11-Gag tetramer. We observed a total absence of the SIV-Gag AL11-specific CD8+ T cell response (d14, p = 0.03, n = 4) in the anti-ASGM1-treated mice when effector cell staining reached the highest levels (Fig. 1C). T cell immune responses against the Luc-antigen were assessed by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay using the Luc peptide pool. We observed a total loss of Luc-specific T cell immune responses after NK/NK T cell depletion (Fig. 1D). These findings suggested that NK or NKT cells are important for eliciting strong DNA vaccine-induced T cell immune responses. In light of the evidence that NK and/or NKT cells influence adaptive immune responses and antigen clearance in plasmid DNA-vaccinated mice, we designed experiments to define the contribution of each of these cell types to the kinetics of DNA vaccine antigen expression. We first evaluated plasmid DNA vaccination in CD1d KO mice, in which complete depletion of NKT cells is achieved through a homozygous CD1d-targeted mutation (35.Park S.H. Roark J.H. Bendelac A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3128-3134PubMed Google Scholar). NK cells and TH2 immune responses are unaffected in these CD1d KO mice (36.Smiley S.T. Kaplan M.H. Grusby M.J. Science. 1997; 275: 977-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). NKT-deficient CD1d KO mice were not able to clear DNA vaccine antigen expression at day 14 (p = 0.03, n = 4) and day 28 (p = 0.03, n = 4) following immunization, suggesting that CD1d may be important for the clearance of plasmid DNA antigen expression in myocytes (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed in mice treated with an anti-CD1d receptor blocking antibody, demonstrating that interaction with CD1d is necessary for the seen effect. In these mice, antigen clearance was diminished in comparison to that seen in wild-type mice starting at day 21, and the difference in antigen clearance with the KO and wild-type mice achieved statistical significance at day 28 (p = 0.01, n = 4) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, using beige mice, in which NKT cells are functional but NK cells are defective (23.Gallin J.I. Bujak J.S. Patten E. Wolff S.M. Blood. 1974; 43: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25.Roder J. Duwe A. Nature. 1979; 278: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we observed no defect in antigen clearance following immunization during 28 days following immunization (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that NK cells are not necessary for DNA vaccine antigen clearance. Having demonstrated with the CD1d KO mice and anti-CD1d receptor-blocking antibody-treated mice that NKT cells influence both DNA vaccine antigen clearance and DNA vaccine-elicited adaptive T cell immune responses, we administered the CD1d ligand d-glucosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C12) at a dose at which total depletion of NKT cell function in vivo has been achieved without affecting NK cell function (29.Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Bere Jr., E.W. Murphy W.J. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in a decrease of plasmid DNA antigen clearance beginning at day 21 following vaccine administration (d21, p = 0.03, n = 4; d28, p = 0.03, n = 4) (Fig. 2E) confirming plasmid DNA NKT cell dependence by another method. No effect on vaccine antigen clearance was seen following administration of the control ceramides d-glucosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C8) (d21, p = 0.69, n = 4; d28, p = 0.90, n = 4), d-galactosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C8) (d21, p = 0.40, n = 4; d28, p = 0.10, n = 4), or d-galactosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C12) (d21, p = 1.0, n = 4; d28, p = 0.06, n = 4). Using iNKT KO mice in which a mutation depletes Vα14-Jα281 cells, we also evaluated which subset of NKT cells, the iNKT or type II NKT cells, influences plasmid DNA-Luc antigen expression. We observed a similar rate of damping of antigen expression in iNKT KO mice and wild-type mice, ruling out the possibility that iNKT cells play an important role in DNA vaccine antigen clearance (Fig. 2D). Together with earlier findings that DNA antigen clearance is β2m-independent (22.Geiben-Lynn R. Greenland J.R. Frimpong-Boateng K. van Rooijen N. Hovav A.H. Letvin N.L. Blood. 2008; 112: 4585-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that the type II NKT mediate this function. Monitoring CD8+ T cell immune by AL11-Gag tetramer staining, we found that the strength of immune response correlated with greater damping of antigen expression. Only mice with intact type II NKT cells showed wild-type CD8+ T cell immune responses. Both NK cell- and iNKT cell-depleted mice developed normal immune responses (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas a total loss of NKT cell function through additional depletion of type II NKT cells led to a decrease in CD8+ T cell mediated immune responses (Fig. 3C). Thus, the complete depletion of NKT cell function can also be achieved by d-glucosyl-β1-1′ ceramide (C12) treatment (29.Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Bere Jr., E.W. Murphy W.J. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This led to a total loss of SIV Gag AL11-specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) response at day 14 (p = 0.03, n = 4) and day 21 (p = 0.03, n = 4) following vaccine administration (Fig. 3C). Treatment of control ceramides did not have an effect on the cellular immune response. To further evaluate the contribution of CD1d-restricted T cell responses to a plasmid DNA vaccine-elicited immune response, we compared the Luc-specific T cell immune response generated by plasmid DNA luciferase immunization in wild-type and CD1d KO mice in more detail. We found that wild-type mice showed a 3–4-fold higher IFN-γ spot-forming cells (SFC) response than CD1d KO mice following exposure to Luc peptides one month after plasmid DNA inoculation (Fig. 4A). We also assessed the CD4+ T cell immune response to Luc peptides in wild-type and CD1d KO mice by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Wild-type mice showed a 4-fold greater CD4+ T cell immune response to the Luc peptides than CD1d KO mice (Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggest that type II NKT cells are necessary for the induction of vaccine antigen-specific CTL responses and clearance of antigen following DNA immunization. To test the hypothesis that DNA vaccination activates NKT cells at the site of injection and these cells then migrate to the peripheral blood, we measured CD69 expression by CD1d-PBS57 tetramer-positive cells in PBMC. We found an ∼20-fold increase in activated NKT cells in PBMC 5 days after vaccination compared with unvaccinated animals (Fig. 4C). Plasmid DNA vaccination was associated with up-regulation CD69 surface expression from 0.4 to 10% (p = 0.03, n = 4). One possible explanation for this observed function of NKT cells is that these cells secrete a series of cytokines following recognition of CD1d that can polarize T helper cell responses (37.Chang Y.J. Huang J.R. Tsai Y.C. Hung J.T. Wu D. Fujio M. Wong C.H. Yu A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10299-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we measured 20 cytokines and chemokines in sera of wild-type and CD1d KO mice following DNA immunization. We found that cytokines and chemokines were maximally increased at day 1 after inoculation and then returned to background levels at day 2 or 3. These kinetics are consistent with an innate immune response. Comparing the blood levels of these proteins in wild-type and CD1d KO mice, we found that both TH1-type and TH2-type cytokines decreased in the CD1d KO: GM-CSF (wt:30.56 ± 15.3, CD1d: 5.28 ± 1.6, p = 0.15, n = 5), IL-2 (wt: 61.6 ± 41.5, CD1d: 10.84 ± 4.5, p = 0.10, n = 5), IL-5 (wt: 150.8 ± 61.8, CD1d: 28.5 ± 19.7, p = 0.03, n = 5), IL-13 (wt: 152.2 ± 114.9, CD1d; 14.6 ± 6.4, p = 0.06, n = 5) and the chemokine MCP-1 (wt: 99.9 ± 31.0, CD1d 17.0 ± 1.9, p = 0.008, n = 5) were expressed at higher levels in the wild type than in the CD1d KO mice (Fig. 5). We finally tested whether the TH1-type chemokine MCP-1 more highly expressed following plasmid DNA vaccination in the wild type than in the CD1d KO mice, could be alone responsible for the enhancement of the DNA vaccine-induced SIV-Gag AL11-specific CD8+ T cell immune response. We used TH2-type cytokine IL-13 as a control. We treated wild-type mice with each of the proteins by i.m. route on days 0, 3, and 5 following plasmid DNA-Luc inoculation and measured the SIV-Gag AL11-specific CD8+ T cell responses. We found that MCP-1 increased the SIV-Gag AL11-specific CD8+ T cell responses by 2–3-fold (Fig. 6A), whereas the IL-13 control had no effect on the DNA vaccine-elicited responses (Fig. 6B). Emerging data suggest that NKT cells are a heterogeneous population with a variety of immune functions. NKT cells have been classified into subtypes based on the degree of their TCR diversity and the antigen-presenting molecules that they recognize (8.Kronenberg M. Gapin L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Two of these subtypes, the classical or iNKT cells and the non-classical or type II NKT cells, interact with the CD1 receptor. The present study shows that type II NKT cells contribute to plasmid DNA antigen clearance and to changes in vaccine-induced cellular immune responses. Our findings increase the range of biologic functions mediated by type II NKT cells found so far: (i) In ulcerative colitis, type II NKT cells are present in the lamina propria of the colon, and lyse intestinal epithelial cells (38.Fuss I.J.

https://openalex.org/W2068614489,"Chromosomal translocations are frequently observed in cells exposed to agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, and are often associated with tumors in mammals. Recently, translocation formation in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been found to occur at high frequencies following the creation of multiple DSBs adjacent to repetitive sequences on non-homologous chromosomes. The genetic control of translocation formation and the chromosome complements of the clones that contain translocations suggest that translocation formation occurs by single-strand annealing (SSA). Among the factors important for translocation formation by SSA is the central mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination (HR) factor, Msh2. Here we describe the effects of several msh2 missense mutations on translocation formation that suggest that Msh2 has separable functions in stabilizing annealed single strands, and removing non-homologous sequences from their ends. Additionally, interactions between the msh2 alleles and a null allele of RAD1, which encodes a subunit of a nuclease critical for the removal of non-homologous tails suggest that Msh2 blocks an alternative mechanism for removing these sequences. These results suggest that Msh2 plays multiple roles in the formation of chromosomal translocations following acute levels of DNA damage."
