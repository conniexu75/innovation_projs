https://openalex.org/W2097483036,"Glucocorticoid hormones counteract inflammation and phorbol ester tumor promotion and drastically decrease the expression of several extracellular proteases, including collagenase I. Glucocorticoid hormone inhibits basal and induced transcription of collagenase by interfering with AP-1, the major enhancer factor of the collagenase promoter. The mechanism of interference is novel in that it does not require protein synthesis, it depends on the hormone receptor but not its binding to DNA, it occurs at hormone doses one order of magnitude below those required for gene activation, and it involves down-modulation of the trans-activating function of preexisting unbound and DNA-bound AP-1. Coprecipitation experiments suggest direct AP-1-hormone receptor interaction, which also possibly explains the reverse experiment: overexpression of Fos or Jun inhibits the expression of hormone-dependent genes."
https://openalex.org/W1987557547,"Glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of collagenase induction by phorbol esters and inflammatory mediators. The target for this negative effect is the AP-1 site within the collagenase promoter, which also mediates its induction. Negative regulation is due to repression of AP-1 activity by the glucocorticoid receptor (GCR). While the GCR is a potent inhibitor of AP-1 activity (Jun/Fos), both c-Jun and c-Fos are potent repressors of GCR activity. In vitro experiments using purified GCR and c-Jun proteins suggest that mutual repression is due to direct interaction between the two. Direct interaction between GCR and either c-Jun or c-Fos is demonstrated by cross-linking and coimmunoprecipitation. These findings reveal a cross talk between two major signal transduction systems used to control gene transcription in response to extracellular stimuli, and a novel mechanism for transcriptional repression."
https://openalex.org/W1980722886,"We present evidence that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and transcription factor Jun/AP-1 can reciprocally repress one another's transcriptional activation by a novel mechanism that is independent of DNA binding. Overexpression of c-Jun prevents the glucocorticoid-induced activation of genes carrying a functional glucocorticoid response element (GRE). Conversely, GR is able to repress AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Mutant analysis reveals that the ligand binding and DNA binding domains of GR and the region including the leucine zipper of c-Jun are required for repression. Gel retardation analysis demonstrates that bacterially expressed c-Jun disrupts GR-GRE complexes. These data indicate that members of two distinct classes of transcription factors can oppose one another's activity through a mechanism likely involving protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1533321987,"Bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) were exposed to continuous fluxes of hydroxyl radical (.OH) alone, superoxide anion radical (O2-) alone, or mixtures of .OH and O2-, by gamma radiolysis in the presence of 100% N2O (.OH exposure), 100% O2 + formate (O2- exposure), or 100% O2 alone (.OH + O2- exposure). Hydrogen peroxide effects were studied by addition of pure H2O2. NADH dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, succinate oxidase, and ATPase activities (Vmax) were rapidly inactivated by .OH (10% inactivation at 15-40 nmol of .OH/mg of SMP protein, 50-90% inactivation at 600 nmol of .OH/mg of SMP protein) and by .OH + O2- (10% inactivation at 20-80 nmol of .OH + O2-/mg of SMP protein, 45-75% inactivation at 600 nmol of .OH + O2-/mg of SMP protein). Importantly, O2- was a highly efficient inactivator of NADH dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase, and ATPase (10% inactivation at 20-50 nmol of O2-/mg of SMP protein, 40% inactivation at 600 nmol of O2-/mg of SMP protein), a mildly efficient inactivator of succinate dehydrogenase (10% inactivation at 150 nmol of O2-/mg of SMP protein, 30% inactivation at 600 nmol of O2-/mg of SMP protein), and a poor inactivator of succinate oxidase (less than 10% inactivation at 600 nmol of O2-/mg of SMP protein). H2O2 partially inactivated NADH dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase, and cytochrome oxidase, but even 10% loss of these activities required at least 500-600 nmol of H2O2/mg of SMP protein. Cytochrome oxidase activity (oxygen consumption supported by ascorbate + N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) was remarkably resistant to oxidative inactivation, with less than 20% loss of activity evident even at .OH, O2-, OH + O2-, or H2O2 concentrations of 600 nmol/mg of SMP protein. Cytochrome c oxidase activity, however (oxidation of, added, ferrocytochrome c), exhibited more than a 40% inactivation at 600 nmol of .OH/mg of SMP protein. The .OH-dependent inactivations reported above were largely inhibitable by the .OH scavenger mannitol. In contrast, the O2(-)-dependent inactivations were inhibited by active superoxide dismutase, but not by denatured superoxide dismutase or catalase. Membrane lipid peroxidation was evident with .OH exposure but could be prevented by various lipid-soluble antioxidants which did not protect enzymatic activities at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2027988197,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found to promote the survival of Ell 7 rat embryo septal cholinergic neurons in culture, as assessed by a histochemical stain for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). A 2.4-fold increase in neuronal survival was achieved with 10 ng/ml BDNF After initial deprivation of growth factor for 7 days, BDNF failed to bring about this increase, strongly suggesting that BDNF promotes cell survival and not just induction of AChE. BDNF was also found to increase the levels of cholinergic enzymes; choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and AChE activities were increased by approximately 2-fold in the presence of 50 ng/ml BDNF BDNF produced a 3-fold increase in the number of cells bearing the NGF receptor, as detected by the monoclonal antibody IgG-192. Although NGF had no additive effect with BDNF in terms of neuronal survival, suggesting that both act on a similar neuronal population, the combination of both produced an additive response, approximately a 6-fold increase, in ChAT activity."
https://openalex.org/W2063767041,"Efficient transcription of SV40 early genes requires transcription factor Sp1. Here, we report that SV40 infection induces Sp1 phosphorylation. While characterizing this modification, we discovered that Sp1 becomes quantitatively phosphorylated in an in vitro transcription extract. Multiple processive phosphorylation of Sp1 depends on binding of Sp1 to GC box-containing DNA. Cell fractionation and column chromatography reveal that the Sp1 kinase is a nuclear DNA binding protein that corresponds to a previously identified DNA-dependent protein kinase. Because only some trans-activators are phosphorylated by this kinase, Sp1 belongs to a specific subgroup of factors that are phosphorylated upon binding to promoter sequences. Finally, efficient phosphorylation of Sp1 requires both a functional DNA binding domain and a region containing the transcriptional activation domains. Coupling of phosphorylation to DNA binding may represent a novel mechanism for regulating transcriptional initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1992470956,"The export of many E. coli proteins such as proOmpA requires the cytosolic chaperone SecB and the membrane-bound preprotein translocase. Translocase is a multisubunit enzyme with the SecA protein as its peripheral membrane domain and the SecY/E protein as its integral domain. SecB, by binding to proOmpA in the cytosol, prevents its aggregation or association with membranes at nonproductive sites. The SecA receptor binds the proOmpA-SecB complex (Kd approximately 6 x 10(-8) M) through direct recognition of both the SecB (Kd approximately 2 x 10(-7) M) as well as the leader and mature domains of the precursor protein. SecB has a dual function in stabilizing the precursor and in passing it on to membrane-bound SecA, the next step in the pathway. SecA itself is bound to the membrane by its affinity (Kd approximately 4 x 10(-8) M) for SecY/E and for acidic lipids. The functions of SecB and SecA as a two-stage receptor system are linked by their affinity for each other."

https://openalex.org/W2002302770,"Primary afferent C fibers in rat dorsal roots are depolarized by the excitatory amino acids kainate and domoate. Under whole-cell voltage clamp, kainate and domoate increase membrane conductance in a subpopulation of freshly dissociated DRG neurons. In contrast to kainate currents observed in CNS neurons, responses to kainate and domoate in DRG cells desensitize with prolonged agonist exposure. Half-maximal activation is achieved with much lower concentrations of kainate and domoate in sensory neurons than in CNS neurons from cerebral cortex. Rapid applications of glutamate, quisqualate, and AMPA evoke a transient current in DRG neurons and desensitize cells to subsequent applications of kainate or domoate. Brief incubation with the lectin concanavalin A eliminates desensitization to excitatory amino acids; after treatment with concanavalin A, all five agonists gate sustained currents of similar amplitude via the same receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2073786218,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF-R) mRNA expression was examined in the adult rat CNS. Northern blot analysis showed a distinct 4.3 kb transcript in various CNS regions. In situ hybridization revealed widely distributed, but specific, populations of cells that express FGF-R mRNA. The most intense hybridization signals were observed in the hippocampus and in the pontine cholinergic neurons. The limbic system and brainstem nuclei, including motor nuclei, showed robust labeling. Cerebellar granule cells and spinal cord neurons were positive for FGF-R mRNA. The distribution of FGF-R mRNA differed significantly from that of NGF receptor mRNA; particularly, no hybridization signal was detected in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. These results strongly suggest that FGF or FGF-like molecules may exert effects on specific neuronal populations in the mature CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2158733225,"The integration of viral DNA into the host cell chromosome is an essential feature of the retroviral life cycle. The integration reaction requires cis-acting sequences at the ends of linear viral DNA and a trans-acting product of the pol gene, the integration protein (IN). Previously, we demonstrated that avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV) IN is able to carry out the first step in the integration process in vitro: nicking of the ends of linear viral DNA. In this paper, using two independent assays, we demonstrate that IN, alone, is sufficient to carry out the second step: cleavage and joining to the target DNA. These results demonstrate that the retroviral IN protein is an integrase."
https://openalex.org/W2052090797,"As cells enter mitosis, the intermediate filament (IF) networks of interphase BHK-21 cells are depolymerized to form cytoplasmic aggregates of disassembled IFs, and the constituent IF proteins, vimentin and desmin are hyperphosphorylated at several specific sites. We have characterized one of two endogenous vimentin kinases from a particulate fraction of mitotic cell lysates. Through several purification steps, vimentin kinase activity copurifies with histone H1 kinase and both activities bind to p13suc1-Sepharose. The final enriched kinase preparation consists primarily of p34cdc2 and polypeptides of 65 and 110 kd. The purified kinase complex phosphorylates vimentin in vitro at a subset of sites phosphorylated in vivo during mitosis. Furthermore, phosphorylation of in vitro polymerized vimentin IFs by the purified kinase causes their disassembly. Therefore, vimentin is a substrate of p34cdc2 and phosphorylation of vimentin contributes to M phase reorganization of the IF network."
https://openalex.org/W2171135455,"Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi merozoites invade human erythrocytes that express Duffy blood group surface determinants. A soluble parasite protein of 135 kd binds specifically to a human Duffy antigen. Using antisera affinity purified on the 135 kd protein, we cloned a gene that encodes a member of a P. knowlesi family of erythrocyte binding proteins. The gene is a member of a family that includes three homologous genes located on separate chromosomes. Two genes are expressed as major membrane-bound products that give rise to soluble erythrocyte binding proteins: the 135 kd Duffy binding protein and a 138 kd protein that binds only rhesus erythrocytes. These different erythrocyte binding specificities may result from sequence divergence of the homologous genes. The Duffy receptor family is localized in micronemes, an organelle found in all organisms of the phylum Apicomplexa."
https://openalex.org/W2089227897,"Olfactory transduction is thought to be mediated by a G protein-coupled increase in intracellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) that triggers the opening of cAMP-gated cation channels and results in depolarization of the plasma membrane of olfactory neurons. In olfactory neurons isolated from the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, stimulation with olfactory stimuli (amino acids) elicits an influx of calcium that leads to a rapid increase in intracellular calcium. In addition, in a reconstitution assay a plasma membrane calcium channel has been identified that is gated by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which could mediate this calcium influx. Together with previous studies indicating that stimulation with olfactory stimuli leads to stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover in olfactory cilia, these data suggest that an influx of calcium triggered by odor stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover may be an alternate or additional mechanism of olfactory transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2158054272,"Drosophila has four loci encoding type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatases (PP1s). Here we describe mutations in one of these genes, at 87B on chromosome 3. Mutants die at the larval-pupal boundary with little or no imaginal cell proliferation. Neuroblasts are delayed in progress through mitosis and show defective spindle organization, abnormal sister chromatid segregation, hyperploidy, and excessive chromosome condensation. Germline transformation of mutant flies with the wild-type PP1 87B gene restores normal mitosis, viability, and fertility. These results show that PP1 activity is required for mitotic progression and that the other loci cannot supply sufficient activity to complement loss of expression of the PP1 87B gene. Alternatively, the PP1 87B product may have a distinct specialized function in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2073358204,"A genetically engineered herpes simplex virus variant was constructed for use as a stable gene vector for neurons. To inhibit replication, the agent possessed a deletion in the immediate early gene ICP4, and to minimize reactivation from the latent state, the gene encoding the latency-associated transcript was deleted. The E. coli beta-galactosidase gene under the control of the Maloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat promoter was inserted into the ICP4 region. When introduced into the peripheral nervous system, this virus established latent infections and stably expressed beta-galactosidase in primary sensory neurons. Expression of beta-galactosidase over a more limited time period was observed when the latent infection was established in motor neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus. Agents of this general design have considerable potential for use as gene vectors for studies of neuronal function and correction of genetic defects affecting neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2003631346,"Hippocampal slices were preincubated with 32P-orthophosphate and used to study the effect of glutamate analogs on protein phosphorylation. NMDA induced a rapid, 70% decrease in the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein MAP2, with no change in the total amount of MAP2. Both competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists blocked the effect of NMDA, but a glutamate antagonist acting at non-NMDA receptors did not. Kainate and quisqualate were less potent than NMDA in stimulating dephosphorylation of MAP2. Other forebrain regions (necortex, striatum, and olfactory bulb) also showed dephosphorylation of MAP2 in response to NMDA. These and other results suggest that NMDA receptor activation induces the dephosphorylation of MAP2 by stimulating a protein phosphatase, possibly the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. Moreover, they indicate that alteration in the properties of a microtubule-associated protein may account for some of the effects of glutamate on postsynaptic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2042568710,"Ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76 amino acid protein, plays a role in targeting intracellular proteins for degradation. Ubiquitin expression was examined during the developmentally programmed atrophy and degeneration of the intersegmental muscles (ISMs) in the hawk-moth, Manduca sexta. A clone containing nine repeats of the ubiquitin coding sequence was isolated from an ISM cDNA library and was used as a probe to examine polyubiquitin expression during development. When the ISMs became committed to degenerate, polyubiquitin gene expression increased dramatically. Injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone, which delays degeneration in this system, prevented the increase in polyubiquitin mRNA. The expression of polyubiquitin occurred without apparent activation of the cell's heat shock response. These data suggest that ubiquitin plays a role in programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2085015167,"Patterns of expression of transcripts encoding receptors for fibroblast growth factor and nerve growth factor (FGF-R and NGF-R) in the developing chick nervous system are compared using in situ hybridization histochemistry. FGF-R transcripts are expressed abundantly in the germinal neuroepithelial layer. Expression ceases as cells migrate into the mantle layer and returns during late maturation of neuronal populations, including cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain, brainstem reticular and motor nuclei, and cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. The pattern of NGF-R expression is generally reciprocal to that of FGF-R in the CNS and in some phases of development of the PNS. These results suggest that FGF and NGF may act sequentially rather than in concert during neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W1593099788,"Treatment of adipocytes with okadaic acid (a specific inhibitor of type 1 and 2a protein phosphatases) resulted in a rapid 8-10-fold stimulation of cell extract myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase activity (t1/2 = 10 min) and kinase activity toward a synthetic peptide RRLSSLRA (S6 peptide) (t1/2 = 5 min). Insulin brought about a smaller stimulation of these two activities (t1/2 = 2.5 min). MBP kinase activity from cells treated with okadaic acid or insulin was resolved by anion exchange chromatography into two well defined peaks; S6 peptide kinase activity was less well resolved. The two partially purified MBP kinases were inactivated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 or by protein phosphatase 2a (PP-2a). In contrast, partially purified S6 peptide kinase activity was inactivated only by PP-2a or protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1). Furthermore, a 38-kDa protein which co-eluted with one peak of MBP kinase and a 42-kDa protein which co-eluted with the other peak of MBP kinase were phosphorylated on tyrosine after treatment with okadaic acid. These findings illustrate several important points concerning regulation of MBP and S6 peptide kinases. First, these protein kinases are regulated by phosphorylation, and, second, in the absence of hormonal stimuli their activities are strongly suppressed by protein phosphatases. Lastly, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation accompanying the activation of MBP kinases following okadaic acid treatment suggests a role for PP-2a in events that are mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1990110463,"Thyrotropin (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) are structurally related glycoprotein hormones, which bind to receptors that share a high degree of sequence similarity. However, comparison of the primary amino acid sequences of the TSH and LH-CG receptors reveals two unique insertions of 8 and 50 amino acids in the extracellular domain of the TSH receptor. The functional significance of these insertions were determined by site-directed mutagenesis. Deletion of the 50-amino acid tract (residues 317 to 366) had no effect on TSH binding or on TSH and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) biological activities. In contrast, either deletion or substitution of the eight-amino acid region (residues 38 to 45) abolished these activities. This eight-amino acid tract near the amino terminus of the TSH receptor appears to be an important site of interaction for both TSH and TSI."

https://openalex.org/W2091495597,"HeLa cell nuclear splicing extracts have been prepared that are specifically and efficiently depleted of U1, U2, or snRNPs by antisense affinity chromatography using biotinylated 2′-OMe RNA oligonucleotides. Removal of each snRNP particle prevents pre-mRNA splicing but arrests spliceosome formation at different stages of assembly. Mixing extracts depleted for different snRNP particles restores formation of functional splicing complexes. Specific binding of factors to the 3′ splice site region is still detected in snRNP-depleted extracts. Depletion of U1 snRNP impairs stable binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branch site. This role of U1 snRNP in promoting stable presplicing complex formation is independent of the U1 snRNA-5′ splice site interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2078566041,"Thyroid hormone (T3) and retinoic acid (RA) receptors mediate ligand-dependent inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and c-erbB2/neu promoter activities. Ligand-activated T3 and RA receptors act via a 36 bp 5′ fragment of the EGF receptor gene in vivo and, in the presence of nuclear extract, bind with high affinity to this region in vitro. Both ligand binding and DNA binding domains of T3 and RA receptors are required for promoter inhibition. When both receptors are expressed in the presence of a single ligand, inhibition is reversed, indicating that the hormone-activated receptor is competed by the unliganded receptor. These results suggest that ligand regulates transcriptional inhibitory functions of the T3 and RA receptors and describe novel regulation of growth factor receptor gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1571816003,"The efflux of GSH has been shown previously to be a saturable process in both isolated rat hepatocytes and perfused liver, suggesting a carrier-mediated transport mechanism. The possibility in hormonal regulation of this process has been raised by recent reports. Our present work examined the role of hormones known to affect intracellular signal transduction mechanisms on GSH efflux in cultured rat hepatocytes and perfused rat livers. We found that cAMP-dependent factors, such as cholera toxin (CT), dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, and glucagon all stimulated GSH efflux in cultured rat hepatocytes. The efflux kinetics were compared in cultured cells incubated with or without CT; the stimulation of GSH efflux was related to a near doubling of the Vmax while exhibiting no significant alteration of the Km. The increase in intracellular cAMP level associated with the threshold for this stimulatory effect was 25% above control. The stimulatory effect of CT could not be blocked by cyclohexamide pretreatment or reversed by colchicine treatment. The stimulatory effect of glucagon was abolished in the presence of ouabain but not in the presence of barium. On the other hand, hormones which act through Ca2+ and protein kinase C, such as phenylephrine and vasopressin, had no effect on GSH efflux in the cultured cells. In the perfused liver model, glucagon (10 nM) and dibutyryl cAMP (8 microM) stimulated sinusoidal GSH efflux to 130 and 144% of control values, respectively, and increased bile flow while not affecting biliary GSH efflux. Finally, the physiological significance of glucagon-mediated stimulation of sinusoidal GSH efflux was assessed by both plasma GSH and glucose levels in response to in vivo glucagon infusion. The threshold dose of glucagon for significant increase in plasma GSH (5.21 pmol/min) was lower than for glucose (15.61 pmol/min). At the highest glucagon infusion rate (261 pmol/min), plasma GSH level doubled while glucose level increased 80%. In conclusion, increased cAMP stimulates GSH efflux in cultured rat hepatocytes and perfused livers. The stimulatory effect of cAMP is exerted at the sinusoidal pole and appears to be mediated by hyperpolarization of hepatocytes by stimulation of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. In vivo studies confirmed the importance of cAMP-mediated stimulation of sinusoidal GSH efflux as it resulted in significant elevation of the plasma GSH level."
https://openalex.org/W1495434193,"mRNAs from the alpha- and beta-subunits (mRNA alpha and mRNA beta, respectively) of Torpedo californica (Na,K)-ATPase were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes either separately or in combination, and the properties of the two subunits synthesized were studied. The alpha-subunit synthesized in oocytes injected with mRNA alpha alone was recovered in both the membrane and cytosol fractions and was susceptible to tryptic attack. When mRNA beta was coinjected with mRNA alpha, almost all the alpha-subunit was found in the membrane fraction and was resistant to trypsin. In all cases, essentially all of the beta-subunit was recovered in the membrane fraction and was resistant to trypsin. As the amount of mRNA beta coinjected increased, the amounts of both the alpha- and beta-subunits as well as (Na,K)-ATPase activity of the membrane fraction increased. These results suggest that the beta-subunit facilitates the correct assembly of the alpha-subunit into the membrane probably by forming a stable complex with the nascent alpha-subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2093112951,"We have studied the subcellular distribution of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits of the dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor and ankyrin in rat skeletal muscle with immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling techniques. All three proteins were concentrated in the triad junction formed between the T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits of the DHP receptor were colocalized in the junctional T-tubule membrane, supporting their proposed association in a functional complex and the possible participation of the alpha 2 subunit in excitation-contraction coupling. Ankyrin label in the triad showed a distribution different from that of the DHP receptor subunits. In addition, ankyrin was found in longitudinally oriented structures outside the triad. Thus, ankyrin might be involved in organizing the triad and in immobilizing integral membrane proteins in T-tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1582322269,Discrimination between cAMP and cGMP is a critical feature of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. An alanine/threonine difference in the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites has been proposed to provide a structural basis for this functional distinction. Site-directed mutagenesis of this alanine to a threonine in a cAMP-binding site of cAMP kinase produced a mutant with markedly increased cGMP affinity as determined by cGMP binding and protein kinase activation assays. Studies of other mutants at this position support the role of the threonine hydroxyl group as the component that enhances cGMP binding affinity.
https://openalex.org/W2033808907,"Afferent influences on natural cell death were modeled in retinal cultures derived from neonatal rats. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) blockade of electrical activity produced a significant reduction in surviving retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons during a critical period of development, similar in magnitude to the reduction observed during natural cell death in the intact retina at a similar developmental stage. The addition of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) protected the RGCs from the lethal action of TTX. This effect was specific, since the related peptides PHI-27 and secretin produced no significant increase in RGC survival. Radioimmunoassay of cyclic nucleotides showed that TTX decreased culture levels of cAMP and that this trend was reversed by VIP. Decreases in RGC survival associated with TTX electrical blockade were prevented by 8-bromo:cAMP or forskolin. Furthermore, VIP10-28, the C-terminal fragment that inhibits VIP stimulation of adenylate cyclase, reduced the number of surviving RGCs. Thus, our results suggest that VIP, acting by increasing cAMP, has a neurotrophic effect on electrically blocked RGCs and may be an endogenous factor modulating normal cell death in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W1489462168,"Glucosidase II was purified approximately 1700-fold to homogeneity from Triton X-100 extracts of mung bean microsomes. A single band with a molecular mass of 110 kDa was seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. This band was susceptible to digestion by endoglucosaminidase H or peptide glycosidase F, and the change in mobility of the treated protein indicated the loss of one or two oligosaccharide chains. By gel filtration, the native enzyme was estimated to have a molecular mass of about 220 kDa, suggesting it was composed of two identical subunits. Glucosidase II showed a broad pH optima between 6.8 and 7.5 with reasonable activity even at 8.5, but there was almost no activity below pH 6.0. The purified enzyme could use p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate but was also active with a number of glucose-containing high-mannose oligosaccharides. Glc2Man9GlcNAc was the best substrate while activity was significantly reduced when several mannose residues were removed, i.e. Glc2Man7-GlcNAc. The rate of activity was lowest with Glc1Man9GlcNAc, demonstrating that the innermost glucose is released the slowest. Evidence that the enzyme is specific for alpha 1,3-glucosidic linkages is shown by the fact that its activity on Glc2Man9GlcNAc was inhibited by nigerose, an alpha 1,3-linked glucose disaccharide, but not by alpha 1,2 (kojibiose)-, alpha 1,4(maltose)-, or alpha 1,6 (isomaltose)-linked glucose disaccharides. Glucosidase II was strongly inhibited by the glucosidase processing inhibitors deoxynojirimycin and 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-imino-7-O-(beta-D- glucopyranosyl)-D-glycero-L-guloheptitol, but less strongly by castanospermine and not at all by australine. Polyclonal antibodies prepared against the mung bean glucosidase II reacted with a 95-kDa protein from suspension-cultured soybean cells that also showed glucosidase II activity. Soybean cells were labeled with either [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]galactose, and the glucosidase II was isolated by immunoprecipitation. Essentially all of the radioactive mannose was released from the protein by treatment with endoglucosaminidase H. The labeled oligosaccharide(s) released by endoglucosaminidase H was isolated and characterized by gel filtration and by treatment with various enzymes. The major oligosaccharide chain on the soybean glucosidase II appeared to be a Man9(GlcNAc)2 with small amounts of Glc1Man9(GlcNAc)2."

We report the cloning and sequencing of the gene expressed in human fibroblasts. Like the other two transcribed genes, it has four exons. The 5'-flanking region of the fibroblast translocase gene contains a functional promoter. The promoter has a TATA motif beginning 30 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site and five potential SP1 binding sites, but lacks a canonical CCAAT box immediately upstream of the TATA sequence. Differences among the sequence motifs of the 5'-flanking region of the three human translocase genes could account for differences in their cell type-specific and proliferation-associated expression."
https://openalex.org/W2064401245,"Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that participates in the transduction of calcium signals. The electric phenotypes of calmodulin mutants of Paramecium have suggested that the protein may regulate some calcium-dependent ion channels. Calcium-dependent sodium single channels in excised patches of the plasma membrane from Paramecium were identified, and their activity was shown to decrease after brief exposure to submicromolar concentrations of calcium. Channel activity was restored to these inactivated patches by adding calmodulin that was isolated from Paramecium to the cytoplasmic surface. This restoration of channel activity did not require adenosine triphosphate and therefore, probably resulted from direct binding of calmodulin, either to the sodium channel itself or to a channel regulator that was associated with the patch membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1497822816,"The present studies describe the distribution of phosphatidylinositol (PI) within the membrane bilayer of the human red blood cell (RBC) as well as its transbilayer mobility. The membrane bilayer distribution was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of PI in the exterior leaflet of the RBC membrane using a PI-specific phospholipase C and by extraction of PI from the exterior leaflet using bovine serum albumin. The transbilayer mobility of PI was measured by following the fate of radiolabeled PI which was first incorporated into the outer leaflet of the RBC membrane. Our results indicate that PI is asymmetrically distributed in the membrane, with approximately 80% located in the inner and 20% in the outer leaflet of the bilayer. The rate of transbilayer mobility of PI is similar to that for certain molecular species of phosphatidylcholine and much slower than that reported for the aminophospholipids in the RBC membrane."

At least eight radioactive metabolites were observed, three of which were previously identified as 20-hydroxy-, 20-carboxy-, and 18-carboxy-19,20-dinor-LTB4. A less lipophilic major metabolite (designated HIV) was purified by two reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography separations and was found to exhibit maximal UV absorbance at 269 nm with shoulders at 260 and 280 indicating the presence of a conjugated triene chromophore. Negative ion electron capture gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the pentafluorobenzyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivative of HIV, and positive ion electron ionization mass spectra of the methyl ester trimethylsilyl derivative were consistent with a structure of this metabolite being 16-carboxy-14,15-dihydro-17,18,19,20-tetranor-LTB3. The appearance of this metabolite supports the concept of further beta-oxidation of LTB4 to the carbon 16 which requires the action of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase to remove the 14,15-double bond located two carbon atoms removed from the CoA thioester moiety. One minor metabolite was analyzed by negative ion continuous flow fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry which revealed an ion at m/z 444 which by high resolution mass spectrometry was shown to contain both nitrogen and sulfur. Tandem mass spectrometry suggested the presence of SO3- as well as other fragments corresponding to the amino acid taurine. Incubation of isolated rat hepatocytes with [14C]taurine as well as [3H]LTB4 revealed the incorporation of both radioactive isotopes into this metabolite. The data supported the identification of this metabolite as tauro-18-carboxy-19,20-dinor-LTB4. Amino acid conjugation of leukotrienes has not been previously reported and suggests that such intermediates might participate in enterohepatic circulation of LTB4 metabolites in the intact animal and thus serve as an alternative metabolic route for LTB4 elimination."
https://openalex.org/W1935835891,"The yeast gene for the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome b.c1 complex was subcloned into the expression vector, pSP64, then transcribed and translated in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. Import studies in vitro of the newly synthesized precursor form of the iron-sulfur protein into isolated yeast mitochondria revealed that the precursor form of the iron-sulfur protein is processed into the mature form via an intermediate form. After the import reaction at 18 or 27 degrees C, treatment of mitochondria with exogenous protease indicated that both intermediate and mature forms had been internalized into mitochondria where they were resistant to digestion by external protease. Import and processing of the iron-sulfur protein into mitochondria also occurred at temperatures ranging from 2 to 27 degrees C in a temperature-dependent manner. Processing of the precursor form to the intermediate form appeared to be less sensitive to temperature than the processing of the intermediate form to the mature form. Moreover, at temperatures of 12 degrees C or lower, the mature form produced was completely digested by exogenous protease suggesting that it was assembled incorrectly in the membrane and not assembled into the b.c1 complex. The successive disappearance of first the mature form and then the intermediate form of the iron-sulfur protein by increasing concentrations of the metal chelators, EDTA and o-phenanthroline, suggested that two different proteases requiring divalent metal ions are involved in the two-step processing of the presequence of the iron-sulfur protein. Furthermore, mitoplasts containing only the matrix/inner membrane fraction were able to import and process the precursor form of the iron-sulfur protein indicating that both proteolytic processing events occur in the matrix/inner membrane fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1529230387,"Phosphorylation of a single threonine (myosin IA) or serine (myosins IB and IC) in the heavy chains of the Acanthamoeba myosin I isozymes is required for expression of their actin-activated Mg2(+)-ATPase activities. We now report that the synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Arg-Ser-Ser-Val-Tyr-Ser, which corresponds to the phosphorylated region of Acanthamoeba myosin IC, is a good substrate for myosin I heavy chain kinase: Km = 54 microM, and Vmax = 15 mumols/min.mg. The same serine is phosphorylated as in the native substrate (residue 6 in the above sequence), and kinase activity with the synthetic peptide as substrate is also stimulated by phosphatidylserine-enhanced autophosphorylation of the kinase. These results indicate that all of the essential sequence determinants of kinase specificity are contained within this 9-residue peptide. With the peptide as substrate, we found that another acidic phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol, also enhances autophosphorylation of the kinase whereas the neutral phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine do not. By comparing the Km and Vmax values for a series of synthetic peptide substrates, we established that 1 basic amino acid is essential on the NH2-terminal side of the phosphorylation site, and two are preferable, and that a tyrosine is essential 2 residues away on the COOH-terminal side. There is a slight preference for arginines over lysines. All of these local sequence specificity determinants are present in the three native substrates, Acanthamoeba myosins IA, IB, and IC, and in two Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes that are putative substrates for the kinase. Similar sequences do not occur in the myosins I from intestinal brush border, which is not a substrate for the Acanthamoeba kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1581619899,"The gene COX VII coding for yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit VII has been cloned by a two-step procedure. Two degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to amino- and carboxyl-terminal protein segments were used in a polymerase chain reaction for the amplification of a major portion of subunit VII (residues 1-52), which was then used for the cloning of complete COX VII. From the nucleotide sequence, an additional amino-terminal and two additional carboxyl-terminal amino acids are predicted as compared with the described primary sequence (Power, S. D., Lochrie, M. A., and Poyton, R. O. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9206-9209). Beside subunit VIIa the subunit described here is the only nuclear encoded subunit of cytochrome c oxidase in yeast without a leader sequence. COX VII exists as a single copy per haploid genome as shown by Southern blot and gene disruption. Null mutants produced by gene disruption at the COX VII locus were respiratory-deficient. No cytochrome c oxidase activity was detectable nor was there an assembly of the oxidase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1581629428,"Two glutamate-binding proteins (71 and 63 kDa) were previously purified from synaptic plasma membranes (Chen, J.-W., Cunningham, M.D., Galton, V., and Michaelis, E. K. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 417-426). These proteins may play a role in glutamate neurotransmission in brain. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the denatured glutamate-binding proteins in rabbits, including sets of antibodies against each of the binding proteins. The antibodies reacted specifically against both 71- and 63-kDa proteins. The antibodies recognized the denatured form of the proteins in Western blots and the native state of the proteins in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and in immunoaffinity chromatography and extraction procedures. All antibodies labeled most strongly the 71-kDa protein in Western blots, but extracted both proteins from solubilized synaptic membrane preparations. These findings indicate that the two proteins are closely related immunologically but the reactivity on Western blots differs between these two proteins. Immunoextraction of the 71- and 63-kDa proteins led to a approximately 60% decrease in L-[3H]glutamate-binding activity associated with synaptic membrane proteins. Of the brain subcellular fractions examined, the isolated synaptic plasma membranes had the strongest reaction in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays toward the antiglutamate-binding protein antisera. Electron microscopy combined with gold particle immunohistochemistry revealed the sites labeled by the antibodies as entities present either on the surface or within the postsynaptic membranes and the associated densities of brain nerve ending particles (synaptosomes). Immunohistochemical procedures of gold labeling with silver enhancement of labeled sites revealed selective neuronal labeling in brain regions enriched in glutamate neurotransmitter pathways such as the hippocampus. Labeling was along dendrites and around cell bodies of pyramidal neurons. Based on the pattern of histochemical labeling, the distribution of immune reactivity in synaptic membranes, and the extractions of a major component of membrane glutamate-recognizing proteins by the antibodies, the glutamate-binding proteins must play a role in glutamate neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W1593346842,"Two gastrin analogs containing a D- and a L-tetrafluorinated tyrosyl residue (Arg-Arg-Leu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-(F4)Tyr-Gly) were synthesized and tested as substrates and inhibitors of the insulin receptor kinase. No phosphorylation of these peptides was observed, but both gastrin analogs were effective inhibitors in the microM range. Although the D- and L-tetrafluorotyrosine-gastrin analogs differ in the sequence by only 1 amino acid residue, a different inhibitory pattern was obtained with the insulin receptor. The inhibition of all-L-isomer is competitive with respect to both the protein substrate, reduced, S-carboxymethylated, and maleylated lysozyme (RCMM-lysozyme), and ATP with a Ki value of 4 microM. This result corroborates a previous finding (Walker, D. H., Kuppuswamy, D., Visvanathan, A., and Pike, L. J. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 1428-1433) that the kinetic mechanism for insulin receptor is a random Bi Bi mechanism. Different from the L-isomer, the D-analog is competitive to RCMM-lysozyme and noncompetitive toward ATP and gives an apparent inhibition constant of 20 microM. A free tetrafluorotyrosine also shows a competitive inhibition to protein substrate, RCMM-lysozyme (Ki = 18 mM) whereas free tyrosine shows no effect on the activity of insulin receptor. These results show the importance of the charge state and nucleophilicity of the phenolic component in substrate recognition and catalysis and provide a rationale for the design of inhibitors of tyrosyl phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1500400127,"A polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 3-25 of mature lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) was raised in rabbits. The antibody was used to study the production of LACI by Hep G2 hepatoma, Chang liver, and SK hepatoma cells, and to purify LACI from the culture media. By using an amidolytic assay for factor Xa, it was found that the culture media from these liver-derived cell lines contain inhibitors of factor Xa. In Hep G2 hepatoma culture medium, approximately 50% of Xa inhibitory activity was due to LACI. In the Chang liver and SK hepatoma culture media over 95% of the Xa inhibitory activity was due to LACI. The LACIs were purified from these media by immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-LACI-lg-Sepharose 4B column and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified LA-CIs varied in molecular weight depending on whether the media were concentrated before chromatography. An Mr approximately 38,000 LACI was obtained by chromatography of unconcentrated media. Chromatography of concentrated media yielded a LACI of Mr approximately 35,000 with the same amino-terminal sequence, suggesting partial proteolysis in the carboxyl-terminal region. In addition, an Mr approximately 25,000 form of LACI was also present. The purified Mr approximately 38,000 and approximately 35,000 LACI species from the above cells possess similar specific activities when measured by an anti-Xa/amidolysis assay. To study the role of LACI in the control of coagulation, pooled human plasma was depleted of LACI antigen by immunoaffinity absorption and reconstituted with varying amounts of purified LACI to examine the effect on tissue factor (TF)-induced coagulation. LACI depletion shortens the time of TF-induced clotting of plasma and the clotting time is linearly related to the LACI concentration after reconstitution. These results suggest that LACI plays an important role in limiting TF-induced coagulation in human plasma. Comparison of the potencies of various purified LACIs in the prolongation of TF-induced coagulation revealed that LA-CIs from different sources are not equivalent. The plasma LACI, SK hepatoma LACI, and Chang liver LACI are approximately 7-, 6-7, and 1.3-fold higher in specific activity than Hep G2 hepatoma LACI in the TF-induced clotting assay when compared on an anti-Xa/amidolysis unit basis, suggesting possible differences in post-translational modification of these LA-CIs."
https://openalex.org/W1591897306,"Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) receptor was purified from plasma membranes of bovine liver using Triton X-100 extraction, wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B gel affinity chromatography, and DEAE-cellulose anion-exchange chromatography. As previously reported for the aFGF receptor in murine fibroblasts (Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9568-9571), the purified aFGF receptor was also found to be a 135-kDa glycoprotein which showed an intrinsic and ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation activity. The 32P-labeled aFGF receptor was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-FGF receptor (anti-flg/bek/cek gene product) antiserum. In contrast to other growth factor receptors/protein tyrosine kinases, the protein tyrosine kinase activity (autophosphorylation) of the aFGF receptor was stimulated (approximately 1.5-fold) by low concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ (optimal concentrations of approximately 0.1, approximately 0.1, and 1 microM, respectively) but inhibited by higher concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and pyrophosphate (greater than or equal to 20, greater than or equal to 50, greater than or equal to 10, and greater than or equal to 100 microM, respectively). However, addition of Mn2+ and pyrophosphate at a ratio of 1:1 not only reversed the inhibitory effect but also enhanced the kinase activity about 3-4-fold. The apparent Km of ATP for intrinsic and ligand-stimulated protein kinase activity of the aFGF receptor was estimated to be 25 microM. The preferred exogenous substrates for the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the aFGF receptor were found to be myelin basic protein and histone. Poly-L-arginine, an inhibitor for aFGF binding to the receptor, appeared to stimulate the mitogenesis or cell growth of responsive cells by mimicking aFGF activity."
https://openalex.org/W1583509003,"The enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a functionally important glycoprotein of neutrophilic granulocytes and occurs in three major isoforms (forms 1, 2, and 3) that are dimeric structures composed of two heavy subunit-light subunit protomers, each of which is associated with a chlorine-like prosthetic group. In the present study, highly purified MPO isoforms were obtained from the cells of a single normal donor, and each protein was subjected to reductive alkylation under nondenaturing conditions. The resulting enzymatically active protomers were separated from unreacted dimer using gel filtration chromatography. Use of a fast protein liquid chromatography cation exchange system with a Mono S matrix revealed heterogeneity of the protomers, and allowed essentially complete resolution of the protomers of MPO form 2. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the two resolved protomeric species under reducing conditions revealed small but reproducible differences in the Mr of their heavy subunits (59,000 and 57,000). Treatment with either endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase or peptide N-glycohydrolase F reduced the Mr of each heavy subunit by approximately 3000 but did not change their relative electrophoretic mobilities. Heavy and light subunits were prepared from each of the MPO isoforms by reductive alkylation under conditions that allowed full retention of the prosthetic group with the heavy subunit. Reverse-phase chromatography and amino-terminal sequencing showed that each MPO isoform contained one major species of light subunit and several minor species. No differences in peroxidatic activity or inhibition by salicylhydroxamic acid were observed among any of the MPO isoforms or resolved protomers, but the latter were considerably more heat labile than dimeric forms of the enzyme and a monomeric form isolated from HL-60 cells. This is the first report of the isolation and partial characterization of distinct protomers from a single isoform of human MPO and suggests that the structure of MPO is more complex than considered previously."
https://openalex.org/W1578809849,"The DNA binding domain of γδ-resolvase, residues 141-183, is thought to bind DNA by a helix-turn-helix motif based on sequence similarities with other known DNA binding proteins. Incorporation of the DNA cleaving moiety, EDTA Fe, at the NH2 and COOH termini of γδ(141-183) allows the positions of these residues relative to the DNA bases at three resolvase binding sites, each consisting of inverted copies of an imperfectly conserved 9-base pair sequence, to be mapped by high resolution gel electrophoresis. The cleavage data for EDTA-γδ(141-183) reveals that the NH2 terminus of the DNA binding domain of gamma delta-resolvase is bound proximal to the minor groove of DNA near the center of the resolvase binding sites. Cleavage by EDTA Fe attached to a lysine side chain (Asn^(183)→Lys^(183)) at the COOH terminus of γδ(141-183) reveals that the putative recognition helix is in the adjacent major groove on the same face of the helix, oriented toward the center of the inverted repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1590562895,"ATP (CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.25) has been purified from wild type cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as from a strain that overproduces the activity. Purification from the wild type strain was accomplished with a multistep protocol including ammonium sulfate fractionation, anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme is near homogeneity as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and at 59,000 Da is smaller than reported previously. A similar molecular mass is obtained by gel filtration demonstrating that the enzyme is active as a monomer. The pH optimum for the enzyme is around 9.5. The apparent KM values for ATP and CTP were determined to be 5.6 x 10(-4) M and 1.8 x 10(-4) M, respectively. Purification of the enzyme from the overproducing cells was accomplished by a three step protocol with high yield. The nucleotidyltransferase activity from the overproducing cells had a KM for CTP indistinguishable from that of the wild type enzyme, and the mobility of the protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels was the same regardless of the source. Thus, the overproducing strain appears to be a good source for large amounts of yeast nucleotidyltransferase for further biochemical and structural studies."

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 706-712). Separation of these activities from each other was attempted by means of gel filtration, hydroxylapatite column chromatography, or immunoaffinity chromatography. Approximately 90% of toxic activity was recovered in each chromatography. Although ADP-ribosylation activity was incompletely separated from neurotoxin D by gel filtration, it was separated by hydroxylapatite column chromatography. In immunoaffinity chromatography with a column of Sepharose 4B coupling antibodies against botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase, no ADP-ribosylation activity was detected by autoradiography in the unabsorbed toxic fraction. These results indicate that neurotoxin D does not have ADP-ribosylation activity."

https://openalex.org/W1497175096,"The Escherichia coli sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase has been successfully expressed in COS cells. The E. coli dgkA locus which contains the coding sequences for DAG kinase was subcloned into an eukaryotic expression vector, pMT2. COS cells transfected with the vector pMT2dgk expressed the DAG kinase as shown by Western analysis. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the E. coli DAG kinase was prominently but not exclusively located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, mixed micellar assays in beta-octyl glucoside revealed that membranes prepared from pMT2dgk-transfected COS cells contained over a 1500-fold increase in DAG kinase activity: 107 nmol/min/mg compared with only 0.067 nmol/min/mg for controls. DAG kinase activity from the E. coli enzyme was distinguished from endogenous COS cell activity based on differences in thermolability and the ability of the E. coli enzyme to use ceramide as a substrate. No ceramide kinase activity was detected in control COS cells, so the activity detected in pMT2dgk transfectants must have resulted from the expressed E. coli DAG kinase. The Km values for DAG kinase derived from E. coli and COS cells were nearly identical. Finally, transfected COS cells were labeled with [32P]Pi to investigate possible perturbations in lipid composition induced by the action of the E. coli DAG kinase. Ceramide (generated by the action of sphingomyelinase) was also used to clearly implicate the E. coli enzyme. Levels of ceramide phosphate increased more than 150-fold in pMT2dgk-transfected cells relative to controls. The results of these studies show that the E. coli enzyme expressed in COS cells is active and perturbs lipid composition in the intact cell system; the absolute lipid cofactor requirement of E. coli DAG kinase can be satisfied in COS cells."
