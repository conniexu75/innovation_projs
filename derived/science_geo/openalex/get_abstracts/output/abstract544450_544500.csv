https://openalex.org/W1927627425,"The recent dramatic rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has triggered intense research worldwide. However, high PCE values have often been reached with poor stability at an illuminated area of typically less than 0.1 square centimeter. We used heavily doped inorganic charge extraction layers in planar PSCs to achieve very rapid carrier extraction, even with 10- to 20-nanometer-thick layers, avoiding pinholes and eliminating local structural defects over large areas. The robust inorganic nature of the layers allowed for the fabrication of PSCs with an aperture area >1 square centimeter that have a PCE >15%, as certified by an accredited photovoltaic calibration laboratory. Hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics was eliminated; the PSCs were stable, with >90% of the initial PCE remaining after 1000 hours of light soaking."

Over the past decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region's Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions. The experience in the Gulf of Maine highlights the need to incorporate environmental factors into resource management."
https://openalex.org/W2201214180,"It is unknown whether the human immune system frequently mounts a T cell response against mutations expressed by common epithelial cancers. Using a next-generation sequencing approach combined with high-throughput immunologic screening, we demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from 9 out of 10 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers contained CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells that recognized one to three neo-epitopes derived from somatic mutations expressed by the patient’s own tumor. There were no immunogenic epitopes shared between these patients. However, we identified in one patient a human leukocyte antigen–C*08:02–restricted T cell receptor from CD8+ TILs that targeted the KRASG12D hotspot driver mutation found in many human cancers. Thus, a high frequency of patients with common gastrointestinal cancers harbor immunogenic mutations that can potentially be exploited for the development of highly personalized immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W1935840347,"The rechargeable aprotic lithium-air (Li-O2) battery is a promising potential technology for next-generation energy storage, but its practical realization still faces many challenges. In contrast to the standard Li-O2 cells, which cycle via the formation of Li2O2, we used a reduced graphene oxide electrode, the additive LiI, and the solvent dimethoxyethane to reversibly form and remove crystalline LiOH with particle sizes larger than 15 micrometers during discharge and charge. This leads to high specific capacities, excellent energy efficiency (93.2%) with a voltage gap of only 0.2 volt, and impressive rechargeability. The cells tolerate high concentrations of water, water being the dominant proton source for the LiOH; together with LiI, it has a decisive impact on the chemical nature of the discharge product and on battery performance."
https://openalex.org/W2618657542,"Transcription factors (TFs) bind specific sequences in promoter-proximal and -distal DNA elements to regulate gene transcription. RNA is transcribed from both of these DNA elements, and some DNA binding TFs bind RNA. Hence, RNA transcribed from regulatory elements may contribute to stable TF occupancy at these sites. We show that the ubiquitously expressed TF Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) binds to both gene regulatory elements and their associated RNA species across the entire genome. Reduced transcription of regulatory elements diminishes YY1 occupancy, whereas artificial tethering of RNA enhances YY1 occupancy at these elements. We propose that RNA makes a modest but important contribution to the maintenance of certain TFs at gene regulatory elements and suggest that transcription of regulatory elements produces a positive-feedback loop that contributes to the stability of gene expression programs."
https://openalex.org/W1911271782,"How dying tumor cells get noticed Besides killing tumor cells directly, some chemotherapies, such as anthracyclines, also activate the immune system to kill tumors. Vacchelli et al. discovered that in mice, anthracycline-induced antitumor immunity requires immune cells to express the protein formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1). Dendritic cells (DCs) near tumors expressed especially high amounts of FPR1. DCs normally capture fragments of dying tumor cells and use them to activate nearby T cells to kill tumors, but DCs lacking FPR1 failed to do this effectively. Individuals with breast or colon cancer expressing a variant of FPR1 and treated with anthracyclines showed poor metastasis-free and overall survival. Thus, FPR1 may affect anti-tumor immunity in people, too. Science , this issue p. 972"
https://openalex.org/W2319030970,"Bedrock fracture systems facilitate weathering, allowing fresh mineral surfaces to interact with corrosive waters and biota from Earth's surface, while simultaneously promoting drainage of chemically equilibrated fluids. We show that topographic perturbations to regional stress fields explain bedrock fracture distributions, as revealed by seismic velocity and electrical resistivity surveys from three landscapes. The base of the fracture-rich zone mirrors surface topography where the ratio of horizontal compressive tectonic stresses to near-surface gravitational stresses is relatively large, and it parallels the surface topography where the ratio is relatively small. Three-dimensional stress calculations predict these results, suggesting that tectonic stresses interact with topography to influence bedrock disaggregation, groundwater flow, chemical weathering, and the depth of the ""critical zone"" in which many biogeochemical processes occur."

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying mechanically evoked itch. Bourane et al. produced a model of mechanical itch by reducing the number of neuropeptide Y–expressing inhibitory spinal interneurons. This led to a selective increase in mechanically evoked itch-like behavior in mice. In contrast, chemically evoked itch or pain behavior remained unaffected. Science , this issue p. 550"

It is possible that some metallicity survives along the boundaries of magnetic domains, the so-called domain walls, but the question is difficult to address directly in experiments. Ma et al. did just that by mapping out the conductance of the material Nd 2 Ir 2 O 7 in its low-temperature magnetic insulating phase, using microwave impedance microscopy. The magnetic domain walls showed up clearly in the images as regions of high conductance. Science , this issue p. 538"
https://openalex.org/W2285543512,"Infections and inflammation can lead to cachexia and wasting of skeletal muscle and fat tissue by as yet poorly understood mechanisms. We observed that gut colonization of mice by a strain of Escherichia coli prevents wasting triggered by infections or physical damage to the intestine. During intestinal infection with the pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium or pneumonic infection with Burkholderia thailandensis, the presence of this E. coli did not alter changes in host metabolism, caloric uptake, or inflammation but instead sustained signaling of the insulin-like growth factor 1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway in skeletal muscle, which is required for prevention of muscle wasting. This effect was dependent on engagement of the NLRC4 inflammasome. Therefore, this commensal promotes tolerance to diverse diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1904163981,"Small wireless trunk accelerometers have become a popular approach to unobtrusively quantify human locomotion and provide insights into both gait rehabilitation and sports performance. However, limited evidence exists as to which trunk accelerometry measures are suitable for the purpose of detecting movement compensations while running, and specifically in response to fatigue. The aim of this study was therefore to detect deviations in the dynamic center of mass (CoM) motion due to running-induced fatigue using tri-axial trunk accelerometry. Twenty runners aged 18-25 years completed an indoor treadmill running protocol to volitional exhaustion at speeds equivalent to their 3.2 km time trial performance. The following dependent measures were extracted from tri-axial trunk accelerations of 20 running steps before and after the treadmill fatigue protocol: the tri-axial ratio of acceleration root mean square (RMS) to the resultant vector RMS, step and stride regularity (autocorrelation procedure), and sample entropy. Running-induced fatigue increased mediolateral and anteroposterior ratios of acceleration RMS (p < .05), decreased the anteroposterior step regularity (p < .05), and increased the anteroposterior sample entropy (p < .05) of trunk accelerometry patterns. Our findings indicate that treadmill running-induced fatigue might reveal itself in a greater contribution of variability in horizontal plane trunk accelerations, with anteroposterior trunk accelerations that are less regular from step-to-step and are less predictable. It appears that trunk accelerometry parameters can be used to detect deviations in dynamic CoM motion induced by treadmill running fatigue, yet it is unknown how robust or generalizable these parameters are to outdoor running environments."

These two lineages are thought to have diverged rather cleanly, sharing few similarities after the emergence of crown hominoids. Alba et al. describe a new ape from the Miocene era that contains characteristics from both hominoids and small-bodied apes (see the Perspective by Benefit and McCrossin). Thus, early small-bodied apes may have contributed more to the evolution of the hominoid lineage than previously assumed. Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.aab2625 ; see also p. 515"
https://openalex.org/W1917289718,"Although alterations of topological organization have previously been reported in the brain functional network of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, the topological properties of the brain network in early-stage PD patients who received antiparkinson treatment are largely unknown. This study sought to determine the topological characteristics of the large-scale functional network in early-stage PD patients. First, 26early-stage PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stage:1-2) and 30 age-matched normal controls were scanned using resting-state functional MRI. Subsequently, graph theoretical analysis was employed to investigate the abnormal topological configuration of the brain network in early-stage PD patients. We found that both the PD patient and control groups showed small-world properties in their functional brain networks. However, compared with the controls, the early-stage PD patients exhibited abnormal global properties, characterized by lower global efficiency. Moreover, the modular structure and the hub distribution were markedly altered in early-stage PD patients. Furthermore, PD patients exhibited increased nodal centrality, primarily in the bilateral pallidum, the inferior parietal lobule, and the medial superior frontal gyrus, and decreased nodal centrality in the caudate nucleus, the supplementary motor areas, the precentral gyrus, and the middle frontal gyrus. There were significant negative correlations between the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor scores and nodal centralities of superior parietal gyrus. These results suggest that the topological organization of the brain functional network was altered in early-stage PD patients who received antiparkinson treatment, and we speculated that the antiparkinson treatment may affect the efficiency of the brain network to effectively relieve clinical symptoms of PD."

Using untargeted metabolomic screens, we show that Abcc5−/− mice accumulate endogenous glutamate conjugates in several tissues, but brain in particular. The abundant neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate was 2.4-fold higher in Abcc5−/− brain. The metabolites that accumulated in Abcc5−/− tissues were depleted in cultured cells that overexpressed human ABCC5.

https://openalex.org/W2146948565,"Neuronal electrical impulse propagation is facilitated by the myelin sheath, a compact membrane surrounding the axon. The myelin sheath is highly enriched in galactosylceramide (GalCer) and its sulfated derivative sulfatide. Over 50% of GalCer and sulfatide in myelin is hydroxylated by the integral membrane enzyme fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H). GalCer hydroxylation contributes to the compact nature of the myelin membrane, and mutations in FA2H result in debilitating leukodystrophies and spastic paraparesis. We report here the 2.6 A crystal structure of sphingolipid α-hydroxylase (Scs7p), a yeast homolog of FA2H. The Scs7p core is composed of a helical catalytic cap domain that sits atop four transmembrane helices that anchor the enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum. The structure contains two zinc atoms coordinated by the side chains of 10 highly conserved histidines within a dimetal center located near the plane of the cytosolic membrane. We used a yeast genetic approach to confirm the important role of the dimetal-binding histidines in catalysis and identified Tyr-322 and Asp-323 as critical determinants involved in the hydroxylase reaction. Examination of the Scs7p structure, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, allowed for the generation of a model of ceramide binding to Scs7p. Comparison of the Scs7p structure and substrate-binding model to the structure of steroyl-CoA desaturase revealed significant differences in the architecture of the catalytic cap domain and location of the dimetal centers with respect to the membrane. These observations provide insight into the different mechanisms of substrate binding and recognition of substrates by the hydroxylase and desaturase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1838136827,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor protein tyrosine that is overexpressed in many types of tumors and plays a pivotal role in multiple cell signaling pathways involved in cell survival, migration, and proliferation. This study attempts to determine the effect of synthesized antroquinonol on the modulation of FAK signaling pathways and explore their underlying mechanisms. Antroquinonol significantly inhibits cell viability with an MTT assay in both N18 neuroblastoma and C6 glioma cell lines, which exhibits sub G1 phase cell cycle, and further induction of apoptosis is confirmed by a TUNEL assay. Antroquinonol decreases anti-apoptotic proteins, whereas it increases p53 and pro-apoptotic proteins. Alterations of cell morphology are observed after treatment by atomic force microscopy. Molecular docking results reveal that antroquinonol has an H-bond with the Arg 86 residue of FAK. The protein levels of Src, pSrc, FAK, pFAK, Rac1, and cdc42 are decreased after antroquinonol treatment. Additionally, antroquinonol also regulates the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins. Furthermore, antroquinonol suppresses the C6 glioma growth in xenograft studies. Together, these results suggest that antroquinonol is a potential anti-tumorigenesis and anti-metastasis inhibitor of FAK."
https://openalex.org/W1907384058,"The long-term use of indwelling catheters results in a high risk from urinary tract infections (UTI) and blockage. Blockages often occur from crystalline deposits, formed as the pH rises due to the action of urease-producing bacteria; the most commonly found species being Proteus mirabilis. These crystalline biofilms have been found to develop on all catheter materials with P. mirabilis attaching to all surfaces and forming encrustations. Previous studies have mainly relied on electron microscopy to describe this process but there remains a lack of understanding into the stages of biofilm formation. Using an advanced light microscopy technique, episcopic differential interference contrast (EDIC) microscopy combined with epifluorescence (EF), we describe a non-destructive, non-contact, real-time imaging method used to track all stages of biofilm development from initial single cell attachment to complex crystalline biofilm formation. Using a simple six-well plate system, attachment of P. mirabilis (in artificial urine) to sections of silicone and hydrogel latex catheters was tracked over time (up to 24 days). Using EDIC and EF we show how initial attachment occurred in less than 1 h following exposure to P. mirabilis. This was rapidly followed by an accumulation of an additional material (indicated to be carbohydrate based using lectin staining) and the presence of highly elongated, motile cells. After 24 h exposure, a layer developed above this conditioning film and within 4 days the entire surface (of both catheter materials) was covered with diffuse crystalline deposits with defined crystals embedded. Using three-dimensional image reconstruction software, cells of P. mirabilis were seen covering the crystal surfaces. EDIC microscopy could resolve these four components of the complex crystalline biofilm and the close relationship between P. mirabilis and the crystals. This real-time imaging technique permits study of this complex biofilm development with no risk of artefacts due to sample manipulation. A full understanding of the stages and components involved in crystalline encrustation formation will aid in the development of new protocols to manage and ultimately prevent catheter blockage."

https://openalex.org/W2110530019,"The liver hormone hepcidin is the central regulator of systemic iron metabolism. Its increased expression in inflammatory states leads to hypoferremia and anemia. Elucidation of the mechanisms that up-regulate hepcidin during inflammation is essential for developing rational therapies for this anemia. Using mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease, we have shown previously that colitis-associated hepcidin induction is influenced by intestinal microbiota composition. Here we investigate how two commensal bacteria, Bifidobacterium longum and Bacteroides fragilis, representative members of the gut microbiota, affect hepcidin expression. We found that supernatants of a human macrophage cell line infected with either of the bacteria up-regulated hepcidin when added to a human hepatocyte cell line. This activity was abrogated by neutralization of IL-1β. Moreover, purified IL-1β increased hepcidin expression when added to the hepatocyte line or primary human hepatocytes and when injected into mice. IL-1β activated the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in hepatocytes and in mouse liver, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of small mothers against decapentaplegic proteins. Activation of BMP signaling correlated with IL-1β-induced expression of BMP2 in human hepatocytes and activin B in mouse liver.

Hepcidin is a 25-amino acid peptide hormone that is secreted by the liver and functions as the key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis (1.Ganz T. Systemic iron homeostasis.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1721-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Its expression in hepatocytes is regulated exclusively at the level of transcription and is sensitive to a number of inputs, including tissue and plasma iron concentrations. Although the exact mechanism by which tissue iron concentrations are detected is not clear, it is known that elevated hepatic iron concentrations lead to increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) (2.Kautz L.

The complex of SMAD4 and the phosphorylated receptor-associated SMAD translocates to the nucleus, binds to specific sites in the hepcidin promoter, and increases transcription (3.Parrow N.L.

Hemojuvelin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in iron homeostasis.Front. Pharmacol. 2014; 5: 104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Circulating iron levels are sensed by a mechanism involving interactions between the type II transferrin receptor and the hemochromatosis protein HFE, both of which are expressed on the hepatocyte plasma membrane (5.Worthen C.A. Enns C.A. The role of hepatic transferrin receptor 2 in the regulation of iron homeostasis in the body.Front. Pharmacol. 2014; 5: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Elevated plasma iron induces the two proteins to associate, leading to increased activation of the BMP signaling pathway and up-regulation of hepcidin transcription. Hepcidin binds to and induces the degradation of the iron transport protein ferroportin (FPN), which is expressed on the plasma membrane of macrophages and the basolateral surface of duodenal enterocytes and is the sole means by which iron recycled from erythrocytes and absorbed from the diet, respectively, enters the circulation (6.Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J.

Ferroportin-mediated iron transport: expression and regulation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1426-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of the increased expression of hepcidin induced by elevated tissue and plasma iron concentrations is to down-regulate FPN, thereby reducing the amount of iron released into the blood and restoring homeostasis. Conversely, when tissue and plasma iron levels are low, hepcidin expression is decreased, allowing more iron to enter the circulation as a result of increased FPN expression. The hepcidin-FPN axis is therefore a critical component of a negative feedback loop that maintains iron concentrations within a narrow physiologic range (1.Ganz T. Systemic iron homeostasis.Physiol.

The abnormally elevated hepcidin levels lead to a drop in plasma iron concentrations because of FPN down-regulation. When this situation persists, it compromises erythropoiesis, resulting in the development of the so-called anemia of inflammation (AI) (9.Nemeth E. Ganz T. Anemia of inflammation.Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 2014; 28 (vi): 671-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Because AI can negatively affect quality of life and may require specific treatment beyond management of the underlying inflammatory process, there is a great deal of interest in understanding the factors and mechanisms involved in inflammation-associated up-regulation of hepcidin. In relatively simple experimental models of inflammation, such as those involving the injection of LPS or turpentine, the cytokine IL-6 has been shown to play an important role in hepcidin up-regulation because of its ability to activate signals that phosphorylate STAT3, which then dimerizes and binds to the hepcidin promoter to increase transcription (10.Nemeth E.

Our studies have tried to shed light on this issue by characterizing hepcidin expression in mouse models of IBD (14.Wang L. Trebicka E. Fu Y. Ellenbogen S. Hong C.C. Babitt J.L. Lin H.Y.

We have shown recently that dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in wild-type mice was associated with decreased expression of hepcidin, whereas dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in IL-10-deficient mice resulted in hepcidin up-regulation. Strikingly, however, when the IL-10-deficient animals were co-caged with wild-type mice for 2 weeks prior to the induction of colitis or were given a wild-type fecal transplant, hepcidin up-regulation was inhibited (16.Shanmugam N.K. Trebicka E. Fu L.L. Shi H.N. Cherayil B.J. Intestinal inflammation modulates expression of the iron-regulating hormone hepcidin depending on erythropoietic activity and the commensal microbiota.J. Immunol. 2014; 193: 1398-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results indicate that differences in the commensal bacterial communities that constitute the gut microbiota have a strong influence on inflammation-induced expression of hepcidin. This effect could not be explained by differences in colonic levels of inflammatory cytokines known to alter hepcidin expression, such as IL-6 and TNFα (15.Shanmugam N.K. Ellenbogen S. Trebicka E. Wang L. Mukhopadhyay S. Lacy-Hulbert A. Gallini C.A. Garrett W.S. Cherayil B.J.

Immunol. 2014; 193: 1398-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because there is little or no information on how commensal bacteria might directly or indirectly affect hepcidin expression, we carried out experiments to clarify this issue. The human monocyte cell line THP-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Prior to infection, the cells were seeded in tissue culture plates at a density of 106 cells/ml and differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 50 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 72 h. The differentiated cells were washed twice with PBS and placed in serum- and antibiotic-free medium prior to infection. B. longum and B. fragilis (provided by Dr. Deepak Vijaykumar, Massachusetts General Hospital) were grown anaerobically at 37 °C for 20–22 h in broth cultures of dMan Rogosa Sharpe medium and reinforced clostridial medium, respectively. The dehydrated media were obtained from BD Biosciences and prepared according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. On the basis of the optical density and the results of preliminary titering experiments, appropriate volumes of the B. longum and B. fragilis cultures were centrifuged, and the bacterial pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in antibiotic- and serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Fifty million bacteria were added to the differentiated THP-1 cells (multiplicity of infection, 50:1). The infection was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C, after which the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for a further 4 h at 37 °C in antibiotic- and serum-free medium. The cell supernatants were collected at the end of the 4 h, filter-sterilized by passage through a 0.2-μm filter, and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. The human hepatoma cell line HuH7 (provided by Dr. Raymond Chung, Massachusetts General Hospital) was maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Prior to stimulation, the cells were seeded at 106 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated overnight in serum-free medium. In preliminary experiments, the serum-starved cells were stimulated directly with live bacteria in the same way as the THP-1 cells or for 4 h with purified Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (5 μg/ml Pam3Cys, 1 μg/ml LPS, and 1 μg/ml flagellin, all from Invivogen, San Diego, CA). In subsequent studies, the serum-starved cells were stimulated for the indicated times in individual experiments with 0.5 ml of supernatant from control or infected THP-1 cells or with 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). In some experiments, the cells were also treated with the BMP signaling inhibitors (17.Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T.

Following stimulation under the different conditions, cell supernatants were collected for analysis by ELISA, and the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) for preparation of RNA or with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with mixtures of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (19.Shanmugam N.K.

The hepatocytes were prepared by the Core from healthy whole livers donated for research purposes using a two-step collagenase perfusion procedure (20.Dunn J.C. Tompkins R.G. Yarmush M.L. Long-term in vitro function of adult hepatocytes in a collagen sandwich configuration.Biotechnol. Prog. 1991; 7: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Purity of the isolated hepatocytes was >99%, as assessed by morphology, with 80–90% viability, as measured by trypan blue exclusion. The hepatocytes were cultured overnight in serum-free medium and stimulated as described above for the HuH7 cells, and then TRIzol extracts were prepared. In some experiments, the cells were treated with anti-BMP2/BMP4 or control antibodies as described above. Six-week-old, female, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the vivarium at Massachusetts General Hospital. Groups of animals were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 250 ng of recombinant murine IL-1β (R&D Systems) diluted in PBS or, as a control, with just PBS and then euthanized at the indicated times in the specific experiment. At necropsy, blood was collected in serum separator tubes, and the serum was used for estimation of iron concentrations as described below. Samples of liver were also collected and homogenized in TRIzol reagent or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for preparation of RNA and protein extracts, respectively. All studies with mice were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Total RNA was prepared from TRIzol extracts according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. It was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers and amplified with gene-specific primers as described in detail previously (21.Wang L. Harrington L. Trebicka E. Shi H.N. Kagan J.C. Hong C.C. Lin H.Y.

The primers used for amplification of human BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and activin B were as follows: BMP2 forward, 5′-ACCCGCTGTCTTCTAGCGT-3′; BMP2 reverse, 5′-TTTCAGGCCGAACATGCTGAG-3′; BMP4 forward, 5′-TGGTCTTGAGTATCCTGAGCG-3′; BMP4 reverse, 5′-GCTGAGGTTAAAGAGGAAACGA-3′; BMP6 forward, 5′-AGCGACACCACAAAGAGTTCA-3′; BMP6 reverse, 5′-GCTGATGCTCCTGTAAGACTTGA-3′; activin B forward, 5′-CGGGTCCGCCTATACTTCTTC-3′; and activin B reverse, 5′-CGTAGGGCAGGAGTTTCAGG-3′. IL-1β and IL-6 concentrations in cell supernatants were measured using kits from eBioscience (San Diego, CA) and Biolegend (San Diego, CA), respectively, and BMP2 was measured in cell lysates and supernatants using the Quantikine ELISA kit from R&D Systems. Protocols provided by the manufacturers were followed in all cases. Cell lysates used for BMP2 estimation were prepared with 0.1% Triton X-100-containing buffer. Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE after normalizing protein concentrations and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semidry blotting as described in detail previously (15.Shanmugam N.K.

The membrane was blocked and then incubated overnight with antibodies specific for either phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 or total SMAD1 (both from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The blot was developed with the relevant fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies, and the signals were analyzed using an Odyssey infrared fluorescence imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The signal intensities of the phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 bands from each blot were normalized to the intensities of the corresponding total SMAD1 bands by calculating the pSMAD/SMAD1 ratio. The means of the normalized intensities ± S.E. from the blots of multiple experiments are displayed, along with a representative blot from one of the experiments. Serum iron concentrations were measured as described previously (23.Babitt J.L. Huang F.W. Xia Y. Sidis Y. Andrews N.C. Lin H.Y. Modulation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in vivo regulates systemic iron balance.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1933-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) using a colorimetric assay kit from Thermo Scientific (Tewksbury, MA). Macrophage infections and hepatocyte stimulations were carried out in triplicate in each experiment, and each experiment was performed at least twice. Mouse studies involved 3–5 animals/group. The results are displayed as the means ± S.E. on the basis of replicates from a single experiment or pooled from multiple experiments as indicated in the figures. Two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test was used to assess significance, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Statistically significant differences are indicated with asterisks in the figures, whereas the p values and sample numbers (n) are specified in the figure legends. On the basis of our recent results indicating a clear effect of gut microbiota composition on colitis-associated hepcidin up-regulation (16.Shanmugam N.K. Trebicka E. Fu L.L. Shi H.N. Cherayil B.J. Intestinal inflammation modulates expression of the iron-regulating hormone hepcidin depending on erythropoietic activity and the commensal microbiota.J. Immunol. 2014; 193: 1398-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we initiated a series of experiments to examine the effects of commensal bacteria on hepcidin expression. Our studies were predicated on the idea that, during colitis, commensal bacteria or their products are translocated across the damaged intestinal epithelium and act on hepatocytes, either directly or indirectly, to induce hepcidin expression. In initial experiments, we exposed the HuH7 hepatocyte cell line to representative live commensal bacteria, the Gram-positive B. longum or the Gram-negative B. fragilis, significant components of the human infant and adult intestinal microbiota, respectively (24.Lozupone C.A. Stombaugh J.I. Gordon J.I. Jansson J.K. Knight R. Diversity, stability and resilience of the human gut microbiota.Nature. 2012; 489: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). This direct interaction between the hepatocytes and the bacteria did not alter hepcidin expression (Fig. 1A). There was also no change in hepcidin expression when HuH7 cells were treated with bacterial ligands for TLR2 (Pam3Cys), TLR4 (LPS), or TLR5 (flagellin) (Fig. 1B). We then considered the possibility that translocated bacteria or bacterial products might be sensed initially by cells of the innate immune system residing in the colonic lamina propria or liver, which would then secrete molecules that could act on hepatocytes to alter hepcidin expression. Accordingly, we differentiated the THP-1 human monocyte cell line into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and then infected the cells with either B. longum or B. fragilis. Cell- and bacteria-free supernatants of the control and infected THP-1 macrophages were then added to HuH7 hepatocytes for 4 h, and the effect on hepcidin expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1C, supernatants of both B. longum- and B. fragilis-infected THP-1 cells induced significant increases in hepcidin expression in HuH7 cells relative to the supernatant of uninfected THP-1 cells. We examined the supernatants of the infected THP-1 cells for the presence of cytokines that might influence hepcidin expression and found that infection with both B. longum and B. fragilis induced the production of significant amounts of IL-1β (Fig. 2A). IL-6, the cytokine that has been associated most often with hepcidin up-regulation (10.Nemeth E. Rivera S. Gabayan V. Keller C. Taudorf S. Pedersen B.K. Ganz T.

Importantly, we found that treating the supernatant of B. longum-infected THP-1 cells with 5 μg/ml of a monoclonal anti-IL-1β-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited its ability to up-regulate hepcidin in HuH7 cells, whereas an equivalent amount of an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody did not have this effect (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained when neutralizing IL-1β in the supernatant of B. fragilis-infected THP-1 cells (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that B. longum- or B. fragilis-induced IL-1β secreted by THP-1 cells is required for up-regulation of hepcidin in HuH7 cells (even in the presence of IL-6 in the case of B. fragilis). We proceeded to carry out experiments to clarify the mechanisms involved in the IL-1β-induced up-regulation of hepcidin. We were particularly interested in the potential involvement of the BMP signaling pathway because our previous experiments have shown that inhibition of this pathway prevented hepcidin up-regulation in the context of both infectious and non-infectious intestinal inflammation in vivo, including in multiple mouse models of IBD (14.Wang L.

https://openalex.org/W2248044406,"European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is currently battling an onslaught of ash dieback, a disease emerging in the greater part of its native area, brought about by the introduction of the ascomycete Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (= Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus). The closely-related fungus Hymenoscyphus albidus, which is indigenous to Europe, is non-pathogenic when in contact with F. excelsior, but could pose a potential risk to exotic Fraxinus species. The North American green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) is planted widely throughout Europe and regenerates naturally within this environment but little is known about the susceptibility of this species to ash dieback. We performed wound inoculations with both fungi (nine strains of H. fraxineus and three strains of H. albidus) on rachises and stems of F. excelsior and F. pennsylvanica under field conditions in Southern Poland. Necrosis formation was evaluated after two months on the rachises and after 12 months on the stems. After inoculation of H. albidus, only small lesions (of up to 1.3 cm in length) developed on the F. excelsior and F. pennsylvanica rachises, but with no significant distinction from the controls. Hymenoscyphus albidus did not cause necrotic lesions on the stems of either Fraxinus species. In contrast, H. fraxineus induced necroses on all inoculated rachises of both ash species with mean lengths of 8.4 cm (F. excelsior) and 1.9 cm (F. pennsylvanica). Necroses also developed on all of the inoculated F. excelsior stems (mean length 18.0 cm), whereas on F. pennsylvanica such lesions only occurred on about 5% of the stems (mean length 1.9 cm). The differences between strains were negligible. No necroses were observed on the control plants. Reisolations of H. albidus were only successful in around 8–11% of the cases, while H. fraxineus was reisolated from 50–70% of the inoculated organs showing necrotic lesions. None of the Hymenoscyphus species were isolated from the control plants. Our data confirm H. fraxineus’ high virulence with regards to F. excelsior and demonstrate a low virulence in relation to F. pennsylvanica under field conditions in Poland. Hymenoscyphus albidus did not express any perceivable pathogenicity on both host species."

Cox multivariate regression analysis was conducted for the parameters found.The study sample consisted of 132 men and 86 women with a mean age at disease onset of 57.2±12.3 years; 77.6% of them were Caucasian. The mean periods between disease onset and diagnosis were 22.7 months among men and 23.5 months among women, and the mean survival periods were 45.7±47.0 months among men and 39.3±29.8 months among women. In addition, 80.3% patients presented non-bulbar-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 19.7% presented bulbar-onset. Cox regression analysis indicated worse prognosis for body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2 (relative risk [RR]: 3.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-8.86), age >75 years (RR: 12.47, 95% CI: 3.51-44.26), and bulbar-onset (RR: 4.56, 95% CI: 2.06-10.12). Electromyography did not confirm the diagnosis in 55.6% of the suspected cases and in 27.9% of the bulbar-onset cases.The factors associated with lower survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were age >75 years, BMI <25 kg/m2, and bulbar-onset."
https://openalex.org/W1896451502,"Very limited research has been undertaken on sex workers' personal romantic relationships and the impact the nature of their work has on their relationships. This exploratory study aimed to explore the impact sex work has on women's personal romantic relationships and the use of mental separation as a coping mechanism to balance the two aspects of their lives.Fifty-five women working in the indoor sex industry in Melbourne, Australia, were recruited to complete a self-report questionnaire about various aspects of their work, including the impact of sex work on their personal relationships. Questionnaires were completed anonymously and included both closed and open-ended questions. A further six women were interviewed to 'member check' the accuracy of the questionnaire findings.Most women (78%) reported that, overall, sex work affected their personal romantic relationships in predominantly negative ways, mainly relating to issues stemming from lying, trust, guilt and jealousy. A small number of women reported positive impacts from sex work including improved sexual self-esteem and confidence. Just under half of women were in a relationship at the time of the study and, of these, 51% reported their partner was aware of the nature of their work. Seventy-seven percent of single women chose to remain single due to the nature of their work. Many women used mental separation as a coping mechanism to manage the tensions between sex work and their personal relationships. Member checking validated the accuracy of the questionnaire data.This exploratory study identified a number of ways in which sex work impacts negatively on women's personal romantic relationships. The findings of this study support the need for further studies to be undertaken to determine if the findings are reflected in a larger, more representative sample of Australian sex workers and should be considered in the context of any future intervention and support programs aimed at addressing the tensions sex workers experience between their work and personal relationships. Greater public awareness and education programs aimed at addressing the negative stigma associated with the sex industry may go some way towards easing the issues faced by women in their personal relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1903205518,"Hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) is known to be associated with deep vein thrombosis and venous thromboembolism. We attempted to get a better comprehension of its mechanism by going to high altitude, thereby including the potential contributing role of physical activity. Two groups of 15 healthy individuals were exposed to hypoxia by going to an altitude of 3900 meters, either by climbing actively (active group) or transported passively by cable car (passive group). Both groups were tested for plasma fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels, fibrinolysis, thrombin generating capacity, heart rate, oxygen saturation levels and blood pressure. As a control for the passive group, 7 healthy volunteers stayed immobile in bed for 7 days at normoxic conditions. The heart rate increased and oxygen saturation levels decreased with increasing altitude. Fibrinolysis and fibrinogen levels were not affected. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor levels levels increased significantly in the active group, but not in the passive group. Plasma thrombin generation remained unchanged in both the active and passive group with increasing altitude and during 7 days of immobility in healthy subjects. However, by applying whole blood thrombin generation, we found an increased peak height and endogenous thrombin potential, and a decreased lagtime and time-to-peak with increasing levels of hypoxia in both groups. In conclusion, by applying whole blood thrombin generation we demonstrated that hypoxia causes a prothrombotic state. As thrombin generation in plasma did not increase, our results suggest that the cellular part of the blood is involved in the prothrombotic phenotype induced by hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1955712031,"Frataxin plays a key role in eukaryotic cellular iron metabolism, particularly in mitochondrial heme and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis. However, its precise role has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we studied the subcellular localization of Arabidopsis frataxin, AtFH, using confocal microscopy, and found a novel dual localization for this protein. We demonstrate that plant frataxin is targeted to both the mitochondria and the chloroplast, where it may play a role in Fe-S cluster metabolism as suggested by functional studies on nitrite reductase (NIR) and ferredoxin (Fd), two Fe-S containing chloroplast proteins, in AtFH deficient plants. Our results indicate that frataxin deficiency alters the normal functioning of chloroplasts by affecting the levels of Fe, chlorophyll, and the photosynthetic electron transport chain in this organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2208308247,"Hybridization between distinct populations or species is increasingly recognized as an important process for generating biodiversity. However, the interaction between hybridization and speciation is complex, and the diverse evolutionary outcomes of hybridization are difficult to differentiate. Here we characterize potential hybridization in a species group of swallowtail butterflies using microsatellites, DNA sequences, and morphology, and assess whether adaptive introgression or homoploid hybrid speciation was the primary process leading to each putative hybrid lineage. Four geographically separated hybrid populations were identified in the Papilio machaon species group. One distinct mitochondrial DNA clade from P. machaon was fixed in three hybrid taxa (P. brevicauda, P. joanae, and P. m. kahli), while one hybrid swarm (P. zelicaon x machaon) exhibited this hybrid mtDNA clade as well as widespread parental mtDNA haplotypes from both parental species. Microsatellite markers and morphology showed variable admixture and intermediacy, ranging from signatures of prolonged differential introgression from the paternal species (P. polyxenes/P. zelicaon) to current gene flow with both parental species. Divergences of the hybrid lineages dated to early- to mid-Pleistocene, suggesting that repeated glaciations and subsequent range shifts of parental species, particularly P. machaon hudsonianus, facilitated initial hybridization. Although each lineage is distinct, P. joanae is the only taxon with sufficient evidence (ecological separation from parental species) to define it as a homoploid hybrid species. The repetition of hybridization in this group provides a valuable foundation for future research on hybridization, and these results emphasize the potential for hybridization to drive speciation in diverse ways."

Subsequently, PET imaging was performed with an aryloxyanilide-based TSPO ligand, [18F]PBR06, in primary orthotopic xenograft models of WHO grade III and IV gliomas. Selective uptake of [18F]PBR06 in engrafted tumor was measured. Furthermore, PET imaging with [18F]PBR06 demonstrated infiltrative glioma growth that was undetectable by traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Preliminary PET with [18F]PBR06 demonstrated a preferential tumor-to-normal background ratio in comparison to 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG). These results suggest that TSPO PET imaging with such high-affinity radiotracers may represent a novel strategy to characterize distinct molecular features of glioma growth, as well as better define the extent of glioma infiltration for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2231317968,"Coumarin and its derivatives are fragrant natural compounds isolated from the genus Murraya that are flowering plants widely distributed in East Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Murraya plants have been widely used as medicinal herbs for relief of pain, such as headache, rheumatic pain, toothache, and snake bites. However, little is known about their analgesic components and the molecular mechanism underlying pain relief. Here, we report the bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of a novel coumarin derivative, named muralatin L, that can specifically activate the nociceptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel and reverse the inflammatory pain in mice through channel desensitization. Muralatin L was identified from the active extract of Murraya alata against TRPV1 transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells in fluorescent calcium FlexStation assay. Activation of TRPV1 current by muralatin L and its selectivity were further confirmed by whole-cell patch clamp recordings of TRPV1-expressing HEK-293T cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons isolated from mice. Furthermore, muralatin L could reverse inflammatory pain induced by formalin and acetic acid in mice but not in TRPV1 knock-out mice. Taken together, our findings show that muralatin L specifically activates TRPV1 and reverses inflammatory pain, thus highlighting the potential of coumarin derivatives from Murraya plants for pharmaceutical and medicinal applications such as pain therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1902949209,"Pak choi is a seed vernalization-type plant whose vernalization mechanism is currently unclear. Therefore, it is critical to discover genes related to vernalization and research its functions during vernalization in pak choi. Here, the gene expression profiles in the shoot apex were analyzed after low temperature treatment using high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. The results showed that there are 1,664 and 1,192 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pak choi in cold treatment ending and before flower bud differentiation, respectively, including 42 genes that exhibited similar expression trend at both stages. Detailed annotation revealed that the proteins encoded by the DEGs are located in the extracellular region, cell junction and extracellular matrix. These proteins exhibit activity such as antioxidant activity and binding protein/transcription factor activity, and they are involved in signal transduction and the immune system/biological processes. Among the DEGs, Bra014527 was up-regulated in low temperature treatment ending, Bra024097 was up-regulated before flower bud differentiation and Bra035940 was down-regulated at both stages in low temperature-treated shoot apices. Homologues of these genes in A. thaliana, AT3G59790, AT4G30200 and AT5G61150, are involved in flowering and vernalization, suggesting that they take part in the vernalization process in pak choi. Further pathway enrichment analysis revealed that most genes were enriched in the tryptophan metabolism and glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways. However, the functions of tryptophan and glucosinolate in vernalization are not yet clear and require further analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1962631341,"Functional selectivity (or biased agonism) is a property exhibited by some G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands, which results in the modulation of a subset of a receptor's signaling capabilities and more precise control over complex biological processes. The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) exhibits pleiotropic responses to the biogenic amine dopamine (DA) to mediate complex central nervous system functions through activation of G proteins and β-arrestins. D2R is a prominent therapeutic target for psychological and neurological disorders in which DA biology is dysregulated and targeting D2R with functionally selective drugs could provide a means by which pharmacotherapies could be developed. However, factors that determine GPCR functional selectivity in vivo may be multiple with receptors, ligands and transducers contributing to the process. We have recently described a mutagenesis approach to engineer biased D2R mutants in which G protein-dependent ([Gprot]D2R) and β-arrestin-dependent signaling ([βarr]D2R) were successfully separated (Peterson, et al. PNAS, 2015). Here, permutations of these mutants were used to identify critical determinants of the D2R signaling complex that impart signaling bias in response to the natural or synthetic ligands. Critical residues identified in generating [Gprot]D2R and [βarr]D2R conferred control of partial agonism at G protein and/or β-arrestin activity. Another set of mutations that result in G protein bias was identified that demonstrated that full agonists can impart unique activation patterns, and provided further credence to the concept of ligand texture. Finally, the contributions and interplay between different transducers indicated that G proteins are not aberrantly activated, and that receptor kinase and β-arrestin activities are inextricably linked. These data provide a thorough elucidation of the feasibility and malleability of D2R functional selectivity and point to means by which novel in vivo therapies could be modeled."

The ATPase Vps4 remodels and disassembles ESCRT-III, but the manner in which Vps4 activity is coordinated with ESCRT-III function remains unclear. Ist1 is structurally homologous to ESCRT-III subunits and has been reported to inhibit Vps4 function despite the presence of a microtubule-interacting and trafficking domain-interacting motif (MIM) capable of stimulating Vps4 in the context of other ESCRT-III subunits. Here we report that Ist1 inhibition of Vps4 ATPase activity involves two elements in Ist1: the MIM itself and a surface containing a conserved ELYC sequence. In contrast, the MIM interaction, in concert with a more open conformation of the Ist1 core, resulted in stimulation of Vps4. Addition of the ESCRT-III subunit binding partner of Ist1, Did2, also converted Ist1 from an inhibitor to a stimulator of Vps4 ATPase activity. Finally, distinct regulation of Vps4 by Ist1 corresponded with altered ESCRT-III disassembly in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2261150353,"Some studies, so far limited in number, suggest the existence of procedural metacognition in young children, that is, the practical capacity to monitor and control one’s own cognitive activity in a given task. The link between procedural metacognition and false belief understanding is currently under theoretical discussion. If data with primates seem to indicate that procedural metacognition and false belief understanding are not related, no study in developmental psychology has investigated this relation in young children. The present paper aims, first, to supplement the findings concerning young children’s abilities to monitor and control their uncertainty (procedural metacognition) and, second, to explore the relation between procedural metacognition and false belief understanding. To examine this, 82 3- to 5-year-old children were presented with an opt-out task and with 3 false belief tasks. Results show that children can rely on procedural metacognition to evaluate their perceptual access to information, and that success in false belief tasks does not seem related to success in the task we used to evaluate procedural metacognition. These results are coherent with a procedural view of metacognition, and are discussed in the light of recent data from primatology and developmental psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2255932752,"Calmodulin (CaM), a Ca(2+)-sensing protein, is constitutively bound to IQ domains of the C termini of human Kv7 (hKv7, KCNQ) channels to mediate Ca(2+)-dependent reduction of Kv7 currents. However, the mechanism remains unclear. We report that CaM binds to two isoforms of the hKv7.4 channel in a Ca(2+)-independent manner but that only the long isoform (hKv7.4a) is regulated by Ca(2+)/CaM. Ca(2+)/CaM mediate reduction of the hKv7.4a channel by decreasing the channel open probability and altering activation kinetics. We took advantage of a known missense mutation (G321S) that has been linked to progressive hearing loss to further examine the inhibitory effects of Ca(2+)/CaM on the Kv7.4 channel. Using multidisciplinary techniques, we demonstrate that the G321S mutation may destabilize CaM binding, leading to a decrease in the inhibitory effects of Ca(2+) on the channels. Our study utilizes an expression system to dissect the biophysical properties of the WT and mutant Kv7.4 channels. This report provides mechanistic insights into the critical roles of Ca(2+)/CaM regulation of the Kv7.4 channel under physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2208435516,"DNA methylation reprogramming occurs during mammalian gametogenesis and embryogenesis. Sex-specific DNA methylation patterns at specific CpG islands controlling imprinted genes are acquired during this window of development. Characterization of the DNA methylation dynamics of imprinted genes acquired by oocytes during folliculogenesis is essential for understanding the physiological and genetic aspects of female gametogenesis and to determine the parameters for oocyte competence. This knowledge can be used to improve in vitro embryo production (IVP), specifically because oocyte competence is one of the most important aspects determining the success of IVP. Imprinted genes, such as IGF2, play important roles in embryo development, placentation and fetal growth. The aim of this study was to characterize the DNA methylation profile of the CpG island located in IGF2 exon 10 in oocytes during bovine folliculogenesis. The methylation percentages in oocytes from primordial follicles, final secondary follicles, small antral follicles, large antral follicles, MII oocytes and spermatozoa were 73.74 ± 2.88%, 58.70 ± 7.46%, 56.00 ± 5.58%, 65.77 ± 5.10%, 56.35 ± 7.45% and 96.04 ± 0.78%, respectively. Oocytes from primordial follicles showed fewer hypomethylated alleles (15.5%) than MII oocytes (34.6%) (p = 0.039); spermatozoa showed only hypermethylated alleles. Moreover, MII oocytes were less methylated than spermatozoa (p<0.001). Our results showed that the methylation pattern of this region behaves differently between mature oocytes and spermatozoa. However, while this region has a classical imprinted pattern in spermatozoa that is fully methylated, it was variable in mature oocytes, showing hypermethylated and hypomethylated alleles. Furthermore, our results suggest that this CpG island may have received precocious reprogramming, considering that the hypermethylated pattern was already found in growing oocytes from primordial follicles. These results may contribute to our understanding of the reprogramming of imprinted genes during bovine oogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1924785882,"Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In vivo studies were performed to evaluate the activities of two thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, as inhibitors of oral carcinogenesis in rats. Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) were induced in male F344 rats by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO; 20 ppm in the drinking water for 10 weeks). In each study, groups of 30 NQO-treated rats were exposed to a PPARγ agonist beginning at week 10 (one day after completion of NQO administration) or at week 17 (7 weeks post-NQO); chemopreventive agent exposure was continued until study termination at week 22 (rosiglitazone study) or week 24 (pioglitazone study). Administration of rosiglitazone (800 mg/kg diet) beginning at week 10 increased survival, reduced oral cancer incidence, and reduced oral cancer invasion score in comparison to dietary controls; however, chemopreventive activity was largely lost when rosiglitazone administration was delayed until week 17. Administration of pioglitazone (500 mg/kg diet beginning at week 10 or 1000 mg/kg diet beginning at week 17) induced significant reductions in oral cancer incidence without significant effects on OSCC invasion scores. Transcript levels of PPARγ and its three transcriptional variants (PPARγv1, PPARγv2, and PPARγv3) were not significantly different in OSCC versus age- and site-matched phenotypically normal oral tissues from rats treated with NQO. These data suggest that PPARγ provides a useful molecular target for oral cancer chemoprevention, and that overexpression of PPARγ at the transcriptional level in neoplastic lesions is not essential for chemopreventive efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2219813987,"Vasopressin increases urine concentration through activation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the collecting duct. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block prostaglandin E2 synthesis, and may suppress AQP2 producing a urine concentrating defect. There are four serines in AQP2 that are phosphorylated by vasopressin. To determine if chronic use of NSAIDs changes AQP2’s phosphorylation at any of these residues, the effects of a non-selective NSAID, ibuprofen, and a COX-2-selective NSAID, meloxicam, were investigated. Daily ibuprofen or meloxicam increased the urine output and decreased the urine osmolality significantly by days 7 through 14. Concomitantly, meloxicam significantly reduced total AQP2 protein abundance in inner medulla (IM) tip to 64% of control and base to 63%, respectively. Ibuprofen significantly decreased total AQP2 in IM tip to 70% of control, with no change in base. Meloxicam significantly increased the ratios of p256-AQP2 and p261-AQP2 to total AQP2 in IM tip (to 44% and 40%, respectively). Ibuprofen increased the ratio of p256-AQP2 to total AQP2 in IM tip but did not affect p261-AQP2/total AQP2 in tip or base. Both ibuprofen and meloxicam increased p264-AQP2 and p269-AQP2 ratios in both tip and base. Ibuprofen increased UT-A1 levels in IM tip, but not in base. We conclude that NSAIDs reduce AQP2 abundance, contributing to decreased urine concentrating ability. They also increase some phosphorylated forms of AQP2. These changes may partially compensate for the decrease in AQP2 abundance, thereby lessening the decrease in urine osmolality."

The mean inter-marker distance was 1.18 cM and there were few gaps > 5 cM in length. Marker collinearity was maintained with the established peach genomic sequence. The map was used to show that trunk diameter (TD) is under the control of 4 loci, mapping to 3 different LGs. Different locus influenced TD at a varying stage of the tree's development.

https://openalex.org/W2230177954,"Gestational and developmental cues have important consequences for long-term health, behavior and adaptation to the environment. In addition, social stressors cause plastic molecular changes in the brain that underlie unique behavioral phenotypes that also modulate fitness. In the adult African cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni, growth and social status of males are both directly regulated by social interactions in a dynamic social environment, which causes a suite of plastic changes in circuits, cells and gene transcription in the brain. We hypothesized that a possible mechanism underlying some molecular changes might be DNA methylation, a reversible modification made to cytosine nucleotides that is known to regulate gene function. Here we asked whether changes in DNA methylation of the GnRH1 gene, the central regulator of the reproductive axis, were altered during development of A. burtoni. We measured changes in methylation state of the GnRH1 gene during normal development and following the gestational and developmental stress of social crowding. We found differential DNA methylation within developing juveniles between 14-, 28- and 42-day-old. Following gestational crowding of mouth brooding mothers, we saw differential methylation and transcription of GnRH1 in their offspring. Taken together, our data provides evidence for social control of GnRH1 developmental responses to gestational cues through DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2229265453,OBJECTIVE: This study examined service provider perceptions of requirements for successful sustainment of an efficacious intervention for preventing HIV/AIDS and STIs in female sex workers (FSWs) in Mexico. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 77 leaders and counselors from 12 community-based reproductive health clinics located throughout Mexico participating in a large hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial to scale-up the use of Mujer Segura a psychoeducational intervention designed to promote condom use and enhance safer sex negotiation skills among FSWs. RESULTS: Five sets of requirements for sustainment were identified: 1) characteristics of the provider including competence in delivering the intervention need for continued technical support and assistance from outside experts and satisfaction with addressing the needs of this population; 2) characteristics of the clients (i.e. FSWs) including client need and demand for services and incentives for participation; 3) characteristics of the organization including its mission benefits and operations; 4) characteristics of the outer setting including financial support and relationship with the community-based organizations central offices and transportation and security in areas where FSWs live and work; and 5) outcomes associated with the intervention itself including a reduction of risk through education and increased outreach through referrals from FSWs who received the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Although the requirements for successful sustainment of interventions like Mujer Segura are consistent with the factors identified in many models of implementation the results illustrate the importance of local context in assigning priority to these model elements and suggest that the five categories are not discrete entities but interconnected.

Here we describe an epitope-specific approach based on immunogenic display of hCG-derived peptides on virus-like particles of RNA bacteriophage. A number of recombinant VLPs were constructed, each displaying a different hCG-derived peptide. Some were taken from the disordered C-terminal tail of the hormone, another came from an internal loop, and yet another was an epitope mimic produced by affinity-selection on an hCG-neutralizing antibody target. Immunization of mice with some VLPs yielded antisera that bound the hormone and neutralized hCG biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2163930982,"Proteolytic processing of human host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) to its mature form was recently shown, unexpectedly, to occur in a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent fashion within the transferase active site of O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) (Lazarus, M. B., Jiang, J., Kapuria, V., Bhuiyan, T., Janetzko, J., Zandberg, W. F., Vocadlo, D. J., Herr, W., and Walker, S. (2013) Science 342, 1235-1239). An interesting mechanism involving formation and then intramolecular rearrangement of a covalent glycosyl ester adduct of the HCF-1 polypeptide was proposed to account for this unprecedented proteolytic activity. However, the key intermediate remained hypothetical. Here, using a model enzyme system for which the formation of a glycosyl ester within the enzyme active site has been shown unequivocally, we show that ester formation can indeed lead to proteolysis of the adjacent peptide bond, thereby providing substantive support for the mechanism of HCF-1 processing proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2256916199,"Global environmental change significantly affects marine species composition. However, analyzing the impact of these changes on marine zooplankton communities was so far mostly limited to assessing lethal doses through mortality assays and hence did not allow a direct assessment of the preferred conditions, or preferendum. Here, we use a microfluidic device to characterize individual behavior of actively swimming zooplankton, and to quantitatively determine their ecological preferendum. For the annelid zooplankton model Platynereis dumerilii we observe a broader pH preferendum than for the copepod Euterpina acutifrons, and reveal previously unrecognized sub-populations with different pH preferenda. For Platynereis, the minimum concentration difference required to elicit a response (responsiveness) is ~1 μM for H+ and ~13.7 mM for NaCl. Furthermore, using laser ablations we show that olfactomedin-expressing sensory cells mediate chemical responsiveness in the Platynereis foregut. Taken together, our microfluidic approach allows precise assessment and functional understanding of environmental perception on planktonic behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2243346348,"Cyclotides are a family of triple disulfide cyclic peptides with exceptional resistance to thermal/chemical denaturation and enzymatic degradation. Several cyclotides have been shown to possess anti-HIV activity, including kalata B1 (KB1). However, the use of cyclotides as anti-HIV therapies remains limited due to the high toxicity in normal cells. Therefore, grafting anti-HIV epitopes onto a cyclotide might be a promising approach for reducing toxicity and simultaneously improving anti-HIV activity. Viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 is required for entry of HIV into CD4+ T cells. However, due to a high degree of variability and physical shielding, the design of drugs targeting gp120 remains challenging. We created a computational protocol in which molecular modeling techniques were combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to automate the design of new cyclotides with improved binding to HIV gp120. We found that the group of modified cyclotides has better binding scores (23.1%) compared to the KB1. By using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation as a post filter for the final candidates, we identified two novel cyclotides, GA763 and GA190, which exhibited better interaction energies (36.6% and 22.8%, respectively) when binding to gp120 compared to KB1. This computational design represents an alternative tool for modifying peptides, including cyclotides and other stable peptides, as therapeutic agents before the synthesis process."

https://openalex.org/W1921344638,"Small scale distribution of insect root herbivores may promote plant species diversity by creating patches of different herbivore pressure. However, determinants of small scale distribution of insect root herbivores, and impact of land use intensity on their small scale distribution are largely unknown. We sampled insect root herbivores and measured vegetation parameters and soil water content along transects in grasslands of different management intensity in three regions in Germany. We calculated community-weighted mean plant traits to test whether the functional plant community composition determines the small scale distribution of insect root herbivores. To analyze spatial patterns in plant species and trait composition and insect root herbivore abundance we computed Mantel correlograms. Insect root herbivores mainly comprised click beetle (Coleoptera, Elateridae) larvae (43%) in the investigated grasslands. Total insect root herbivore numbers were positively related to community-weighted mean traits indicating high plant growth rates and biomass (specific leaf area, reproductive- and vegetative plant height), and negatively related to plant traits indicating poor tissue quality (leaf C/N ratio). Generalist Elaterid larvae, when analyzed independently, were also positively related to high plant growth rates and furthermore to root dry mass, but were not related to tissue quality. Insect root herbivore numbers were not related to plant cover, plant species richness and soil water content. Plant species composition and to a lesser extent plant trait composition displayed spatial autocorrelation, which was not influenced by land use intensity. Insect root herbivore abundance was not spatially autocorrelated. We conclude that in semi-natural grasslands with a high share of generalist insect root herbivores, insect root herbivores affiliate with large, fast growing plants, presumably because of availability of high quantities of food. Affiliation of insect root herbivores with large, fast growing plants may counteract dominance of those species, thus promoting plant diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2103013475,"The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis predicts that escape from intense herbivore damage may enable invasive plants to evolve higher competitive ability in the invasive range. Below-ground root herbivory can have a strong impact on plant performance, and invasive plants often compete with multiple species simultaneously, but experimental approaches in which EICA predictions are tested with root herbivores and in a community setting are rare. Here, we used Brassica nigra plants from eight invasive- and seven native-range populations to test whether the invasive-range plants have evolved increased competitive ability when competing with Achillea millefolium and with a community (both with and without A. millefolium). Further, we tested whether competitive interactions depend on root herbivory on B. nigra by the specialist Delia radicum. Without the community, competition with A. millefolium reduced biomass of invasive- but not of native-range B. nigra. With the community, invasive-range B. nigra suffered less than native-range B. nigra. Although the overall effect of root herbivory was not significant, it reduced the negative effect of the presence of the community. The community produced significantly less biomass when competing with B. nigra, irrespective of the range of origin, and independent of the presence of A. millefolium. Taken together, these results offer no clear support for the EICA hypothesis. While native-range B. nigra plants appear to be better in dealing with a single competitor, the invasive-range plants appear to be better in dealing with a more realistic multi-species community. Possibly, this ability of tolerating multiple competitors simultaneously has contributed to the invasion success of B. nigra in North America."

We applied laparoscopic ultrasonography (using Esaote 7.5~10MHz laparoscopic transducer) on the retrospective analyses of 42 women subjects during laparoscopic extirpation and excision of gynecological tumors in our hospital from August 2011 to August 2013. The objective of our research is to develop robust segmentation technique for isolation and identification of the uterus from the ultrasound images, so as to assess, locate and guide in removing the lesions during laparoscopic operations. Our method enables segmentation of the uterus by the active contour algorithm. We evaluated 42 in-vivo laparoscopic images acquired from the 42 patients (age 39.1 ± 7.2 years old) and selected images pertaining to 4 cases of congenital uterine malformations and 2 cases of pelvic adhesions masses. These cases (n = 6) were used for our uterus segmentation experiments. Based on them, the active contour method was compared with the manual segmentation method by a medical expert using linear regression and the Bland-Altman analysis (used to measure the correlation and the agreement). Then, the Dice and Jaccard indices are computed for measuring the similarity of uterus segmented between computational and manual methods. Good correlation was achieved whereby 84%–92% results fall within the 95% confidence interval in the Student t-test) and we demonstrate that the proposed segmentation method of uterus using laparoscopic images is effective."
https://openalex.org/W1942058908,"A new method for designing radiofrequency (RF) pulses with numerical optimization in the wavelet domain is presented. Numerical optimization may yield solutions that might otherwise have not been discovered with analytic techniques alone. Further, processing in the wavelet domain reduces the number of unknowns through compression properties inherent in wavelet transforms, providing a more tractable optimization problem. This algorithm is demonstrated with simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) spin echo refocusing pulses because reduced peak RF power is necessary for SMS diffusion imaging with high acceleration factors. An iterative, nonlinear, constrained numerical minimization algorithm was developed to generate an optimized RF pulse waveform. Wavelet domain coefficients were modulated while iteratively running a Bloch equation simulator to generate the intermediate slice profile of the net magnetization. The algorithm minimizes the L2-norm of the slice profile with additional terms to penalize rejection band ripple and maximize the net transverse magnetization across each slice. Simulations and human brain imaging were used to demonstrate a new RF pulse design that yields an optimized slice profile and reduced peak energy deposition when applied to a multiband single-shot echo planar diffusion acquisition. This method may be used to optimize factors such as magnitude and phase spectral profiles and peak RF pulse power for multiband simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) acquisitions. Wavelet-based RF pulse optimization provides a useful design method to achieve a pulse waveform with beneficial amplitude reduction while preserving appropriate magnetization response for magnetic resonance imaging."
