Since the first demonstration of 29% efficient TPVs (Fig. 1a) using an integrated back surface reflector and a tungsten emitter at 2,000 °C (ref. 10), TPV fabrication and performance have improved11,12. However, despite predictions that TPV efficiencies can exceed 50% (refs. 11,13,14), the demonstrated efficiencies are still only as high as 32%, albeit at much lower temperatures below 1,300 °C (refs. 13-15). Here we report the fabrication and measurement of TPV cells with efficiencies of more than 40% and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of high-bandgap tandem TPV cells. The TPV cells are two-junction devices comprising III-V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that are optimized for emitter temperatures of 1,900-2,400 °C. The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 ± 1)% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm-2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 °C. A 1.2/1.0 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 ± 1)% operating at a power density of 1.8 W cm-2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 °C. These cells can be integrated into a TPV system for thermal energy grid storage to enable dispatchable renewable energy. This creates a pathway for thermal energy grid storage to reach sufficiently high efficiency and sufficiently low cost to enable decarbonization of the electricity grid."

https://openalex.org/W4223906185,"Understanding how super-massive black holes form and grow in the early Universe has become a major challenge1,2 since it was discovered that luminous quasars existed only 700 million years after the Big Bang3,4. Simulations indicate an evolutionary sequence of dust-reddened quasars emerging from heavily dust-obscured starbursts that then transition to unobscured luminous quasars by expelling gas and dust5. Although the last phase has been identified out to a redshift of 7.6 (ref. 6), a transitioning quasar has not been found at similar redshifts owing to their faintness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Here we report observations of an ultraviolet compact object, GNz7q, associated with a dust-enshrouded starburst at a redshift of 7.1899 ± 0.0005. The host galaxy is more luminous in dust emission than any other known object at this epoch, forming 1,600 solar masses of stars per year within a central radius of 480 parsec. A red point source in the far-ultraviolet is identified in deep, high-resolution imaging and slitless spectroscopy. GNz7q is extremely faint in X-rays, which indicates the emergence of a uniquely ultraviolet compact star-forming region or a Compton-thick super-Eddington black-hole accretion disk at the dusty starburst core. In the latter case, the observed properties are consistent with predictions from cosmological simulations7 and suggest that GNz7q is an antecedent to unobscured luminous quasars at later epochs."
https://openalex.org/W4224076430,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing interest in online information about coronavirus worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the digital health literacy (DHL) level, information-seeking behaviour, and satisfaction of information on COVID-19 among East and South-East Asia university students. This cross-sectional web-based study was conducted between April to June 2020 by recruiting students from universities in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines. University students who have Internet access were invited to participate in the study. Items on sociodemographic variables, DHL, information-seeking behaviour, and information satisfaction were included in the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were conducted. A total of 5302 university students responded to the survey. The overall mean score across the four DHL subscales was 2.89 (SD: 0.42). Search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo) (92.0%) and social media (88.4%) were highly utilized by the students, whereas Websites of doctors or health insurance companies were of lower utilization (64.7%). Across the domains (i.e., adding self-generated content, determining relevance, evaluating reliability, and protecting privacy) higher DHL was positively associated with higher usage of trustworthy resources. Providing online information on COVID-19 at official university websites and conducting health talks or web-based information dissemination about the strategies for mental health challenges during pandemic could be beneficial to the students. Strengthening DHL among university students will enhance their critical thinking and evaluation of online resources, which could direct them to the quality and trustworthy information sources on COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4223917156,"COVID-19 and mass incarceration are closely intertwined with prisons having COVID-19 case rates much higher than the general population. COVID-19 has highlighted the relationship between incarceration and health, but prior work has not explored how COVID-19 spread in communities have influenced case rates in prisons. Our objective was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 case rates in the general population and prisons located in the same county.Using North Carolina's (NC) Department of Health and Human Services data, this analysis examines all COVID-19 tests conducted in NC from June-August 2020. Using interrupted time series analysis, we assessed the relationship between substantial community spread (50/100,000 detected in the last seven days) and active COVID-19 case rates (cases detected in the past 14 days/100,000) within prisons.From June-August 2020, NC ordered 29,605 tests from prisons and detected 1,639 cases. The mean case rates were 215 and 427 per 100,000 in the general and incarcerated population, respectively. Once counties reached substantial COVID-19 spread, the COVID-19 prison case rate increased by 118.55 cases per 100,000 (95% CI: -3.71, 240.81).Community COVID-19 spread contributes to COVID-19 case rates in prisons. In counties with prisons, community spread should be closely monitored. Stringent measures within prisons (e.g., vaccination) and decarceration should be prioritized to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4224048259,"A massive ""infodemic"" developed in parallel with the global COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to public misinformation at a time when access to quality information was crucial. This research aimed to analyze the science and health-related hoaxes that were spread during the pandemic with the objectives of (1) identifying the characteristics of the form and content of such false information, and the platforms used to spread them, and (2) formulating a typology that can be used to classify the different types of hoaxes according to their connection with scientific information. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of hoaxes which were debunked by the three main fact-checking organizations in Spain in the three months following WHO's announcement of the pandemic (N = 533). The results indicated that science and health content played a prominent role in shaping the spread of these hoaxes during the pandemic. The most common hoaxes on science and health involved information on scientific research or health management, used text, were based on deception, used real sources, were international in scope, and were spread through social networks. Based on the analysis, we proposed a system for classifying science and health-related hoaxes, and identified four types according to their connection to scientific knowledge: ""hasty"" science, decontextualized science, badly interpreted science, and falsehood without a scientific basis. The rampant propagation and widespread availability of disinformation point to the need to foster media and scientific caution and literacy among the public and increase awareness of the importance of timing and substantiation of scientific research. The results can be useful in improving media literacy to face disinformation, and the typology we formulate can help develop future systems for automated detection of health and science-related hoaxes."
https://openalex.org/W4224025080,"Alternative pet foods may offer benefits concerning environmental sustainability and the welfare of animals processed into pet foods. However, some worry these may compromise the welfare of pets. We asked 2,639 dog guardians about one dog living with them, for at least one year. Among 2,596 involved in pet diet decision-making, pet health was a key factor when choosing diets. 2,536 provided information relating to a single dog, fed a conventional meat (1,370 = 54%), raw meat (830 = 33%) or vegan (336 = 13%) diet for at least one year. We examined seven general indicators of ill health: unusual numbers of veterinary visits, medication use, progression onto a therapeutic diet after initial maintenance on a vegan or meat-based diet, guardian opinion and predicted veterinary opinion of health status, percentage of unwell dogs and number of health disorders per unwell dog. Dogs fed conventional diets appeared to fare worse than those fed either of the other two diets. Dogs fed raw meat appeared to fare marginally better than those fed vegan diets. However, there were statistically significant differences in average ages. Dogs fed raw meat were younger, which has been demonstrated to be associated with improved health outcomes. Additionally, non-health related factors may have improved apparent outcomes for dogs fed raw meat, for three of seven general health indicators. We also considered the prevalence of 22 specific health disorders, based on predicted veterinary assessments. Percentages of dogs in each dietary group considered to have suffered from health disorders were 49% (conventional meat), 43% (raw meat) and 36% (vegan). Significant evidence indicates that raw meat diets are often associated with dietary hazards, including nutritional deficiencies and imbalances, and pathogens. Accordingly, the pooled evidence to date indicates that the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs, are nutritionally sound vegan diets."
https://openalex.org/W4223898498,"Machine learning (ML) accelerometer data processing methods have potential to improve the accuracy of device-based assessments of physical activity (PA) in young children. Yet the uptake of ML methods by health researchers has been minimal and the use of cut-points (CP) continues to be the norm, despite evidence of significant misclassification error. The lack of studies demonstrating a relative advantage for ML approaches over CP methods maybe a key contributing factor.The current study compared the accuracy of PA intensity predictions provided by ML classification models and previously published CPs for preschool-aged children.In a free-living study, 31 preschool-aged children (mean age = 4.0 ± 0.9 y) wore wrist and hip ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers while completing a video recorded 20-minute free play session. Ground truth PA intensity was coded continuously using the Children's Activity Rating Scale (CARS). Accelerometer data was classified as sedentary (SED), light intensity (LPA), or moderate-to-vigorous intensity (MVPA) using ML random forest PA classifiers and published CPs for preschool-aged children. Performance differences were evaluated in a hold-out sample by comparing weighted kappa statistics, classification accuracy for each intensity band, and equivalence testing.ML classification models (hip: κ = 0.76; wrist: κ = 0.72) exhibited significantly higher agreement with ground truth PA intensity than CP methods (hip: κ = 0.38-0.49; wrist: κ = 0.31-0.44). For the ML models, classification accuracy for SED and LPA ranged from 83% - 88%, while classification accuracy for MVPA ranged from 68% - 78%. For the CP's, classification accuracy ranged from 50% - 94% for SED, 19% - 75% for LPA, and 44% - 76.1% for MVPA. ML classification models showed equivalence (within ± 0.5 SD) with directly observed time in SED, LPA, and MVPA. None of the CP's exhibited evidence of equivalence.Under free living conditions, ML classification models for hip or wrist accelerometer data provide more accurate assessments of PA intensity in young children than CP methods. The results demonstrate the relative advantage of ML methods over threshold-based approaches and adds to a growing evidence base supporting the feasibility and accuracy of ML accelerometer data processing methods."
https://openalex.org/W4223915139,"The COVID-19 crisis forced many changes to occur within organizations, which were necessary to keep the continuance of the organization's operations. Job performance seems to be an important factor determining such continuance, through its influence on the performance of entire organization. Shaping and keeping job performance in times of COVID-19 pandemic was a challenge for organizations, due to its negative impact on employees, causing their stress or lack of sense of security. There is a growing role of HRM specialists in appropriately shaping HRM strategies that can positively shape job-related attitudes, resulting in enhanced job performance during such difficult times. Therefore, this study aims to explain the role of COVID-19 oriented HRM strategies in shaping job performance through job-related attitudes such as work motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment in a time of crisis occurring in the organization due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted among 378 organizations operating in Poland during 2nd wave of COVID-19 pandemic. To verify the hypotheses, descriptive statistics were calculated using IBM SPSS and path analysis was performed using IBM AMOS. The result shows that combined set of ""hard"" HRM strategies related to the financial aspects and ""soft"" HRM strategies related to keeping employees' wellbeing during the crisis gives the best results in shaping job performance through job-related attitudes and consequently strengthening organizational performance. This study contributes to the knowledge concerning the development of COVID-19 oriented HRM strategies, which may also have practical application."

In this paper, we presented different prediction models using deep learning methods based on the monthly incidence of Hepatitis through a national public health surveillance system in China mainland.We assessed and compared the performance of three deep learning methods, namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) prediction model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) prediction model, and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction model. The data collected from 2005 to 2018 were used for the training and prediction model, while the data are split via 5-Fold cross-validation. The performance was evaluated based on three metrics: mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).Among the year 2005-2018, 20,924,951 cases and 11,892 deaths were supervised in the system. Hepatitis B (HB) is the most disease-causing incidence and death, and the proportion is greater than 70 percent, while the percentage of the incidence and deaths is decreased much in 2018 compared with 2005. Based on the measured errors and the visualization of the three neural networks, there is no one model predicting the incidence cases that can be completely superior to other models. When predicting the number of incidence cases for HB, the performance ranking of the three models from high to low is LSTM, BPNN, RNN, while it is LSTM, RNN, BPNN for Hepatitis C (HC). while the MAE, MSE and MAPE of the LSTM model for HB, HC are 3.84*10-06, 3.08*10-11, 4.981, 8.84*10-06, 1.98*10-12,5.8519, respectively.The deep learning time series predictive models show their significance to forecast the Hepatitis incidence and have the potential to assist the decision-makers in making efficient decisions for the early detection of the disease incidents, which would significantly promote Hepatitis disease control and management."

However, PrEP continuation and high adherence remain challenges to its impact. Existing PrEP adherence interventions can be time- and cost-intensive. Widescale PrEP delivery will require the identification of layered PrEP support strategies for AGYW with diverse prevention needs. We describe the design of a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) to evaluate a PrEP adherence support model using scalable, stepped interventions in AGYW in South Africa.""PrEP SMART"" is a randomized trial in Johannesburg, South Africa, enrolling AGYW who are between 18 and 25 years of age, sexually active, newly initiating PrEP, and have regular access to a mobile phone. Participants are randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care PrEP counseling with either two-way SMS or WhatsApp group adherence support. Adherence is assessed at three months using tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels from dried blood spots collected at month 2 to categorize participants as ""responders"" (TFV-DP ≥500 fmol/punch) or ""non-responders"" (TFV-DP <500 fmol/punch). AGYW defined as 'non-responders' undergo a secondary 1:1 randomization to either quarterly drug-level feedback counseling or monthly issue-focused counseling, in addition to their first-level intervention. The primary outcome is PrEP adherence at nine months (TFV-DP ≥700 fmol/punch). We will assess the effect of our two initial interventions on TFV-DP levels among responders, assess the effect of our intensified interventions on TFV-DP levels among non-responders, and identify the optimal sequence of adherence interventions through nine months.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04038060.

https://openalex.org/W4224045269,"Folic acid is one of the vital micronutrients that contribute to the genetic stability and other biological activities. In addition, microRNAs regulate gene expression through a multittude of pathways. Our current work aimd to explore the possible ameliorative potency of folic acid and its association with the hepatic miR-21, -34a, and -122 expression as well as their targeted genes, HBP1, SIRT1, and SREBP-1c in rats with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL). A total of 50 Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups, a control group (n = 10) and NAFL group (n = 40). Rats in NAFL group were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) containing 20% fats for 14 weeks. The NAFL group was further subdivided into four groups (n = 10/group), one untreated and three orally folic acid-treated groups (25, 50, and 75 μg/Kg b.wt). NAFL characteristics was evaluated in rats in addition to the miR-21, -34a, and -122 profile as well as the transcriptional levels of HBP1, SIRT1, and SREBP-1c genes. NAFL rats exhibited the classic traits of fatty liver disease profile and dysregulation in the pattern of miR-21, -34a, and -122 expression as well as their targeted genes (HBP1, SIRT1, and SREBP-1c, respectively) in the liver. Additionally, NAFL rats had altered levels of TNF-α and adiponectin. These alterations were significantly ameliorated in a dose-dependent pattern following the folic acid treatments. In conclusions, the anti-steatotic, insulin-sensitizing, glucose-lowering and lipotropic potencies of folic acid in NAFL rats may be linked to the epigenetic modulation of the hepatic microRNAs (miR-21, -34a, and -122) and the expression of their target genes (HBP1, SIRT1, and SREBP-1c)."
https://openalex.org/W4224101493,"Do health and economic shocks exacerbate prejudice towards racial/ethnic minority groups? We investigate this question in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic by collecting nationally representative survey data with an embedded experiment. Results show that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group reported increased prejudice towards East Asian and Hispanic colleagues. East Asians in the treatment group faced higher prejudicial responses from Americans living in counties with higher COVID-19 infections and those who lost jobs due to COVID-19, and fewer prejudicial responses in counties with a higher concentration of Asians. These results point to the salience of COVID-19 fueled health and economic insecurities in shaping prejudicial attitudes, specifically towards East Asians. County-level socioeconomic factors did not moderate the increased prejudicial attitudes toward Hispanics in the workplace. These findings highlight a dimension of prejudice, intensified during the pandemic, which has been largely underreported and therefore missing from the current discourse on this important topic."
https://openalex.org/W4223968190,"Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are small, cysteine-rich proteins, a part of the pathogenesis-related protein family, and numerous of them act as positive regulators during plant disease resistance, growth, and reproduction. These proteins are involved also in the intracellular transfer of lipids, as well as in plant immune responses. Besides their differences in sequences, they show similar features in their structure. However, they show distinct lipid-binding specificities signifying their various biological roles that dictate further structural study. This study reports the identification, in silico characterization and purification of a novel member of the nsLTP2 protein family from durum wheat, TdLTP2. It was generated and purified using the combination of gel filtration chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Its identity was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). TdLTP2 had been expressed in different stress to detect its localization; therefore, fluor-immunolocalization studies accomplished this data. In this approach, to assess the allergenicity of TdLTP2, thirty patients with baker's asthma were enrolled and ELISA to detect the presence of specific IgE antibodies tested their sera. Moreover, the lipid-binding properties of TdLTP2 were examined in vitro and validated using a molecular docking study. In summary, our results demonstrate a new addition of member in plant nsLTPs family, TdLTP2, which can develop a better understanding about its biological functions and shed light on future applications."
https://openalex.org/W4224035982,"Environmental challenges are as wide as the universe so that its different dimensions can be the subject of diverse studies. In this research, using 17 data from Asia-Pacific during the period 2000 to 2017, an attempt has been made to investigate the economic factors responsible for the ecological footprint in the fishing sector. The main contribution of the present study is to investigate the effects of nine economic freedom indicators along with other control variables on environmental pressure on the status of fishery resources. Based on the results, the Kuznets curve hypothesis was confirmed in the fishing grounds footprint, so that the growth of GDP per capita shows a positive and significant effect, while its squared form coefficient is negative. Other control variables including natural resource rents, urbanization, and energy intensity, do not show significant effects on the fishing footprint. The different components of economic freedom show different effects, while their cumulative effects in the form of the total economic freedom index have a positive effect on the footprint of fishing and lead to increased extraction from fishing resources. The results show that the Government Integrity, Tax Burden, Business Freedom, Monetary Freedom indices increase the fishing footprint, while the indices of trade freedom and investment freedom, by revealing the negative effects on the fishing footprint, have beneficial environmental effects in reducing the pressure on the aquatic resources of countries. The results of the present study reveal the need to examine how the various dimensions of economic freedom affect to provide the proper management of fishery resources."
https://openalex.org/W4223928346,"Media bias has a substantial impact on individual and collective perception of news. Effective communication that may counteract its potential negative effects still needs to be developed. In this article, we analyze how to facilitate the detection of media bias with visual and textual aids in the form of (a) a forewarning message, (b) text annotations, and (c) political classifiers. In an online experiment, we randomized 985 participants to receive a biased liberal or conservative news article in any combination of the three aids. Meanwhile, their subjective perception of media bias in this article, attitude change, and political ideology were assessed. Both the forewarning message and the annotations increased media bias awareness, whereas the political classification showed no effect. Incongruence between an articles' political position and individual political orientation also increased media bias awareness. Visual aids did not mitigate this effect. Likewise, attitudes remained unaltered."
https://openalex.org/W4224050707,"Disrupting the formation of the oncogenic YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex holds substantial therapeutic potential. However, the three protein interaction interfaces of this complex cannot be easily disrupted using small molecules. Here, we report that the pharmacologically active small molecule aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) acts as a disruptor of the TAZ-TEAD complex. ATA was identified in a high-throughput screen using a TAZ-TEAD AlphaLISA assay that was tailored to identify disruptors of this transcriptional complex. We further used fluorescence polarization assays both to confirm disruption of the TAZ-TEAD complex and to demonstrate that ATA binds to interface 3. We have previously shown that cell-based models that express the oncogenic TAZ-CAMTA1 (TC) fusion protein display enhanced TEAD transcriptional activity because TC functions as an activated form of TAZ. Utilizing cell-based studies and our TC model system, we performed TC/TEAD reporter, RNA-Seq, and qPCR assays and found that ATA inhibits TC/TEAD transcriptional activity. Further, disruption of TC/TEAD and TAZ/TEAD interaction by ATA abrogated anchorage-independent growth, the phenotype most closely linked to dysregulated TAZ/TEAD activity. Therefore, this study demonstrates that ATA is a novel small molecule that has the ability to disrupt the undruggable TAZ-TEAD interface."
https://openalex.org/W4224072479,"Changes in retinal thickness are common in various ocular diseases. Transverse magnification due to differing ocular biometrics, in particular axial length, affects measurement of retinal thickness in different regions. This study evaluated the effect of axial length and refractive error on measured macular thickness in two community-based cohorts of healthy young adults.A total of 2160 eyes of 1247 community-based participants (18-30 years; 23.4% myopes, mean axial length = 23.6mm) were included in this analysis. Macular thickness measurements were obtained using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (which assumes an axial length of 24.385mm). Using a custom program, retinal thickness data were extracted at the 9 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) regions with and without correction for transverse magnificent effects, with the corrected measurements adjusting according to the participant's axial length. Linear mixed models were used to analyse the effect of correction and its interaction with axial length or refractive group on retinal thickness.The raw measures (uncorrected for axial length) underestimated the true retinal thickness at the central macula, while overestimating at most non-central macular regions. There was an axial length by correction interaction effect in all but the nasal regions (all p<0.05). For each 1mm increase in axial length, the central macular thickness is overestimated by 2.7-2.9μm while thicknesses at other regions were underestimated by 0.2-4.1μm. Based on the raw thickness measurements, myopes have thinner retinas than non-myopes at most non-central macular. However, this difference was no longer significant when the corrected data was used.In a community-based sample, the raw measurements underestimate the retinal thickness at the central macula and overestimate the retinal thickness at non-central regions of the ETDRS grid. The effect of axial length and refractive error on retinal thickness is reduced after correcting for transverse magnification effects resulting from axial length differences."
https://openalex.org/W4225554972,"Dickeya are plant pathogenic bacteria able to provoke disease on a wide range of plants. A type 2 secretion system (T2SS) named Out is necessary for Dickeya virulence. Previous studies showed that the D. dadantii T2SS secretes a wide range of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, including pectinases and a cellulase. However, the full repertoire of exoproteins it can secrete has probably not yet been identified. Secreted proteins possess a signal peptide and are first addressed to the periplasm before their recruitment by Out. T2SS-specific secretion signals remain unknown which prevents in silico identification of T2SS substrates. To identify new Out substrates, we analyzed D. dadantii transcriptome data obtained in plant infection condition and searched for genes strongly induced and encoding proteins with a signal sequence. We identified four new Out-secreted proteins: the expansin YoaJ, the putative virulence factor VirK and two proteins of the DUF 4879 family, SvfA and SvfB. We showed that SvfA and SvfB are required for full virulence of D. dadantii and that svf genes are present in a variable number of copies in other Pectobacteriaceae, up to three in D. fanghzongdai. This work opens the way to the study of the role of non-pectinolytic proteins secreted by the Out pathway in Pectobacteriaceae."
https://openalex.org/W4223913544,"Recently, workers in most enterprises suffer from excessive occupational stress in the workplace, which negatively affects workers' productivity, safety, and health. To deal with stress in workers, it is vital for the human resource management (HRM) department to manage stress effectively, bridging the gap between management and stressed employees. To manage stress effectively, the first step is to predict workers' stress and detect the factors causing stress among workers. Existing methods often rely on the stress assessment questionnaire, which may not be effective to predict workers' stress, due to 1) the difficulty of collecting the questionnaire data, and 2) the bias brought by workers' subjectivity when completing the questionnaires. In this paper, we aim to address this issue and accurately predict workers' stress status based on Deep Learning (DL) approach. We develop two stress prediction models (i.e., stress classification model and stress regression model) and correspondingly design two neural network architectures. We train these two stress prediction models based on workers' data (e.g., salary, working time, KPI). By conducting experiments over two real-world datasets: ESI and HAJP, we validate that our proposed deep learning-based approach can effectively predict workers' stress status with 71.2% accuracy in the classification model and 11.1 prediction loss in the regression model. By accurately predicting workers' stress status with our method, the HRM of enterprises can be improved."

Based on the resource-dependent and principal-agent theories, this paper compares and discusses the relationship between charitable donations and innovation investment under different motivations. Using 2008 ~2019 relevant data of listed companies as research samples, a mixed regression model is established for the hypothesis test, and further examines the state-ownership of its moderating role. The results show that the altruistic motivation-oriented corporate donations have a significant inverted u-shaped effect on innovation investment. The tool motivation-oriented corporate donations have a significant U-shaped effect on innovation investment. Moreover, it is further found that for ST (Special Treatment) corporates with the risk of delisting in the tool motivation-oriented charitable donations type, the corporate charitable donations have a significant negative effect on innovation investment. State-ownership can enhance the inverted U-shaped relationship between altruistic motivation-oriented corporate donations and innovation investment but weaken the U-shaped relationship between tool motivation-oriented corporate donations and innovation investment."
https://openalex.org/W4224071429,"Quantifying the factors associated with the presence and abundance of species is critical for conservation. Here, we quantify the factors associated with the occurrence of the Southern Greater Glider in the forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. We gathered counts of animals along transects and constructed models of the probability of absence, and then the abundance if animals were present (conditional abundance), based on species' associations with forest type, forest age, the abundance of denning sites in large old hollow-bearing trees, climatic conditions, and vegetation density. We found evidence of forest type effects, with animals being extremely uncommon in Alpine Ash and Shining Gum forest. In Mountain Ash forest, we found a negative relationship between the abundance of hollow-bearing trees and the probability of Southern Greater Glider absence. We also found a forest age effect, with the Southern Greater Glider completely absent from the youngest sites that were subject to a high-severity, stand-replacing wildfire in 2009. The best fitting conditional abundance model for the Southern Greater Glider included a strong positive effect of elevation; the species was more abundant in Mountain Ash forests at higher elevations. Our study highlights the importance of sites with large old hollow-bearing trees for the Southern Greater Glider, although such trees are in rapid decline in Mountain Ash forests. The influence of elevation on conditional abundance suggests that areas at higher elevations will be increasingly important for the conservation of the species, except where Mountain Ash forest is replaced by different tree species that may be unsuitable for the Southern Greater Glider."

We evaluated using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) morphological parameters of the macular center of eyes with foveal hypoplasia and describe the presence of hyporeflective zones in the Henle fiber layer (HFL) of eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia. Methods Eyes with foveal hypoplasia were classified into two groups: high-grade foveal hypoplasia with thick inner retinal layers at the macular center (thickness above 100 μm; 16 eyes of 9 subjects) and low-grade foveal hypoplasia with thinner inner retinal layers at the macular center (thickness below 100 μm; 25 eyes of 13 subjects). As comparison, SD-OCT images of normal control eyes (n = 75) were investigated. Results Eyes with foveal hypoplasia displayed shorter central photoreceptor outer segments (POS), a thinner central myoid zone, and a thicker central HFL compared to control eyes. Eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia also displayed a thinner central outer nuclear layer (ONL) compared to eyes with low-grade foveal hypoplasia and control eyes. There was a negative correlation between the thicknesses of the central ONL and HFL in eyes with foveal hypoplasia; however, the total thickness of both ONL and HFL was similar in all eye populations investigated. Visual acuity of subjects with foveal hypoplasia was negatively correlated to the thickness of the central inner retinal layers and positively correlated to the length of central POS. In contrast to central POS, the length of paracentral POS (0.5 and 1.0 mm nasal from the macular center) was not different between the three eye populations investigated. The paracentral ONL was thickest in eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia and thinnest in control eyes. Hyporeflective zones in the HFL were observed on SD-OCT images of eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia, but not of eyes with low-grade foveal hypoplasia and control eyes. OCT angiography images recorded at the level of the HFL of eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia showed concentric rings of different reflectivity around the macular center; such rings were not observed on images of eyes with low-grade foveal hypoplasia and control eyes. Conclusions It is suggested that the hyporeflective zones in the HFL of eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia represent cystoid spaces which are surrounded by Henle fiber bundles. Cystoid spaces are likely formed because there are fewer Henle fibers and a thinner central ONL despite an unchanged thickness of both ONL and HFL. Cystoid spaces may cause the concentric rings of different reflectivity around the macular center in the HFL of eyes with high-grade foveal hypoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W4223924623,"Artificial feeding of young infants is considered a modern phenomenon. However, historical sources note its practice in some past European populations. This research explores factors that contributed to a short to absent period of breastfeeding in pre-modern Netherlands. Stable nitrogen and carbon isotope analysis is undertaken on 277 19th century individuals from Beemster, a, rural, mainly Protestant, dairy farming community. An intra-individual sampling approach for ≤6 year-olds compares newer metaphyseal to older diaphyseal long bone collagen to classify feeding status at death. Archivally identified individuals permit analyses of sex and year-of-death. Few infants have isotopic evidence for breastfeeding and, if present, it was likely of short duration or a minor source of dietary protein. From only a few weeks to months of age infants were fed cow's milk and paps with sugar. There is broad dietary homogeneity with no sex or temporal isotopic differences, but young infants (1-11 months) have the most ẟ15N and ẟ13C variation highlighting the effect of multiple dietary and physiological processes. Beemster had many factors associated with high rates of breastfeeding in other Dutch communities, yet, most mothers did not breastfeed, or not for long, showing that regional variation in infant feeding is influenced by community values and traditions. On top of child rearing and domestic chores, female dairy farmers were in charge of milking cattle and dairy production, an important income source, suggesting high workload was also a factor in short or absent breastfeeding periods, aided by the constant supply of fresh milk that could be fed to an infant by an older sibling."
https://openalex.org/W4223982380,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of a gluten-free diet and/or antibiotics on tetanus vaccine induced immunoglobulin G titers and immune cell levels in BALB/c mice. The gluten-free diet was associated with a reduced anti-tetanus IgG response, and it increased the relative abundance of the anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium significantly in some of the mice. Antibiotics also led to gut microbiota changes and lower initial vaccine titer. After a second vaccination, neither gluten-free diet nor antibiotics reduced the titers. In the spleen, the gluten-free diet significantly increased regulatory T cell (Treg) fractions, CD4+ T cell activation, and tolerogenic dendritic cell fractions and activation, which extend the downregulating effect of the Treg. Therefore, the systemic effect of the gluten-free diet seems mainly tolerogenic. Antibiotics reduced the fractions of CD4+ T and B cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. These results suggest that vaccine response in mice is under influence of their diet, the gut microbiota and the interplay between them. However, a gluten-free diet seems to work through mechanisms different from those induced by antibiotics. Therefore, diet should be considered when testing vaccines in mice and developing vaccines for humans."
https://openalex.org/W4224010554,"Although emotional and behavioural problems among young children are common and, if unaddressed, can lead to multi-facetted problems later in life, there is little research investigating the implementation of parenting programs that target these problems. In this study, the RE-AIM framework was used to evaluate the implementation of the Triple P parenting program in a preschool setting at a medium-sized municipality in Sweden. Reach increased over time, showing an overall increase in participating fathers and parents with lower education. Effectiveness outcomes showed an improvement in emotional and behavioural problems in children and less mental health-related symptoms and higher self-efficacy in parents. Adoption rate was 93.3%. To ensure staff ""buy-in"", designated coordinators made changes in recruitment procedures, and provided supervision and training to all Triple P practitioners. Implementation adaptations were made, such as minor revisions of parenting strategies and other program content, as well as providing child care during seminars and groups, and setting up weekend-groups. Maintenance assessed through 12 month follow-up data suggested that several child and parent outcomes were maintained over time. Uppsala municipality continues to offer Triple P to parents. The reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the program were all satisfactory and demonstrated the suitability of delivering evidence-based parenting support using preschools as an arena."
https://openalex.org/W4224043785,"Surgical exploration is widely performed in hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA), but the intraoperative resectability rate is only 60%-80%. Exploration substantially increases pain and mental stress, and the costs and length of hospital stay are considerably increased. Identifying preoperative risk factors associated with unresectability could decrease unnecessary exploration.In total, 440 HCCA patients from multiple centers were enrolled. Those receiving surgical exploration were divided into the resected and unresected groups. Morphological variables including Bismuth classification, lymph node metastasis and vessel invasion were obtained from radiological exams. Logistic regression for the training cohort was used to identify risk factors for unresectability, and a nomogram was constructed to calculate the unresectability rate. A calibration curve assessed the power of the nomogram.Among 311 patients receiving surgical exploration, 45 (14.7%) were unresectable by intraoperative judgment. Compared with the resected group, unresected patients had similar costs (p = 0.359) and lengths of hospital stay (p = 0.439). Multivariable logistic regression of the training cohort (235 patients) revealed that CA125, Bismuth-Corlette type IV, lymph node metastasis and hepatic artery invasion were risk factors for unresectability. Liver atrophy (p = 0.374) and portal vein invasion (p = 0.114) were not risk factors. The nomogram was constructed based on the risk factors. The concordance index (C-index) values of the calibration curve for predicting the unresectability rate of the training and validation (76 patients) cohorts were 0.900 (95% CI, 0.835-0.966) and 0.829 (95% CI, 0.546-0.902), respectively.Analysis of preoperative factors could reveal intraoperative unresectability and reduce futile surgical explorations, ultimately benefiting HCCA patients."
https://openalex.org/W4225729275,"Laboratory mice are widely studied as models of mammalian biology, including the microbiota. However, much of the taxonomic and functional diversity of the mouse gut microbiome is missed in current metagenomic studies, because genome databases have not achieved a balanced representation of the diverse members of this ecosystem. Towards solving this problem, we used flow cytometry and low-coverage sequencing to capture the genomes of 764 single cells from the stool of three laboratory mice. From these, we generated 298 high-coverage microbial genome assemblies, which we annotated for open reading frames and phylogenetic placement. These genomes increase the gene catalog and phylogenetic breadth of the mouse microbiota, adding 135 novel species with the greatest increase in diversity to the Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae families. This new diversity also improves the read mapping rate, taxonomic classifier performance, and gene detection rate of mouse stool metagenomes. The novel microbial functions revealed through our single-cell genomes highlight previously invisible pathways that may be important for life in the murine gastrointestinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W4223914213,"Functioning of ecosystems depends on the nutrient dynamics across trophic levels, largely mediated by microbial interactions in the soil food web. The present study investigated the use of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and poultry manure (PM) for maintaining labile P in the soil for an extensive fertility enhancement and as a substitution of chemical fertilizers. Based on the different P solubilizing capabilities of Bacillus and Pseudomonas, a quadruple consortium of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Pseudomonas fluorescens, and their grazer nematodes (soil free living) supplemented with PM were studied. This study was carried out on the trophic levels of soil communities to assess the growth and availability of P to the wheat plants. Experiment was performed for 90 days. Comparing the unamended and amended predator results showed that nematode addition beyond bacterial treatment substantially increased the net available P by ≈2 times, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity by 3.3 times. These results demonstrated the nematodes association with increasing nutrient availability or P mineralization. The interactive effect of PM as substrate and biological drivers was more noticeable on plant dry biomass (1.6 times) and plant P concentration (3.5times) compared to the similar unamended treatment. It is concluded that the biological drivers significantly enhanced the soil ALP and available P while the substrate and biological drivers enhanced dry biomass and plant P concentration. Bacterivore nematodes enhanced the effect of PSB for P mineralization via microbial loop and could be used for the enhancement of wheat production."

The Duchenne Video Assessment (DVA) measures patient ease of movement through identification of compensatory movement patterns. The DVA directs caregivers to video record patients performing specific movement tasks at home using a secure mobile application, and DVA-certified physical therapists (PTs) score the videos using scorecards with prespecified compensatory movement criteria. The goal of this study was to develop and refine the DVA scorecards.To develop the initial scorecards, 4 PTs collaboratively created compensatory movement lists for each task, and researchers structured the lists into scorecards. A 2-round modified Delphi process was used to gather expert opinion on the understandability, comprehensiveness, and clinical meaningfulness of the compensatory movements on the scorecards. Eight PTs who had evaluated ≥50 patients with DMD and participated in ≥10 DMD clinical trials were recruited for the panel. In Round 1, panelists evaluated compensatory movement criteria understandability via questionnaire and tested the scorecards. In Round 2, panelists participated in an in-person meeting to discuss areas of disagreement from Round 1 and reach consensus (≥75% agreement) on all revisions to the scorecards.During the Round 1 revisions to the scorecards, there were 67 changes (44%) to the wording of 153 original compensatory movement criteria and 3 criteria were removed. During the Round 2 revisions to the scorecards, there were 47 changes (31%) to the wording of 150 compensatory movement criteria, 20 criteria were added, and 30 criteria were removed. The panel reached 100% agreement on all changes made to scorecards during Round 2.PTs with extensive experience evaluating patients with DMD confirmed that the compensatory movement criteria included in the DVA scorecards were understandable, comprehensive, and clinically meaningful."
https://openalex.org/W4224020211,"Aiming at the engineering requirements of reducing the volume and improving the vibration characteristics of gears in the three-cylinder engine balanced system, a design and optimization method of gear structure is proposed based on the Design of Experiments (DOE) and proxy models. The paper analyzes the structure improvement process based on the gear design model and technical index requirements. By designing the plane characteristics of the weight-increasing module, the weight-reducing module and the elastic module, the calculation model of balance performance indices such as mass, moment of inertia and unbalance of new balanced vibration reduction gear are constructed. Then, a more efficient design method is proposed based on dynamic simulation and multidisciplinary optimization design platform (Isight). The results show that the new design method of gear structure can effectively reduce the structure improvement cycle. At the same time, the improved structure can reduce the thickness of the weight-increasing module by 6.3 mm and the vibration attenuation by more than 90%."
https://openalex.org/W4224043324,"The global body-fossil record of marine ‘fishes’ from the time interval immediately preceding the Cretaceous–Paleogene Extinction is markedly poor. This deficiency appears to be further exacerbated with regards to offshore and deep-water taxa, obscuring our understanding of the state and composition of corresponding vertebrate faunas at the onset of this major extinction event. Recent fieldwork in the mid–late Maastrichtian exposures of the Pindos Unit in Gavdos Island, Greece, yielded a small but informative sample of fossil ‘fishes’, which inhabited the Tethys approximately three to four million years before the extinction. In this work we describe this sample, which comprises between eight and nine discrete morphotypes of various size classes, belonging to †Ichthyodectoidei, Aulopiformes (†Dercetidae, †Enchodontidae, †Ichthyotringidae), cf. †Sardinioididae, as well as the hexanchid shark † Gladioserratus sp. The new material expands the faunal list for the Maastrichtian of Gavdos Island, and the Pindos Unit as a whole, and further allows for the description of a new genus and species of †Enchodontidae and a new species of †Ichthyotringidae. The two new taxa are found to be widespread in the Maastrichtian of the Pindos Unit. The overall character of the assemblage agrees with previous interpretations of an offshore and rather deep depositional environment for the fossiliferous horizons. Furthermore, it exhibits a higher diversity than, and little taxonomic overlap with penecontemporaneous teleost assemblages from the Tethys, and informs on the otherwise poorly known Maastrichtian offshore and deep-water marine ichthyofaunas of the region."
https://openalex.org/W4224075947,"Species-specific diversities are particular features of mammalian chloride channel regulator, calcium activated ( CLCA ) genes. In contrast to four complex gene clusters in mammals, only two CLCA genes appear to exist in chickens. CLCA2 is conserved in both, while only the galline CLCA1 ( gCLCA1 ) displays close genetic distance to mammalian clusters 1, 3 and 4. In this study, sequence analyses and biochemical characterizations revealed that gCLCA1 as a putative avian prototype shares common protein domains and processing features with all mammalian CLCA homologues. It has a transmembrane (TM) domain in the carboxy terminal region and its mRNA and protein were detected in the alimentary canal, where the protein was localized in the apical membrane of enterocytes, similar to CLCA4. Both mammals and birds seem to have at least one TM domain containing CLCA protein with complex glycosylation in the apical membrane of enterocytes. However, some characteristic features of mammalian CLCA1 and 3 including entire protein secretion and expression in cell types other than enterocytes seem to be dispensable for chicken. Phylogenetic analyses including twelve bird species revealed that avian CLCA1 and mammalian CLCA3 form clades separate from a major branch containing mammalian CLCA1 and 4. Overall, our data suggest that gCLCA1 and mammalian CLCA clusters 1, 3 and 4 stem from a common ancestor which underwent complex gene diversification in mammals but not in birds."

We also adjust for attachment to parents and parental monitoring.Data are drawn from four cross-sectional surveys conducted between 2016 and 2019 in southern Sweden. The sample consists of 3,838 adolescents, aged 14-15. Negative binomial models were used to calculate the associations between family structure and delinquency.The results show that those living in single-father, single-mother, father-stepmother, mother-stepfather families report significantly more delinquency than adolescents living with both their parents. Adolescents living in ""symmetrical"" family arrangements, i.e. both parents are single or have a new partner, reported lower levels of delinquency, whereas adolescents living in ""asymmetrical"" family arrangements, i.e. where either the mother or the father, but not both, have a new partner, reported higher levels of delinquency. Most of the associations between family structure and delinquency decline when adjusted for attachment to parents and parental monitoring.This study shows that it is important to move on to the use of more detailed categorisations of family structure in relation to delinquency. We need to increase our knowledge about the group of adolescents that moves between parents and especially about the different constellations of asymmetrical and symmetrical living arrangements."

Therefore, we evaluated the impact of MHO on lung function in a large health-screening cohort.114,143 subjects (65,342 men, mean age and BMI: 39.6 years and 23.6) with health examinations in 2019 were divided into four groups as follows: metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO), MHO, metabolically unhealthy non-obese (MUHNO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO). Metabolic health was defined as fewer than two metabolic syndrome components. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs), using MHNO as a reference, were calculated to determine lung function impairment.Approximately one-third (30.6%) of the study subjects were obese. The prevalence of MHO was 15.1%. Subjects with MHO had the highest FEV1% and FVC% values but the lowest FEV1/FVC ratio (p<0.001). These results persisted after controlling for covariates. Compared with MHNO, the aORs (95% confidence interval) for FEV1% < 80% in MHO, MUHNO and MUHO were 0.871 (0.775-0.978), 1.274 (1.114-1.456), and 1.176 (1.102-1.366), respectively (P for trend = 0.014). Similarly, the aORs in MHO, MUHNO, and MUHO were 0.704 (0.615-0.805), 1.241 (1.075-1.432), and 1.226 (1.043-1.441), respectively, for FVC% < 80% (p for trend = 0.013). However, the aORs for FEV1/FVC<0.7 were not significantly different between groups (p for trend = 0.173).The MHO group had better lung function than other groups. However, longitudinal follow-up studies are required to validate our findings."

Comparisons of winners to controls yielded a 4.8% relative difference average life-span (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 7.9, p = 0.004), a 5.1 year absolute increase in life expectancy (95% confidence interval: 3.0 to 7.2, p < 0.001), and a 41% improvement in mortality hazard (95% confidence interval: 19 to 68, p < 0.001). The increased survival tended to be greater in recent years, for individuals winning at a younger age, and among those with multiple wins. The increased survival replicated in secondary analyses comparing winners to nominees and was not observed in analyses comparing nominees to controls.Academy award winning actors and actresses show a positive association between success and survival, suggesting the importance of behavioral, psychological, or other modifiable health factors unrelated to poverty."

This study aims to revise the taxonomy and ecology of Indian Psyra by providing a morphology-based diagnostic key, highlighting their altitudinal, habitat and seasonal preferences, and modelling their distribution based on current and future climatic scenarios. Here, we describe a new species, P. variabilis sp. nov. and document 4 species and 1 subspecies as new to India, viz. P. gracilis, P. szetschwana, P. dsagara, P. falcipennis and P. debilis debilis, thus updating the global species count to 19 with 14 species/1 subspecies from India. We also submitted partial mitochondrial COI sequences of P. crypta, P. similaria, P. spurcataria and P. gracilis as novel to the global genetic database and calculated the overall genetic divergence was 5.17% within the genus, suggesting strong monophyly. Being a typical montane genus, most of the species of Psyra were active within 2000-2280 m altitude, 10.55-15.7°C annual mean temperature, 1200-2300 mm annual precipitation and 168-179 NDVI. Psyra species were predominant in wet temperate, mixed coniferous and moist temperate deciduous forests, their abundance and richness being at peak during post-monsoon months of October-November. The major bioclimatic variables influencing the overall distribution of the genus were mean temperature of warmest quarter, temperature seasonality and precipitation of coldest/driest quarter. While two of the modelled species were predicted to lose area occupancy under future climatic scenarios, the narrow-specialist, Trans-Himalayan species P. debilis debilis was projected to gain up to 75% additional area in the years 2041-60. The results of this study will be helpful to identify sites with maximum area loss projection in ecologically fragile Indian Himalaya and initiating conservation management for such climatically vulnerable insect species groups."

These studies sometimes explore important factors that are affected by load, such as training adaptations and injury risk. The generalisability of the conclusions of these studies, can depend on how much load varies between seasons, training phases and teams. The interpretation of previous load studies and the design of future load studies should be influenced by an understanding of how load can vary across seasons, training phases and between teams. The current study compared training loads (session rating of perceived exertion x session duration) between all (8) teams in an elite Netball competition for multiple (2) season phases and (2) seasons. A total of 29,545 records of athlete session training loads were included in the analysis. Linear mixed models identified differences between seasons and training phases (p &lt; .05). There were also differences between teams and a complex set of interactions between these three factors (season, phase, and team) (p &lt; .05). While the absolute value of the training loads reported here are only relevant to elite netball, these results illustrate that when data is sampled from a broader context, the range and variation in load may increase. This highlights the importance of cautiously interpreting and generalisation of findings from load studies that use limited data sets."
https://openalex.org/W4223985358,"Cumulative advantage–commonly known as the Matthew Effect–influences academic output and careers. Given the challenge and uncertainty of gauging the quality of academic research, gatekeepers often possess incentives to prefer the work of established academics. Such preferences breach scientific norms of universalism and can stifle innovation. This article analyzes repeat authors within academic journals as a possible exemplar of the Matthew Effect. Using publication data for 347 economics journals from 1980–2017, as well as from three major generalist science journals, we analyze how articles written by repeat authors fare vis-à-vis less-experienced authors. Results show that articles written by repeat authors steadily decline in citation impact with each additional repeat authorship. Despite these declines, repeat authors also tend to garner more citations than debut authors. These contrasting results suggest both benefits and drawbacks associated with repeat authorships. Journals appear to respond to feedback from previous publications, as more-cited authors in a journal are more likely to be selected for repeat authorships. Institutional characteristics of journals also affect the likelihood of repeat authorship, as well as citation outcomes. Repeat authorships–particularly in leading academic journals–reflect innovative incentives and professional reward structures, while also influencing the intellectual content of science."

Differences in EEG between patients and controls, as well as differences in patients' depression severity, were examined using the ratio of the power spectrum at each frequency. In addition, the effects of medications were examined in a similar way.In comparing healthy controls and depression patients, significant power spectrum differences were observed at 3 Hz, 4 Hz, and 10 Hz and higher frequencies. In the patient group, differences in the power spectrum were observed between asymptomatic patients and healthy individuals, and between patients of each respective severity level and healthy individuals. In addition, significant differences were observed at multiple frequencies when comparing patients who did and did not take antidepressants, antipsychotics, and/or benzodiazepines. However, the power spectra still remained significantly different between non-medicated patients and healthy individuals.The small sample size may have caused Type II error. Patients' demographic characteristics varied. Moreover, most patients were taking various medications, and cannot be compared to the non-medicated control group.A study with a larger sample size should be conducted to gauge reproducibility, but the methods used in this study could be useful in clinical practice as a biomarker of depression."

https://openalex.org/W4225768086,"Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling plays critical roles during vertebrate development, including regulation of skeletal and cartilage growth. TH acts through its receptors (TRs), nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) that heterodimerize with Retinoid-X receptors (RXRs), to regulate gene expression. A defining difference between NR signaling during development compared to in adult tissues, is competence, the ability of the organism to respond to an endocrine signal. Amphibian metamorphosis, especially in Xenopus laevis, the African clawed frog, is a well-established in vivo model for studying the mechanisms of TH action during development. Previously, we've used one-week post-fertilization X. laevis tadpoles, which are only partially competent to TH, to show that in the tail, which is naturally refractive to exogenous T3 at this stage, RXR agonists increase TH competence, and that RXR antagonism inhibits the TH response. Here, we focused on the jaw that undergoes dramatic TH-mediated remodeling during metamorphosis in order to support new feeding and breathing styles. We used a battery of approaches in one-week-old tadpoles, including quantitative morphology, differential gene expression and whole mount cell proliferation assays, to show that both pharmacologic (bexarotene) and environmental (tributyltin) RXR agonists potentiated TH-induced responses but were inactive in the absence of TH; and the RXR antagonist UVI 3003 inhibited TH action. Bex and TBT significantly potentiated cellular proliferation and the TH induction of runx2, a transcription factor critical for developing cartilage and bone. Prominent targets of RXR-mediated TH potentiation were members of the matrix metalloprotease family, suggesting that RXR potentiation may emphasize pathways responsible for rapid changes during development."
