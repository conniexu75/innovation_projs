https://openalex.org/W2942134847,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) produced from back-splicing of exons of pre-mRNAs are widely expressed, but current understanding of their functions is limited. These RNAs are stable in general and are thought to have unique structural conformations distinct from their linear RNA cognates. Here, we show that endogenous circRNAs tend to form 16-26 bp imperfect RNA duplexes and act as inhibitors of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) related to innate immunity. Upon poly(I:C) stimulation or viral infection, circRNAs are globally degraded by RNase L, a process required for PKR activation in early cellular innate immune responses. Augmented PKR phosphorylation and circRNA reduction are found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from patients with autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Importantly, overexpression of the dsRNA-containing circRNA in PBMCs or T cells derived from SLE can alleviate the aberrant PKR activation cascade, thus providing a connection between circRNAs and SLE."

However, ecosystem-level impacts of viral community diversity remain difficult to assess due to classification issues and few reference genomes. Here, we establish an ∼12-fold expanded global ocean DNA virome dataset of 195,728 viral populations, now including the Arctic Ocean, and validate that these populations form discrete genotypic clusters. Meta-community analyses revealed five ecological zones throughout the global ocean, including two distinct Arctic regions. Across the zones, local and global patterns and drivers in viral community diversity were established for both macrodiversity (inter-population diversity) and microdiversity (intra-population genetic variation). These patterns sometimes, but not always, paralleled those from macro-organisms and revealed temperate and tropical surface waters and the Arctic as biodiversity hotspots and mechanistic hypotheses to explain them. Such further understanding of ocean viruses is critical for broader inclusion in ecosystem models."
https://openalex.org/W2940627982,"We performed the first proteogenomic study on a prospectively collected colon cancer cohort. Comparative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of paired tumor and normal adjacent tissues produced a catalog of colon cancer-associated proteins and phosphosites, including known and putative new biomarkers, drug targets, and cancer/testis antigens. Proteogenomic integration not only prioritized genomically inferred targets, such as copy-number drivers and mutation-derived neoantigens, but also yielded novel findings. Phosphoproteomics data associated Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, which explains why this classical tumor suppressor is amplified in colon tumors and suggests a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation in colon cancer. Proteomics identified an association between decreased CD8 T cell infiltration and increased glycolysis in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, suggesting glycolysis as a potential target to overcome the resistance of MSI-H tumors to immune checkpoint blockade. Proteogenomics presents new avenues for biological discoveries and therapeutic development."

YTHDF2 decreases the half-life of diverse m6A transcripts that contribute to the overall integrity of LSC function, including the tumor necrosis factor receptor Tnfrsf2, whose upregulation in Ythdf2-deficient LSCs primes cells for apoptosis.

Thus, we identify YTHDF2 as a unique therapeutic target whose inhibition selectively targets LSCs while promoting HSC expansion. Hematopoiesis critically depends on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which possess unique self-renewal capacity and multilineage differentiation potential, replenishing all blood lineages (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in which the acquisition of mutations by HSPCs results in a block in their myeloid differentiation and the generation of self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs) (Döhner et al., 2015Döhner H. Weisdorf D.J. Bloomfield C.D. Acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 1136-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). LSCs initiate and propagate the disease, and given that they are treatment resistant, they often fuel disease relapses. Therefore, identification of specific therapeutic targets for LSC elimination is an unmet clinical need. Emerging evidence indicates an involvement of mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, the most abundant internal mRNA modification (Desrosiers et al., 1974Desrosiers R. Friderici K. Rottman F.

However, recent studies implicated Ythdf2 in the regulation of HSC homeostasis and hematopoietic regeneration (Li et al., 2018Li Z. Qian P. Shao W. Shi H. He X.C. Gogol M. Yu Z. Wang Y. Qi M.

Here, we reveal that targeting YTHDF2 extends the half-life of m6A-modified transcripts to selectively compromise AML initiation and propagation without derailing normal hematopoiesis. We found that YTHDF2 was expressed significantly higher across AML samples with diverse cytogenetic abnormalities compared to non-leukemic controls (Figure 1A), and YTHDF2 protein was highly expressed in primary AML samples (Figure 1B). We next compared YTHDF2 expression in datasets from AML cells with LSC activity and AML cells without LSC activity validated by xenotransplantation (Ng et al., 2016Ng S.W. Mitchell A. Kennedy J.A. Chen W.C. McLeod J. Ibrahimova N. Arruda A. Popescu A. Gupta V.

Given that the majority of CD34+ and a minority of CD34− fractions have LSC activity (Eppert et al., 2011Eppert K. Takenaka K. Lechman E.R. Waldron L. Nilsson B. van Galen P. Metzeler K.H. Poeppl A.

Invest. 2011; 121: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we also compared YTHDF2 expression between these fractions and found that YTHDF2 was expressed at higher levels in CD34+ fractions (Figure S1A). To investigate the requirement for YTHDF2 in leukemogenesis, we employed conditional genetics and a mouse AML model in which Meis1 and Hoxa9, oncogenes frequently overexpressed in human AML (Drabkin et al., 2002Drabkin H.A.

In this model (Figure 1D), HSPCs are transduced with retroviruses co-expressing Meis1 and Hoxa9 and serially replated, generating preleukemic cells, which upon transplantation to recipient mice generate self-renewing LSCs, causing AML (Guitart et al., 2017Guitart A.V.

We utilized the conditional and reporter Ythdf2fl mouse allele in which exon 2 of Ythdf2 was flanked by loxP sites and GFP was inserted after the start codon of Ythdf2 in exon 1, generating a fully functional GFP-YTHDF2 fusion protein (Ivanova et al., 2017Ivanova I.

Cell. 2017; 67: 1059-1067.e1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We combined the Ythdf2fl allele with Vav-iCre (de Boer et al., 2003de Boer J. Williams A. Skavdis G. Harker N. Coles M. Tolaini M. Norton T. Williams K. Roderick K. Potocnik A.J. Kioussis D. Transgenic mice with hematopoietic and lymphoid specific expression of Cre.Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) to generate Ythdf2fl/fl;Vav-iCre (Ythdf2CKO) mice in which Ythdf2 is specifically deleted in the hematopoietic system shortly after the emergence of HSCs (Figures 1E and 1F). Ythdf2CKO and control Ythdf2fl/fl (Ythdf2CTL) mice showed normal Mendelian distribution (Ythdf2fl/fl × Ythdf2fl/fl;Vav-iCre matings resulted in 65 Ythdf2CTL and 47 Ythdf2CKO mice at weaning; p = 0.28) and had comparable survival. We transduced Ythdf2CKO and Ythdf2CTL HSPCs with Meis1-Hoxa9 retroviruses and found that while Ythdf2CKO cells produced significantly lower colony numbers upon serial replating (Figure 1G), they had unaffected expression of c-Kit, CD11b, and Gr-1 (Figure 1H). Notably, Ythdf2-deficient preleukemic cells generated AML with substantially longer latency compared to control cells (Figures 1I and 1J). The loss of YTHDF2 expression was confirmed in Ythdf2CKO cells isolated from moribund recipient mice (Figure 1K). To enumerate LSCs in the leukemic recipients of Meis1-Hoxa9-transduced Ythdf2CKO and Ythdf2CTL cells, we performed a limiting dilution assay with donor-derived CD45.2+ bone marrow (BM) cells isolated from primary recipients. We found that LSC frequency in recipients of Ythdf2CKO cells was significantly decreased (Figure 1L). Therefore, Ythdf2 is required for LSC development and AML initiation. To test whether Ythdf2 is required for leukemic transformation driven by other oncogenes, we used PML-RARA, which causes acute promyelocytic leukemia, and MOZ-TIF2, which is associated with AML with inv(8)(p11q13). Serial replating assays revealed that Ythdf2CKO c-Kit+ cells transduced with either PML-RARA or MOZ-TIF2 retroviruses failed to efficiently generate colonies (Figure 1M). Thus, Ythdf2 is essential for leukemic transformation driven also by other oncogenes. We next asked whether acute deletion of Ythdf2 from established LSCs using Mx1-Cre impacts LSC maintenance and leukemia propagation. We generated experimental Ythdf2fl/fl;Mx1-Cre (Ythdf2iCKO) and control Ythdf2fl/fl (Ythdf2CTL) mice, transduced HSPCs with Meis1-Hoxa9 retroviruses, and transplanted them into lethally irradiated primary recipients (Figure 2A). Upon leukemia development, c-Kit+ cells (a population enriched for LSCs; Somervaille and Cleary, 2006Somervaille T.C. Cleary M.L. Identification and characterization of leukemia stem cells in murine MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 257-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) were isolated, and given the leakiness of Mx1-Cre upon transplantation (Velasco-Hernandez et al., 2016Velasco-Hernandez T.

Potential pitfalls of the Mx1-Cre system: implications for experimental modeling of normal and malignant hematopoiesis.Stem Cell Reports. 2016; 7: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the population was further sorted for GFP+ cells to enrich for those expressing YTHDF2 (Figure 2B). While Ythdf2CTL c-Kit+GFP+ cells showed significant engraftment and caused aggressive AML in secondary recipients (Figures 2C and 2D), Ythdf2iCKO c-Kit+GFP+ cells lost YTHDF2 expression (Figure 2E) due to spontaneous Mx1-Cre activation (even without the administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [pIpC]) and failed to efficiently engraft and propagate the disease (Figures 2C and 2D). Therefore, YTHDF2 is critical for LSC maintenance. To investigate the requirement for YTHDF2 in human leukemic cells, we knocked down the expression of YTHDF2 in human AML THP-1 cells harboring MLL-AF9 translocation using two independent short hairpins targeting YTHDF2. YTHDF2 knockdown (Figure 2F) inhibited their proliferative capacity (Figure 2G) and increased their apoptosis (Figure 2H) but had no impact on their myeloid differentiation (Figure 2I). This finding was corroborated in NOMO-1 AML cells harboring MLL-AF9 translocation (Figures S1B and S1C). THP-1 cells with YTHDF2 knockdown had compromised capacity to engraft AML (Figure 2J) and displayed impaired ability to cause fatal AML (Figure 2K). Finally, we performed knockdown experiments in independent human primary AML samples and found that YTHDF2 depletion significantly decreased the clonogenic potential of AML cells in colony-forming cell (CFC) assays (Figures 2L and 2M). Thus, YTHDF2 is necessary for human AML cell survival and leukemic cell engraftment. We next investigated whether Ythdf2 deletion has any detrimental effects on HSC functions and multilineage hematopoiesis. To determine the YTHDF2 expression at different levels of the hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy, we employed Ythdf2fl/fl mice harboring the GFP-YTHDF2 fusion protein (Ivanova et al., 2017Ivanova I. Much C. Di Giacomo M. Azzi C. Morgan M. Moreira P.N. Monahan J. Carrieri C. Enright A.J. O’Carroll D. The RNA m6A reader YTHDF2 is essential for the post-transcriptional regulation of the maternal transcriptome and oocyte competence.Mol. Cell. 2017; 67: 1059-1067.e1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All hematopoietic cells in adult BM expressed GFP-YTHDF2 (Figures 3A and S2A). YTHDF2 was highly expressed in Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) stem and/or progenitor cells, HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs), primitive hematopoietic progenitors (HPC-1 and HPC-2 populations), and myeloid progenitors, and its expression was decreased in differentiated Lin+ cells (Figures 3A and S2A). Peripheral blood (PB) analyses of Ythdf2CKO mice revealed modest decreases in numbers of white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), B cells, and CD8+ T cells and elevated platelet levels (Figure 3B). Apart from a decrease in CD8+ T cells, Ythdf2CKO mice had essentially normal numbers of differentiated cells in their spleens (Figure S2B). We found unaffected numbers of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), increased numbers of pre-megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (pre-MegEs) and megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs) and an imbalance between pre-colony forming unit-erythroid (pre-CFU-E) and colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) (Figure S2C). CFC assays showed normal differentiation potential of Ythdf2CKO BM cells (Figure 3C). Thus, YTHDF2 is not critical for steady-state hematopoiesis. We next investigated the impact of Ythdf2 deletion on stem and progenitor cells. Adult Ythdf2CKO mice displayed expansion of LSK cells, HSCs, and HPC-1 and HPC-2 progenitor cells compared to Ythdf2CTL mice (Figures 3D and 3E). We also inducibly ablated Ythdf2 using Mx1-Cre, which upon pIpC injection acutely deletes Ythdf2 in Ythdf2iCKO adult mice (Figure 3F). Acute Ythdf2 deletion (Figure 3G) had no impact on mouse survival (data not shown) or multilineage hematopoiesis (Figures 3H and 3I; Table S1) and resulted in increased numbers of LSK cells, but not myeloid progenitor cells (Figure 3J). Thus, hematopoiesis-specific Ythdf2 ablation during development or acute deletion in adult mice leads to an expansion of the primitive cell compartment at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy and does not derail normal hematopoiesis. To reveal the repopulation capacity of Ythdf2-deficient HSCs, we competitively transplanted HSCs from Ythdf2CKO and Ythdf2CTL mice into lethally irradiated recipients. HSCs of both genotypes gave equal overall long-term reconstitution (Figure 3K). However, while Ythdf2CKO HSCs had enhanced myeloid lineage reconstitution capacity, they had normal B cell and compromised T cell reconstitution potentials (Figure 3K). Strikingly, Ythdf2CKO HSCs displayed significantly increased capacity to contribute to the BM HSC and progenitor cell compartments and differentiated cell compartments (Figures 3L and 3M). The analyses of donor-derived compartment of the recipients revealed increased frequencies of Ythdf2CKO LSK, HPC-1, and HPC-2 cells (Figure S2D). The myeloid bias of Ythdf2-deficient HSCs and its connection to a shift in balance among the HSCs, MPP, and HPC populations upon Ythdf2 deletion merit future investigation. Therefore, targeting Ythdf2 promotes stem or primitive progenitor cell expansion and enhances their reconstitution and myeloid differentiation potentials. We next sought to understand the mechanism by which YTHDF2 loss impedes LSC function. YTHDF2 is known to promote transcript decay through deadenylation (Du et al., 2016Du H. Zhao Y. He J. Zhang Y. Xi H. Liu M. Ma J. Wu L. YTHDF2 destabilizes m(6)A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.Nat.

Jia G. et al.N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Indeed, the loss of YTHDF2 resulted in deregulated gene expression with 754 upregulated and 528 downregulated genes; p < 0.05) in Ythdf2CKO compared to Ythdf2CTL preleukemic cells (Figure 4A). Gene Ontology analysis of deregulated genes in preleukemic cells revealed generic metabolic processes in the upregulated genes and immune response processes in the downregulated genes (Figure S3A). To understand which of the deregulated transcripts could be direct targets of YTHDF2, we determined transcriptome-wide mRNA m6A in Ythdf2CTL and Ythdf2CKO preleukemic cells. This revealed the expected m6A consensus motif as well as distribution of m6A within the transcriptome and enrichment around the stop codon within transcripts in both genotypes (Figures S3B–S3D). Furthermore, Ythdf2 deficiency did not alter any of these parameters (Figures S3B–S3D). YTHDF2 loss is expected to result in the upregulation of direct target transcripts; indeed, we observed an enrichment for m6A occupancy in the significantly upregulated genes (p < 0.05; 754 genes) in Ythdf2CKO preleukemic cells compared to the corresponding unchanged or downregulated gene sets (Figure 4B). Reciprocally, we analyzed the transcriptome based on RNA m6A modification and found that transcripts that contain m6A show increased expression in Ythdf2CKO preleukemic cells (Figures 4C and 4D). To understand if these observations are extended to the AML in vivo, we isolated LSCs from mice with AML derived from Ythdf2CTL and Ythdf2CKO preleukemic cells and performed gene expression analysis (Figure S3E). The relationship between m6A occupancy and increased transcript dosage was also observed in Ythdf2CKO LSCs (Figures S3F–S3H). The upregulation of m6A-containing transcripts in the absence of YTHDF2 may arise from an increase in their half-life. We therefore measured mRNA half-life transcriptome-wide in preleukemic cells using thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq; Herzog et al., 2017Herzog V.A.

https://openalex.org/W2942493572,"In mammals, endogenous circadian clocks sense and respond to daily feeding and lighting cues, adjusting internal ∼24 h rhythms to resonate with, and anticipate, external cycles of day and night. The mechanism underlying circadian entrainment to feeding time is critical for understanding why mistimed feeding, as occurs during shift work, disrupts circadian physiology, a state that is associated with increased incidence of chronic diseases such as type 2 (T2) diabetes. We show that feeding-regulated hormones insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) reset circadian clocks in vivo and in vitro by induction of PERIOD proteins, and mistimed insulin signaling disrupts circadian organization of mouse behavior and clock gene expression. Insulin and IGF-1 receptor signaling is sufficient to determine essential circadian parameters, principally via increased PERIOD protein synthesis. This requires coincident mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, increased phosphoinositide signaling, and microRNA downregulation. Besides its well-known homeostatic functions, we propose insulin and IGF-1 are primary signals of feeding time to cellular clocks throughout the body."

The striatum is the largest nucleus of the basal ganglia, a group of interconnected subcortical nuclei involved in movement, repetitive behavior, obsessions, habits, tics, and diverse neuropsychiatric conditions (Graybiel, 2008Graybiel A.M. Habits, rituals, and the evaluative brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 359-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). In the current study, we report the unexpected discovery that latent synaptogenic cues derived from striatal astrocytes drive behavioral hyperactivity with disrupted attention in adult mice. Initially documented over a century ago, astrocytes represent about 40% of all brain cells. They are the most numerous type of glia and tile the entire CNS (Barres, 2008Barres B.A. The mystery and magic of glia: a perspective on their roles in health and disease.Neuron. 2008; 60: 430-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). During development, astrocytes provide important cues to regulate synapse formation and removal (Allen and Lyons, 2018Allen N.J. Lyons D.A. Glia as architects of central nervous system formation and function.Science. 2018; 362: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), whereas in adults, the finest astrocyte processes from these “bushy” cells continue to contact neurons, synapses, blood vessels, and other glial cells. In these locations, astrocytes mediate multiple active and homeostatic functions (Attwell et al., 2010Attwell D. Buchan A.M. Charpak S. Lauritzen M. Macvicar B.A. Newman E.A.

Despite these advances, the mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron signaling, its effects on the functions of intact neural circuits, their behavioral outputs, and their contributions to brain diseases remain to be fully elucidated. Replete with molecularly defined astrocytes, the striatum is an important circuit to explore astrocyte biology in adult mice (Chai et al., 2017Chai H. Diaz-Castro B. Shigetomi E. Monte E. Octeau J.C.

As the major input nucleus of the basal ganglia, the striatum integrates converging excitatory and inhibitory signals from numerous parts of the brain and is involved in action selection and motor function (Graybiel, 2008Graybiel A.M.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2397-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via whole-cell patch-clamping (Figures 1A–1C). MSN depolarization by ∼20–30 mV resulted in action potential (AP) firing and significantly increased the frequency of Ca2+ signals in nearby astrocytes (<50 μm away from MSN somata or dendrites) from 1.4 ± 0.2 to 2.4 ± 0.3 min−1 (Figures 1B and 1C; n = 24 astrocytes, 6 mice; p < 0.001). The amplitude of the Ca2+ signals was unaltered (0.3 ± 0.04 to 0.3 ± 0.04 dF/F; p > 0.05; n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice), but their duration increased (2.8 ± 0.04 to 4.0 ± 0.4 s; p < 0.01; n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice), likely reflecting merged events. No change in Ca2+ signals was observed by current injection via an open pipette, indicating that the astrocyte responses were not due to mechanical effects (Figures 1B and 1C; n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice). Furthermore, astrocytes responded similarly when either D1 or D2 MSNs were depolarized (Figures S1A–S1C), likely reflecting developmental maturity in adult mice (Martín et al., 2015Martín R. Bajo-Grañeras R. Moratalla R. Perea G. Araque A.

MSN depolarization-evoked astrocyte Ca2+ signals were resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX; 300 nM; Figure 1C; n = 21 astrocytes, 5 mice), which blocked all APs (Figure S1F). However, astrocyte Ca2+ signals were abolished by Cd2+ (50 μM; n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice) and nimodipine (20 μM; n = 23 astrocytes, 4 mice), which both block MSN L-type Ca2+ channels (Bargas et al., 1994Bargas J. Howe A. Eberwine J. Cao Y. Surmeier D.J. Cellular and molecular characterization of Ca2+ currents in acutely isolated, adult rat neostriatal neurons.J.

The depolarization-evoked astrocyte Ca2+ signals were also blocked by MSN dialysis with the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA; 10 mM; n = 21 astrocytes, 4 mice) or with the light chain of tetanus toxin (LC-TeNT; 1 μM; Figure 1C; n = 24 astrocytes, 5 mice), which blocks vesicular release. Together with imaging of MSN activity during upstate-like heightened excitability (Figures S1D–S1G), these data show that MSN membrane potential transitions open high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and cause Ca2+-dependent vesicular release of a substance from MSNs that communicates to nearby astrocytes to cause intracellular Ca2+ elevations.Figure S1MSN Depolarization, which Induced Ca2+ Influx into MSNs, Activated Astrocyte Ca2+ Signaling Irrespective of MSN Subtypes, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative images showing tdTomato-positive (i, D1) and tdTomato-negative (ii, D2) MSNs from Drd1a-tdTomato mice before and after whole-cell patching (dialyzed with Alexa 568).

GABAB receptor type 1 (GB1R) proteins (gene: Gabbr1) were abundant in striatal astrocytes isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Chai et al., 2017Chai H. Diaz-Castro B. Shigetomi E.

Furthermore, consistent with functional expression of GABA receptors in astrocytes, bath application of GABA (300 μM; n = 24 astrocytes, 5 mice) and the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (50 μM; n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice) increased astrocyte Ca2+ signals (Figure 1F; p < 0.01). The effect of baclofen was blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845 (10 μM; n = 15 astrocytes, 4 mice; Figure 1F), which also blocked the MSN depolarization-evoked astrocyte Ca2+ signals (Figure 1F; n = 18 astrocytes, 4 mice). Astrocyte Ca2+ responses evoked by baclofen and by MSN depolarization were abolished (Figure 1G) in mice in which GB1Rs were deleted from the striatum (Figures 1G, S2A, and S2B). We explored whether MSN depolarization stimulated astrocytes via GABA in vivo. We expressed ChR2(H134R) in MSNs and assessed immediate-early gene (c-Fos) expression in astrocytes following optical stimulation. We detected GB1R-dependent c-Fos expression in astrocytes following MSN ChR2(H134R) stimulation. The optically stimulated increase in c-Fos expression in astrocytes was significantly reduced when GB1R was deleted (Figures 1H and 1I; 4 mice). Ca2+ signals are a readout of diverse astrocyte G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Porter and McCarthy, 1997Porter J.T. McCarthy K.D. Astrocytic neurotransmitter receptors in situ and in vivo.Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). GB1Rs couple to Gi proteins, which in astrocytes (Haustein et al., 2014Haustein M.D. Kracun S. Lu X.H. Shih T. Jackson-Weaver O. Tong X. Xu J. Yang X.W. O’Dell T.J. Marvin J.S. et al.Conditions and constraints for astrocyte calcium signaling in the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway.Neuron. 2014; 82: 413-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) leads to Ca2+ elevation by activation of phospholipase C, which we confirmed for the GABAB receptor responses (Figures S2C and S2D). Furthermore, MSNs intermingled extensively with astrocytes (Chai et al., 2017Chai H. Diaz-Castro B. Shigetomi E. Monte E. Octeau J.C. Yu X. Cohn W. Rajendran P.S. Vondriska T.M.

We hypothesize that MSNs release GABA from their dendrites to mediate astrocyte responses; dendritic release of neurotransmitters, including GABA, is known (Waters et al., 2005Waters J. Schaefer A. Sakmann B. Backpropagating action potentials in neurones: measurement, mechanisms and potential functions.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 87: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that hippocampal astrocytes respond to glutamate, ATP, and/or endocannabinoid release from dendrites (Bernardinelli et al., 2011Bernardinelli Y. Salmon C. Jones E.V. Farmer W.T. Stellwagen D. Murai K.K. Astrocytes display complex and localized calcium responses to single-neuron stimulation in the hippocampus.J.

Endocannabinoids mediate neuron-astrocyte communication.Neuron. 2008; 57: 883-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) via release mechanisms that are not yet delineated. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for MSN-to-astrocyte signaling mediated by neuronal GABA release acting on astrocyte GABAB receptors (Figures 1, S1, and S2). We comment on our use of mice carrying a floxed (f/f) Gabbr1 allele and the use of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). In the preceding sections, we deleted GB1Rs from astrocytes using striatal AAV2/5 GfaABC1D-Cre microinjections. We could identify astrocytes based on their bushy morphologies as well as by marker expression (Figures S2A and S2B), and we could therefore easily monitor the consequences of deleting GB1Rs in single-cell evaluations (Figures 1G and 1I). However, as reported in Figures S3A–S3D and the associated legend, we could not use Gabbr1 f/f mice for astrocyte-selective evaluations of more complex phenomena, such as animal behavior. To explore the consequences of GB1R Gi pathway activation in astrocytes, we used chemogenetic approaches that were fully validated for astrocyte selectivity (Adamsky et al., 2018Adamsky A. Kol A. Kreisel T. Doron A. Ozeri-Engelhard N. Melcer T. Refaeli R. Horn H. Regev L.

GABAB receptors exist in multiple brain cells, including neurons; therefore, GABAB receptor agonists cannot be used in vivo to interrogate astrocyte GABAB receptor-mediated physiology. Furthermore, currently available genetic strategies cannot selectively delete GABAB receptors only from striatal astrocytes in the adult brain (Figures S3A–S3D). Hence, to specifically explore the consequences of striatal astrocyte GABAB Gi pathway activation in vivo, which is necessary to interpret behavioral effects, we expressed human M4 muscarinic (hM4) receptor (hM4Di) designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) (Roth, 2016Roth B.L. DREADDs for Neuroscientists.Neuron. 2016; 89: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) using established methods that result in selective expression within 84% ± 3% of striatal astrocytes (Chai et al., 2017Chai H. Diaz-Castro B. Shigetomi E. Monte E. Octeau J.C. Yu X. Cohn W. Rajendran P.S. Vondriska T.M.

We confirmed that intrastriatal microinjection of AAV2/5-delivered cargo was astrocyte-selective and restricted to the striatum, although there was a little expression proximal to the needle tract in astrocytes of the cortex and, sometimes, of the corpus callosum (Figure S3E). We suspect that such expression occurred in all past studies employing viruses because it is impossible to reach subcortical brain structures without advancing the needle through the overlying tissue; all studies employing microinjections (including ours) need to be interpreted with this anatomical caveat in mind. In brain slices from control mice, the hM4Di agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 1 μM) had no effect on astrocyte Ca2+ signals (Figures 2B and 2C; Video S1; n = 14 astrocytes, 4 mice). However, in brain slices from mice expressing hM4Di in striatal astrocytes, CNO evoked significant astrocyte Ca2+ elevations (Figures 2B and 2C; Video S2; n = 11 astrocytes, 4 mice; p < 0.0001). These were similar to those mediated by GABAB receptors (Figure 1F) and other endogenous GPCRs (the CNO-evoked response area was 52.1 ± 8.4 dF/F.sec, whereas that for phenylephrine (Srinivasan et al., 2016Srinivasan R.

Furthermore, 2 h after acute in vivo administration of CNO (Alexander et al., 2009Alexander G.M. Rogan S.C. Abbas A.I. Armbruster B.N. Pei Y. Allen J.A. Nonneman R.J. Hartmann J. Moy S.S.

In vivo hM4Di activation by CNO increased c-Fos expression in striatal astrocytes (Figure 2F; n = 4 mice). Thus, CNO stimulated hM4Di-expressing striatal astrocytes to a level similar to that"
https://openalex.org/W2942376604,"Our bodies are equipped with powerful immune surveillance to clear cancerous cells as they emerge. How tumor-initiating stem cells (tSCs) that form and propagate cancers equip themselves to overcome this barrier remains poorly understood. To tackle this problem, we designed a skin cancer model for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that can be effectively challenged by adoptive cytotoxic T cell transfer (ACT)-based immunotherapy. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and lineage tracing, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-responding tSCs are superior at resisting ACT and form the root of tumor relapse. Probing mechanism, we discovered that during malignancy, tSCs selectively acquire CD80, a surface ligand previously identified on immune cells. Moreover, upon engaging cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4), CD80-expressing tSCs directly dampen cytotoxic T cell activity. Conversely, upon CTLA4- or TGF-β-blocking immunotherapies or Cd80 ablation, tSCs become vulnerable, diminishing tumor relapse after ACT treatment. Our findings place tSCs at the crux of how immune checkpoint pathways are activated."

For example, photoconversion cell-lineage tracing identified migratory and proliferative cell states in human rhabdomyosarcoma, a pediatric cancer of muscle. Additional experiments identified the preclinical efficacy of combination olaparib PARP inhibitor and temozolomide DNA-damaging agent as an effective therapy for rhabdomyosarcoma and visualized therapeutic responses using a four-color FUCCI cell-cycle fluorescent reporter. These experiments identified that combination treatment arrested rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the G2 cell cycle prior to induction of apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2941652504,"Prolonged behavioral challenges can cause animals to switch from active to passive coping strategies to manage effort-expenditure during stress; such normally adaptive behavioral state transitions can become maladaptive in psychiatric disorders such as depression. The underlying neuronal dynamics and brainwide interactions important for passive coping have remained unclear. Here, we develop a paradigm to study these behavioral state transitions at cellular-resolution across the entire vertebrate brain. Using brainwide imaging in zebrafish, we observed that the transition to passive coping is manifested by progressive activation of neurons in the ventral (lateral) habenula. Activation of these ventral-habenula neurons suppressed downstream neurons in the serotonergic raphe nucleus and caused behavioral passivity, whereas inhibition of these neurons prevented passivity. Data-driven recurrent neural network modeling pointed to altered intra-habenula interactions as a contributory mechanism. These results demonstrate ongoing encoding of experience features in the habenula, which guides recruitment of downstream networks and imposes a passive coping behavioral strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2942136138,"Hyperexcitability of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to drive aversion associated with chronic neuropathic pain. Here, we studied the contribution of input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to ACC, using sciatic nerve injury and chemotherapy-induced mouse models of neuropathic pain. Activating MD inputs elicited pain-related aversion in both models. Unexpectedly, excitatory responses of layer V ACC neurons to MD inputs were significantly weaker in pain models compared to controls. This caused the ratio between excitation and feedforward inhibition elicited by MD input to shift toward inhibition, specifically for subcortically projecting (SC) layer V neurons. Furthermore, direct inhibition of SC neurons reproduced the pain-related aversion elicited by activating MD inputs. Finally, both the ability to elicit pain-related aversion and the decrease in excitation were specific to MD inputs; activating basolateral amygdala inputs produced opposite effects. Thus, chronic pain-related aversion may reflect activity changes in specific pathways, rather than generalized ACC hyperactivity."

In particular, the ESC pathway to differentiation in vitro provides an opportunity to dissect the progression of pluripotency from naive founder cells through to specification of germline and somatic lineage progenitors.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Other pathways and factors identified in the screens have also been shown to reduce expression or function of components of the naive GRN, although to a lesser extent than TCF3. Strikingly, the majority of these components are present in naive ESCs but are ineffective in 2i (Kalkan and Smith, 2014Kalkan T. Smith A.

The pre-existence of multi-layered dissolution machinery means that mouse ESCs are poised for rapid disabling of the naive network. Multiple effectors also explain why single-factor mutants only delay and do not prevent transition. However, although elimination of naive factors is necessary for departure from the ESC state, it may not be sufficient for installation of an alternative GRN, which requires new transcription factor expression and enhancer reconfiguration (Buecker et al., 2014Buecker C.

Here, we sought to characterize drivers of the naive to formative transition that might act in parallel with TCF3 and examine whether genetic deletions might replace 2i and maintain naive ESC self-renewal. To identify factors that may mediate the effect of ERK pathway inhibition in driving pluripotency network transition, we inspected results from loss-of-function screens. Among transcription factors, we noted that Etv5 is the most recurrent hit after Tcf3 in a random mutagenesis screen (Leeb et al., 2014Leeb M. Dietmann S. Paramor M. Niwa H. Smith A.

ETV5 is a member of the PEA3 sub-family of ETS transcription factors, along with Etv1 and Etv4 (Hollenhorst et al., 2011bHollenhorst P.C. McIntosh L.P. Graves B.J.

ETV5 and other ETS factors are typically activated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-ERK signaling through transcriptional upregulation and/or protein phosphorylation (Janknecht et al., 1996Janknecht R.

ETV5 is considered to be functionally redundant with ETV4, and the two factors are co-expressed in multiple tissues in response to FGF (Liu et al., 2003Liu Y. Jiang H. Crawford H.C. Hogan B.L.

Genet. 2009; 41: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Etv5 transcripts are readily detected in ground state ESCs (Figure 1A). In contrast, Etv4 mRNA is not evident in 2i but is rapidly upregulated in transitioning cells. Transcripts for both factors are detected in mouse naive (embryonic day 4.5 [E4.5]) and formative (E5.5) epiblast, with ETV5 being more abundant (Figure 1B). Etv1 expression is negligible in ESCs and the early embryo. We examined in closer detail the behavior of Etv5 and Etv4 in ESCs upon transfer from 2i to N2B27. Ribosome profiling indicated potential for a truncated ETV5 protein isoform (ΔN-Etv5) lacking the first 202 amino acids (Ingolia et al., 2011Ingolia N.T. Lareau L.F. Weissman J.S.

Two functionally distinct domains responsible for transactivation by the Ets family member ERM.Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1325-1336PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we designed alternative qRT-PCR primer pairs. We detected the ETS domain, but not the N-TAD encoding sequence, in undifferentiated ESCs, indicating expression of ΔN-ETV5 only. In contrast, N-TAD-containing transcripts appear within 4 h after 2i withdrawal and persist for 48 h (Figure 1C). Total Etv5 transcripts increase initially but decline from 24 h, implying downregulation of ΔN-ETV5. Etv4 expression also rises rapidly on removal of 2i and then reduces. We investigated steady-state Etv4/5 expression in ESCs maintained with single inhibitors and LIF (Figure 1D). Both canonical Etv5 and Etv4 mRNA are upregulated in conditions when ERK signaling is active. Inspection of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data substantiated activity of an internal Etv5 promoter in undifferentiated ESCs, whereas transcripts originating from the upstream start site are evident after 2i withdrawal (Figure S1A). Immunoblotting identified a smaller ΔN-Etv5 protein (Figures 1E and S1B) that decreased from 24 h of transition. Conversely, the canonical isoform was absent from undifferentiated cells and upregulated over the transition time course. Single-inhibitor withdrawal showed that canonical Etv5 is expressed in response to MEK and ERK activation. siRNA-mediated knockdown confirmed the specificity of immunoblotting (Figure S1B). Due to the proposed redundancy between Etv5 and Etv4, we first sourced ESCs genetically deficient for both genes (E4/5-double knockout [dKO]; Lu et al., 2009Lu B.C. Cebrian C. Chi X. Kuure S. Kuo R. Bates C.M. Arber S. Hassell J. MacNeil L. Hoshi M. et al.Etv4 and Etv5 are required downstream of GDNF and Ret for kidney branching morphogenesis.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These cells were derived in serum and LIF and reported to show reduced proliferation (Akagi et al., 2015Akagi T. Kuure S. Uranishi K. Koide H. Costantini F. Yokota T. ETS-related transcription factors ETV4 and ETV5 are involved in proliferation and induction of differentiation-associated genes in embryonic stem (ES) cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 22460-22473Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This phenotype is exacerbated in 2i/LIF (Figure S1C). However, we found that the mutant cells could be expanded robustly by omitting the MEK inhibitor and culturing in CH/LIF (Figure S1C). We therefore maintained E4/5-dKO cells in CH/LIF, but for consistency with previous studies (Kalkan et al., 2017Kalkan T. Olova N. Roode M. Mulas C. Lee H.J. Nett I. Marks H. Walker R. Stunnenberg H.G.

Kalkan T. Smith A. NODAL secures pluripotency upon embryonic stem cell progression from the ground state.Stem Cell Reports. 2017; 9: 77-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), cells were exchanged into 2i prior to assay. A short period of 2i culture has no apparent effect on growth rate or viability (Figure S1C). The assay entails withdrawal of 2i for 48 h before replating at clonal density in CH/LIF (Figure 1F). Self-renewal capacity is almost entirely extinguished in parental ESC by 48 h. In contrast, E4/5-dKO cells still generate numerous undifferentiated colonies (Figure 1G). This phenotype is eliminated upon expression of cDNA encoding either isoform of ETV5 (Figure 1G), both of which also rescue the growth defect during self-renewal (Figure S1C). To discriminate functions of Etv4 and Etv5, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to create single and double knockouts. We used RGd2 ESCs that carry the Rex1::GFPd2 knockin reporter of naive status (Kalkan et al., 2017Kalkan T. Olova N. Roode M. Mulas C. Lee H.J. Nett I. Marks H. Walker R. Stunnenberg H.G. Lilley K.S. et al.Tracking the embryonic stem cell transition from ground state pluripotency.Development. 2017; 144: 1221-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Etv5-KO ESCs also show reduced expansion in 2i or 2i/LIF but proliferate normally in CH/LIF (Figure S1D). These results indicate that Etv5 plays a specific role in consolidating naive ESC propagation when ERK signaling is blocked and Etv4 is not expressed. We expanded cells in CH/LIF and transferred into 2i before assay, as above. Etv4 mutants show no significant delay in GFP downregulation (Figure 1H) or extinction of clonogenicity (Figure 1I). In contrast, deletion of Etv5 results in impaired exit from naive pluripotency, measured by perdurance of GFP and persistence of clonogenic cells. Normal GFP downregulation was restored by expressing either Etv5 isoform (Figure S1E). In Etv5 mutants, Etv4 is activated later but to an enhanced level (Figure S1F). However, the Etv5-KO phenotype is not enhanced in E4/5-dKO ESCs (Figure 1H), confirming that Etv4 has little relevance for kinetics of transition from 2i. These results establish that Etv5 supports ESC self-renewal when ERK signaling is inhibited and facilitates exit from naive pluripotency when ERK is active. Although canonical Etv5 is specifically upregulated prior to exit, either isoform can be sufficient for both functions. Tcf3 is upregulated in Etv5-KO ESCs, indicating that the phenotypes are independent (Figures S2A and S2B). As Tcf3 is downstream of GSK3 and ETV5 is regulated by ERK1/2, we tested whether combined deletion of both genes might mimic the effect of 2i and be sufficient to sustain ESC self-renewal. We generated Etv5/Tcf3 single and double mutants in RGd2 ESCs and compared GFP profiles after transfer into N2B27 (Figure 1J). In ET-dKO cells, perdurance of GFP was more pronounced. However, at the end of passage 2, ET-dKO cells showed a substantial fraction of GFP low or negative cells, and undifferentiated ESCs were not sustained after replating (Figure 1J). Thus, TCF3 and ETV5 act combinatorially to drive pluripotency progression, but the absence of both is not sufficient to prevent loss of ESC identity. We re-inspected the candidate regulators to identify a factor that might complement ETV5 and TCF3 to enforce exit from naive pluripotency. The repressor RBPJ was detected in a haploid ESC mutagenesis screen (Leeb et al., 2014Leeb M. Dietmann S. Paramor M. Niwa H. Smith A. Genetic exploration of the exit from self-renewal using haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). RBPJ is expressed in the naive epiblast in the embryo (Figure S2C). RBPJ is nuclear localized in ESCs (Figure 2A), and RBPJ mRNA and protein are upregulated upon 2i withdrawal, a response that is enhanced in Etv5-KO and Tcf3-KO cells (Figures S2D–S2F). RBPJ is therefore a candidate complementary regulator, regulated by both ERK and GSK3, and acting through uncharacterized targets. We inactivated Rbpj in RGd2 ESCs using CRISPR/Cas9. Rbpj-deficient ESCs adopted a more flattened colony morphology but showed no markers of differentiation (Figure S2G) and growth in 2i remained similar to parental ESCs (Figure S2H). Upon withdrawal from 2i, Rbpj-KO cells exhibit delayed downregulation of Rex1-GFPd2 and persistence of clonogenic ESCs at 42 h, consistent with siRNA results (Leeb et al., 2014Leeb M. Dietmann S. Paramor M. Niwa H. Smith A. Genetic exploration of the exit from self-renewal using haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar; Figures 2B and 2C). Rex1 downregulation timing is restored upon expression of an Rbpj transgene, which also rescues domed colony morphology (Figures S2G and S2I). RBPJ is best known for a role in the NOTCH pathway in which activated NOTCH intracellular domain induces a switch from repression to activation of target genes (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009Kopan R. Ilagan M.X.G. The canonical Notch signaling pathway: unfolding the activation mechanism.Cell. 2009; 137: 216-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). However, RBPJ can also regulate genes independently of NOTCH (Castel et al., 2013Castel D. Mourikis P. Bartels S.J. Brinkman A.B. Tajbakhsh S. Stunnenberg H.G. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Johnson and Macdonald, 2011Johnson J.E. Macdonald R.J. Notch-independent functions of CSL.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2011; 97: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Absence of most known NOTCH transcriptional targets (Figure S2J), despite detectable expression of NOTCH ligands and pathway components (Figure S2K), suggests that the NOTCH pathway may not be significant during naive ESC transition. Nonetheless, to test whether NOTCH might be relevant to exit dynamics, we employed γ-secretase inhibitors to block production of NOTCH intracellular domain. We did not observe any effect on Rex1-GFP downregulation (Figure S2L). Thus, RBPJ may act purely as a repressor during naive state exit. By RNA-seq, we found 405 upregulated and 705 downregulated genes in Rbpj-KO ESCs in 2i (p adj. ≤ 0.05; fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads [FPKM] ≥ 1; Table S1), with functions in multiple processes (Figures S3A and S3D). Because Rbpj deletion did not affect ESC self-renewal (Figure S2H), we focused on differential expression during transition. At 16 h after 2i withdrawal (N16h), 2,341 genes were up- and 355 downregulated (Table S1). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis shows enrichment in both 2i and N16h for cell adhesion, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions (Figures S3A and S3B), reflected in expression of laminins, integrins, collagens, and cadherins (Figure S3C). This is in line with observations in Rbpj mutan"
https://openalex.org/W2943562300,"Introduction Neutrophils can generate extracellular net-like structures by releasing their DNA–histone complexes and antimicrobial peptides, which is called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Various stimuli can induce NET formation. In particular, neutrophils and NET formation are abundant in tumor tissue. This study investigated how cancer cells induce NET formation and whether this NET formation promotes plasma thrombin generation and cancer progression. Methods Induction of NET formation by a pancreatic cancer cell line (AsPC-1) was assessed by measuring the histone–DNA complex level. The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was measured by thrombin generation assay. In vitro migration, invasion, and tubule formation assays were performed. The circulating levels of NET markers and hypercoagulability markers were assessed in 62 patients with pancreatobiliary malignancy and 30 healthy controls. Results AsPC-1 significantly induced NET formation in a dose-dependent manner. Conditioned medium (CM) from AsPC-1 also induced NETs. Interestingly, NET-formation was abolished by heat-inactivated CM, but not by lipid-extracted CM, suggesting an important role of protein components. A reactive oxygen species inhibitor did not inhibit cancer cell–induced NET formation, but prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, cyclic adenosine monophosphate inducer) and antithrombin did. NETs significantly increased ETP of normal plasma. Of note, NETs promoted cancer cell migration and invasion as well as angiogenesis, which were inhibited by histone-binding agents (heparin, polysialic acid), a DNA-degrading enzyme, and Toll-like receptor neutralizing antibodies. In patients with pancreatobiliary malignancy, elevated NET markers correlated well with hypercoagulability makers. Conclusion Our findings indicate that cancer cell–induced NET formation enhances both hypercoagulability and cancer progression and suggest that inhibitors of NET formation such as PGE1 and antithrombin can be potential therapeutics to reduce both hypercoagulability and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2941023745,"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a devastating, multisystemic disorder caused by recessive mutations in the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). FXN participates in the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters and is considered to be essential for viability. Here we report that when grown in 1% ambient O2, FXN null yeast, human cells, and nematodes are fully viable. In human cells, hypoxia restores steady-state levels of Fe-S clusters and normalizes ATF4, NRF2, and IRP2 signaling events associated with FRDA. Cellular studies and in vitro reconstitution indicate that hypoxia acts through HIF-independent mechanisms that increase bioavailable iron as well as directly activate Fe-S synthesis. In a mouse model of FRDA, breathing 11% O2 attenuates the progression of ataxia, whereas breathing 55% O2 hastens it. Our work identifies oxygen as a key environmental variable in the pathogenesis associated with FXN depletion, with important mechanistic and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2941030182,"The perioculomotor (pIII) region of the midbrain was postulated as a sleep-regulating center in the 1890s but largely neglected in subsequent studies. Using activity-dependent labeling and gene expression profiling, we identified pIII neurons that promote non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Optrode recording showed that pIII glutamatergic neurons expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide alpha (CALCA) are NREM-sleep active; optogenetic and chemogenetic activation/inactivation showed that they strongly promote NREM sleep. Within the pIII region, CALCA neurons form reciprocal connections with another population of glutamatergic neurons that express the peptide cholecystokinin (CCK). Activation of CCK neurons also promoted NREM sleep. Both CALCA and CCK neurons project rostrally to the preoptic hypothalamus, whereas CALCA neurons also project caudally to the posterior ventromedial medulla. Activation of each projection increased NREM sleep. Together, these findings point to the pIII region as an excitatory sleep center where different subsets of glutamatergic neurons promote NREM sleep through both local reciprocal connections and long-range projections."
https://openalex.org/W2940587549,"Neocortical circuits consist of stereotypical motifs that must self-assemble during development. Recent evidence suggests that the subtype identity of both excitatory projection neurons (PNs) and inhibitory interneurons (INs) is important for this process. We knocked out the transcription factor Satb2 in PNs to induce those of the intratelencephalic (IT) type to adopt a pyramidal tract (PT)-type identity. Loss of IT-type PNs selectively disrupted the lamination and circuit integration of INs derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE). Strikingly, reprogrammed PNs demonstrated reduced synaptic targeting of CGE-derived INs relative to controls. In control mice, IT-type PNs targeted neighboring CGE INs, while PT-type PNs did not in deep layers, confirming this lineage-dependent motif. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that major CGE IN subtypes were conserved after loss of IT PNs, but with differential transcription of synaptic proteins and signaling molecules. Thus, IT-type PNs influence CGE-derived INs in a non-cell-autonomous manner during cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2941701972,"ZIP14 (encoded by the solute carrier 39 family member 14 (SLC39A14) gene) is a manganese transporter that is abundantly expressed in the liver and small intestine. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC39A14 cause severe hypermanganesemia. Because the liver is regarded as the main regulatory organ involved in manganese homeostasis, impaired hepatic manganese uptake for subsequent biliary excretion has been proposed as the underlying disease mechanism. However, liver-specific Zip14 KO mice exhibit decreased manganese only in the liver and do not develop manganese accumulation in other tissues under normal conditions. This suggests that impaired hepatobiliary excretion is not the primary cause for manganese overload observed in individuals lacking functional ZIP14. We therefore hypothesized that increased intestinal manganese absorption could induce manganese hyperaccumulation when ZIP14 is inactivated. To elucidate the role of ZIP14 in manganese absorption, here we used CaCo-2 Transwell cultures as a model system for intestinal epithelia. The generation of a ZIP14-deficient CaCo-2 cell line enabled the identification of ZIP14 as the major transporter mediating basolateral manganese uptake in enterocytes. Lack of ZIP14 severely impaired basolateral-to-apical (secretory) manganese transport and strongly enhanced manganese transport in the apical-to-basolateral (absorptive) direction. Mechanistic studies provided evidence that ZIP14 restricts manganese transport in the absorptive direction via direct basolateral reuptake of freshly absorbed manganese. In support of such function of intestinal ZIP14 in vivo, manganese levels in the livers and brains of intestine-specific Zip14 KO mice were significantly elevated. Our findings highlight the importance of intestinal ZIP14 in regulating systemic manganese homeostasis."

While some rare diseases are 100% genetically determined, for most common ones, the genetic contribution is minor and environmental factors play an important role. In obesity, for example, only ∼6% of the phenotypic variance can be explained by the associated genetic variance (Speliotes et al., 2010Speliotes E.K. Willer C.J. Berndt S.I. Monda K.L. Thorleifsson G. Jackson A.U. Lango Allen H. Lindgren C.M. Luan J.

Genet. 2010; 42: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The identification of functional traits in proteotypes therefore holds great promise to provide disease-associated fingerprints in individuals because such traits should be a molecular reflection of not only genetic but also environmental factors (e.g., life style). If environmental factors can be disentangled from genetic ones, such fingerprints might even provide a basis for personalized treatments. Establishing such connections from genetic or environmental factors to the individual proteotype remains challenging, however. This is due to technical limitations, in particular the variable experimental noise across studies, but also biological buffering mechanisms (Stefely et al., 2016Stefely J.A. Kwiecien N.W.

Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the modular architecture of the proteome (i.e., its organization into complexes, pathways, and subcellular structures) provides powerful means to overcome these issues by interpreting observed variations in the context of well-established biological functions (Stefely et al., 2016Stefely J.A.

Although each study highlighted individual proteins or functional modules that were found to be variable, a systematic and unbiased analysis of functional modules across multiple studies is lacking. It remains unknown if alterations of specific cellular functions are prevalent and at which organizational level such alterations manifest (e.g., complexes, pathways, organelles). Furthermore, the extent to which the proteome of individuals is variable, and how this variability is linked to environmental or genetic factors remains difficult to estimate. A case in point is the lack of stratification of male and female organisms at the proteotype level. Various studies have reported protein abundance variation due to the genetic sex of an organism, but focus only on chromosome X/Y-specific protein expression rather than on the systemic differences in the overall proteotypic patterns (Wu et al., 2013Wu L.

Exploring gender differences of the proteome is pivotal for our understanding of clinical phenotypes that are often sexually dimorphic (Naugler et al., 2007Naugler W.E. Sakurai T. Kim S. Maeda S.

Here, we analyze 11 public datasets to investigate proteotypes of healthy and diseased individuals from human and mice. The proteotype of an individual describes, more generally, the state of a proteome (i.e., protein abundances, connectivity, turnover, and localization) in conjunction with the presence and state of posttranslational modifications. It differs from cell type to cell type (Geiger et al., 2012Geiger T. Wehner A. Schaab C. Cox J. Mann M.

Ori A. What have we learned on aging from omics studies?.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 70: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The 11 datasets, however, only describe protein abundances and source information (a given cell line or tissue). Therefore, we use an operational definition of the proteotype that is restricted to protein abundances. For each dataset, we test to what extent it recovers known functional modules and assess the contribution of these modules to proteotype variation and their association with genetic and environmental factors. Our unbiased analysis reveals that protein complex abundance and stoichiometry are the major determinants of an individual’s proteome, while proteins in other functional modules, such as molecular pathways, co-vary less often across individuals. Within protein complexes, the consistently co-varying dynamic components can be associated with both genetic and environmental factors. We demonstrate that sex as a genetic factor explains the largest fraction of the observed variability in protein complexes but also find functional modules that are impacted by diet, an environmental factor. As both examples alone already have considerable effect sizes, our study implies that protein functional module variation might serve as a molecular fingerprint of a wide range of environmental and genetic factors, which might be tunable toward desired proteotypes (e.g., by individualized diets) (Zeevi et al., 2015Zeevi D. Korem T. Zmora N. Israeli D. Rothschild D. Weinberger A. Ben-Yacov O. Lador D. Avnit-Sagi T. Lotan-Pompan M. et al.Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.Cell. 2015; 163: 1079-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Proteins are not functioning alone, but are organized into functional modules and networks, spanning from complexes to pathways and entire organelles. In order to understand which features or levels of organization define the proteome state of individuals, we tested to what extent known functional modules or protein associations can be recovered in different proteomics datasets. Implicitly, we thereby tested the power of each dataset and ensured consistent results. We examined datasets resulting from profiling proteins across cancer patients (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] panels: Ovarian Cancer, Zhang et al., 2016Zhang H. Liu T. Zhang Z. Payne S.H. Zhang B.

If available, we included transcriptional data as well as data derived from ribosome profiling to reveal the impact of transcriptional and translational regulation. We assessed the power of each dataset for discovering functional modules by calculating the level of observed co-abundance for known protein-protein interactions utilizing the STRING v10.5 resource (Szklarczyk et al., 2017Szklarczyk D.

As expected, throughout all datasets, we recovered pairs of proteins connected by high-confidence interactions (STRING combined score >700) to be more co-abundant across conditions or individuals than protein pairs with no known interactions (see STAR Methods). To further dissect the functional relevance of co-abundant protein sets, we added contextual information about chromosomal location, housekeeping roles (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013Eisenberg E. Levanon E.Y. Human housekeeping genes, revisited.Trends Genet. 2013; 29: 569-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), cellular compartment (Human Protein Atlas) (Uhlén et al., 2015Uhlén M.

The latter were derived from a manually curated list of 279 largely non-overlapping protein complexes as defined by Ori et al., 2016Ori A. Iskar M. Buczak K. Kastritis P. Parca L. Andrés-Pons A. Singer S. Bork P. Beck M. Spatiotemporal variation of mammalian protein complex stoichiometries.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. For each category of contextual information, we assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves whether the respective dataset reliably recovered known functional entities, based solely on the co-abundance or co-expression metric. This approach implicitly allows a dual assessment of (1) the overall power of each dataset based on the amount of co-abundance, and (2) an unbiased assessment of the type of functional module yielding the highest level of co-abundance across datasets. With regard to (1), we observed datasets derived from tissue samples to be noisier when compared to cell lines, probably due to the mixture of different cell types within a tissue. Proteomics datasets tended to more clearly recover functional modules as compared to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or ribosome profiling datasets (average p = 3.73 × 10−5, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test), in line with previous work suggesting an important role of post-translational mechanisms in shaping protein complex abundance and stoichiometry across cell types (Ori et al., 2016Ori A.

https://openalex.org/W2940901182,"Following fertilization, totipotent cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions, resulting in three distinct cell types in the late pre-implantation blastocyst: epiblast (Epi), primitive endoderm (PrE), and trophectoderm (TE). Here, we aim to understand whether these three cell types can be induced from fibroblasts by one combination of transcription factors. By utilizing a sophisticated fluorescent knockin reporter system, we identified a combination of five transcription factors, Gata3, Eomes, Tfap2c, Myc, and Esrrb, that can reprogram fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs), and induced extraembryonic endoderm stem cells (iXENs), concomitantly. In-depth transcriptomic, chromatin, and epigenetic analyses provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the reprogramming process toward the three cell types. Mechanistically, we show that the interplay between Esrrb and Eomes during the reprogramming process determines cell fate, where high levels of Esrrb induce a XEN-like state that drives pluripotency and high levels of Eomes drive trophectodermal fate."
https://openalex.org/W2942746651,"The clinical use of the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (Dox) is limited by cardiotoxic side-effects. One of the early Dox effects is induction of a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak. The chaperone Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is important for Ca2+ homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)—the organelle corresponding to the SR in non-cardiomyocytes—and has been shown to convey resistance to Dox in certain tumors. Our aim was to investigate the effect of cardiac GRP78 gene transfer on Ca2+ dependent signaling, cell death, cardiac function and survival in clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo models for Dox cardiotoxicity.By using neonatal cardiomyocytes we could demonstrate that Dox induced Ca2+ dependent Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation is one of the factors involved in Dox cardiotoxicity by promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated GRP78 overexpression partly protects neonatal cardiomyocytes from Dox induced cell death by modulating Ca2+ dependent pathways like the activation of CaMKII, phospholamban (PLN) and p53 accumulation. Most importantly, cardiac GRP78 gene therapy in mice treated with Dox revealed improved diastolic function (dP/dtmin) and survival after Dox treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that Ca2+ dependent CaMKII activation fosters Dox cardiomyopathy and provide additional insight into possible mechanisms by which GRP78 overexpression protects cardiomyocytes from Doxorubicin toxicity."

Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is a cancer type in which p53 status is correlated with prognosis, and TP53 mutations are a frequent genetic modification. Here we aimed to evaluate the expression patterns of different p53 isoforms and their contributions to the formation and subcellular localization of p53 amyloid aggregates in both EC and endometrial nontumor cell lines. We found that full-length (fl) p53 and a truncated p53 isoform, Δ40p53, resulting from alternative splicing of exon 2 or alternative initiation of translation at ATG-40, are the predominantly expressed p53 variants in EC cells. However, Δ40p53 was the major p53 isoform in endometrial nontumor cells. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Δ40p53 is mainly localized to cytoplasmic punctate structures of EC cells, resembling solid-phase structures similar to those found in neurodegenerative pathologies. Using light-scattering kinetics, CD, and transmission EM, we noted that the p53 N-terminal transactivation domain significantly reduces aggregation of the WT p53 DNA-binding domain, confirming the higher aggregation tendency of Δ40p53, which lacks this domain. This is the first report of cytoplasmic Δ40p53 in EC cells being a major component of amyloid aggregates. The differential aggregation properties of p53 isoforms in EC cells may open up new avenues in the development of therapeutic strategies that preferentially target specific p53 isoforms to prevent p53 amyloid aggregate formation.

https://openalex.org/W2942774065,"The hemodialysis regimen is an inevitable and mandatory treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). During the dialysis journey, patients may experience maladaptation in terms of sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Psychosocial resources such as social support may have beneficial influences on health outcomes, but studies have rarely analyzed the integrated relationships among risk factors which include pain, sleep disturbances, duration since diagnosis and various health outcomes in Taiwan. This study aimed to bridge this gap by investigating the relationships among related risk factors, social support, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and HRQOL, which is composed of physical quality of life (PQOL) and mental quality of life (MQOL), in ESRD patients.A correlational design was used, and 178 patients aged 20 years or older were recruited via convenience sample. The relationships among the risk factors, the mediators, depressive symptoms, PQOL, and MQOL were analyzed using structural equation modeling.The findings showed that more than 70% of the participants reported poor sleep quality, and 32% reported depressive symptoms. When participants had greater pain and more sleep disorders, they were more likely to be depressed. When participants had more appraisal support; they had better PQOL and fewer depressive symptoms. Overall, the structural equation model explained 31.8% of the variance in self-reported depressive symptoms, 29.4% of the variance in PQOL, and 5.7% of the variance in MQOL. Moreover, appraisal support enhanced PQOL and reduced depressive symptoms by exerting its two mediating effects on sleep disturbances.Our findings indicate that patients with ESRD who have more social support have better PQOL and MQOL and fewer depressive symptoms than those with less social support."
https://openalex.org/W2942534170,"Objective Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are common benign tumors of the myometrium but their molecular pathobiology remains elusive. These stiff and often large tumors contain abundant extracellular matrix (ECM), including large amounts of collagen, and can lead to significant morbidities. After observing structural multiformities of uterine fibroids, we aimed to explore this heterogeneity by focusing on collagen and tissue stiffness. Methods For 19 fibroids, ranging in size from 3 to 11 centimeters, from eight women we documented gross appearance and evaluated collagen content by Masson trichrome staining. Collagen types were determined in additional samples by serial extraction and gel electrophoresis. Biomechanical stiffness was evaluated by rheometry. Results Fibroid slices displayed different gross morphology and some fibroids had characteristics of two or more patterns: classical whorled (n = 8); nodular (n = 9); interweaving trabecular (n = 9); other (n = 1). All examined fibroids contained at least 37% collagen. Tested samples included type I, III, and V collagen of different proportions. Fibroid stiffness was not correlated with the overall collagen content (correlation coefficient 0.22). Neither stiffness nor collagen content was correlated with fibroid size. Stiffness among fibroids ranged from 3028 to 14180 Pa (CV 36.7%; p<0.001, one-way ANOVA). Stiffness within individual fibroids was also not uniform and variability ranged from CV 1.6 to 42.9%. Conclusions The observed heterogeneity in structure, collagen content, and stiffness highlights that fibroid regions differ in architectural status. These differences might be associated with variations in local pressure, biomechanical signaling, and altered growth. We conclude the design of all fibroid studies should account for such heterogeneity because samples from different regions have different characteristics. Our understanding of fibroid pathophysiology will greatly increase through the investigation of the complexity of the chemical and biochemical signaling in fibroid development, the correlation of collagen content and mechanical properties in uterine fibroids, and the mechanical forces involved in fibroid development as affected by the various components of the ECM."

Recently an EQ-5D valuation study was conducted for Trinidad and Tobago, but thus far there have been no population norms published for Trinidad and Tobago or for any Caribbean country. The objective of this study is to provide a set of population norms, and to investigate inequalities in health in Trinidad and Tobago. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was included in the 2012/2013 Adult Population Survey of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor for Trinidad and Tobago. This survey covered a representative sample of 2,036 adults aged 18 and over. Demographic data and self-reported health using EQ-5D-5L were collected. The Trinidad and Tobago value set was used to obtain EQ-5D index values. The Kakwani index and logistic regression models were used to evaluate inequalities in health. Mean EQ-5D index values and EQ-VAS values were calculated by age group, ethnicity, gender, income, educational attainment, employment status and place of residence. The 10 most commonly observed EQ-5D-5L states accounted for 90% of the respondents. The mean VAS value for the sample was 83.6 and the mean EQ-5D-5L index value was 0.95. Pain/discomfort was found to be the EQ-5D dimension with the highest prevalence of reported problems with 22% of the population reporting pain at any level. Self-care was the dimension with the lowest prevalence of problems reported at any level (3%). Health declines with increasing age, and men reported fewer problems and higher levels of self-reported health than women. Age, gender and education level were found to be important drivers of health status as measured by the EQ-5D instrument. Being in a very low income group was also observed to affect EQ-VAS values among younger respondents. The population norms provided in this study can be used by clinicians, academics and policy makers in several ways. They can be used in comparing different demographic groups or patient groups, or as a basis for tracking the progress of patients through a treatment regimen. They can also provide a baseline for cost utility analysis of health interventions for Trinidad and Tobago."

We investigated whether maternal circadian disruption, using night shift work as a proxy, is associated with variations in DNA methylation patterns of placental tissue in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of night shift work. Here, we compared cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide (CpG) specific methylation genome-wide of placental tissue (measured with the Illumina 450K array) from participants (n = 237) in the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS) who did (n = 53) and did not (n = 184) report working the night shift, using robust linear modeling and adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy smoking, infant sex, maternal adversity, and putative cell mixture. Statistical analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons and results presented with Bonferroni or Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) adjustment for false discovery rate. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation in placental tissue, including CpG sites in the genes NAV1, SMPD1, TAPBP, CLEC16A, DIP2C, FAM172A, and PLEKHG6 (Bonferroni-adjusted p<0.05). CpG sites within NAV1, MXRA8, GABRG1, PRDM16, WNT5A, and FOXG1 exhibited the most hypomethylation, while CpG sites within TDO2, ADAMTSL3, DLX2, and SERPINA1 exhibited the most hypermethylation (BH q<0.10). Functional analysis indicated GO-terms associated with cell-cell adhesion and enriched GWAS results for psoriasis. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation of the placenta, which may have implications for fetal health and development. This is the first study to examine the epigenetic impacts of night shift exposure, as a proxy for circadian disruption, on placental methylation in humans, and, while results should be interpreted with caution, suggests circadian disruption may have epigenetic impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2942141976,"Regional anticoagulation with citrate during renal replacement therapy (RRT) reduces the risk of bleeding, extends dialyzer lifespan and is cost-effective. Therefore, current guidelines recommend its use if patients are not anticoagulated for another reason and if there are no contraindications against citrate. RRT with regional citrate anticoagulation has been established in critically ill patients as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) to reduce citrate load. However, CVVHD is inferior regarding middle molecule clearance compared to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The use of a high cut-off dialyzer in CVVHD may thus present an option for middle molecule clearance similar to CVVH. This may allow combining the advantages of both techniques.In this prospective, randomized, single-blinded single-center-trial, sixty patients with acute renal failure and established indication for renal replacement therapy were randomized 1:1 into two groups. The control group was put on CVVHD using regional citrate anticoagulation and a high-flux dialyzer, while the intervention group was on CVVHD using regional citrate anticoagulation and a high-cut-off dialyzer. The concentrations of urea, creatinine, β2-microglobulin, myoglobin, interleukin 6 and albumin were measured pre- and post-dialyzer 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after initiating CVVHD.Mean plasma clearance for β2-microglobulin was 19.6±5.8 ml/min in the intervention group vs. 12.2±3.6 ml/min in the control group (p<0.001). For myoglobin (8.0±4.5 ml/min vs. 0.2±3.6 ml/min, p<0.001) and IL-6 (1.5±4.3 vs. -2.5±3.5 ml/min, p = 0.002) a higher mean plasma clearance using high-cut-off dialyzer could be detected too, but no difference for urea, creatinine and albumin could be observed concerning this parameter between the two groups.CVVHD using a high cut-off dialyzer results in more effective middle molecule clearance than that with high-flux dialyzer.German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00005254, registered 26th November 2013)."
https://openalex.org/W2942862165,"Purpose Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) is a diffusion MRI (dMRI) technique used to characterize tissue microstructure by compartmental modelling of neural water fractions. Intra-neurite, extra-neurite, and cerebral spinal fluid volume fractions are measured. The purpose of this study was to determine the reproducibility of NODDI in the rat brain at 9.4 Tesla. Methods Eight data sets were successfully acquired on adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Each rat was scanned twice on a 9.4T Agilent MRI with a 7 ± 1 day separation between scans. A multi-shell diffusion protocol was implemented consisting of 108 total directions varied over two shells (b-values of 1000 s/mm2 and 2000 s/mm2). Three techniques were used to analyze the NODDI scalar maps: mean region of interest (ROI) analysis, whole brain voxel-wise analysis, and targeted ROI analyses (voxel-wise within a given ROI). The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to assess the reproducibility of NODDI and provide insight into necessary sample sizes and minimum detectable effect size. Results CV maps for orientation dispersion index (ODI) and neurite density index (NDI) showed high reproducibility both between and within subjects. Furthermore, it was found that small biological changes (<5%) may be detected with feasible sample sizes (n < 6–10). In contrast, isotropic volume fraction (IsoVF) was found to have low reproducibility, requiring very large sample sizes (n > 50) for biological changes to be detected. Conclusions The ODI and NDI measured by NODDI in the rat brain at 9.4T are highly reproducible and may be sensitive to subtle changes in tissue microstructure."

As follow-up, we document natural ingestion of sea slugs by corals and investigate the role of sacoglossan sea slugs as possible prey items of scleractinian corals. Feeding trials were carried out using six sacoglossan species as prey, two each from the genera Costasiella, Elysia and Plakobranchus, and four free-living solitary corals (Danafungia scruposa, Fungia fungites, Pleuractis paumotensis and Heteropsammia cochlea) as predators. Trials were carried out under both in-situ and ex-situ conditions with the aim to observe ingestion and assess signs of prey consumption based on tissue loss of prey individuals over time. Significant differences were observed in both ingestion time and consumption state of prey between prey species, with three of them being ingested more rapidly and preferentially consumed over the others. Additionally, prey size was found to be a significant factor with larger prey (>12 mm) being ingested more slowly and rarely than smaller ones (<6 mm and 6–12 mm). Comparisons of consumption capability among predators showed no significant difference with all coral species showing similar preferences for prey species. While no specific mechanism of prey capture is proposed, we also document instances of kleptoparisitism and resuspension of prey items by wrasses. This study highlights the important distinction between opportunistic prey capture and true predation events."

As a post-translational modification, S6 kinase undergoes acetylation at the C terminus. The role of this acetylation to regulate kidney glomerular cell hypertrophy and matrix expansion is not known. In mesangial cells, high glucose decreased the acetylation and enhanced phosphorylation of S6 kinase and its substrates rps6 and eEF2 kinase that lead to dephosphorylation of eEF2. To determine the mechanism of S6 kinase deacetylation, we found that trichostatin A, a pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, blocked all high glucose–induced effects. Furthermore, high glucose increased the expression and association of HDAC1 with S6 kinase. HDAC1 decreased the acetylation of S6 kinase and mimicked the effects of high glucose, resulting in mesangial cell hypertrophy and expression of fibronectin and collagen I (α2). In contrast, siRNA against HDAC1 inhibited these effects by high glucose. A C-terminal acetylation-mimetic mutant of S6 kinase suppressed high glucose–stimulated phosphorylation of S6 kinase, rps6 and eEF2 kinase, and inhibited the dephosphorylation of eEF2. Also, the acetylation mimetic attenuated the mesangial cell hypertrophy and fibronectin and collagen I (α2) expression. Conversely, an S6 kinase acetylation-deficient mutant induced all the above effects of high glucose. Finally, in the renal glomeruli of diabetic rats, the acetylation of S6 kinase was significantly reduced concomitant with increased HDAC1 and S6 kinase activity.

It is difficult, however, to quantify the function of urban regions based on the varieties of human behavior. In this research, we developed a clustering method to help discover the specific functions that exist within urban regions. This method applies the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to classify regions' inflow and trip count characteristics. It regroups these urban regions using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) clustering method based on those typical characteristics. Using a large amount of vehicle trajectory data (approximately 1,500,000 data points) in the Chinese city of Chengdu, we demonstrate that the method can discriminate between urban functional regions, by comparing the proportion of surface objects within each region. This research shows that vehicle trajectory data in different functional urban regions possesses different time-series curves, while similar types of functional regions can be identified by these curves. Compared with remote sensing images and other statistical methods which can provide only static results, our research can provide a timely and effective approach to determine an urban region's functions."

Despite recommendations that central obesity assessment should be employed as a marker of metabolic health, there is no consensus regarding the protocol for measurement. The present study included 720 men aged 71 ± 8 years and 919 women aged 71 ± 7 years from a rural village. We examined the relationship between anthropometric indices {e.g., body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR)}, and MetS based on the modified criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III report in a cross-sectional (N = 1,639) and cohort (N = 377) data. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off value and best discriminatory value of each of these anthropometric indices to predict MetS. In the cross-sectional study, WHtR as well as BMI and WHpR showed significantly predictive abilities for MetS in both genders; and WHtR showed the strongest predictive ability for the presence of MetS. Also in the cohort study, WHtR as well as BMI and WHpR showed significantly predictive abilities for incident MetS in both genders, and in men WHtR showed the strongest predictive ability for incident MetS, but in women BMI showed the strongest predictive ability. In the cross-sectional study, the optimal WHtR cutoff values were 0.52 (sensitivity, 71.0%; specificity, 77.9%) for men and 0.53 (sensitivity, 79.8%; specificity, 75.7%) for women. In the cohort study, the optimal WHtR values were 0.50 (sensitivity, 60.7%; specificity, 73.2%) for men and 0.50 (sensitivity, 75.0%; specificity, 56.1%) for women. Increased WHtR was significantly and independently associated with prevalence of MetS in both genders. These results suggest that WHtR is a useful screening tool for determining metabolic risk in Japanese elderly community dwelling individuals."

By examining mouse livers, we have found that in the fasted state, the Mediator complex exists primarily as an approximately 1.2-MDa complex, consistent with the size of the large Mediator complex, whereas following feeding, it converts to an approximately 600-kDa complex, consistent with the size of the core Mediator complex. This dynamic change is due to the dissociation and degradation of the kinase module that includes the MED13, MED12, cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), and cyclin C (CCNC) subunits. The dissociation and degradation of the kinase module are dependent upon nutrient activation of mTORC1 that is necessary for the induction of lipogenic gene expression because pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mTORC1 in the fed state restores the kinase module. The degradation but not dissociation of the kinase module depends upon the E3 ligase, SCFFBW7. In addition, genetically insulin-resistant and obese db/db mice in the fasted state displayed elevated lipogenic gene expression and loss of the kinase module that was reversed following mTORC1 inhibition.

Recently, we reported that CDK8 and CCNC play an important role in the control of lipogenic gene expression through a nutrient-stimulated down-regulation in the liver (19Feng D. Youn D.Y. Zhao X. Gao Y. Quinn 3rd, W.J. Xiaoli A.M. Sun Y. Birnbaum M.J. Pessin J.E. Yang F. mTORC1 down-regulates cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and cyclin C (CycC).PLoS One. 2015; 10 (26042770)e0126240 10.1371/journal.pone.0126240PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the subunit assembly state of the whole Mediator complex is regulated under physiological or pathophysiological states. In this study, we now demonstrate that the subunit assembly state of the Mediator complex in mouse liver undergoes dynamic normal physiologic regulation through a mTORC1-dependent down-regulation of the entire kinase module to generate the small Mediator complex. In addition, the degradation of the kinase module, but not its dissociation from the large Mediator complex, depends upon the E3 ligase SCFFBW7. We have previously shown that the degradation of two subunits in the kinase module, CDK8, and its binding partner, CCNC, is triggered by nutrient signals in the liver (19Feng D. Youn D.Y. Zhao X. Gao Y. Quinn 3rd, W.J. Xiaoli A.M. Sun Y. Birnbaum M.J. Pessin J.E. Yang F. mTORC1 down-regulates cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and cyclin C (CycC).PLoS One. 2015; 10 (26042770)e0126240 10.1371/journal.pone.0126240PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether other subunits of the Mediator complex are also regulated by nutrient availability, we compared the protein levels of additional subunits of the Mediator complex in the livers between mice that were fasted overnight and those that were fed for 4 h following the overnight fast. As observed previously, equal amounts of liver nuclear extracts (normalized for the nuclear TATA-binding protein (TBP)) displayed reduced levels of CKD8 and CCNC in the fed state (Fig. 1A). Similarly, there was also a reduction in MED13 and MED12 proteins with little effect on the levels of the Mediator subunit MED1. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against MED1, which is present in both the small and large Mediator complexes (8Dotson M.R. Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Jiang Y.W. Li Y.

To confirm the specificity of kinase module subunit antibodies, here we show the immunoblots of liver-specific Ccnc knockout mice that display the expected decrease in CDK8 and CCNC protein without significant effect on MED13 or MED12 protein levels (Fig. S1A). In contrast, liver-specific knockout of Med13 knockout results in decreased protein levels of all four kinase module proteins MED13, MED12, CCNC, and CDK8 (Fig. S1B). The reduction in the protein levels of the kinase module subunits occurred without any significant change in the amounts of mRNAs encoding for the Mediator subunits (Fig. S2). To further confirm this apparent change in the Mediator subunit assembly state, we examined the size distribution of the Mediator complex by glycerol gradient fractionation. Based on the molecular size standards, the small Mediator complex (∼600 kDa) should be in fractions 12–15, whereas the large Mediator complex (∼1.2 MDa) should be in fractions 16–19 (Fig. 1B). In fasted state, it was apparent that all of the subunits were in the large Mediator form, as both the core subunit (MED25) and kinase module subunits were enriched in the later fractions that match with the size of the large Mediator complex (∼1.2 MDa) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the enrichment of all subunits was shifted to the left with the major distribution located in fractions 12–15 in the fed livers to the size close to the small Mediator complex or the kinase module alone (Fig. 1B). It is also important to note that the glycerol gradient fractionation analyses do not reflect the relative amounts of proteins present between fasting and feeding, but only the relative sizes of protein complexes that they are associated with, as greater amounts of nuclear extracts from fed livers were used, and the gel exposures were not identical in order to observe the less abundant kinase module subunits. To explore the role of mTORC1 signaling in the regulation of protein levels of the kinase module subunits, we first took a pharmacological approach by using the mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin. Mice were fasted, fed, or treated with rapamycin before induction of the fed state. As observed by others, rapamycin effectively blocked the feeding-induced activation of mTORC1 kinase activity, as demonstrated by the inhibition of S6K1 and S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). In addition, rapamycin blocked the induction of lipogenic gene expression in the fed state but has no significant effect on gluconeogenic gene expression levels (Fig. S3, A and B). In concert, the reduction in the kinase module subunits MED12, MED13, CDK8, and CCNC in the fed state was prevented when the mice were pretreated with rapamycin (Fig. 2A). To determine whether mTORC1 inhibition also prevents the feeding-induced formation of the small Mediator complex, we analyzed the liver nuclear extracts by glycerol gradient fractionation. Consistent with the data in Fig. 1, in the fasted state, the Mediator complex primarily resolved as the large Mediator complex (centered around ∼1.2 MDa), whereas in the fed state, it shifted to a smaller size consistent with the small Mediator complex (Fig. 2B). However, feeding of the rapamycin-treated mice prevented the formation of the small Mediator complex, as the Mediator complex mostly fractionated in the position of the large Mediator complex (Fig. 2B). The specificity of rapamycin for mTORC1 was verified by examining the phosphorylation of AKT, in which both Ser-473 and Thr-450 are thought to be mTORC2 target sites (20Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Phosphorylation and regulation of Akt/PKB by the rictor-mTOR complex.Science. 2005; 307 (15718470): 1098-110110.1126/science.1106148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5223) Google Scholar, 21Facchinetti V.

As expected, the phosphorylation of Thr-450 was unaffected by rapamycin, and both Ser-473 and Thr-308 were found to be further increased in the fed state following rapamycin pretreatment (Fig. 2C). These data confirm the specificity of rapamycin for mTORC1 and are also consistent with mTORC1 activation acting in a feedback pathway to reduce AKT activation (22Manning B.D. Balancing Akt with S6K: implications for both metabolic diseases and tumorigenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167 (15533996): 399-40310.1083/jcb.200408161Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of mTORC1 in the regulation of the Mediator complex, we generated hepatocyte-specific Raptor knockout mice via injecting AAV8-Tbg-Cre in the tail vein of Raptorfl/fl mice. RAPTOR is a critical component of mTORC1, and knockout of Raptor completely abolishes the mTORC1 pathway but not mTORC2 (23Guertin D.A. Stevens D.M. Thoreen C.C. Burds A.A. Kalaany N.Y. Moffat J.

These liver-specific Raptor knockout mice displayed a marked reduction of the S6K1 phosphorylation consistent with reduced mTORC1 activation along with prevention of the loss of the kinase module proteins in the fed state (Fig. 3A). Although Raptor deficiency did not affect the suppression of gluconeogenic genes in the fed state (Fig. 3B), there was a substantial reduction of lipogenic gene expression (Fig. 3C). In parallel, Raptor deficiency also blocked the conversion of the large Mediator complex to the small Mediator complex in the fed state (Fig. 3D). The effect of loss of function of mTORC1 activity by rapamycin and Raptor deficiency was further confirmed by analyses of mTORC1 gain of function using liver-specific Tsc1 knockout mice, in which the mTORC1 pathway is constitutively active. The constitutive activation of mTORC1 was confirmed by the increased levels of S6K1 phosphorylation in both the fasted and fed state in the Tsc1 knockout liver hepatocytes. As observed previously, control mice in the fed state had reduced MED13, MED12, CDK8, and CCNC protein levels compared with those in the fasted state (Fig. S4). In contrast, following Tsc1 deletion, the levels of these proteins were relatively low in the fasted state and refractory to any further change following feeding (Fig. S4). Previously, we reported that the livers of the insulin-resistant and obese db/db mice display elevated mTORC1 activation in the fasted state, and this was confirmed in Fig. 4A. Consistent with this fasted state activation of mTORC1, the Mediator kinase module subunits were reduced compared with the fasted control mice. Importantly, treatment with rapamycin to suppress mTORC1 activation resulted in a concomitant rescue of the kinase module proteins (Fig. 4A), suggesting that mTORC1 is the major driver for the loss of the kinase module. As expected, rapamycin treatment of the db/db mice also suppressed the abnormal elevation of lipogenic gene expression in the fasted state (Fig. 4B) with little effect on the key gluconeogenic gene Pck1 (Fig. 4C) but with a small reduction of G6pc mRNA by ∼50%. In any case, glycerol gradient fractionation demonstrated a large shift to smaller sizes of the Mediator complex in the fasted db/db mice livers compared with control mice, and the complex was mostly reversed back to the large Mediator complex following rapamycin treatment (Fig. 4D). Next, we examined whether blocking the degradation of the kinase module is sufficient to prevent the feeding-induced formation of the small Mediator complex. In vitro studies have suggested that the E3 ubiquitin ligase component FBW7 can induce the degradation of MED13 (25Davis M.A. Larimore E.A. Fissel B.M. Swanger J. Taatjes D.J. Clurman B.E.

We therefore tested whether FBW7 is necessary for the degradation and/or dissociation of the kinase module in vivo using acute hepatocyte-specific Fbw7 knockout mice generated by tail vein injection of AAV-Tbg-Cre into Fbw7fl/fl mice. Control mice in the fed state displayed the typical decrease in the Mediator kinase module subunits that was prevented in the hepatocyte-specific Fbw7-deficient mice (Fig. 5A). Consistent with functioning downstream of mTORC1, Fbw7 deficiency had no significant effect on the activation of mTORC1 kinase activity in the fed state (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, despite the restoration of the kinase module proteins in the Fbw7 knockout livers, the Mediator complex is still converted to the small Mediator and the kinase module complexes following feeding (Fig. 5E), indicating that stabilizing the kinase module subunits is not sufficient to block the feeding-induced dissociation of this module from the large Mediator complex. In parallel, both the control and Fbw7 knockout livers displayed elevated gluconeogenic genes in the fasted state that was suppressed in the fed state, whereas the lipogenic genes were increased in the fed state and suppressed in the fasted state (Fig. 5, C and D). Although the relative changes in Pck1 and Fasn were not significantly different between control and Fbw7 knockout livers, we have consistently observed that the fasting-induced expression of G6pc was reduced, whereas the feeding-induced expression of Acly, Acaca, and Scd1 were enhanced in the liver-specific Fbw7 knockout mice.

Our study of mouse liver revealed a dynamic oscillation of different forms of the Mediator complexes between fasting and feeding.

https://openalex.org/W2943341553,"Coastal climate adaptation strategies are needed to build salt marsh resiliency and maintain critical ecosystem services in response to impacts caused by climate change. Although resident microbial communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh functioning, their response to restoration practices is still understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in Spartina alterniflora-vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs, the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular, the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria increased in the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is maintained within the optimal range for S. alterniflora. While long-term effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of S. alterniflora are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor climate adaptation and restoration efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2943033257,"Every year more than 800 patients in Denmark are diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of which 3-5% are expected to be part of a hereditary renal cancer syndrome. We performed genetic screening of causative and putative RCC-genes (VHL, FH, FLCN, MET, SDHB, BAP1, MITF, CDKN2B) in RCC-patients suspected of a genetic predisposition.The cohort consisted of forty-eight Danish families or individuals with early onset RCC, a family history of RCC, a family history of RCC and melanoma or both RCC- and melanoma diagnosis in the same individual. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples or cancer-free formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.One start codon variant of unknown clinical significance (VUS) (c.3G>A, p.Met1Ile) and one missense VUS (c.631A>C, p.Met211Leu) was found in VHL in a patient with RCC-onset at twenty-eight years of age but without other manifestations or family history of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL). Furthermore, in three families we found three different variants in BAP1, one of which was a novel non-segregating missense variant (c.1502G>A, p.Ser501Asn) in a family with two brothers affected with RCC. Finally, we found the known E318K-substitution in MITF in a RCC-affected member of a family with multiple melanomas. No variants were detected in CDKN2B.Although we did find three VUS's in BAP1 in three families and a pathogenic variant in MITF in one family, pathogenic germline variants in BAP1, MITF or CDKN2B are not frequent causes of hereditary renal cancer in Denmark. It is possible that the high prevalence of risk factors such as male gender, smoking and obesity has influenced the development of cancer in the patients of the current study. Further investigations into putative predisposing genes and risk factors of RCC are necessary to enable better prediction of renal cancer risk or presymptomatic testing of relatives in hereditary renal cancer families."
https://openalex.org/W2940504239,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and persistent post-concussion syndrome (PCS) including chronic migraine (CM) are major health issues for civilians and the military. It is important to understand underlying biochemical mechanisms of these conditions, and be able to monitor them in an accurate and minimally invasive manner. This study describes the initial use of a novel serum analytical platform to help distinguish TBI patients, including those with post-traumatic headache (PTH), and to help identify phenotypes at play in these disorders. The hypothesis is that physiological responses to disease states like TBI and PTH and related bodily stresses are reflected in biomolecules in the blood in disease-specific manner. Leave one out (serum sample) cross validations (LOOCV) and sample randomizations were utilized to distinguished serum samples from the following TBI patient groups: TBI +PTSD + CM + severe depression (TBI ""most affected"" group) vs healthy controls, TBI ""most affected"" vs TBI, TBI vs controls, TBI + CM vs controls, and TBI + CM vs TBI. Inter-group discriminatory p values were ≤ 10-10, and sample group randomizations resulted in p non-significant values. Peptide/protein identifications of discriminatory mass peaks from the TBI ""most affected"" vs controls and from the TBI plus vs TBI minus CM groups yielded information of the cellular/molecular effects of these disorders (immune responses, amyloidosis/Alzheimer's disease/dementia, neuronal development). More specific biochemical disease effects appear to involve blood brain barrier, depression, migraine headache, autoimmunity, and autophagy pathways. This study demonstrated the ability for the first time of a novel, accurate, biomarker platform to monitor these conditions in serum, and help identify biochemical relationships leading to better understanding of these disorders and to potential therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2942920977,"Although influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) among those with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), in the 2015-16 season, coverage for persons with heart disease was only 48% in the US.We built a Monte Carlo (probabilistic) spreadsheet-based decision tree in 2018 to estimate the cost-effectiveness of increased influenza vaccination to prevent MACE readmissions. We based our model on current US influenza vaccination coverage of the estimated 493,750 US acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients from the healthcare payer perspective. We excluded outpatient costs and time lost from work and included only hospitalization and vaccination costs. We also estimated the incremental cost/MACE case averted and incremental cost/QALY gained (ICER) if 75% hospitalized ACS patients were vaccinated by discharge and estimated the impact of increasing vaccination coverage incrementally by 5% up to 95% in a sensitivity analysis, among hospitalized adults aged ≥ 65 years and 18-64 years, and varying vaccine effectiveness from 30-40%.At 75% vaccination coverage by discharge, vaccination was cost-saving from the healthcare payer perspective in adults ≥ 65 years and the ICER was $12,680/QALY (95% CI: 6,273-20,264) in adults 18-64 years and $2,400 (95% CI: -1,992-7,398) in all adults 18 + years. These resulted in ~ 500 (95% CI: 439-625) additional averted MACEs/year for all adult patients aged ≥18 years and added ~700 (95% CI: 578-825) QALYs. In the sensitivity analysis, vaccination becomes cost-saving in adults 18+years after about 80% vaccination rate. To achieve 75% vaccination rate in all adults aged ≥ 18 years will require an additional cost of $3 million. The effectiveness of the vaccine, cost of vaccination, and vaccination coverage rate had the most impact on the results.Increasing vaccination rate among hospitalized ACS patients has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile and becomes cost-saving when at least 80% are vaccinated."
https://openalex.org/W2940740166,"Mindfulness is known to increase after meditation interventions. But might features of our everyday situations outside of meditation not also influence our mindfulness from moment-to-moment? Drawing from psychological research on interpersonal trust, we suggest that interacting with trustworthy people could influence the expression of mindfulness. And, extending this research on trust, we further suggest that the influence of trustworthy social interactions on mindfulness could proceed through two pathways: a particularized pathway (where specific interactions that are especially high (or low) in trustworthiness have an immediate influence on mindfulness) or a generalized pathway (where the typical level of trustworthiness a person perceives across all their interactions exerts a more stable influence on their mindfulness). To explore these two pathways, study participants (N = 201) repeatedly reported their current levels of mindfulness and their prior interactions with trustworthy leaders and teammates during their everyday situations using an experience sampling protocol ([Formula: see text] = 3,605 reports). Results from mixed-effects models provide little support for the particularized pathway: specific interactions with trustworthy leaders and teammates had little immediate association with mindfulness. The generalized pathway, however, was strongly associated with mindfulness-and remained incrementally predictive beyond relevant individual differences and features of situations. In sum, people who typically interact with more trustworthy partners may become more mindful."
https://openalex.org/W2942940364,"The objective of this study was identify the association between delays in the care provided to pregnant women and the fetal death outcome, in a tertiary reference maternity hospital in the Northeastern Brazil. A case-control study, with 72 cases of fetal death and 144 controls (live births) in women admitted to the Obstetrics Service of the Assis Chateaubriand Teaching Maternity Hospital, in Fortaleza, Ceará. Controls were matched (2:1) by the approximate gestational age of the case. The groups were compared using the three delays model of obstetric care. The Pearson's Chi-square test and the Fisher's exact test were used to compare the groups. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Group with fetal death had a smaller number of prenatal consultations (> 6 consultations: 27.8% in cases, 40.3% in controls, p = 0.003), less risk classification of pregnancy (41.7% vs 55.9%, p = 0.048), less guidance about the health facility for delivery (44.5% vs 64%, p = 0.009), lower frequency of cesarean sections (25.4% vs 65.7%) and higher frequency of hemorrhagic syndromes (33.3% vs 19.4%, p = 0.024) and syphilis (15.3% vs 4.2%, p = 0·004). Variables that persisted significantly associated with fetal death in the logistic regression were: Refusal of assistance (OR = 4.07, IC 95%: 1.08–15.3), Absence or inadequacy of prenatal care (OR = 2.69, IC 95%: 1.07–6.75), Delay in diagnosis (OR = 10.3, IC 95%: 2.58–41.4) and Inadequate patient conduct (OR = 4.88; IC 95%: 1.43–16.6). Despite of having a higher frequency of obstetric complications, gestations with fetal death are more prone to delays in obstetric care."
https://openalex.org/W2943008626,"Introduction Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) trans venous lead extraction (TLE) is technically challenging. Whether the use of a laser sheath reduces complications and improves outcomes is still in debate. We therefore aimed at comparing our experience with and without laser in a large referral center. Methods Information of all patients undergoing TLE was collected prospectively. We retrospectively compared procedural outcomes prior to the introduction of the laser sheath lead extraction technique to use of laser sheath. Results During the years 2007–2017, there were 850 attempted lead removals in 407 pts. Of them, 339 (83%) were extracted due to infection, device upgrade/lead malfunction in 42 (10%) cases, and other (7%). Complete removal (radiological success) of all leads was achieved in (88%). Partial removal was achieved in another 6% of the patients. Comparison of cases prior to and after laser technique introduction, showed that with laser, a significantly smaller proportion of cases required conversion to femoral approach [31/275 (6%) laser vs. 40/132 (15%) non-laser; p<0.001]. However, success rates of removal [259/275 (94%) vs. 124/132 (94%) respectively; p = 0.83] and total complication rates [35 (13%) vs. 19 (14%) respectively; p = 0.86] did not differ prior to and after laser use. In multivariate analysis, laser-assisted extraction was an independent predictor for no need for femoral extraction (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.23–0.69; p = 0.01). Conclusion Introduction of laser lead removal resulted in decreased need to convert to femoral approach, albeit without improving success rates or preventing major complications."
https://openalex.org/W2900049693,"We consider the variational foam model, where the goal is to minimize the total surface area of a collection of bubbles subject to the constraint that the volume of each bubble is prescribed. We apply sharp interface methods to develop an efficient computational method for this problem. In addition to simulating time dynamics, we also report on stationary states of this flow for <22 bubbles in two dimensions and <18 bubbles in three dimensions. For small numbers of bubbles, we recover known analytical results, which we briefly discuss. In two dimensions, we also recover the previous numerical results of Cox et. al. (2003), computed using other methods. Particular attention is given to locally optimal foam configurations and heterogeneous foams, where the volumes of the bubbles are not equal. Configurational transitions are reported for the quasi-stationary flow where the volume of one of the bubbles is varied and, for each volume, the stationary state is computed. The results from these numerical experiments are described and accompanied by many figures and videos."
https://openalex.org/W2942703201,"Spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, which includes those that cause Lyme disease, have not been identified in Australia. Nevertheless, Australian patients exist, some of whom have not left the country, who have symptoms consistent with so-called ""chronic Lyme disease"". Blood specimens from these individuals may be tested in Australian laboratories and in specialist laboratories outside Australia and sometimes conflicting results are obtained. Such discrepancies cause the patients to question the results from the Australian laboratories and seek assistance from the Australian Government in clarifying why the discrepancies occur. The aim of this study was to determine the level of agreement in results between commonly used B. burgdorferi serology assays in specimens of known status, and between results reported by different laboratories when they use the same serology assay. Five immunoassays and five immunoblots used in Australia and elsewhere were examined for the detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Predominantly, archived specimens previously tested for Lyme disease were used for the study and included 639 contributed by seven clinical laboratories located either in Australia or in areas endemic for Lyme disease. Also included were 308 prospectively collected Australian blood donor specimens. All clinical specimens were tested in all 10 assays whereas blood donor specimens were tested in all immunoassays and a subset was tested on immunoblots. With the exception of one immunoblot, the results between the assays agreed with each other in a known positive specimen population ≥ 77% of the time and in a known negative population, 88% of the time or greater. The test results obtained during the study were different from the participating laboratory's less than 2% of the time when the same assay was used. These findings suggest that discordance in results between laboratories is more likely due to variation in algorithms or in the use of assays with different sensitivities or specificities rather than conflicting results being reported from the same assay in different laboratories. In the known negative population, specificities of the immunoassays ranged between 87.7% and 99.7%. In Australia's low prevalence population, this would translate to a positive predictive value of < 4%."
https://openalex.org/W2943491939,"This study examined the mediation effect of practical training on the relationship of demographic characteristics with bystander self-efficacy in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performance. We used nationwide, cross-sectional data from the Korea Community Health Survey and analyzed 25,082 Korean adults who participated in CPR training within the last 2 years. A mediation model was applied to explore the pathway from demographic characteristics via CPR practical training to self-efficacy in CPR performance. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine each path in the mediation model. Of the 25,082 respondents recently trained, 19,168 (76.8%) practiced on a manikin. In the unadjusted CPR practical training model, the demographic characteristics associated with high self-efficacy in CPR performance were male gender (odds ratio [OR] = 2.54); 50s age group (OR = 1.30); college or more (OR = 1.39) and high school education (OR = 1.32); white collar (OR = 1.24) and soldier (OR = 2.98) occupational statuses. The characteristics associated with low self-efficacy were 30s age group (OR = 0.69) and capital (OR = 0.79) and metropolitan (OR = 0.84) areas of residence (p < 0.05). In the adjusted CPR practical training model, the significance of the relationship between demographics and self-efficacy in CPR performance decreased in male gender, 30s age group, college or more and high school education, and soldier occupational status (i.e., partial mediation), and disappeared in metropolitan residents (i.e., complete mediation). The degree of the mediating effect of CPR practical training on self-efficacy differed for each demographic characteristic. Thus, individualized educational strategies considering recipient demographics are needed for effective practice-based CPR training and improving bystander CPR performance."
https://openalex.org/W2940578682,"Background Multi-mode data collection is widely used in surveys. Since several modes of data collection are successively applied in such design (e.g. self-administered questionnaire after face-to-face interview), partial nonresponse occurs if participants fail to complete all stages of the data collection. Although such nonresponse might seriously impact estimates, it remains currently unexplored. This study investigates the determinants of nonresponse to a self-administered questionnaire after having participated in a face-to-face interview. Methods Data from the Belgian Health Interview Survey 2013 were used to identify determinants of nonresponse to self-administered questionnaire (n = 1,464) among those who had completed the face-to-face interview (n = 8,133). The association between partial nonresponse and potential determinants was explored through multilevel logistic regression models, encompassing a random interviewer effect. Results Significant interviewer effects were found. Almost half (46.6%) of the variability in nonresponse was attributable to the interviewers, even in the analyses controlling for the area as potential confounder. Partial nonresponse was higher among youngsters, non-Belgian participants, people with a lower educational levels and those belonging to a lower income household, residents of Brussels and Wallonia, and people with poor perceived health. Higher odds of nonresponse were found for interviews done in the last quarters of the survey-year. Regarding interviewer characteristics, only the total number of interviews carried out throughout the survey was significantly associated with nonresponse to the self-administered questionnaire. Conclusions The results indicate that interviewers play a crucial role in nonresponse to the self-administered questionnaire. Participant characteristics, interview circumstances and interviewer characteristics only partly explain the interviewer variability. Future research should examine further interviewer characteristics that impact nonresponse. The current study emphasises the importance of training and motivating interviewers to reduce nonresponse in multi-mode data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2943073375,"Purpose This study aimed to elucidate whether muscle activity (in terms of glucose uptake) between the legs can be considered symmetrical during walking. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether the [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose was distributed heterogeneously throughout each muscle, and if so, whether areas of high uptake would be clustered. Methods Ten healthy participants walked on a treadmill at self-selected comfortable walking speed for a total of 90 minutes, 60 minutes before and 30 minutes after intravenous injection of 50 MBq [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose. Thereafter, a positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan of the lower limb was acquired. Three-dimensional muscle contours of 78 (= 39x2) muscles of the left and right lower limb were semi-automatically determined from magnetic resonance imaging scans. After non-rigid registration, those muscle contours were used to extract [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake from the positron emission tomography scans. Results Large asymmetries were observed in the lower leg muscles (e.g. median absolute asymmetry index of 42% in the gastrocnemius medialis) and in the gluteus minimus (30% asymmetry) and gluteus medius (15% asymmetry), whereas the uptake in the thighs was relatively symmetrical between the limbs (<6% asymmetry). These were not related to limb-dominance nor to inter-limb differences in muscle volume. The [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose distribution was not distributed normally; most voxels had a relatively low standardized uptake value, and a minority of voxels had a relatively high standardized uptake value. The voxels with higher [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake were distributed heterogeneously; they were clustered in virtually all muscles. Conclusion The findings in this study challenge the common assumption of symmetry in muscle activity between the limbs in healthy subjects. The clustering of voxels with high uptake suggests that even in this prolonged repetitive task, different spatial regions of muscles contribute differently to walking than others."
https://openalex.org/W2943485049,"Differentiation between pancreatic malignant and inflammatory tumors presents an important diagnostic problem. The ability to recognize pancreatic malignant tumors using Doppler evaluation of tissue perfusion has been recently demonstrated. The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic value of Dynamic Tissue Perfusion Measurement (DTPM) in the differentiation between malignant and inflammatory pancreatic tumors. The study included 60 patients (35M, 25F, age 60.9 ± 2.3 years) with a malignant (Group 1, n = 30) or inflammatory (Group 2, n = 30) pancreatic tumor undergoing endoscopic ultrasound with the evaluation of tissue perfusion by Color Doppler and a simultaneous biopsy of lesions for cytological evaluation. In 20 patients the diagnosis was verified in the postoperative histopathological examination. Flow velocity (FV) and percentiles of the distribution of perfusion intensity (PR) evaluated by DTPM were analyzed with regard to receiver-operator-characteristics. FV as well as PR were significantly higher in Group 2 compared to Group 1. A threshold of 2.0 cm/sec for FV identified patients with malignancies with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 86%. In multivariable regression analysis, the best PR parameter for differentiating between malignant and inflammatory tumors was 97.5% percentile, whose value of 0.922 allowed for the recognition of pancreatic malignant tumors with a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 83% (p < 0.001). In conclusion, Color Doppler ultrasound tissue perfusion parameters are a sensitive and specific tool in the differentiation between malignant and inflammatory pancreatic tumors."
