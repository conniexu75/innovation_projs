https://openalex.org/W2060978874,"The amygdala, a brain region important for learning fearful memories, is thought to have a role in generalized anxiety, but the subregions and connections involved in this response are unknown. Now, using optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala of rats, a specific circuit for natural bidirectional anxiety control has been identified. Stimulating these neurons has a calming effect, whereas blocking the same projection increases anxiety-related behaviours. These findings are consistent with a role for the central nucleus of the amygdala in anxiety, although there may be other circuits working in parallel or downstream of the amygdala. The amygdala, a brain region important for learning fearful memories, is thought to have a role in generalized anxiety, but the critical subregions and connections are unknown. This paper shows that optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala of rats with channelrhodopsin has an anxiolytic effect, whereas inhibition of the same projection with eNpHR3.0 increases anxiety related behaviours. These effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata themselves, indicating that selective activation of certain connections can have different effects. Anxiety—a sustained state of heightened apprehension in the absence of immediate threat—becomes severely debilitating in disease states1. Anxiety disorders represent the most common of psychiatric diseases (28% lifetime prevalence)2 and contribute to the aetiology of major depression and substance abuse3,4. Although it has been proposed that the amygdala, a brain region important for emotional processing5,6,7,8, has a role in anxiety9,10,11,12,13, the neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear. Here we explore the neural circuits underlying anxiety-related behaviours by using optogenetics with two-photon microscopy, anxiety assays in freely moving mice, and electrophysiology. With the capability of optogenetics14,15,16 to control not only cell types but also specific connections between cells, we observed that temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)—achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in the downstream CeA—exerted an acute, reversible anxiolytic effect. Conversely, selective optogenetic inhibition of the same projection with a third-generation halorhodopsin15 (eNpHR3.0) increased anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, these effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata, possibly owing to recruitment of antagonistic downstream structures. Together, these results implicate specific BLA–CeA projections as critical circuit elements for acute anxiety control in the mammalian brain, and demonstrate the importance of optogenetically targeting defined projections, beyond simply targeting cell types, in the study of circuit function relevant to neuropsychiatric disease."
https://openalex.org/W2022235653,"In the cerebral cortex, local circuits consist of tens of thousands of neurons, each of which makes thousands of synaptic connections. Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding the network would also require information about each neuron's function. Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property--the preferred stimulus orientation--of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected."

https://openalex.org/W2164148151,"In vitro display technologies, best exemplified by phage and yeast display, were first described for the selection of antibodies some 20 years ago. Since then, many antibodies have been selected and improved upon using these methods. Although it is not widely recognized, many of the antibodies derived using in vitro display methods have properties that would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain by immunizing animals. The first antibodies derived using in vitro display methods are now in the clinic, with many more waiting in the wings. Unlike immunization, in vitro display permits the use of defined selection conditions and provides immediate availability of the sequence encoding the antibody. The amenability of in vitro display to high-throughput applications broadens the prospects for their wider use in basic and applied research."
https://openalex.org/W2052091241,"Structural studies of active states of the visual pigment rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor, have previously been limited to apoprotein or opsin forms that do not contain the agonist all-trans-retinal. Two groups now report structures that reveal more details of the transformations involved in rhodopsin activation. Choe et al. solve the X-ray crystal structure of the metarhodopsin II intermediate of the photoreceptor rhodopsin, and Standfuss et al. determine the structure of a constitutively active mutant of rhodopsin bound to a peptide derived from the C-terminus of the G protein transducin. This study solves the X-ray crystal structure of a constitutively active mutant of rhodopsin, a G-protein-coupled receptor, bound to a peptide derived from the C-terminus of the G protein transducin. Comparison of this structure with the structure of ground-state rhodopsin suggests how translocation of the retinal β-ionone ring leads to a rotational tilt of transmembrane helix 6, the critical conformational change that occurs upon activation. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and mediate cellular responses to an extensive array of hormones, neurotransmitters and sensory stimuli. Although some crystal structures have been determined for GPCRs, most are for modified forms, showing little basal activity, and are bound to inverse agonists or antagonists. Consequently, these structures correspond to receptors in their inactive states. The visual pigment rhodopsin is the only GPCR for which structures exist that are thought to be in the active state1,2. However, these structures are for the apoprotein, or opsin, form that does not contain the agonist all-trans retinal. Here we present a crystal structure at a resolution of 3 Å for the constitutively active rhodopsin mutant Glu 113 Gln3,4,5 in complex with a peptide derived from the carboxy terminus of the α-subunit of the G protein transducin. The protein is in an active conformation that retains retinal in the binding pocket after photoactivation. Comparison with the structure of ground-state rhodopsin6 suggests how translocation of the retinal β-ionone ring leads to a rotation of transmembrane helix 6, which is the critical conformational change on activation7. A key feature of this conformational change is a reorganization of water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks between the retinal-binding pocket and three of the most conserved GPCR sequence motifs. We thus show how an agonist ligand can activate its GPCR."

https://openalex.org/W2029719395,"Epithelial integrity in metazoan organs is maintained through the regulated proliferation and differentiation of organ-specific stem and progenitor cells. Although the epithelia of organs such as the intestine regenerate constantly and thus remain continuously proliferative, other organs, such as the mammalian urinary bladder, shift from near-quiescence to a highly proliferative state in response to epithelial injury. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this injury-induced mode of regenerative response are poorly defined. Here we show in mice that the proliferative response to bacterial infection or chemical injury within the bladder is regulated by signal feedback between basal cells of the urothelium and the stromal cells that underlie them. We demonstrate that these basal cells include stem cells capable of regenerating all cell types within the urothelium, and are marked by expression of the secreted protein signal Sonic hedgehog (Shh). On injury, Shh expression in these basal cells increases and elicits increased stromal expression of Wnt protein signals, which in turn stimulate the proliferation of both urothelial and stromal cells. The heightened activity of this signal feedback circuit and the associated increase in cell proliferation appear to be required for restoration of urothelial function and, in the case of bacterial injury, may help clear and prevent further spread of infection. Our findings provide a conceptual framework for injury-induced epithelial regeneration in endodermal organs, and may provide a basis for understanding the roles of signalling pathways in cancer growth and metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2122481751,"FoxO transcription factors have been implicated in lipid metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, in an effort to elucidate such mechanisms, we examined the phenotypic consequences of liver-specific deletion of three members of the FoxO family: FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4. These liver-specific triply null mice, designated LTKO, exhibited elevated triglycerides in the liver on regular chow diet. More remarkably, LTKO mice developed severe hepatic steatosis following placement on a high fat diet. Further analyses revealed that hepatic NAD(+) levels and Sirt1 activity were decreased in the liver of the LTKO mice relative to controls. At the mechanistic level, expression profile analyses showed that LTKO livers had significantly down-regulated expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD(+) biosynthesis. Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that Nampt is a transcriptional target gene of FoxOs. Significantly, overexpression of Nampt gene reduced, whereas knockdown increased, hepatic triglyceride levels in vitro and in vivo. Thus, FoxOs control the Nampt gene expression and the NAD(+) signaling in the regulation of hepatic triglyceride homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2101668125,"Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is the principal enzyme responsible for maintenance of cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome. The N-terminal replication focus targeting sequence (RFTS) domain of Dnmt1 has been implicated in subcellular localization, protein association, and catalytic function. However, progress in understanding its function has been limited by the lack of assays for and a structure of this domain. Here, we show that the naked DNA- and polynucleosome-binding activities of Dnmt1 are inhibited by the RFTS domain, which functions by virtue of binding the catalytic domain to the exclusion of DNA. Kinetic analysis with a fluorogenic DNA substrate established the RFTS domain as a 600-fold inhibitor of Dnmt1 enzymatic activity. The crystal structure of the RFTS domain reveals a novel fold and supports a mechanism in which an RFTS-targeted Dnmt1-binding protein, such as Uhrf1, may activate Dnmt1 for DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1976560635,"The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs; isoforms HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-3α) mediate many responses to hypoxia. Their regulation is principally by oxygen-dependent degradation, which is initiated by hydroxylation of specific proline residues followed by binding of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. Chuvash polycythe-mia is a disorder with elevated HIF. It arises through germline homozygosity for hypomorphic VHL alleles and has a phenotype of hematological, cardiopulmonary, and metabolic abnormalities. This study explores the phenotype of two other HIF pathway diseases: classic VHL disease and HIF-2α gain-of-function mutation. No cardiopulmonary abnormalities were detected in classic VHL disease. HIF-2α gain-of-function mutations were associated with pulmonary hypertension, increased cardiac output, increased heart rate, and increased pulmonary ventilation relative to metabolism. Comparison of the HIF-2α gain-of-function responses with data from studies of Chuvash polycythemia suggested that other aspects of the Chuvash phenotype were diminished or absent. In classic VHL disease, patients are germline heterozygous for mutations in VHL, and the present results suggest that a single wild-type allele for VHL is sufficient to maintain normal cardiopulmonary function. The HIF-2α gain-of-function phenotype may be more limited than the Chuvash phenotype either because HIF-1α is not elevated in the former condition, or because other HIF-independent functions of VHL are perturbed in Chuvash polycythemia.—Formenti, F., Beer, P.

https://openalex.org/W2145973275,"The modification of N-glycans by α-mannosidases is a process that is relevant to a large number of biologically important processes, including infection by microbial pathogens and colonization by microbial symbionts. At present, the described mannosidases specific for α1,6-mannose linkages are very limited in number. Through structural and functional analysis of two sequence-related enzymes, one from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpGH125) and one from Clostridium perfringens (CpGH125), a new glycoside hydrolase family, GH125, is identified and characterized. Analysis of SpGH125 and CpGH125 reveal them to have exo-α1,6-mannosidase activity consistent with specificity for N-linked glycans having their α1,3-mannose branches removed. The x-ray crystal structures of SpGH125 and CpGH125 obtained in apo-, inhibitor-bound, and substrate-bound forms provide both mechanistic and molecular insight into how these proteins, which adopt an (α/α)(6)-fold, recognize and hydrolyze the α1,6-mannosidic bond by an inverting, metal-independent catalytic mechanism. A phylogenetic analysis of GH125 proteins reveals this to be a relatively large and widespread family found frequently in bacterial pathogens, bacterial human gut symbionts, and a variety of fungi. Based on these studies we predict this family of enzymes will primarily comprise such exo-α1,6-mannosidases."
https://openalex.org/W1998956543,"The regulation of energy homeostasis integrates diverse biological processes ranging from behavior to metabolism and is linked fundamentally to numerous disease states. To identify new molecules that can bypass homeostatic compensatory mechanisms of energy balance in intact animals, we screened for small-molecule modulators of Caenorhabditis elegans fat content. We report on several molecules that modulate fat storage without obvious deleterious effects on feeding, growth and reproduction. A subset of these compounds also altered fat storage in mammalian and insect cell culture. We found that one of the newly identified compounds exerts its effects in C. elegans through a pathway that requires previously undescribed functions of an AMP-activated kinase catalytic subunit and a transcription factor previously unassociated with fat regulation. Thus, our strategy identifies small molecules that are effective within the context of intact animals and reveals relationships between new pathways that operate across phyla to influence energy homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2076227992,"Activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors in urothelium is considered critical for development of urothelial cancer. Here we report cloning of the urothelium-specific promoter uroplakin-II (UPK II) and generation of transgenic mice in which expression of SV40 large T antigen is driven by UPK II promoter. Inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 and pRb in urothelium by SV40 T antigen resulted in urothelial carcinoma, resembling human high-grade carcinoma in situ. Specific deletion of p53 in urothelial cells using the newly generated UPK II-Cre mice results in normal bladders without any evidence of cancer. The high-grade carcinoma in situ in the UPK II-SV40 mice is associated with significant activation of angiogenic signals consisting of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and VEGF and a down-regulation of thrombospondin-1. Interestingly, such pro-angiogenic activity was not associated with progression to invasive cancer. Analysis of bladder-associated microRNAs in carcinoma in situ lesions reveals a pro-angiogenic profile, with specific overexpression of miR-18a and miR-19a and down-regulation of miR-107.

Our studies identify a new mouse model for bladder cancer that can be used to study factors that determine progression to an invasive phenotype of bladder cancer. Urothelial carcinomas of the bladder are among the most frequent human cancers and account for more than 14,000 deaths annually in the United States (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Thun M.J. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2009; 59: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9937) Google Scholar). Most cases of urothelial cancer are superficial bladder tumors, but around 20% of them are invasive carcinomas that can generate metastasis at the initial presentation or later in the evolution of the disease. Two groups of superficial bladder tumors have been described (2Pasin E. Josephson D.Y. Mitra A.P. Cote R.J. Stein J.P. Rev. Urol. 2008; 10: 31-43PubMed Google Scholar). Low grade papillary neoplasms are the most frequent, with a low potential of transformation into invasive cancer. Conversely, carcinomas in situ (CIS) 3The abbreviations used are: CIScarcinoma in situmiRmicroRNATSP-1thrombospondin-1UPK IIuroplakin II. are biologically more aggressive and carry a high probability of turning into an invasive carcinoma. The molecular basis of urothelial bladder cancer is being progressively unveiled, and the generation of transgenic mouse models of bladder cancer obtained through the urothelial expression of oncogenes (SV40) (3Zhang Z.T. Pak J. Shapiro E. Sun T.T. Wu X.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3512-3517PubMed Google Scholar) or deletion of tumor suppressor genes remains a viable strategy for unraveling this mechanism. It is acknowledged that there are at least two different pathways driving the malignant transformation of urothelium, each of them corresponding to one of the two types of urothelial tumors. The pathway leading to CIS, which is speculated to involve a loss of function of p53 (4Cheng J. Huang H. Pak J. Shapiro E. Sun T.T. Cordon-Cardo C. Waldman F.M. Wu X.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 179-185PubMed Google Scholar), is particularly important due to its role as precursor of invasive disease. However, p53 deletion does not seem to be sufficient for urothelial tumorigenesis unless there is either a concurrent deletion of pRb (5Mo L. Cheng J. Lee E.Y. Sun T.T. Wu X.R. Am. J. Physiol.

Bladder urothelial carcinoma in situ poses a difficult conundrum in the clinical setting. Its high recurrence rate (90% of cases) and its frequent evolution to invasive disease make it a target for aggressive treatment regimens, such as bladder bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy or cystectomy as in cases of extensive or persistent disease presentation (9Kaufman D.S. Shipley W.U. Feldman A.S. Lancet. 2009; 374: 239-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is among the biological factors that have been studied as potential predictors of progression to invasive tumors in superficial bladder carcinoma and is considered by some groups as a useful biomarker (10Mitra A.P. Datar R.H. Cote R.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2006; 24: 5552-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In this regard, some clinical studies have suggested that elevated microvessel density, an indicator of angiogenic phenotype, is associated with progression of carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer, but some other clinical observations did not confirm these results (11Sağol O.

Similar conflicting results have been reported for VEGF levels in urine or plasma (13Crew J.P. O'Brien T. Bicknell R. Fuggle S. Cranston D. Harris A.L. J. Urol. 1999; 161: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or for VEGF and HIF-1α expression in the tumor, which some authors suggest as important for progression to invasive cancer (14Izawa J.I.

Int. 2006; 77: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most studies include both CIS and pT1a types of tumors, thus making their interpretation confounding. Consequently, the emergence of angiogenic phenotype and its relevance for progression toward invasive bladder carcinoma are still controversial and need experimental validation. The goal of our study was to determine the role of p53 and angiogenic phenotype in the initiation and progression of bladder cancer. SV40 T antigen expression is able to inactivate both p53 and pRb tumor suppression pathways, and its urothelial conditional expression driven by uroplakin II (UPK II) has been previously shown to generate urothelial bladder carcinoma in situ, with late muscle invasion and metastasis in a few mice (3Zhang Z.T. Pak J. Shapiro E. Sun T.T. Wu X.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3512-3517PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a new transgenic mouse, UPK II-SV40, and observed that the development of high-grade urothelial carcinoma in situ was associated with a significant activation of angiogenic signals. This pro-angiogenic phenotype was independent of invasion and associated with specific changes in the profile of microRNAs regulating angiogenesis, without any effect on urothelial expression of invasion-related microRNA (miR). Lastly, loss of p53 alone in the urothelium did not result in initiation of cancer or angiogenic activation, and mice were normal. Collectively, these results suggest that progression to invasive bladder cancer is not solely dependent on angiogenesis, and therefore, the notion that markers of angiogenesis or angiogenesis-related miRs may serve as useful markers to predict invasive bladder cancer needs to be carefully evaluated. For the specific urothelial expression of SV40 large T antigen, a construct containing the urothelium-specific promoter uroplakin II (3.6 kb) and the SV40 T antigen was designed. First, we cloned mouse UPK II promoter (accession number: EF467361) from bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP24-308H8 with a PCR-based approach. During the cloning process, we found that about 1500 bp of the UPK II promoter region, which was deposited in GenBankTM (accession number U14421), was oppositely inserted between the two SacI restriction enzyme sites (from −1262 to −2805 from exon 1) in UPK II promoter. SV40 early sequence DNA was obtained from the Rip-TAG vector (kindly provided by Dr. Douglas Hanahan). The chimeric gene containing (5′ to 3′) the UPK II promoter (3.6 kb), the SV40 T antigen sequence (3.0 kb), and a 250-bp poly(A) signal was excised from the vector with EcoRI and BamHI digestion and purified with the Illustra GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (GE Healthcare). Additionally, we also generated a transgenic mouse that expresses the Cre recombinase enzyme in bladder uroepithelium by utilizing the same UPK II promoter. Microinjection of the purified constructs in the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from C57/BL mice was performed for generation of transgenic mice (UPK II-SV40 and UPK II-Cre) at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center transgenic facility. For specific urothelial knock-out of p53, the UPK II-Cre mouse strain described before was interbred to p53 floxed mice (National Institutes of Health, NCI, Mouse Repository) in which LoxP sites have been inserted in introns 1 and 10 of the p53 gene. To confirm urothelium-restricted expression of UPK II, a reporter strain was generated by interbreeding the UPK II-Cre with Rosa-R26R-YFP floxed mice (17Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). Genotyping of transgenic mice was determined by PCR in genomic DNA isolated from mice tails. The term “controls” refers to littermates of mice with a negative UPK II-SV40, UPK II-Cre;p53 f/f, or UPK II-Cre;YFP genotype. Mice were sacrificed at different time points, and bladders were obtained, weighted, and processed for histological analysis and molecular biology techniques. Thirty minutes before sacrifice, pimonidazole (HypoxyprobeTM-1, HPI Inc.) was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 60 mg/kg. Mice were maintained at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center animal facility under standard conditions. All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded 5-μm sections were treated with 10 mm citrate buffer for antigen retrieval, and standard immunohistochemical techniques were applied. The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: anti-SV40 T antigen (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-VEGF Ab-1 (10 μg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-HIF-1α (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Glut-1 (1:50; Abcam), anti-p53 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-CD34 (1:50; Abcam). Biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200) and VECTASTAIN ABC kit were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories). For hypoxia staining, the HypoxyprobeTM-1 Kit (HPI, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (primary antibody: 1:50 dilution). For immunofluorescence, 5-μm frozen sections were fixed in 100% acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. Primary antibodies were anti-CD31 (1:50; BD Biosciences Pharmingen), anti-CD34 (1:50; Abcam), anti-VEGF Ab-1 (10 μg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and anti-NG2 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sections were subsequently labeled with fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining. For blood vessel evaluation, a sufficient number of sections to cover the whole area of bladder stroma and urothelium were analyzed at 200×, and the relative area of CD31 staining was quantified with the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For evaluation of pericyte coverage, the proportion of CD31 vessels with perivascular NG2 staining was calculated. Samples (purified protein from whole bladder) were denatured with SDS sample buffer. Primary antibodies were anti-VEGF (1:500; Oncogene), anti-SV40 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin (1:1000; Sigma). After incubation with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce Biotechnology) was used. Total RNA was isolated from whole bladder tissues using TRIzol® according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). After DNase I treatment (Invitrogen), reverse transcription for mRNA was carried out using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For microRNA studies, RNA reverse transcription was performed with the ABI TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) using specific stem-loop primers, as described previously (18Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J.

Quantification of expression levels of VEGF, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), HIF-1α, HIF-1β, Dicer, Drosha, and microRNAs was determined by quantitative real time-PCR using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) and an Applied Biosystems 7300 detection system. GAPDH and RNU6B (for microRNA) were used for normalization, and all reactions were run in triplicate. Relative quantification of genes expression was analyzed with the comparative cycle threshold method (2−ΔΔCT). Sequences of miR, stem-loop primers, and primers for real time RT-PCR are shown in supplemental Table 1. Other primers for real time RT-PCR are shown in supplemental Table 2. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc.). Tests used were non-parametric Mann-Whitney (unpaired, two-tailed), and when appropriate, Student's t test. Statistical significance was established as p ≤ 0.05. SV40 T large antigen expression is able to inactivate both p53 and pRb, and its uroplakin II conditional expression has been previously shown to induce the development of bladder CIS (3Zhang Z.T. Pak J. Shapiro E. Sun T.T. Wu X.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3512-3517PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a transgenic mouse model in which the newly cloned UPK II promoter drives the expression of the SV40 T antigen (Fig. 1A). UPK II-SV40 (+) mice developed bladder urothelial carcinoma in situ with a 100% (39/39) penetrance starting from the first week of their life (Fig. 1, B–D and F–O). Although both males and females developed bladder carcinomas with similar disease progression kinetics, the bladder weight was higher in males, reflecting a higher tumor burden, as reported previously (19Johnson A.M. O'Connell M.J. Miyamoto H. Huang J. Yao J.L. Messing E.M. Reeder J.E. BMC Urol. 2008; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Immunohistochemistry evaluation of paraffin-embedded bladder tissue revealed specific expression of SV40 in urothelial cells from UPK II-SV40 mice (Fig. 1, P–Q). Bladder transitional carcinomas developed with characteristics of human CIS or high-grade intraurothelial neoplasia (20Epstein J.I. Amin M.B. Reuter V.R. Mostofi F.K. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 1998; 22: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar), exhibiting a flat growth, with large and pleomorphic nuclei and frequent mitoses (Fig. 1R). A papillary high-grade pattern appeared later but was infrequent. Although previous reports of similar models showed muscle invasion and occasional metastasis (3Zhang Z.T. Pak J. Shapiro E. Sun T.T. Wu X.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3512-3517PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cheng J. Huang H. Pak J. Shapiro E. Sun T.T. Cordon-Cardo C. Waldman F.M. Wu X.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 179-185PubMed Google Scholar), this was an infrequent and late event; accordingly, in our UPK II-SV40 lines, we observed one incidence (1 out of 39) of lamina propria invasion but without muscle involvement or distant metastases (4–6 months). The development of urothelial carcinomas in renal pelvis and ureter followed a similar, but slower, progression (Fig. 1, S–V). The expression of VEGF, the main pro-angiogenic factor in cancer, has been considered a critical factor in SV40-induced tumor progression (21Catalano A. Romano M. Martinotti S. Procopio A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To analyze the angiogenic pattern in our model of bladder carcinoma in situ, we performed immunofluorescence for CD31 and CD34. Staining for both markers was considerably increased in the bladder of UPK II-SV40 mice when compared with controls (Fig. 2, A–D). Tumor growth was associated with the development of a prominent vasculature, as shown by a statistically significant increase in the CD31 area (p = 0.017) (Fig. 2G). To evaluate the maturation status of carcinoma-associated bladder vessels, we double-labeled the bladder for CD31 and NG2, a pericyte marker (Fig. 2, E and F). Pericyte coverage of vessels was similar in both groups, thus suggesting a normal maturation and function of bladder tumor-associated vasculature in this stage (Fig. 2H). Differences in CD31 or NG2 staining (corrected by bladder area) were not observed between males and females. To provide further evidence of a pro-angiogenic phenotype and to explore the potential mechanism/s of vessel proliferation, Western blot of VEGF was performed using SV40 as a control for the presence of transformed urothelium. The analysis of Western blot revealed higher VEGF levels in UPK II-SV40 (+) mice (Fig. 3A). VEGF expression in SV40 urothelial tumors, as evaluated by immunofluorescence, was detected in stroma (Fig. 3, B–G) but was stronger in the urothelium, where it co-localized with UPK II (Fig. 3, H–M). Because hypoxia-related pathways have a role in the generation of a tumor-associated angiogenic phenotype, hypoxia was next assessed in bladder tissues. When compared with control, UPK II-SV40 mice exhibited a higher level of hypoxia as evaluated by Hypoxyprobe labeling (Fig. 4, A and B). HIF-1α participates in angiogenesis, and it is expressed in human CIS (16Ioachim E. Michael M. Salmas M. Michael M.M. Stavropoulos N.E. Malamou-Mitsi V. Urol. Int. 2006; 77: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Jones A. Fujiyama C. Blanche C. Moore J.W. Fuggle S. Cranston D. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Clin Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1263-1272PubMed Google Scholar). We found an intense expression of HIF-1α both in the transformed urothelium and in the tumor stroma (Fig. 4, C and D), thus highlighting the participation of the hypoxia response pathway in VEGF production and neoplastic progression of bladder CIS. Staining for Glut-1, a glucose transporter whose up-regulation is usually dependent on HIF-1α (23Palit V. Phillips R.M. Puri R. Shah T. Bibby M.C. Oncol. Rep. 2005; 14: 909-913PubMed Google Scholar), was also increased in bladder tumoral epithelium when compared with normal urothelium and with tumor stroma (supplemental Fig. 1, A–D). Analysis of the expression of angiogenic growth factors and hypoxia markers, as evaluated by real time RT-PCR, showed an increase in VEGF and HIF-1β and down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a well known inhibitor of angiogenesis (19Johnson A.M. O'Connell M.J. Miyamoto H. Huang J. Yao J.L. Messing E.M. Reeder J.E. BMC Urol. 2008; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4E). We did not find any difference between females and males in the expression of VEGF, HIF-1α, or TSP-1 (supplemental Table 3). Dysregulation in the expression of miRs, a group of small non-coding molecules of RNA with an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, is a frequent phenomenon in cancer (24Iorio M.V. Croce C.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 5848-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Thus, we next sought to identify modifications in the profile of miRs related to the regulation of angiogenesis (25Wang S. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), such as the miR-17-92 cluster (26Dews M. Homayouni A. Yu D. Murphy D. Sevignani C. Wentzel E. Furth E.E. Lee W.M. Enders G.H. Mendell J.T. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Whole bladder from UPK II-SV40 mice revealed an increase in the expression of miR-18a and miR-19a, which are considered responsible for pro-angiogenic effects (27Doebele C. Bonauer A. Fischer A. Scholz A. Reiss Y. Urbich C. Hofmann W.K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Blood. 2010; 115: 4944-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), whereas miR-17/20 and miR-92a were unchanged (Fig. 5A). These results, taken together with TSP-1 down-regulation (Fig. 4E), are consistent with a pro-angiogenic effect of miR-17-92 in this model. Additionally, miR-107, another angiogenesis-related miR whose expression is thought to be dependent on p53 status (28Yamakuchi M. Lotterman C.D. Bao C. Hruban R.H. Karim B. Mendell J.T. Huso D. Lowenstein C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6334-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), was significantly decreased in bladder carcinoma in situ when compared with normal bladder (Fig. 5B). A similar pattern of angiogenesis-related miR was found in both males and females, although there was a trend toward increased pro-angiogenic microRNAs, such as miR-18a, miR-19, and miR-20a in the females (supplemental Table 3). Because expression of Dicer and Drosha, two enzymes participating in miR processing, may be up-regulated in the setting of increased angiogenesis (29Kuehbacher A. Urbich C. Dimmeler S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 12-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30Kuehbacher A. Urbich C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ.

As shown in Fig. 5C, both of them exhibit significant increase in expression, consistent with their potential role in the generation of a pro-angiogenic profile. To determine whether differences in miR regulation might explain the uncoupling of invasion and angiogenesis in UPK II-SV40 bladder CIS, we analyzed the expression of other miRs previously reported as important for the progression or invasion of urothelial bladder cancer: miR-21 (32Neely L.A.

Because the precise cellular origin of bladder carcinomas is still unclear, a mouse model in which p53 deletion involves all layers of the urothelium was generated. In the UPK II-Cre;p53 f/f mouse model (Fig. 6A), deletion of p53 in the urothelium was not associated with formation of bladder carcinomas or other morphological alterations (Fig. 6, B–E). Immunolabeling confirmed the lack of p53 expression in all cell layers of urothelium (Fig. 6, G–H). Further confirmation of urothelium-restricted expression of the Cre was obtained using reporter mice generated after breeding of UPK-II-Cre with Rosa-R26R-YFP floxed mice (supplemental Fig. 2A). When compared with control mice, YFP expression was specifically detected in the urothelial cells of bladder (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C) and ureter (supplemental Fig. 2, D and E) of UPK II-Cre; Rosa-Stop-YFP+/+ mice. Cre-mediated excision of the STOP cassette was also demonstrated by PCR for the recombinant YFP in the bladder DNA from UPK II-Cre; Rosa-Stop-YFP+/+ mice (supplemental Fig. 2F). To determine whether the pro-angiogenic profile observed in the UPK II-SV40 mice was related to p53 deletion, we examined the vasculature of bladders from UPK II-Cre;p53 f/f mice. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, increased vascularization was not observed in UPK II-Cre;p53 f/f mice, when evaluated using immunofluorescence for CD31 (Fig. 7C). Pericyte coverage of blood vessels was also similar in both groups. We did not observe any difference in hypoxia response as evaluated using HIF-1α staining (Fig. 7, D and E) and VEGF staining (data not shown) F"
https://openalex.org/W2122495294,"The sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/P(i)) transporters NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c play a major role in the renal reabsorption of P(i). The functional need for several transporters accomplishing the same role is still not clear. However, the fact that these transporters show differential regulation under dietary and hormonal stimuli suggests different roles in P(i) reabsorption. The pathways controlling this differential regulation are still unknown, but one of the candidates involved is the NHERF family of scaffolding PDZ proteins. We propose that differences in the molecular interaction with PDZ proteins are related with the differential adaptation of Na/P(i) transporters. Pdzk1(-/-) mice adapted to chronic low P(i) diets showed an increased expression of NaPi-2a protein in the apical membrane of proximal tubules but impaired up-regulation of NaPi-2c. These results suggest an important role for PDZK1 in the stabilization of NaPi-2c in the apical membrane. We studied the specific protein-protein interactions of Na/P(i) transporters with NHERF-1 and PDZK1 by FRET. FRET measurements showed a much stronger interaction of NHERF-1 with NaPi-2a than with NaPi-2c. However, both Na/P(i) transporters showed similar FRET efficiencies with PDZK1. Interestingly, in cells adapted to low P(i) concentrations, there were increases in NaPi-2c/PDZK1 and NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 interactions. The differential affinity of the Na/P(i) transporters for NHERF-1 and PDZK1 proteins could partially explain their differential regulation and/or stability in the apical membrane. In this regard, direct interaction between NaPi-2c and PDZK1 seems to play an important role in the physiological regulation of NaPi-2c."

This cell type produces glucagon, a major counteracting hormone to insulin in regulating glucose homeostasis in adults. However, little is known about the factors that regulate Arx transcription in the pancreas. In this study, we showed that the number of Arx+ cells was significantly reduced in the pancreata of embryos deficient for the Islet-1 (Isl-1) transcription factor, which was also supported by the reduction in Arx mRNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis localized Isl-1 activator binding sites within two highly conserved noncoding regulatory regions (Re) in the Arx locus, termed Re1 (+5.6 to +6.1 kb) and Re2 (+23.6 to +24 kb). Using cell line-based transfection assays, we demonstrated that a Re1- and Re2-driven reporter was selectively activated in islet α-cells, a process mediated by Isl-1 in overexpression, knockdown, and site-directed mutation experiments. Moreover, Arx mRNA levels were up-regulated in islet α-cells upon Isl-1 overexpression in vivo.

Pancreatic islets play an important role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism through the production and secretion of hormones. The five cell types found in the islet are α-, β-, δ-, ϵ-, and pancreatic polypeptide cells that, respectively, produce the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide (1Oliver-Krasinski J.M. Stoffers D.A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1998-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The hormonal products of the predominant α- and β-cells act in peripheral tissues in a counter-regulatory manner to control blood glucose homeostasis, with insulin promoting cellular glucose uptake and storage and glucagon promoting its release. Notably, although insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction are the major causes of diabetes, the sustained, unregulated secretion of glucagon from α-cells also contributes to hyperglycemia and the associated complications (2Burcelin R.

Importantly, Pax4 and Arx function in an antagonistic manner and are both critical in the specification of these islet cell types during pancreatic development (15Collombat P. Hecksher-Sørensen J. Broccoli V. Krull J. Ponte I. Mundiger T. Smith J. Gruss P. Serup P. Mansouri A. Development. 2005; 132: 2969-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For example, Arx misexpression in the pancreatic epithelium specifically converted β-cells into α- and pancreatic polypeptide cells, whereas Pax4 produced more β-cells at the expense of the α-cell population (22Collombat P. Hecksher-Sørensen J. Krull J. Berger J. Riedel D. Herrera P.L. Serup P. Mansouri A. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 23Collombat P. Xu X. Ravassard P.

Significantly, as islet α-cells were also lost in humans with an ARX-null mutation (24Itoh M. Takizawa Y. Hanai S. Okazaki S. Miyata R. Inoue T. Akashi T. Hayashi M. Goto Y. Differentiation. 2010; 80: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the collective evidence strongly suggests that this transcription factor serves as a master regulator of mammalian islet α-cell formation. Thus far, the only established regulator of Arx transcription in the pancreas is Pax4, which inhibits expression through binding to a cis-acting element located ∼14.2 kb downstream of the Arx translation stop site (15Collombat P. Hecksher-Sørensen J. Broccoli V. Krull J. Ponte I. Mundiger T. Smith J. Gruss P. Serup P. Mansouri A. Development. 2005; 132: 2969-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that removal of the Lin 1/Islet 1/Mec3-homeodomain Islet-1 (Isl-1) transcription factor in the pancreatic epithelium reduced both α- and β-cell numbers as well as key transcriptional regulators associated with their identity; specifically, MafA and Arx in β- and α-cells, respectively (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Isl-1 might be a good candidate for their regulation. The goal of this study was to investigate whether Arx is directly regulated by Isl-1 in α-cells. We identified two highly conserved regulatory regions (Re) within the Arx locus, termed Re1 and Re2, that are bound by Isl-1 and promote expression selectively in α-cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Isl-1 activates Arx transcription using a combination of in vitro and in vivo based loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. These results establish Isl-1 as a key activator of Arx transcription during α-cell formation and potentially also as a critical regulator for its regulation in adults. Approximately 800 to 1000 islets were isolated from five 8-week-old CD1 male mice using the standard collagenase procedure as described previously (25Gupta R.K. Gao N. Gorski R.K. White P. Hardy O.T. Rafiq K. Brestelli J.E. Chen G. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Kaestner K.H. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 756-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The islets were washed in PBS, cross-linked in 1.1% formaldehyde, and sonicated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). αTC6 (26Hohmeier H.E. Newgard C.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 228: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and βTC3 tissue-cultured cells were cross-linked under similar conditions, lysed in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 85 mm KCl with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)), and sonicated. α-Isl-1 antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa, 39.4D5) was added to the sonicated chromatin, and Isl-1 bound chromatin was isolated by incubation with protein A-agarose beads and eluted in buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m Na2CO3. The immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by either ChIP-Seq or real-time PCR analysis. ChIP PCR primer sequences are as follows: ArxRe1, 5′CCATTTGAAGGCAAAATGCT and 5′GTATGGGCTGCAAACACCTT; ArxRe2, 5′TGAAGTGGCTGAATGAGAGC and 5′AGTTGGAGCGCGTTTTGTAG; and PEPCK, 5′CAACAGGCAGGGTCAAAGTTTAG and 5′AGGCCTCAGGCCCCTCTAT. The purified immunoprecipitated DNA was prepared for next-generation high-throughput sequencing using the ChIP-Seq DNA sample prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The modified product was assayed for quantity and quality on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Tech). Sequencing and data processing were performed at the Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center. Functional Genomics Core at University of Pennsylvania. Isl-1-bound regions designated by peaks were identified using the Global Identifier of Target Regions algorithm (27Tuteja G. White P. Schug J. Kaestner K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from islets or tissue-cultured cells using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using Oligo(dT), Superscript II reverse transcriptase, plus the accompanying reagents (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR reactions were set up using the Brilliant SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Stratagene). All reactions were performed in triplicate with reference dye for normalization. PCR primer sequences are as follows: Arx, 5′TCAAGCATAGCCGCGCTGAG and 5′ACACCTCCTTCCCCGTGCTG and Isl-1, 5′CGGAGAGACATGATGGTGGTT and 5′GGGCTGATCTATGTCGCTTTGC. Arx Re1, and Re2 were cloned into the pGL4.27 luciferase vector (Promega). Site-directed mutants were generated with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create Isl-1 binding site mutations (underlined). The corresponding wild-type nucleotide sequences for these sites are labeled in red in Fig. 5, A and B: Re1–1, 5′CCGCCCTGCACAAGGAGCTGGCGCCGGCTATTTGATTTCC; Re1–3, 5′GGGAGTGAGTGCAATGCTGCCGAAGGTGTTTGCAGCCC; Re2–2, 5′CAATAACAAGCATGGCCGTAAGTGAGCATGATGAAGTTAATGG; Re2–3, 5′GTGAGCATGATGAAGTGCCGGGAGATAATTCATTCC; and Re2–6, 5′GCATAATTGCAGAGAATGAAGCCGTGATTTGACAATTGTACCAG. αTC1–6 cells were cultured in 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with the Arx-driven expression vectors as well as the Renilla luciferase control expression plasmid (pRL-SV40) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Reporter assays were performed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Arx-luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase. Lentiviral transduction particles (MISSION® shRNA, Sigma) targeting Isl-1 were applied to cultured αTC1–6 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (multiplicity of infection = 5). Infected cells were selected for puromycin (5 μg/ml) resistance for 1 week before analysis. The Isl-1 shRNA sequence is as follows: 5′CCGGCGGCAATCAAATTCACGACCACTCGAGTGGTCGTGAATTTGATTGCCGTTTTTG. Whole cell lysate from control and Isl-1 shRNA transduced αTC1–6 cells as well as isolated islets (equivalent of ∼200 islets) were loaded and resolved on 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE® Novex® mini gels (Invitrogen). The antibodies used for the Western blot analysis were Isl-1 (1:1000, 39.4D5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa), tubulin (1:5000, Sigma), and Myc (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and then embedded in paraffin. Slides (8–10-μm sections) were subjected to microwave antigen retrieval in 10 mm citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) and treated with protein blocking reagent (Immunotech). Slides were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were insulin (1:1000, Linco), glucagon (1:3000, Linco), Myc (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), and Arx (1:2000, gift from Dr. Kitamura at Kyushu University, Japan). DNA binding reactions (20 μl total volume) included 10 μg of αTC1–6 nuclear extract (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar) or 2 μl of in vitro translated Isl-1-Myc protein (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) plus 400 fmol of 32P end-labeled DNA oligo probe. Reactions were incubated at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCL, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% (v/v) Ficoll, 1 mg/ml BSA, 500 ng poly(dI-dC), and 500 ng of poly(dA-dT). Competition experiments were performed using a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide. α-Isl-1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa, 40.2D6) or α-Myc antibody (SC-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the nuclear extract for 10 min on ice prior to probe addition in the supershift assays. Reaction products were separated on 6% non-denaturing acrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) buffer, and complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The double-stranded oligonucleotide sequences are as follows, with the putative homeodomain (HD) binding elements in bold lettering: Re1-1wild-type, 5′GAGCTGGCTAATGCTATTTG; Re1-2wild-type, 5′CATTGATCTAATAGGGAGTG; Re1-3wild-type, 5′GCAATGCTATTAAAGGTGTT; Re1-4wild-type, 5′GGCTCATTTAATACACAACA; Re1-5wild-type, 5′GCTTCTTGCATTAGAGGGC; Re1-6wild-type: 5′GAGGGCTAATGATGAGGCTG; Re2–1wild-type, 5′AGAAGCACATTATTTCTTTT; Re2–2wild-type, 5′AAGCATGTAATTAAGTGAGC; Re2–2mutant, 5′AAGCATGGCCGGCAGTGAGC (mutation is underlined); Re2–3wild-type, 5′GATGAAGTTAATGGAGATAC; Re2–3mutant, 5′GATGAAGTGCCGGGAGATAC (mutation is underlined); Re2–4wild-type, 5′AGCTGTTAATTTAATCATCAT; Re2–5wild-type, 5′TGCGAGCATAATTGCAGAGA; Re2–6wild-type, 5′AGAATGAATAATTGATTTGA; and Re2–6mutant, 5′AGAATGAAGCCGTGATTTGA (mutation is underlined). The Hnf6 cDNA (from Pdx1PB-Hnf6, gift from M. Gannon, 29Gannon M. Ray M.K. Van Zee K. Rausa F. Costa R.H. Wright C.V. Development. 2000; 127: 2883-2895PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced by rat Isl-1-Myc (gift from Sam Pfaff). DNA was SalI-digested, and the entire Pdx1PB-Isl-1-Myc transgene was injected into the pronuclei of C57BL6J embryos at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Transgenic Core Facility. Founder mice were identified by PCR analysis with the following genotyping primers: 5′CCCCTCTGCTAACCATGTTC and 5′TACCGCAACCAACACATAGG. Mice with pancreas-specific removal of Isl-1 were generated in our lab previously to investigate the requirement of Isl-1 during pancreas development (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Arx mRNA levels were found previously to be decreased in the embryonic Pdx1-Cre;Isl-1LoxP/LoxP pancreata, conditions wherein removal of Isl-1 in pancreatic epithelium at E13.5 also resulted in reduced numbers of insulin+ and glucagon+ cells (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, the steady-state levels of all other analyzed islet-enriched transcriptional regulators were unaffected, with the exception of MafA in insulin+ cells (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for glucagon and Arx was performed with E15.5 control and Pdx1-Cre;Isl-1LoxP/LoxP pancreata to examine whether Arx+ cells were affected in the mutant (Fig. 1, A-D). Pax6 staining was performed on neighboring sections and used as an internal control for quantitative analysis because the mRNA expression level and number of Pax6+ cells were unaltered in the E15.5 Pdx1-Cre;Isl-1LoxP/LoxP pancreas (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). From this analysis, we found that the total number of Arx+ cells was reduced by ∼50% in the Pdx1-Cre;Isl-1LoxP/LoxP pancreata (Fig. 1E), with the few remaining glucagon+ cells coexpressing Arx (Fig. 1D). Unlike the control pancreas, most of the Arx+ cells in the mutant pancreas did not produce glucagon, likely representing the significance of Isl-1 in activating glucagon production (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we have focused on understanding how Isl-1 affects Arx mRNA expression in islet α-cells. To further examine Isl-1 regulation in islet α-cell gene expression in vivo, a transgenic line was derived that expressed rat Isl-1-Myc from the Pst1 to Bst1 region of the mouse pdx-1 promoter, termed Pdx1PB-Isl-1-Myc (Fig. 2A). The transgenic activity of this pdx-1 control region is first observed at around E13.5 and is essential only in islet α, β, and δ cells throughout adulthood (29Gannon M. Ray M.K. Van Zee K. Rausa F. Costa R.H. Wright C.V. Development. 2000; 127: 2883-2895PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.F. Henderson E. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isl-1 mRNA and protein levels were increased ∼2-fold in 8-week old Pdx1PB-Isl-1-Myc mice relative to age-matched controls (Fig. 2, B and C). Double immunostaining in islets for Myc and glucagon or insulin revealed that Isl-1-Myc was produced in 4% of glucagon+ and 32% insulin+ cells (Fig. 2, D–G). This pdx-1 fragment has been shown previously to drive stronger transgene expression in islet β-cells than α-cells (29Gannon M. Ray M.K. Van Zee K. Rausa F. Costa R.H. Wright C.V. Development. 2000; 127: 2883-2895PubMed Google Scholar). Pdx1PB-Isl-1-Myc mice appeared indistinguishable from their control littermates at 8 weeks of age. In addition, we did not detect any gross abnormalities in the overall appearance of the pancreas. Immunohistochemical analysis of Pdx1PB-Isl-1-Myc pancreata showed no changes in islet morphology, size, or the ratio between glucagon- and insulin-expressing cells (Fig. 2, D–L). Furthermore, mRNA levels of glucagon and insulin were also comparable between Pdx1PB-Isl-1-Myc and control littermates (data not shown). Interestingly, Isl-1-Myc overexpression elevated endogenous Arx mRNA levels by roughly 2-fold (Fig. 2H). Notably, Arx protein staining was only found in Pdx1PB-Isl-1-Myc α-cells and not the insulin+ β-cell population (Fig. 2, I and J). This in vivo result further suggested that Isl-1 stimulated Arx expression during α-cell development. Isl-1 binding regions were identified in the Arx locus by whole-genome ChIP-Seq of α-Isl-1 antibody precipitates from nuclei of αTC1–6 cells, a transformed α-cell line (26Hohmeier H.E. Newgard C.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 228: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Binding was observed within two distinct conserved noncoding regions, one located ∼5.6 kb downstream from the transcription start site within intron 3 (termed Region 1: Re1, +5.6 to +6.1 kb) and the other ∼18.kb kb further away, within the last intron of Pola1 (Region 2: Re2, +23.6 to +24 kb) (Fig. 3A and B). Standard α-Isl-1 ChIP assays were performed over Re1 and Re2 in αTC1–6 cells, freshly isolated mouse islets, and βTC-3 (mouse insulinoma) cells to examine the specificity of binding (Fig. 3, C and D). These real-time PCR results were normalized to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter binding, an inactive gene in the pancreas. Isl-1 bound much more effectively to Re1 and Re2 in αTC1–6 than βTC-3 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). These data strongly suggested that the Isl-1 binding observed in islets is principally in α-cells and potentially important to Arx gene transcription. Re1, Re2, and Re1/Re2 combined were subcloned upstream of the minimal RNA polymerase II promoter in the pGL4.27 luciferase reporter vector, and their activation properties were analyzed in transfected αTC1–6 cells. All of these pGL4.27-Arx constructs were more active than pGL4.27 alone (Fig. 4A). Moreover, Isl-1 enhanced activation of each of the Arx-driven constructs in cotransfection assays, although pGL4.27-Re2 (2.9-fold) was more sensitive than either pGL4.27-Re1/2 (2.6-fold) or pGL4.27- Re1 (1.5-fold) (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the involvement of Isl-1 in Arx activity, αTC1–6 cells were infected with an Isl-1 shRNA expressing lentivirus. A nearly 70% reduction in cellular Isl-1 protein amount resulted in a 2-fold reduction in endogenous Arx mRNA levels (Fig. 4, B and C). Notably, Isl-1 knockdown also decreased pGL4.27-Re1 and pGL4.27-Re2 activity by ∼2-fold in αTC1–6 cells (Fig. 4D), strongly suggesting that Isl-1 control of Arx transcription is mediated through Re1 and Re2. Several potential homeodomain-binding sites (TAAT/ATTA) were found within the highly conserved sequences of Re1 and Re2 (Fig. 5, A and B). EMSAs were performed to evaluate the binding ability of in vitro translated Myc-tagged Isl-1 protein to six Arx sites from each region (Fig. 6, A and B), with the well characterized binding element from MafA Region 3 (MafA-R3) serving as the positive control (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Isl-1 and Myc antibodies were used to locate the Isl-1-Myc complex in these assays. Isl-1-Myc:MafA was competed to varying degrees by all of the wild-type Re1 and Re2 sequences (Fig. 6, A and B), and their binding differences were also evident upon analyzing endogenous Isl-1 binding to the Re2–2, Re2–3, and Re2–6 probes (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that Isl-1 was able to bind to multiple sites within Re1 and Re2. Isl-1 binding mutations in Re1–1, Re1–3, Re2–2, Re2–3, and Re2–6 (marked in red, Fig. 5, A and B) were generated in the pGL4.27-Arx reporters to evaluate their effect on activation in αTC1–6 cells (Fig. 5C). These sites were chosen on the basis of the strength of binding to Isl-1 (Fig. 6). The relatively weak binding mutant Re2–3 reduced pGL4.27-Arx activity to the same extent as the strong Re1–1, Re1–3, Re2–2, and Re2–6 (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that Isl-1 activation of Arx transcription in α-cells is likely through many related cis-elements within the 3′-flanking Re1 and Re2 control domains. The results of this study reveal for the first time that Isl-1, an islet transcription factor, is essential for Arx transcription in α-cells. Although the importance of Arx during α-cell formation has been demonstrated in mice and humans (15Collombat P. Hecksher-Sørensen J. Broccoli V. Krull J. Ponte I. Mundiger T. Smith J. Gruss P.

Differentiation. 2010; 80: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms involved in Arx transcription in the islet α-cell have remained largely elusive. Here, we have demonstrated that Isl-1 is an activator for Arx transcription in α-cells through direct binding to multiple elements in the 3′-noncoding sequences. We found that Isl-1 overexpression in islet cells leads to enhanced Arx expression in α-cells. These findings not only shed new light on the transcriptional regulation of Arx in α-cell biology, but also identify Isl-1 as an essential islet transcriptional activator for α-cell formation. Isl-1 proteins have been shown to directly regulate gene activation (e.g. glucagon, insulin, and MafA) in islet cells by binding to the 5′-control regions of these genes (17Du A. Hunter C.S.

It is intriguing that Isl-1 binds to the Arx locus in two distinct regions that are located in the intron and 3′-noncoding sequences that are ∼18 kb apart from each other. From our luciferase reporter assay, it is evident that these two regions have an additive effect when placed next to each other. Lin 1/Islet 1/Mec3-HD transcription factors, like Isl-1, have been shown to function in the context of coregulators that form a high-order transcriptional complex to exert their actions (33Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 34Matthews J.M. Visvader J.E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Whether coregulators like Lin 1/Islet 1/Mec3-domain binding proteins, Ldb1, or Ldb2, (33Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) influence Isl-1 activation during pancreatic development remains to be investigated. Interestingly, mice lacking ultraconserved elements (uc467) which encompass our Re2, have been generated by Ahituv et al. (36Ahituv N. Zhu Y. Visel A. Holt A. Afzal V. Pennacchio L.A. Rubin E.M. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e234Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these mutant mice failed to reveal any overt abnormalities, although the specific impact on α-cell formation was not analyzed in their study (36Ahituv N. Zhu Y. Visel A. Holt A. Afzal V. Pennacchio L.A. Rubin E.M. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e234Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). If no defect is observed, it is possible that Re1 might play a redundant role in mediating Arx transcription in developing islet α-cells. Outside of the pancreas, Arx expression is also detected in the developing ventral telencephalon of the brain, where its expression is directly regulated by the homeodomain factor Dlx2 (37Colasante G. Collombat P. Raimondi V. Bonanomi D. Ferrai C. Maira M. Yoshikawa K. Mansouri A. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.L. Broccoli V. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10674-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 38Cobos I. Broccoli V. Rubenstein J.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 483: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Two Dlx2 binding sites (HD-1 and HD-2) have been identified in the highly conserved noncoding sequence of the Arx locus (referred to as mUAS3, 37Colasante G. Collombat P. Raimondi V. Bonanomi D. Ferrai C. Maira M. Yoshikawa K. Mansouri A. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.L. Broccoli V. J.

Notably, Dlx2 is minimally expressed as compared with Isl-1 in the pancreas (data not shown), suggesting that Isl-1 is the major transcriptional activator of Arx in developing α-cells. Isl-1 has widespread effects in many developing tissues including motor neurons, cardiac mesoderm, and the pancreas (17Du A. Hunter C.S. Murray J. Noble D. Cai C.L. Evans S.M. Stein R. May C.L.

Our findings reveal a novel role for Isl-1 in controlling the islet α-cell phenotype by directly regulating Arx transcription. Although Arx is detected in both α-cell progenitor and fully differentiated glucagon-producing cell populations (16Collombat P. Mansouri A. Hecksher-Sorensen J. Serup P. Krull J. Gradwohl G. Gruss P.

Therefore, Isl-1 is only necessary for the maintenance of Arx transcription in forming α-cells and not involved during the initial actions of Arx in early α-cell specification. Finally, although our current study also suggests that Isl-1 is likely to regulate Arx transcription in adult islet α-cells, the in vivo role Isl-1 plays in adult islet Arx expression and α-cell biology await to be investigated.

Peptides. 2006; 27: 1138-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ASICs are members of the Epithelial Sodium Channel/Degenerin (ENaC/Deg) family, a large group of proteins that are implicated in mechanosensation, pain sensation, regulation of extracellular fluid volume, and airway surface liquid volume (2Lingueglia E.

Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). These channels are organized as homo- or hetero-trimers. Each subunit has two transmembrane segments (TMs) connected by a large extracellular region with the N and C termini on the intracellular side (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 7Gonzales E.B. Kawate T. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 460: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). ASICs are constitutively closed and undergo activation and desensitization in response to extracellular acidification. Seven ASIC subunits are expressed in mammals: ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC1b2, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4 (2Lingueglia E. Deval E. Lazdunski M. Peptides. 2006; 27: 1138-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of activation and desensitization by protons depend on the specific subunits forming the channel complex.The pore of ASIC1 in the presumed desensitized-like state has an hourglass-like shape defined mainly by residues from TM2, although residues from TM1 form a portion of the outer vestibule (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 7Gonzales E.B. Kawate T. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 460: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The TM2 helices are tilted by a ∼50° angle from the membrane normal, and their intersection likely constitutes the desensitization gate. The TM1 segments are in contact with the lipid bilayer and with the TM2 segments in their own and neighboring subunits. Compelling evidence suggests that ASIC activation involves protonation of multiple residues within the extracellular region of the protein (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 8Liechti L.A. Bernèche S. Bargeton B. Iwaszkiewicz J. Roy S. Michielin O. Kellenberger S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 572-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A fundamental question regarding the mechanism of gating of ENaC/Deg channels is how extracellular cues trigger pore opening and closing events. The extracellular region of ASIC1 is organized in discrete subdomains referred to as the palm, the β-ball, the knuckle, the thumb, and the finger (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The thumb is a cylindrical structure with two anti-parallel α helices stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds, and is located between the putative proton-binding sites and the transmembrane helices. Jasti et al. (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) proposed that residues in the thumb domain mediate functional coupling between the proton-binding sites and the ion pore. Non-conserved substitutions of Trp-288, at the base of the thumb domain, or Tyr-71, in the region connecting TM1 to the extracellular region, disrupt proton-dependent gating (9Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whether pore opening is mediated by a coordinated rearrangement of the TM1 segments or by another mechanism remains unknown.In this study, we explored the reactivity to methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of channels bearing Cys mutations in the outer vestibule of the pore. Positively charged MTS reagents triggered pore opening of G428C. Double-mutant cycle analysis indicated that the MTSET-modified side chain of Cys at position 428 interacts with Tyr-424, in the region preceding TM2 (pre-TM2). Western blot analysis of the double Cys mutant Y424C-G428C established the presence of intersubunit disulfide bonds, though the apparent proton affinity for activation and desensitization of these channels was similar to controls. This finding implies a geometric constraint that supports a model in which ion permeation is accomplished by coordinated rotation of the TM2 segments.DISCUSSIONASICs are ligand-gated ion channels that undergo activation and desensitization in response to extracellular acidification. Recent studies suggested that activation and desensitization of ASICs involve a broad reorganization of the extracellular domain rather than a restricted region (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 8Liechti L.A. Bernèche S. Bargeton B. Iwaszkiewicz J. Roy S. Michielin O. Kellenberger S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) proposed that residues at the base of the thumb communicate conformational changes initiated at the proton-binding sites to the pore. A recent study from Li et al. proposed that π-π interactions between Tyr-71, in the region connecting the TM1 segment to the extracellular region, and Trp-287, at the base of the thumb, provide functional coupling between the extracellular domain and the pore of the channel (9Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Voltage clamp fluorometry studies indicated that extracellular acidification triggers a conformational rearrangement in the pre-TM2 region, which correlates with channel activation (11Passero C.J. Okumura S. Carattino M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36473-36481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our studies extend this idea and provide insight into the molecular mechanism that mediates pore opening following extracellular acidification.Activation of G428C by MTS ReagentsWild-type ASIC1a and G428C reside in the resting and desensitized state at pH 7.4 and 7.0, respectively. The rate constant for the reaction of an MTS reagent and a Cys residue depends on the accessibility of the MTS reagent to the target Cys and the reactivity toward the Cys sulfhydryl group. However, a Cys residue could be covalently modified by a MTS reagent without a noticeable effect on function. For instance, MTSET elicited only a modest increase in current at pH 8.0 in oocytes expressing Y424C-G428A, although the sensitivity of the channel to extracellular pH was significantly altered (Fig. 9). Besides the accessibility and reactivity of the target Cys residue toward a MTS reagent, the likelihood of observing a change in function will likely depend on structural factors. The magnitude of the response to a change in extracellular pH from 7.4 to 5.0 was similar when G428C and Y424C-G428A were modified by MTSET at either pH 7.0 or pH 7.4 (Fig. 2i), suggesting that the reactivity and accessibility of the thiol groups was independent of the conformational state of the channel. Moreover, the reactivity of the target Cys depends on the state of protonation of the Cys sulfhydryl group, and it is preferential toward the thiolate anion. Independently of the pKa of the sulfhydryl group, the number of protonated groups should be higher at pH 7.0 than 7.4. The rate constants for the reaction of G428C and MTS reagents were faster at pH 7.0 than 7.4. Therefore, differences in the rate constant for the reaction of G428C and MTSET at pH 7.0 and 7.4 does not result from differences in the protonation state of the reactive sulfhydryl group. The rate constants for the reaction of G428C with MTSMT, MTSET, or MTSPT were similar to each other when performed at pH 7.0 or pH 7.4, suggesting that the accessibility to the target Cys is not dependent on the atomic volume of the MTS reagents. Our studies suggest that structural differences in the resting and desensitized states account for the observed changes in the reaction of MTS reagents with G428C.Coupling Extracellular Acidification to Pore OpeningTo gain insight into the mechanism of activation of G428C by positively charged MTS reagents we mutated residues in the pre-TM2 region and we studied the response evoked by MTSET. Substitutions at position 424 markedly affected the response of G428C to MTSET. Tyr-424 is localized in the extracellular-transmembrane domain interface with its side chain facing the interior of the outer vestibule of the pore. Our results showed that only channels with non-polar residues (Tyr, Phe, Leu, and Cys) at position 424 are electrically functional. Substitutions at this position with polar amino acids affected the surface expression of ASIC1a (Fig. 6). MTSET activated G428C and Y424F-G428C similarly (see Fig. 5c). However, the response to extracellular acidification was apparently reduced in Y424F-G428C compared with G428C, suggesting that Tyr-424 is important to couple proton binding in the extracellular region to pore opening. Phe and Tyr have a similar surface area, but they differ in their hydrophobic character and their ability to form hydrogen bonds. It is conceivable that during proton-dependent gating the hydroxyl group of Tyr-424 participates in the formation of a transient hydrogen bond. Alternatively, Tyr-424 may partition into or interact with the lipid bilayer during proton-dependent activation. Therefore, the hydrophobic character of the residue at position 424 may affect these protein-lipid interactions, and consequently proton-dependent gating of the channel.Mechanism of Activation of G428C by MTS ReagentsOur studies suggest that the transferable moiety of positively charged MTS reagents, when covalently attached to Cys-428, interacts with Tyr-424. Although a cation-π interaction between the positive charge of the transferable moiety and the benzene of Tyr may occur, it cannot explain the activation of Y424L-G428C by MTSET (24Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). The nature of the chemical entities involved in this interaction suggests that hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions do not play a substantial role in the activation of G428C channels by MTS reagents. We propose that steric repulsion between the transferable moiety of the MTS reagents and the side chain of Tyr-424 initiates a conformational rearrangement in the pre-TM2 region that gates the pore.MTSMT, MTSET, and MTSPT evoked an increase in current of similar magnitude in oocytes expressing G428C channels at pH 7.0, i.e. channels in the desensitized state. The rate constants for reaction of MTSMT, MTSET, and MTSPT were similar at pH 7.4. However, the magnitude of the response to positively charged MTS reagents in the resting state showed a strong dependence on the length of the transferable moiety of the MTS reagents. We propose that the magnitude of the response depends on the distance between the transferable moiety of the MTS attached at position 428 and the side chain of Tyr-424. The larger the moiety attached at position 428, the larger the steric repulsion generated with the side chain at position 424. Our data suggest that the distance between the interacting residues at positions 424 and 428 is different in the resting and desensitized states.Desensitization entails structural changes that mediate pore closing when extracellular pH drops below 7.4. The mechanism that mediates channel desensitization is unknown. Previous studies have shown that selected residues in the palm domain within the extracellular region of ASICs contribute to channel desensitization (25Coric T. Zhang P. Todorovic N. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45240-45247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Cushman K.A. Marsh-Haffner J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 17425-17431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Then, desensitization-mediated pore closing must be necessarily accomplished through a reorganization of the extracellular transmembrane domain interface, since this region connects the ectodomain to the pore-forming transmembrane domains. The differential effects that positively-charged MTS reagents have on G428C and Y424C-G428A at pH 7.0 and 7.4 suggest that during desensitization the pre-TM2 region reorganizes. Desensitization-mediated pore closing may be accomplished by this conformational change in the pre-TM2 region, or alternatively this reorganization could be secondary to other structural rearrangements linked to desensitization.Opening the Pore of mASIC1aWhile MTS reagents covalently modify Y424C and G428C, Y424C-G428C are activated by extracellular acidification, but are insensitive to MTSET. Our data suggest that the reduced macroscopic activity of Y424C-G428C, compared with G428C, is due to a significant reduction in the expression of the channel at the cell surface (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis showed that Y424C-G428C migrates under non-reducing conditions essentially as a homo-trimer stabilized by intersubunit disulfide bonds. Surprisingly, the apparent proton affinities for activation and desensitization of Y424C-G428C were similar to those of controls. It is possible that an undetectable pool of channels composed of non-linked subunits is responsible for the observed change in current in response to extracellular acidification in oocytes expressing Y424C-G428C. However, our data indicate that Y424C-G428A and functional G428C that also have a mutation at residues Lys-422, Tyr-424, or Glu-425 were modified by MTSET, the only exception was Y424C-G428C. We consider it unlikely that the lack of response of Y424C-G428C to MTSET is consequence of a structural change that limit MTSET access to the target Cys residues.The pore of ASIC1 in the presumed desensitized-like state has an hourglass shape, where the narrowest point of the hourglass is defined by the intersection of the TM2 segments (Fig. 5b). It is clear that conformational restrictions on the outer vestibule of the pore arising from intersubunit 424–428 disulfide bonds do not prevent the channel from cycling through the resting, open and desensitized states (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 7 and Table 1). Our data suggest that the distance between residues 424 and 428 (when not linked) varies between resting and desensitized states. With respect to the pore, these disulfide bonds would restrict any substantial radial TM2 tilt leading to pore widening (Fig. 10). However, a simultaneous twist of the TM2 helices to maintain good bond geometry could widen the pore in an aperture-like fashion (see Fig. 10). The transmembrane architecture of ASIC1 suggests that a modest circumferential TM2 tilt may be allowed during pore opening. We propose that such coordinated motions in the clockwise direction (from the extracellular perspective) mediate ion pore opening. Indeed, normal mode analysis, a computational approach to predict collective dynamics and inherent flexibilities in biological molecules, suggested that proton binding to the extracellular region of ASIC1 drives an intrinsic rotation of the TM segments (29Yang H. Yu Y. Li W.G. Yu F. Cao H. Xu T.L. Jiang H. PLoS. Biol. 2009; 7: e1000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In summary, our results indicate that opening of the ion pore could be accomplished by a concerted global rotation of the TM2 helices.

ASICs are members of the Epithelial Sodium Channel/Degenerin (ENaC/Deg) family, a large group of proteins that are implicated in mechanosensation, pain sensation, regulation of extracellular fluid volume, and airway surface liquid volume (2Lingueglia E.

Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). These channels are organized as homo- or hetero-trimers. Each subunit has two transmembrane segments (TMs) connected by a large extracellular region with the N and C termini on the intracellular side (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E.

ASICs are constitutively closed and undergo activation and desensitization in response to extracellular acidification. Seven ASIC subunits are expressed in mammals: ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC1b2, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4 (2Lingueglia E. Deval E. Lazdunski M. Peptides. 2006; 27: 1138-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of activation and desensitization by protons depend on the specific subunits forming the channel complex.The pore of ASIC1 in the presumed desensitized-like state has an hourglass-like shape defined mainly by residues from TM2, although residues from TM1 form a portion of the outer vestibule (6Jasti J.

The TM2 helices are tilted by a ∼50° angle from the membrane normal, and their intersection likely constitutes the desensitization gate. The TM1 segments are in contact with the lipid bilayer and with the TM2 segments in their own and neighboring subunits. Compelling evidence suggests that ASIC activation involves protonation of multiple residues within the extracellular region of the protein (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E.

A fundamental question regarding the mechanism of gating of ENaC/Deg channels is how extracellular cues trigger pore opening and closing events. The extracellular region of ASIC1 is organized in discrete subdomains referred to as the palm, the β-ball, the knuckle, the thumb, and the finger (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The thumb is a cylindrical structure with two anti-parallel α helices stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds, and is located between the putative proton-binding sites and the transmembrane helices. Jasti et al. (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) proposed that residues in the thumb domain mediate functional coupling between the proton-binding sites and the ion pore. Non-conserved substitutions of Trp-288, at the base of the thumb domain, or Tyr-71, in the region connecting TM1 to the extracellular region, disrupt proton-dependent gating (9Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whether pore opening is mediated by a coordinated rearrangement of the TM1 segments or by another mechanism remains unknown.In this study, we explored the reactivity to methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of channels bearing Cys mutations in the outer vestibule of the pore. Positively charged MTS reagents triggered pore opening of G428C. Double-mutant cycle analysis indicated that the MTSET-modified side chain of Cys at position 428 interacts with Tyr-424, in the region preceding TM2 (pre-TM2). Western blot analysis of the double Cys mutant Y424C-G428C established the presence of intersubunit disulfide bonds, though the apparent proton affinity for activation and desensitization of these channels was similar to controls. This finding implies a geometric constraint that supports a model in which ion permeation is accomplished by coordinated rotation of the TM2 segments."
https://openalex.org/W2107060271,"Heterochromatin consists of highly ordered nucleosomes with characteristic histone modifications. There is evidence implicating chromatin remodeling proteins in heterochromatin formation, but their exact roles are not clear. We demonstrate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the Fun30p and Isw1p chromatin remodeling factors are similarly required for transcriptional silencing at the HML locus, but they differentially contribute to the structure and stability of HML heterochromatin. In the absence of Fun30p, only a partially silenced structure is established at HML. Such a structure resembles fully silenced heterochromatin in histone modifications but differs markedly from both fully silenced and derepressed chromatin structures regarding nucleosome arrangement. This structure likely represents an intermediate state of heterochromatin that can be converted by Fun30p to the mature state. Moreover, Fun30p removal reduces the rate of de novo establishment of heterochromatin, suggesting that Fun30p assists the silencing machinery in forming heterochromatin. We also find evidence suggesting that Fun30p functions together with, or after, the action of the silencing machinery. On the other hand, Isw1p is dispensable for the formation of heterochromatin structure but is instead critically required for maintaining its stability. Therefore, chromatin remodeling proteins may rearrange nucleosomes during the formation of heterochromatin or serve to stabilize/maintain heterochromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2012413660,"We demonstrated previously that GEC1, a member of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) family, bound to the human κ opioid receptor (hKOPR) and promoted hKOPR cell surface expression by facilitating its trafficking along the secretory pathway. GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), a GEC1 analog, also enhanced KOPR expression, but to a lesser extent. The MAP family proteins undergo cleavage of their C-terminal residue(s), and the exposed conserved glycine forms conjugates with phosphatidylethanolamine, which associate with membranes. Here, we examined whether such modifications were required for GEC1 and GABARAP to enhance hKOPR expression. When transiently transfected into CHO or Neuro2A cells, GEC1 and GABARAP were cleaved at the C termini. G116A mutation alone or combined with deletion of Lys117 in GEC1 (GEC1-A) or Leu117 in GABARAP (GABARAP-A) blocked their C-terminal cleavage, indicating that the conserved Gly116 is necessary for C-terminal modification. The two GEC1 mutants enhanced hKOPR expression to similar extents as the wild-type GEC1; however, the two GABARAP mutants did not. Immunofluorescence studies showed that HA-GEC1, HA-GEC1-A, and HA-GABARAP were distributed in a punctate manner and co-localized with KOPR-EGFP in the Golgi apparatus, whereas HA-GABARAP-A did not. Pulldown assay of GST-KOPR-C-tail with HA-GEC1 or HA-GABARAP revealed that GEC1 had stronger association with KOPR-C-tail than GABARAP. These results suggest that because of its stronger binding for hKOPR, GEC1 is able to be recruited by hKOPR sufficiently without membrane association via its C-terminal modification; however, due to its weaker affinity for the hKOPR, GABARAP appears to require C-terminal modifications to enhance KOPR expression.

https://openalex.org/W2045607014,"The phenylacetic acid (PAA) degradation pathway is the sole aerobic route for phenylacetic acid metabolism in bacteria and facilitates degradation of environmental pollutants such as styrene and ethylbenzene. The PAA pathway also is implicated in promoting Burkholderia cenocepacia infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Intriguingly, the first enzyme in the PAA pathway is present in two copies (paaK1 and paaK2), yet each subsequent enzyme is present in only a single copy. Furthermore, sequence divergence indicates that PaaK1 and PaaK2 form a unique subgroup within the adenylate-forming enzyme (AFE) superfamily. To establish a biochemical rationale for the existence of the PaaK paralogs in B. cenocepacia, we present high resolution x-ray crystal structures of a selenomethionine derivative of PaaK1 in complex with ATP and adenylated phenylacetate intermediate complexes of PaaK1 and PaaK2 in distinct conformations. Structural analysis reveals a novel N-terminal microdomain that may serve to recruit subsequent PAA enzymes, whereas a bifunctional role is proposed for the P-loop in stabilizing the C-terminal domain in conformation 2. The potential for different kinetic profiles was suggested by a structurally divergent extension of the aryl substrate pocket in PaaK1 relative to PaaK2. Functional characterization confirmed this prediction, with PaaK1 possessing a lower Km for phenylacetic acid and better able to accommodate 3′ and 4′ substitutions on the phenyl ring.

https://openalex.org/W1978501724,"Several studies have clearly established the importance of the interaction between macrophages and CX3CL1 in the progression of disease. A previous study demonstrated that Syk was required for CX3CL1-mediated actin polymerization and chemotaxis. Here, we delineated the signaling cascade of Syk-mediated cell migration in response to CX3CL1. Inhibition of Syk in bone marrow-derived macrophages or reduction of Syk expression using siRNA in RAW/LR5 cells indicated that Syk was required for the activation of PI3K, Cdc42, and Rac1. Also, reduction in WASP or WAVE2 levels, common downstream effectors of Cdc42 or Rac1, resulted in impaired cell migration to CX3CL1. Syk indirectly regulated WASP tyrosine phosphorylation through Cdc42 activation. Altogether, our data identify that Syk mediated chemotaxis toward CX3CL1 by regulating both Rac1/WAVE2 and Cdc42/WASP pathways, whereas Src family kinases were required for proper WASP tyrosine phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2035068250,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR-3) expression in the developing intestine is restricted to the undifferentiated epithelial cells within the lower portion of the crypt. We previously showed that mice lacking functional FGFR-3 have a significant decrease in the number of Paneth cells in the small intestine. Here, we used Caco2 cells to investigate whether FGFR-3 signaling can directly modulate expression of Paneth cell differentiation markers through its effects on TCF4/β-catenin or through other signaling pathways downstream of this receptor. Caco2 cells treated with FGFR-3 ligands or expressing FGFR-3(K650E), a constitutively active mutant, resulted in a significantly increased expression of genes characteristic of mature Paneth cells, including human α-defensins 5 and 6 (HD5 and HD6) and Paneth cell lysozyme, whereas enterocytic differentiation markers were reduced. Activation of FGFR-3 signaling sustained high levels of β-catenin mRNA expression, leading to increased TCF4/β-catenin-regulated transcriptional activity in Caco2 cells. Sustained activity of the TCF4/β-catenin pathway was required for the induction of Paneth cell markers. Activation of the MAPK pathway by FGFR-3 is also required for the induction of Paneth cell markers in addition to and independent of the effect of FGFR-3 on TCF4/β-catenin activity. These studies suggest that coordinate activation of multiple independent signaling pathways downstream of FGFR-3 is involved in regulation of Paneth cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2027720382,"The calcium- and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) is a ubiquitous Ca(2+)-binding protein and a specific binding partner for the platelet integrin αIIb cytoplasmic domain, which confers the key role of CIB1 in hemostasis. CIB1 is also known to be involved in apoptosis, embryogenesis, and the DNA damage response. In this study, the solution structures of both Ca(2+)-CIB1 and Mg(2+)-CIB1 were determined using solution-state NMR spectroscopy. The methyl groups of Ile, Leu, and Val were selectively protonated to compensate for the loss of protons due to deuteration. The solution structure of Ca(2+)-CIB1 possesses smaller opened EF-hands in its C-domain compared with available crystal structures. Ca(2+)-CIB1 and Mg(2+)-CIB1 have similar structures, but the N-lobe of Mg(2+)-CIB1 is slightly more opened than that of Ca(2+)-CIB1. Additional NMR experiments, such as chemical shift perturbation and methyl group solvent accessibility as measured by a nitroxide surface probe, were carried out to further characterize the structures of Ca(2+)-CIB1 and Mg(2+)-CIB1 as well as their interactions with the integrin αIIb cytoplasmic domain. NMR measurements of backbone amide proton slow motion (microsecond to millisecond) dynamics confirmed that the C-terminal helix of Ca(2+)-CIB1 is displaced upon αIIb binding. The EF-hand III of both Ca(2+)-CIB1 and Mg(2+)-CIB1 was identified to be directly involved in the interaction of CIB1 with αIIb. Together, these data illustrate that CIB1 behaves quite differently from related EF-hand regulatory calcium-binding proteins, such as calmodulin or neuronal calcium sensor proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2039342414,"GTP-bound forms of Ras family small GTPases exhibit dynamic equilibrium between two interconverting conformations, ""inactive"" state 1 and ""active"" state 2. A great variation exists in their state distribution; H-Ras mainly adopts state 2, whereas M-Ras predominantly adopts state 1. Our previous studies based on comparison of crystal structures representing state 1 and state 2 revealed the importance of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of two flexible effector-interacting regions, switch I and switch II, with the γ-phosphate of GTP in establishing state 2 conformation. However, failure to obtain both state structures from a single protein hampered further analysis of state transition mechanisms. Here, we succeed in solving two crystal structures corresponding to state 1 and state 2 from a single Ras polypeptide, M-RasD41E, carrying an H-Ras-type substitution in residue 41, immediately preceding switch I, in complex with guanosine 5'-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. Comparison among the two structures and other state 1 and state 2 structures of H-Ras/M-Ras reveal two new structural features playing critical roles in state dynamics; interaction of residues 31/41 (H-Ras/M-Ras) with residues 29/39 and 30/40, which induces a conformational change of switch I favoring its interaction with the γ-phosphate, and the hydrogen-bonding interaction of switch II with its neighboring α-helix, α3-helix, which induces a conformational change of switch II favoring its interaction with the γ-phosphate. The importance of the latter interaction is proved by mutational analyses of the residues involved in hydrogen bonding. These results define the two novel functional regions playing critical roles during state transition."
https://openalex.org/W1976062189,"Multiple MAP kinase pathways share components yet initiate distinct biological processes. Signaling fidelity can be maintained by scaffold proteins and restriction of signaling complexes to discreet subcellular locations. For example, the yeast MAP kinase scaffold Ste5 binds to phospholipids produced at the plasma membrane and promotes selective MAP kinase activation. Here we show that Pik1, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase that localizes primarily to the Golgi, also regulates MAP kinase specificity but does so independently of Ste5. Pik1 is required for full activation of the MAP kinases Fus3 and Hog1 and represses activation of Kss1. Further, we show by genetic epistasis analysis that Pik1 likely regulates Ste11 and Ste50, components shared by all three MAP kinase pathways, through their interaction with the scaffold protein Opy2. These findings reveal a new regulator of signaling specificity functioning at endomembranes rather than at the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1966000010,"The encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is the causative agent of cryptococosis, an opportunistic life-threatening infection. C. neoformans is coated by a polysaccharide capsule mainly composed of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). GXM is considered a key virulence factor of this pathogen. The present work aimed at evaluating the effects of GXM on the key glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK). GXM inhibited PFK activity in cultured murine macrophages in both dose- and time-dependent manners, which occurred in parallel to cell viability decrease. The polysaccharide also inhibited purified PFK, promoting a decrease on the enzyme affinity for its substrates. In macrophages GXM and PFK partially co-localized, suggesting that internalized polysaccharide directly may interact with this enzyme. The mechanism of PFK inhibition involved dissociation of tetramers into weakly active dimers, as revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Allosteric modulators of the enzyme able to stabilize its tetrameric conformation attenuated the inhibition promoted by GXM. Altogether, our results suggest that the mechanism of GXM-induced cell death involves the inhibition of the glycolytic flux."
