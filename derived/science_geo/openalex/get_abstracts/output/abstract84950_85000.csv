https://openalex.org/W1507851645,"Yeast mitochondria were fractionated into inner membrane, outer membrane, matrix, and intermembrane space. Identity and purity of each fraction were monitored by enzyme assays, dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunological detection of characteristic mitochondrial polypeptides. Cytochrome b2 and cytochrome c peroxidase were found to be components of the intermembrane space. The most reliable marker of the outer membrane was a major 29,000-dalton polypeptide component. The availability of submitochondrial fractions provides a basis for studying import of precursor polypeptides into isolated yeast mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1527297959,"The addition of thrombin to horse platelets prelabeled with 32P induces a rapid decrease of the radioactivity from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Maximum loss of the radioactivity from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate occurs with 10 s of stimulation and is followed by an increased incorporation of 32P into this lipid. The stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate loss by thrombin is concentration-dependent. The ionophore A23187, which mobilizes Ca2+, is ineffective in inducing the degradation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Measurements of polyphosphoinositides by phosphorus estimation show that, 10 s after thrombin stimulation, there is a decrease of 15-20% of the total phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate without any significant change in phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate. It appears that thrombin causes a rapid and transient degradation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and that this effect might be related to the initiation of platelet activation."

As a result of Southern blot hybridization of a c-sis probe to DNA's from mouse-human somatic cell hybrids, the human homolog (c-sis) of the transforming gene of simian sarcoma virus was assigned to chromosome 22. Hybrids between thymidine kinase-deficient mouse cells and human fibroblasts carrying a translocation of the region q11-qter of chromosome 22 to chromosome 17 were also analyzed. These studies demonstrate that the human c-sis gene is on region 22q11 greater than qter."
https://openalex.org/W1573917001,"The apoprotein of yeast cytochrome c1 is made outside the mitochondria as a larger precursor which is then processed in at least two steps. In the first step, it is transported across both mitochondrial membranes and converted by a matrix-localized protease to an intermediate form whose molecular weight is between that of the precursor and the mature form. The intermediate form is bound to the outer face of the inner membrane. This first step requires an energized mitochondrial inner membrane, but no heme. In the second step, the intermediate form is converted to the mature cytochrome. This second step requires heme; it is blocked in a heme-deficient mutant or in wild type cells treated with an inhibitor of heme synthesis. Import of cytochrome c1 into mitochondria thus proceeds via two distinct heme-free precursors and at least two maturation steps, one of them dependent on heme."
https://openalex.org/W2068832721,"The contractile response of the guinea pig vas deferens to motor nerve stimulation is biphasic. The first phase is antagonized by the specific adenosine triphosphate-receptor antagonist arylazido aminoproprionyl adenosine triphosphate (ANAPP3), and the second by the alpha-receptor antagonist prazosin. The underlying electrical event, the excitatory junction potential, is also blocked by ANAPP3, but not by prazosin."
https://openalex.org/W2067810731,"The action of desipramine on the norepinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase system and the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat cortex was studied after selective lesioning of serotonergic neurons with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. In animals with lesions desipramine failed to reduce the density of beta-adrenoceptors but decreased the response of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate to isoproterenol and norepinephrine to the same degree as in animals without lesions. The results demonstrate a functional linkage between serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the rat cortex, with beta-adrenergic receptors and neurohormonal sensitivity of the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-generating system being under separate regulatory control."
https://openalex.org/W2032295252,"We have analyzed the structures of 19 mutant alleles at the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster. Thirteen of the mutant alleles in our selected sample arose spontaneously, and of these, seven are associated with insertions of non-white-region DNA sequence elements. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that these insertions are responsible for their associated mutant alleles, and further suggest that most or all of these insertions are transposons. Moreover, the white locus DNA sequences can be divided into two nonoverlapping domains on the basis of the properties of the two domains as mutational targets. One of these domains behaves, in this regard, in the manner expected of functional coding sequences, whereas the other does not. We propose a model for the nature and function of the presumptive noncoding white locus genetic elements. The two domains of the white locus defined by our studies are approximately coextensive with the functionally distinct subintervals of the locus defined by previous genetic analysis. Lastly, our results strongly suggest that the dominant, mutable wDZL allele results from the insertion of a transposon outside of, but near, the white locus. This putative transposon apparently carries genetic elements that act at a distance to repress expression of the white locus."
https://openalex.org/W2010586398,"We have developed a monoclonal antibody that detects the first human B-cell-specific differentiation antigen expressed on transformed B lymphoblasts. The antigen is termed B-LAST 1 and is found on B cells transformed in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and pokeweed mitogen; in vivo with EBV and antigen; and on neoplastic B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and poorly differentiated lymphoma. The antigen has a molecular weight of 45,000 and was not found on cells of T, null or myeloid lineage, whether obtained from peripheral blood, lymph nodes, neoplasms or cell lines. The antigen is expressed at a much higher level on EBV-infected cells than on any other cell type studied, but does not appear to be virally encoded. The significance of this antigen in the process of viral and nonviral transformation and its possible role as a target for T-cell-mediated immunity against virus-infected cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1495163505,"This paper describes a sensitive method for study of the isoelectric point and molecular weight of immunoreactive low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors of cultured human fibroblasts. The fibroblast receptors are solubilized with Triton X-100, partially purified by batch elution from DEAE-cellulose, and subjected to two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins are transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper which is then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG-C7) directed against the LDL receptor, followed by an 125I-labeled antibody against mouse IgG. The receptor-bound monoclonal antibody is localized by autoradiography. By this technique, the immunodetectable LDL receptors from normal human fibroblasts migrate as a single spot with an isoelectric point of 4.3 and a Mr of approximately 160,000. In one patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia whose cells fail to bind 125I-labeled IgG-C7, no immunoreactive LDL receptor spot was detected after electrophoresis. We also studied LDL receptors from three homozygotes whose cells bind 125I-IgG-C7, i.e. cross-reacting material-positive mutants. Their immunodetectable receptors were indistinguishable from normal receptors in terms of isoelectric point and molecular weight. Similarly, the receptors from one patient with the internalization-defective form of familial hypercholesterolemia showed normal electrophoretic migration. The immunoblotting technique should prove useful in analyzing structural alterations, if they exist, in LDL receptors from other subjects with cross-reacting material-positive forms of familial hypercholesterolemia."

https://openalex.org/W1587611886,"DNA restriction fragments containing nitrogen fixation (nifi genes of the cyanobacterium Anabaena 7120 were isolated as inserts in bacteriophage X, using plasmids containing Klebsiella pneumoniae nif genes as heterologous hybridization probes. Four contiguous E m RI fragments, comprising a 39-kilobase pair segment of the Anabaena chromosome, were physically mapped and those regions homologous to IL pneumoniae nif genes were identified by Southern hybridization and by electron microscope examination of heteroduplex DNA molecules. Regions of Anabaena DNA were found homologous to the following K. pneumoniae nif genes: nif H, the structural gene for nitrogenase reductase; nif D and nif K, the structural genes for the two subunits of nitrogenase; and either nif V or nif S, genes whose products are required for the maturation of nitrogenase. The four Anabaena nif genes so identified are transcribed in the same direction, as is the case in K. pneumoniae. However, the genes are rearranged with respect to the map of K. pneumoniae. In K. pneumoniae, nif H, nif D, and nif K are adjacent and cotranscribed. In Anabaena, nif H and nif D are adjacent but nif K is separated from nif D by 11 kilobase pairs of DNA. In K. pneumoniae, the nif V-nif S genes are to the left of the nif HDK cluster, while in Anabaena, the homologous region is to the right of the nif H gene. Hybridization of labeled subclones of Anabaena DNA to filter-bound RNA prepared from cells induced for nitrogenase indicated that most of the 11 kilobase pairs between nif K and nif D are not transcribed, while fragments containing the identified nif genes are transcribed abundantly. An additional fragment of Anabaena 7120 DNA was isolated, in recombinant X, which is apparently unlinked to the 39-kilobase pair region described above. This fragment contains a region homologous to K. pneumoniae nif H, but not to nif D. The restriction map of the nif H-homologous region of this Anabaena fragment is different from that of the nif H gene described above."
https://openalex.org/W1577047807,"Cytoplasmically synthesized precursors of mitochondrial polypeptides have previously been observed in trace amounts after pulse labeling of yeast spheroplasts or after in vitro translation of yeast mRNA (Maccecchini, M. L., Rudin, Y., Blobel, G., and Schatz, G. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 343-347). Some of these precursors are shown here to accumulate in large amounts (up to 150 micrograms/g of cell protein) during growth of a cytoplasmic petite (rho-) mutant in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome c1 precursor accumulated under these conditions is unstable; it is degraded with a half-life of about 10 min. In contrast, the F1-ATPase beta-subunit precursor is degraded considerably more slowly and, following removal of the uncoupler, can be post-translationally imported into mitochondria where it is processed to the mature polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1542790713,"The interaction of TiTx gamma, the major toxin in the venom of the scorpion Tityus serrulatus, with its receptor in excitable membranes was studied with the use of 125I-TiTx gamma. This derivative retains biological activity, and its specific binding to both brain synaptosomes and electroplaque membranes from Electrophorus electricus is characterized by a dissociation constant equal to that of the native toxin-receptor complex, about 2 to 5 pM. This very high affinity results mainly from a very slow rate of dissociation, equivalent to a half-life longer than 10 h at 4 degrees C. There is a 1:1 stoichiometry between TiTx gamma binding and tetrodotoxin binding to the membranes, but neither tetrodotoxin nor any of 7 other neurotoxins that are representative of 4 different classes of effectors of the Na+ channel interfere with TiTx gamma binding. Similarly, local anesthetics and other molecules that affect other types of ionic channels or neurotransmitter receptors have no effect on TiTx gamma binding. However, toxin II from Centruroides suffusus suffusus does compete with TiTx gamma, though its affinity for the receptor is much lower. Since the Centruroides toxin II is known to affect Na+ channel function, these two scorpion toxins must be put into a fifth class of Na+ channel effectors."

https://openalex.org/W2018663456,"Regulation of cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis has been examined in chondroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus. Cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature synthesized large amounts of several chondroblast-specific polypeptides (type IV proteoglycan core protein, type II procollagen, a proteoglycan link protein(s) and a 60 kd protein) and very low levels of fibronectin. At the permissive temperature, synthesis of chondroblast-specific proteins was coordinately reduced, while fibronectin synthesis was greatly increased. These changes reflected comparable alterations in levels of translatable mRNAs encoding these proteins. This analysis also revealed the unexpected presence in the transformed cells of type I collagen mRNAs, which are not used in intact cells, indicating that a posttranscriptional control (or controls) may be acting in transformed chondroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1535154106,"Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II, catecholamines, and vasopressin can stimulate the phosphorylation of hepatic cytosolic proteins via a Ca2+-linked cyclic AMP-independent mechanism. The present study used high resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to determine if the proteins phosphorylated in response to the Ca2+-linked hormones were distinct from those affected by glucagon acting via the cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. Intact hepatocytes labeled with [32P]PO4(3-) were stimulated with glucagon, angiotensin II, l-norepinephrine, and vasopressin and over 100 phosphorylated proteins resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and autoradiography. Six important enzymes known to be regulated through covalent modification were positively identified, including phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-6-phosphate, 2-kinase, phenylalanine hydroxylase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Computer analysis of the autoradiograms from control and hormone-treated cells demonstrated that glucagon increased the phosphorylation state of 12 phosphoproteins and reduced the phosphorylation of one protein with a Mr = 21,000 and a pI = 5.9. The Ca2+-linked hormones stimulated the phosphorylation of 7 phosphoproteins and also reduced the phosphorylation state of the 21,000-dalton protein. Angiotensin II, l-norepinephrine, and vasopressin had equivalent effects on protein phosphorylation. There were six protein substrates uniquely affected by glucagon and one phosphoprotein uniquely stimulated by the Ca2+-linked hormones. Seven substrates were affected by stimulation of the cell with either glucagon or the Ca2+-linked hormones. These results demonstrate that, while there is overlap in the substrates affected by glucagon and the Ca2+-linked hormones, each pathway is able to affect the phosphorylation of unique substrates. This finding suggests that the two types of hormones may have some distinct effects on hepatic function.U"
https://openalex.org/W2063504786,"Eleven cDNA clones identified from a cDNA library prepared from the mRNA fraction of SV40 transformed cells detected, by hybridization, higher levels of cellular mRNA in SV40-transformed cells than in nontransformed cells. Three of these cDNA clones detected levels of cellular mRNA that were more than 100-fold greater in SV40tsA transformed cell lines grown at the permissive temperature than in those grown at the nonpermissive temperature. Northern blot hybridizations confirmed these results and in some cases detected RNA species of multiple sizes that were regulated in a temperature-dependent fashion in SV40tsA transformed cell lines. Infection of 3T3 cells with SV40 stimulated the levels of RNAs complementary to these cDNA clones. The results demonstrate that the SV40 large T antigen can regulate the steady state levels of some cellular RNA species."
https://openalex.org/W1489237559,"The import of cytochrome b2 and cytochrome c peroxidase into mitochondria was investigated by pulse-chase experiments with intact yeast cells combined with subcellular fractionation. Import and processing of the precursors of these intermembrane space proteins is blocked by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that an energized inner membrane is required. Cytochrome b2 is processed in two steps. The first step involves energy-dependent transport across both mitochondrial membranes and cleavage by a matrix-located protease to yield an intermediate which is smaller than the precursor, but larger than the mature protein. The second step involves conversion of the intermediate to the mature form. Whereas the precursor and the mature form are soluble, the intermediate is membrane-bound and exposed to the intermembrane space. The maturation of cytochrome c peroxidase is much slower than that of cytochrome b2. Proteolytic processing rather than import is rate-limiting since cytochrome c peroxidase precursor labeled during a 3-min pulse is already found attached to the outer face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Import of cytochrome b2 and probably also of cytochrome c peroxidase thus involves energy-dependent transport to the matrix and cleavage by a matrix-localized protease. Maturation of cytochrome b2 proceeds in the sequence: soluble precursor leads to membrane-bound intermediate form leads to soluble mature form."
https://openalex.org/W1491918952,"When purified on a sucrose gradient, basolateral membranes from dog kidney outer medulla are found to be very rich in (Na,K)-ATPase; about 50% of the membrane protein is comprised of this enzyme. (Na,K)-ATPase activity is activated 3- to 5-fold by detergent treatment, and this has been previously attributed to the impermeable vesicular nature of the membranes. Porcine trypsin inactivates only that fraction of (Na,K)-ATPase activity seen without detergent, consistent with a right-side-out orientation of membrane vesicles; the trypsin sensitivity and detergent activation of [3H]ouabain binding in the presence of Na+ + Mg2+ + ATP or Mg2+ + Pi are also consistent with this hypothesis. Using nearly isosmotic Hypaque density gradient centrifugation a population of impermeable right-side-out membrane vesicles (H1) is separated from a leaky population (H2). (Na,K)-ATPase activity in the H1 population is 20-fold activated by detergent and insensitive to porcine trypsin. The vesicle volume is 2.4 microliters/mg, and monovalent cations passively equilibrate with the intravesicular volume on a time scale of 5-30 min. Very rapid ouabain sensitive 22Na efflux from the vesicles is observed when ATP is photolytically released from intravesicular caged ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1555467483,Cytochrome oxidase from the thermophilic bacterium PS3 which contains three types of polypeptide subunits are reconstituted into liposomes by a freeze-thaw technique. The reconstituted enzyme caused acidification of the medium during cytochrome c oxidation with a stoichiometry of up to 0.8 H+/e. Uptake of K+ ions in the presence of valinomycin occurred with a stoichiometry between 1.5 and 2 K+/e. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited the acidification and decreased the stoichiometry of K+ ion uptake to about 1 K+/e. This bacterial oxidase thus appears to be a proton pump with properties similar to the mitochondrial enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W2048518220,"A plasmid, pHR402, containing SV40 sequences that include a truncated early region bearing an intact t-coding sequence and a functionally intact late region, was introduced into thymidine kinase deficient (tk-) mouse L cells by cotransformation with a cloned tk gene. tk+ cotransformants synthesized SV40 t but not T antigen, and no truncated T-coding sequence products were detected. The viral sequences of pHR402 were reconstituted as a virus in COS1 cells, and acute infection of untransformed mouse cells with this viral stock (SV402) also led to the appearance of t but not T or a truncated T. Abortive transformation assays of such infected cells were negative, as were those performed on the same cells infected with either of two viral mutants (dl883 and dl884), each of which leads to T but not t synthesis. However, mixed infection with SV402 and either dl883 or dl884 led to a clear abortive and permanent transformation response. Thus, at least in part, t and T appear to function in a complementary fashion in eliciting transformation expression by SV40-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064597739,"The DNA insertions that cause the highly unstable mutations wc and wDZL share extensive homology with the FB family of transposable elements. FB elements carry long, internally repetitious, inverted terminal repeats and thus differ in structure from other transposable elements. Our results suggest that FB elements may excise and cause chromosomal rearrangements at unusually high frequencies. The wc insertion is a single FB element. The wDZL insertion differs in that it contains two FB elements, one at each terminus. The wc and wDZL insertions contain 4.0 and 6.5 kilobase nonhomologous segments between their terminal repeats. In contrast to the middle repetitive FB elements, the central segment of the wDZL insertion is single-copy and present at a fixed location in the wild-type genome. It has apparently been transposed by the action of flanking FB elements, causing the wDZL mutation at its new location."
https://openalex.org/W1971598247,"We show that DNA gyrase is required for transposition of Tn5. Coumermycin, a potent inhibitor of DNA gyrase subunit B, inhibits transposition in a wild-type strain, but has no effect on strains carrying a coumermycin-resistant allele in gyrB. In addition, strains containing a thermolabile subunit A of gyrase (gyrA43) are defective for transposition at a nonpermissive temperature. The requirement for gyrase is due to a requirement for supercoiled DNA. We showed this by introducing into the gyrA43 strain a deletion of the gene encoding topoisomerase I. The introduction of the second mutation caused an increase in the superhelical density of DNA as well as an increase in the transposition frequency. This also implies that if the DNA is supercoiled there is no further requirement for gyrase. Experiments with coumermycin support this, because the drug does not inhibit transposition if the recipient DNA remains supercoiled. This indicates that if the DNA acting as recipient of the transposon is deficient in supercoils, it will be a poor substrate for transposition. We also describe a system in which a gene on a multicopy plasmid can be efficiently introduced into the Escherichia coli chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1969927989,"The white locus in Drosophila is required for a normal brick-red eye color; deletions of this locus result in a bleached-white eye color. The white-crimson (wc) allele of white was isolated as a partial revertant of another mutant white allele, white-ivory (wi), a mutation due to duplication of sequences within the white locus. The wc allele reverts at high frequencies to wild-type and wi phenotypes and generates white-eyed derivatives, including deletions with one endpoint at the white locus. We analyzed the structure of the wc allele by molecular cloning and by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA and found that the wc phenotype results from the insertion of a 10 kilobase DNA sequence into the wi duplication. Five independent phenotypic revertants of wc to wi were examined, and in each case reversion was accompanied by apparently precise excision of the insertion. Reversion of wc to a wild-type phenotype in each of the six cases examined was mediated by excision of both the insertion and one copy of the wi duplication, restoring gene structure to wild-type."
https://openalex.org/W1972585407,"One cloned cDNA sequence, pCt63, was used to characterize the repeated structure of the Balbiani ring 2 gene in Chironomus tentans. Although small in size (0.63 kb), the cDNA insert corresponds to a large portion (25 kb) of the BR2 gene (37 kb). Southern blotting experiments suggested that a large part of the BR2 gene consists of tandemly repeated units, each about 215 bp. Sequence analysis of the cDNA confirmed the repeated nature of the BR2 gene and revealed the internal structure of the repeat unit. Each such unit is composed of two regions of approximately equal length; one is highly ordered and built from about six 18 bp repeats, each consisting of a slightly diverged 9 bp duplication. The recorded hierarchic arrangement of the repetitive sequences in the BR2 gene and a specific pattern of base substitutions along the gene have enabled us to propose how a major part of the giant BR2 gene has evolved from a short primordial sequence, 110-120 bp in length."
https://openalex.org/W1539775929,"The extent of phosphorylation of protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 in skeletal muscle rose about 2.5-fold during 60 min of perfusion of the rat hemicorpus preparation and then did not change over the following 30 min. Addition of insulin at 60 min resulted in a 35% fall in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation by 90 min. The rise in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation was due to the presence of catecholamines as evidenced by an accumulation of epinephrine in the perfusate. Removal of the adrenal glands or cannulation of the vena cava prevented the accumulation of epinephrine and the rise in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation. Insulin did not alter the phosphorylation state of inhibitor-1 in the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol where the degree of phosphorylation was low (less than 10%) or at concentrations of isoproterenol (10 nM) where inhibitor-1 was highly phosphorylated (greater than 60%). In preparations with the adrenal glands removed, 0.5 nM isoproterenol produced a 2-fold rise in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation, an effect that was completely prevented by the addition of insulin. The antagonism of 0.5 nM idoproterenol by insulin correlated with a decrease in the muscle content of cyclic AMP. These results suggest that the dephosphorylation of inhibitor-1 may play an important role in the metabolic effects of insulin in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1524097923,"Recent studies on calcium-activated protease (CAF) have indicated that there are two forms of this enzyme, one requiring millimolar levels of Ca2+ and one requiring micromolar levels of Ca2+ for maximal activation. We have attempted to elucidate the biochemical nature of the difference between the two forms by the use of one dimensional peptide maps and immunoautoradiography, and have found that the 80,000-dalton subunits from the two forms differ substantially while the 30,000-dalton subunit appear to be identical."
https://openalex.org/W2009370363,"We have analyzed the lesion in wDZL, a genetically unstable mutant allele of the eye color locus, white, of Drosophila melanogaster. We have cloned the DNA of the white locus region of flies carrying the wDZL allele and find a 13 kilobase insertion not present in the wild-type at the corresponding location. In 12 independent cases examined, reversion to a wild-type eye color phenotype correlates with the excision of a portion of this 13 kilobase insertion, indicating that the insertion is the cause of the mutation. The portion of the insertion that is excised in these eye color revertants is heterogeneous in size but appears to include the central 6 kilobases of the insertion in all cases. Many of these eye color revertants continue to undergo mutation at the white locus, indicating that the residual portion of the insertion in these revertants is sufficient to promote mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2081830124,"We have demonstrated that a SV40-pBR322 recombinant vector (pSV2-gpt) carrying a bacterial gene of selectable phenotype (Eco-gpt) may persist extrachromosomally in COS1 cells, a simian cell line that endogenously produces SV40 large T antigen. The amount of circular (supercoiled) recombinant DNA was estimated to be between 5 and 2000 copies per cell among several pSV2-transformed COS1 clonal lines examined. Complete pSV2 molecules were found in the majority of the transformants, although some of the pSV2 DNAs recovered were shown to have deletions in the pBR322 region. Our results indicate that removal of the pBR322 “inhibitory sequence” in pSV2 is not necessary for stable maintenance of these recombinant molecules in COS1 cells. In addition, large amounts of pSV2-related high molecular weight DNAs, probably concatemers of pSV2, were detected in the transformed lines."

https://openalex.org/W1996792029,"Abstract A tRNA coding locus in the Bam-Sal 9 region of Euglena gracilis Pringsheim strain Z chloroplast DNA was chosen for detailed study. This DNA contains the previously mapped tRNA coding sequences of the adjacent Euglena chloroplast EcoRI products of EcoV and EcoH (Orozco, E. M., Jr., and Hallick, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3258-3264). The 3.2-kilobase pair Bam-Sal 9 fragment was cloned into the BamHI and SalI cut plasmid vector pBR322, resulting in the recombined plasmid pPG76. The tRNA coding locus was mapped to a region of Bam-Sal 9 that contains portions of both EcoH and EcoV. The DNA sequence of 1-kilobase pair Bam-Sal 9, containing the entire tRNA coding locus, was determined. A cluster of six tRNA genes was found. The gene organization is as follows, where bp is base pair: tRNATyrGUA-64 bp spacer-tRNAHisGUG-14 bp spacer-tRNAMetCAU-4 bp spacer-tRNATrpCCA-27 bp spacer-tRNAGluUUC-6 bp spacer-tRNAGlyUCC. The tRNAMetCAU is believed to be an elongator tRNA. The first four genes are within EcoV. The EcoRI cleavage site that separates EcoV and EcoH is in the tRNAGlu gene. The tRNAGly gene is in EcoH. This is the largest known chloroplast tRNA gene cluster."

https://openalex.org/W1579917521,"Cytochrome c1aa3 from Thermus thermophilus has optical and EPR properties similar to bovine cytochrome c oxidase. We have studied 87Fe-enriched samples with Mossbauer spectroscopy in the fully oxidized and fully reduced states and in the oxidized state complexed with cyanide. The cytochromes a and c1 yielded spectra quite similar to those reported for the cytochromes c and b5; in the oxidized state the spectra reflect noninteracting, low spin ferric hemes, whereas the a- and c1-sites of the reduced enzyme are typical of low spin ferrous hemochromes. The spectra of the reduced enzyme show that reduced cytochrome a3 is high spin ferrous, with Mossbauer parameters quite similar to those of deoxymyoglobin. Upon addition of cyanide to the oxidized enzyme, the a3-site exhibits in the absence of an applied magnetic field and at temperatures down to 1.3 K a quadrupole doublet with parameters typical of low spin ferric heme-CN complexes. The low temperature spectra taken in applied magnetic fields show that the electronic ground state of the a3-CN complex has integer electronic spin, suggesting ferromagnetic coupling of the low spin ferric heme (S = 1/2) to Cu2+ (S = 1/2) to yield as S = 1 ground state. We have examined the oxidized enzyme from two different preparations. Both had good activity and identical optical and EPR spectra. The Mossbauer spectra, however, revealed that the a3-site had a substantially different electronic structure in the two preparations. Neither configuration had properties in accord with the widely accepted spin-coupling model proposed for the bovine enzyme."

A mechanism is proposed which includes random addition of the two substrates to the enzyme and a single catalytically active cytochrome c binding site. The mechanism is consistent with prior studies on cytochrome c peroxidase and fits the steady state kinetic data well."

https://openalex.org/W1497698467,"In order to study the variables important for determining the cytotoxicity of protein-protein hybrid toxins, the disulfide and thioiether conjugates between diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) and asialoorosomucoid (ASOR) were synthesized, purified, and tested for cytotoxicity toward isolated rat hepatocytes as monitored by the inhibition of protein synthesis. After 4-h incubation at 37 degrees C, both DTA-ASOR conjugates were nontoxic, but were highly toxic in the presence of an inhibitor of 125I-ASOR degradation. At concentrations inhibiting 125I-ASOR degradation to the same extent, the efficiency of inhibitors to enhance the toxicity of both conjugates varied with the following rank order: colchicine greater than chloroquine greater than NH4Cl greater leupeptin greater than cytochalasin B. In the absence of an inhibitor, both conjugates, after 10-h incubation, also exhibited measurable toxicity at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M, and DTA-S-S-ASOR was 60 times more toxic than DTA-S-ASOR. In a physiological salt solution containing energy source and bovine serum albumin, both conjugates also exhibited partial inhibition of protein synthesis after 4-h incubation and were enhanced by 2 microM colchicine toward complete inhibition with similar C0.5 of 2 X 10(-10) M. The toxicity of the conjugates were prevented in the presence of excess ASOR. These results not only indicate that intracellular degradation is an important factor restricting the toxicity of the conjugates, but also indicate that the toxic entry of DTA activity from these hybrids is independent of lysosomal degradation. Consequently, it appears that conjugate toxicity is dependent on the release of DTA activity from an extralysosomal compartment whose pool size is increased by the inhibitors and the change of medium. The effects of the inhibitors to inhibit 125I-ASOR uptake and degradation were also studied to facilitate interpretation of their enhancement of conjugate toxicity. Specifically, colchicine inhibited both internalization and degradation of the ligand in a saturable fashion with a C0.5 of 0.5 microM and a maximum inhibition of 65%. The data of the present study are interpreted so as to support a hypothesis that two receptor-mediated pathways are involved in the internalization and transport to lysosomes of ASOR and DTA-ASOR conjugates, only one of which is colchicine-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1522295830,Middle T antigen of polyoma virus has an associated tyrosine kinase activity which phosphorylates tyrosine residue 315 on middle T in immunoprecipitates. A peptide representing the sequence of middle T from residue 311 to 319 has been synthesized. This peptide acts as a weak inhibitor of the kinase reaction. An antiserum has been raised against this peptide after conjugation to bovine serum albumin. The antibody is middle T-specific. Middle T antigen precipitated by this serum is largely inactive in the kinase reaction. Dissociation of the immune complex with peptide releases middle T in a kinase-active form.
https://openalex.org/W1567454351,"The major polypeptide (43,000 daltons) of the rat liver receptor for asialoglycoproteins was isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antibodies raised in a goat against this SDS-treated polypeptide exhibited marked cross-reactivity toward the SDS-denatured forms of the two other prominent polypeptides (54,000 and 64,000 daltons) of the receptor preparation. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the receptor were prepared using the spleen cells of mice immunized with the soluble, active receptor purified by affinity chromatography. The most extensively characterized of the monoclonal antibodies, designated D3-5D3, recognized the solubilized receptor and bound to the exterior surface of isolated rat hepatocytes. The binding of D3-5D3 to hepatocytes prevented subsequent binding of the ligand, 125I-asialo-orosomucoid. Conversely, occupation of the receptor with ligand inhibited binding of 125I-IgG prepared from D3-5D3 ascites fluid. The secondary structure of the receptor appears to be critical for recognition by D3-5D3, since denaturation of the receptor with 1% SDS, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol at 100 degrees C abolished antibody binding. Under less denaturing conditions (0.1% SDS, 25 degrees C), antigenic reactivity was retained by the receptor. Preparative electrophoresis using the latter conditions permitted the demonstration that D3-5D3 recognized a unique determinant that is present in each of the three polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1579363093,"Glycyl-tRNA synthetase is one of two Escherichia coli aminoacyl tRNA synthetases which has two different subunits. A 5.1-kilobase pair HindIII chromosomal DNA fragment was isolated, cloned into pBR322 (to give plasmid pTK201), and shown to direct synthesis in maxicells of both subunits (Mr = 35,000 (alpha) and Mr = 65,000 (beta) of glycyl-tRNA synthetase. Locations of alpha- and beta-subunit coding regions were established by introduction of Tn5 insertions into various positions within the 5.1-kilobase pair HindIII segment of pTK201 and by determining the effect of each Tn5 insertion on synthesis of alpha- and beta-subunits and on enzymatic activity. From the Tn5 insertion analysis, regions encoding the NH2 terminus of the alpha-subunit and of the beta-subunit were approximately defined and these regions were sequenced. To locate rigorously the respective NH2-terminal encoding sections in the DNA sequence, NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of alpha- and beta-subunits were established by standard Edman degradations and these sequences were aligned with the DNA sequence. This analysis established the following: 1) coding regions for the subunits are in tandem; 2) a single promoter is used for transcription of both coding sections and the order of transcription is from alpha to beta; 3) in the 500 nucleotides 5' to the start of the alpha-subunit coding section, there is no sequence arrangement like that found for regulatory regions of bacterial amino acid biosynthetic operons; 4) nine nucleotides serve as the spacer between the TAA stop of the alpha- and the ATG start of the beta-subunit coding regions, thus making both coding regions in the same reading frame; and 5) the TAA stop of the alpha-subunit and the next for nucleotides associated with the intersubunit region are complementary to the 3'-end of 16 S rRNA; this arrangement suggests ribosome re-initiation in the spacer region gives balanced synthesis of both subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1529632873,"Mammalian alveolar macrophages are known to bind glycoconjugates with terminal D-mannosyl residues (Stahl, P. D., Rodman, J. S. Miller, M. J., and Schlesinger, R. H. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 1399-1403). Although macromolecules containing D-mannosyl residues, such as bovine serum albumin modified with 2-imino-2-methoxyethyl 1-thio-alpha-D-mannopyranoside (mannose-BSA) (Lee, Y. C., Stowell, C. P., and Krantz, M. J. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 3956-3963), were very potent inhibitors of 125I-mannose-BSA binding to macrophages, the monosaccharides D-mannose, L-fucose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and D-glucose doubled to tripled the binding of 125I-mannose-BSA to intact rabbit lung macrophages at 2 degrees C. The monosaccharide concentration required for maximum stimulation and the extent of stimulation were dependent on the number of D-mannosyl residues attached to the BSA ligand. The lower the number of D-mannosyl residues coupled to BSA, the smaller the effect by D-mannose and the lower the D-mannose concentration at which it occurred. Equilibrium binding analysis indicated that the apparent affinity of cell surface receptor for ligand increased from Kd = 1.0 nM to Kd = 0.3 nM under conditions of maximal stimulation of 125I-mannose43-BSA binding."

https://openalex.org/W1547805255,"Uridine kinase from mouse Ehrlich ascites cells can exist in a variety of different aggregation states, from monomer up to aggregates that may contain 32 or more subunits. With very crude enzyme preparations, uridine kinase activity is always associated with several different coexisting molecular weight species. Changes in the aggregation state are produced in the presence of normal effectors (orthophosphate, ATP and CTP) at physiological concentrations. With uridine kinase that has been purified 9,000-fold, enzyme activity is associated with only a single molecular weight species, but is still responsive to the same physiological effectors. In the presence of orthophosphate, uridine kinase has a molecular weight of 380,000 (appropriate for a dodecamer). In the presence of CTP, the enzyme dissociates with concomitant loss of activity. The dissociated enzyme can be reassociated to the native size. These results imply that alteration of the enzyme's quaternary structure by normal effectors constitutes a mechanism for regulating uridine kinase activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1489398247,"To assess the role of neighboring DNA sequences in gene regulation, poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dG).poly(dC) were cloned adjacent to promoters of the lactose control region. Recombinant plasmids were constructed which were suitable for large scale purification of restriction fragments containing these promoters, 95-base pair (bp) AluI fragments containing the lack operator and promoter for the lac wild type and for the catabolite gene activating the protein-independent mutant, lac UV5, were cloned into pBR322. Homopolymers of varying lengths were inserted into the -60 region of these promoters using recombinant DNA techniques. Six of the recombinant plasmids were chosen for detailed analysis: wild type (wt); wt-AT, containing 70 bp of poly(dA).poly(dT); wt-GC, containing 23 bp of poly(dG).poly(dC); UV5; UV5-AT, containing 70 bp of poly(dA).poly(dT) and finally UV5-GC, containing 43 bp of poly(dG).poly(dC). These plasmids were characterized by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The effects of the DNA homopolymers on the interaction of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase with the promoters were studied using nitrocellulose filter binding. The results show that poly(dA).poly(dT) increases the level of RNA polymerase binding, whereas poly(dG).poly(dC) has no detectable effect."
https://openalex.org/W1589924205,"We have identified specific low affinity low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in skin fibroblasts from two patients previously classified as having LDL receptor-negative homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC). Km and maximum capacity for cell-associated and degraded 125I-LDL were determined by two independent methods, a traditional technique in which increasing amounts of 125I-LDL were added until receptor saturation was achieved and a new technique in which the displacement of a small amount of 125I-LDL tracer was observed during the addition of variable amounts of unlabeled LDL. The Km for specific cell-associated 125I-LDL in FHC cells was 3.5-7.3 times that of normal cells and the maximum specific capacity was reduced to 11% of normal. Thus, some FHC cells have reduced affinity as well as reduced capacity for LDL. The FHC cell receptors share many but not all properties of the normal skin fibroblast LDL receptor. Specific degradation of bound 125I-LDL occurred concomitantly with LDL binding and was greatly reduced by the addition of chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal function. Preincubation of FHC cells with cholesterol or LDL resulted in significant suppression of receptor function. Modification of lysine residues of LDL abolished receptor activity in both normal and FHC cells. Treatment of FHC cells with compactin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, resulted in significant increases in specific 125I-LDL binding and degradation compared to FHC cells without compactin treatment. Normal cells also showed increases in 125I-LDL binding and degradation with compactin treatment, but the mean percentage increase in specific 125I-LDL degradation was significantly greater in FHC cells (strain GM 2000, 160 +/- 18%) than in normal cells (29 +/- 8%)."
https://openalex.org/W1484087546,"Calmodulin is shown to inhibit both the activation and phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Maximal inhibition of both processes was approximately 66% at the highest calmodulin concentration tested (5.5 microM). It was found that the inhibition of phosphorylation was calcium-dependent, reversible by trifluoperazine, and specific for the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase with no significant inhibition of phosphorylation of the alpha subunit. This inhibitory activity of calmodulin appears to be due to an interaction between calmodulin and the substrate, phosphorylase kinase. This finding implies either that the site of exogenous calmodulin interaction with phosphorylase kinase is at the beta subunit or that this interaction results in a conformational change of phosphorylase kinase that inhibits the interaction between cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase. The beta subunit may contain a regulatory site that is recognized by either protein kinase or calmodulin. These findings further substantiate the role of the beta subunits in the activation of phosphorylase kinase and provide an additional example of substrate-directed control of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1608563615,"Transcription studies were conducted on the primary promoter (which initiates at +1) of lac wild type (wt) and UV5 that had insertions of poly(dA).poly(dT) or poly(dG).poly(dC) in their -60 region. This series of recombinant DNAs was designed to study systematically the effect of neighboring DNA sequences on the lac promoter. Investigations using linear templates showed that wild type expression was enhanced by the poly(dA).poly(dT) insertion, whereas UV5 activity was not affected by this polymer. Neither the wt nor the UV5 promoter was influenced by the presence of poly(dG).poly(dC). Quantitation of abortive transcripts from supercoiled templates showed that the influence of the polymers on promoter activity was small. Comparative studies of the primary promoter with a secondary promoter (which initiates near -22), activated by 25% glycerol, were performed."
