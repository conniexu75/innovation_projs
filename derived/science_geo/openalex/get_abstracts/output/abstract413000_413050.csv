Measures of glucose levels in extracellular fluid in the rat hippocampus during memory tests reveal that these levels are dynamic, decreasing in response to memory tasks and loads; exogenous glucose blocks these decreases and enhances memory. The present experiments test the hypothesis that glucose enhancement of memory is mediated by glycogen storage and then metabolism to lactate in astrocytes, which provide lactate to neurons as an energy substrate. Sensitive bioprobes were used to measure brain glucose and lactate levels in 1-sec samples. Extracellular glucose decreased and lactate increased while rats performed a spatial working memory task. Intrahippocampal infusions of lactate enhanced memory in this task. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of astrocytic glycogenolysis impaired memory and this impairment was reversed by administration of lactate or glucose, both of which can provide lactate to neurons in the absence of glycogenolysis. Pharmacological block of the monocarboxylate transporter responsible for lactate uptake into neurons also impaired memory and this impairment was not reversed by either glucose or lactate. These findings support the view that astrocytes regulate memory formation by controlling the provision of lactate to support neuronal functions."
https://openalex.org/W1978511426,"Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat in huntingtin (HTT) protein. We previously showed that calorie restriction ameliorated Huntington's disease pathogenesis and slowed disease progression in mice that model Huntington's disease (Huntington's disease mice). We now report that overexpression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a mediator of the beneficial metabolic effects of calorie restriction, protects neurons against mutant HTT toxicity, whereas reduction of Sirt1 exacerbates mutant HTT toxicity. Overexpression of Sirt1 improves motor function, reduces brain atrophy and attenuates mutant-HTT-mediated metabolic abnormalities in Huntington's disease mice. Further mechanistic studies suggested that Sirt1 prevents the mutant-HTT-induced decline in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations and the signaling of its receptor, TrkB, and restores dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa (DARPP32) concentrations in the striatum. Sirt1 deacetylase activity is required for Sirt1-mediated neuroprotection in Huntington's disease cell models. Notably, we show that mutant HTT interacts with Sirt1 and inhibits Sirt1 deacetylase activity, which results in hyperacetylation of Sirt1 substrates such as forkhead box O3A (Foxo3a), thereby inhibiting its pro-survival function. Overexpression of Sirt1 counteracts the mutant-HTT-induced deacetylase deficit, enhances the deacetylation of Foxo3a and facilitates cell survival. These findings show a neuroprotective role for Sirt1 in mammalian Huntington's disease models and open new avenues for the development of neuroprotective strategies in Huntington's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2035304807,"We have recently described a class of peptides that improve drug delivery by increasing penetration of drugs into solid tumors. These peptides contain a C-terminal C-end Rule (CendR) sequence motif (R/K)XX(R/K), which is responsible for cell internalization and tissue-penetration activity. Tumor-specific CendR peptides contain both a tumor-homing motif and a cryptic CendR motif that is proteolytically unmasked in tumor tissue. A previously described cyclic tumor-homing peptide, LyP-1 (sequence: CGNKRTRGC), contains a CendR element and is capable of tissue penetration. We use here the truncated form of LyP-1, in which the CendR motif is exposed (CGNKRTR; tLyP-1), and show that both LyP-1 and tLyP-1 internalize into cells through the neuropilin-1-dependent CendR internalization pathway. Moreover, we show that neuropilin-2 also binds tLyP-1 and that this binding equally activates the CendR pathway. Fluorescein-labeled tLyP-1 peptide and tLyP-1-conjugated nanoparticles show robust and selective homing to tumors, penetrating from the blood vessels into the tumor parenchyma. The truncated peptide is more potent in this regard than the parent peptide LyP-1. tLyP-1 furthermore improves extravasation of a co-injected nanoparticle into the tumor tissue. These properties make tLyP-1 a promising tool for targeted delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents to breast cancers and perhaps other types of tumors."

The aim of the present study was to examine mechanisms by which diabetes aggravates periodontitis. Ligature-induced periodontitis was examined in Goto-Kakizaki rats with type 2 diabetes. A tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-specific-inhibitor, pegsunercept, was applied to diabetic rats after the onset of periodontal disease. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), TNF-α, interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ-1), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and BMP-6 were measured by real-time RT-PCR, and histological sections were examined for leukocyte infiltration and several parameters related to bone resorption and formation. Inflammation was prolonged in diabetic rats and was reversed by the TNF inhibitor, which reduced cytokine mRNA levels, leukocyte infiltration, and osteoclasts. In contrast, new bone and osteoid formation and osteoblast numbers were increased significantly vs. untreated diabetic animals. TNF inhibition in diabetic animals also reduced apoptosis, increased proliferation of bone-lining cells, and increased mRNA levels of FGF-2, TGFβ-1, BMP-2, and BMP-6. Thus, diabetes prolongs inflammation and osteoclastogenesis in periodontitis and through TNF limits the normal reparative process by negatively modulating factors that regulate bone.—Pacios, S., Kang, J., Galicia, J., Gluck, K., Patel, H., Ovaydi-Mandel, A., Petrov, S., Alawi, F., Graves, D.

https://openalex.org/W1975862553,"Apicomplexan parasites are responsible for high impact human diseases such as malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. These obligate intracellular pathogens are dependent on both de novo lipid biosynthesis as well as the uptake of host lipids for biogenesis of parasite membranes. Genome annotations and biochemical studies indicate that apicomplexan parasites can synthesize fatty acids via a number of different biosynthetic pathways that are differentially compartmentalized. However, the relative contribution of each of these biosynthetic pathways to total fatty acid composition of intracellular parasite stages remains poorly defined. Here, we use a combination of genetic, biochemical, and metabolomic approaches to delineate the contribution of fatty acid biosynthetic pathways in Toxoplasma gondii. Metabolic labeling studies with [13C]glucose showed that intracellular tachyzoites synthesized a range of long and very long chain fatty acids (C14:0–26:1). Genetic disruption of the apicoplast-localized type II fatty-acid synthase resulted in greatly reduced synthesis of saturated fatty acids up to 18 carbons long. Ablation of type II fatty-acid synthase activity resulted in reduced intracellular growth that was partially restored by addition of long chain fatty acids. In contrast, synthesis of very long chain fatty acids was primarily dependent on a fatty acid elongation system comprising three elongases, two reductases, and a dehydratase that were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The function of these enzymes was confirmed by heterologous expression in yeast. This elongase pathway appears to have a unique role in generating very long unsaturated fatty acids (C26:1) that cannot be salvaged from the host.

Apicomplexans are a phylum of single-celled eukaryotic parasites that includes the causative agents for important human diseases such as malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis as well as numerous veterinary pathogens. Control of these diseases is challenging, in no small part due to a rapid emergence of drug resistance that requires a continuous pipeline of new drugs with novel targets and/or modes of action. Apicomplexans are obligate intracellular pathogens and deploy complex mechanisms of synthesis and salvage to meet their essential nutritional requirements. The acquisition of lipids and fatty acids has emerged as a particularly important aspect of the metabolism of intracellular pathogens (1Mazumdar J. Striepen B. Make it or take it.

Fatty acids are the main building blocks of membranes and also play a significant role in the post-translational modification of numerous proteins. Apicomplexans were believed to be incapable of synthesizing their own fatty acids and to rely completely on host-derived lipids. However, the discovery of the apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle challenged this view. As found for the chloroplasts of plants and algae, the apicoplast contains a type II fatty-acid synthesis (FASII) 7The abbreviations used are: FASIItype II fatty-acid synthaseERendoplasmic reticulumACPacyl carrier protein5′FOA5′-fluoroorotic acidATcanhydrotetracycline. pathway (4Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I.

Humans lack plastids and the associated FASII, and instead they rely on type I fatty acid synthesis for the production of bulk long chain fatty acids. A FASII-type synthase is present in human mitochondria, but there are structural differences between its components and those of bacterial or apicomplexan FASII (5Hiltunen J.K. Chen Z. Haapalainen A.M. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. An adopted set of enzymes making a pathway of major importance for the cellular metabolism.Prog. Lipid Res. 2010; 49: 27-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apicoplast FASII also differs from the mammalian FASI pathway, thereby making it a potential target for the treatment of apicomplexan infections (6Goodman C.D. McFadden G.I. Fatty acid biosynthesis as a drug target in apicomplexan parasites.Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Initial pharmacological studies on Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii supported this idea (7Surolia N. Surolia A.

Parasitol. 2001; 31: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Subsequent genetic studies found the essentiality of this pathway to be more complicated. We constructed a conditional mutant for the apicoplast acyl carrier protein (ACP) in T. gondii. ACP is a key molecule of the FASII pathway; fatty-acyl intermediates are covalently bound to ACP as the enzymes of the pathway act on them. Loss of ACP in this conditional mutant affects apicoplast biogenesis and results in the death of the parasite. Moreover, mice infected with a lethal dose of T. gondii can be cured by suppression of the FASII pathway, suggesting its importance in the growth and survival of the parasite (9Mazumdar J.H. Wilson E. Masek K.A. Hunter C. Striepen B. Apicoplast fatty acid synthesis is essential for organelle biogenesis and parasite survival in Toxoplasma gondii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2006; 103: 13192-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In contrast, this pathway is not essential for the bloodstream and mosquito stages of the malarial parasite Plasmodium, although it is essential for the liver stage that is required for establishment of infection in the mammalian host (10Vaughan A.M.

Other apicomplexan parasites, such as Cryptosporidium, Babesia, and Theileria appear to completely lack the FASII biosynthetic machinery suggesting that they are dependent on fatty acid salvage from the host (1Mazumdar J. Striepen B. Make it or take it. Fatty acid metabolism of apicomplexan parasites.Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). type II fatty-acid synthase endoplasmic reticulum acyl carrier protein 5′-fluoroorotic acid anhydrotetracycline. Although both T. gondii and P. falciparum have been shown to take up radiolabeled fatty acids from the culture medium (12Charron A.J. Sibley L.D. Host cells.

Candidates for plasmodial glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor precursors and pathogenicity factors.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2597-2606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these parasites are predicted to contain a number of other fatty acid biosynthetic pathways that could partly compensate for the loss of FASII (1Mazumdar J. Striepen B. Make it or take it. Fatty acid metabolism of apicomplexan parasites.Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Zhu G. Current progress in the fatty acid metabolism in Cryptosporidium parvum.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These alternative mechanisms include a FASI pathway (in T. gondii, Eimeria, and Cryptosporidium) and a putative fatty acid elongation pathway (in most apicomplexans with the exception of Theileria and Babesia). FASI in apicomplexans so far has only been studied in Cryptosporidium parvum (15Zhu G. Li Y. Cai X. Millership J.J. Marchewka M.J. Keithly J.S.

Restricted substrate preference towards very long chain fatty acyl thioesters.BMC Biochem. 2010; 11: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies suggest that apicomplexan fatty acid metabolism is complex and that multiple potentially redundant biosynthetic pathways could contribute to the total cellular fatty acid pool. Identifying the specific biochemical activities of individual components and delineating their sequence and interaction and their relative importance under different growth conditions are critical for understanding host-parasite interaction and identifying potential drug targets. Here, we develop a combined genetic and metabolomic strategy to identify the products of FASII and the elongation pathways for T. gondii. De novo fatty acid synthesis was monitored in wild type parasites and in mutant parasite lines in which specific fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes were selectively ablated by labeling parasite-infected host cells with [U-13C]glucose and analysis of parasite lipids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The activity of specific fatty acid elongases was further examined by heterologous expression and biochemical analyses. Our analyses suggest that the FASII and elongase pathways have nonredundant functions in intracellular tachyzoite stages in maintaining the fatty acid composition of bulk lipids and that these de novo pathways cannot be by-passed by fatty acid salvage from the host cell. The protein sequences of the yeast fatty acid elongation machinery (ELO1–3, ketoacyl-CoA reductase, dehydratase, and enoyl-CoA reductase; GenBankTM accession numbers NP_012339, NP_009963, NP_13476, AAS56194, NP_012438, NP_010269) were used as query sequences for BLAST searches against the T. gondii genome and GenBankTM databases. To evaluate the computational predictions for these genes, we conducted RT-PCR experiments. The predictions for T. gondii ELO-A, ELO-B, ELO-C, and DEH were confirmed. However, for ECR and KCR, the beginning and ending of the coding sequences were different and were subsequently established by RT-PCR, subcloning, and sequencing. The experimentally validated T. gondii genes described in this study are ELO-A, ELO-B, ELO-C, KCR, DEH, and ECR (see supplemental Table S1 for GenBankTM accession numbers). The full-length coding sequences for all genes were amplified from T. gondii cDNA using primers introducing flanking BglII and AvrII restriction sites, subcloned into plasmid pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and subsequently introduced into the equivalent sites of either plasmid pdt7s4H3 or pdt7s4M3 (17Agrawal S. van Dooren G.G.

Plasmids containing a second copy of the target gene under the control of a regulatable promoter (pdt7s4H3) were stably introduced into a T. gondii tetracycline transactivator strain (20Meissner M.

Stable clones for ELO-A, -B, or -C were established in the presence of pyrimethamine. We next engineered a plasmid-based construct to delete the ELO-C locus and cosmid-based targeting vectors for ELO-A and -B. For ELO-C, sequences (∼2 kb) upstream and downstream of the ELO-C genomic locus were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the respective BamHI/KpnI and AatII/SpeI restriction sites of the PTCY vector flanking a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (the vector also contains a YFP cassette for negative selection (9Mazumdar J.H.

Transgenic parasites that were chloramphenicol-resistant and YFP-negative were isolated. Clones were tested by PCR for integration, and gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blot analyses. (Plasmids used for the probes are listed in supplemental Table S2.) Cosmids (TOXP929/ELO-B or TOXO789/ELO-A) were modified to replace the coding sequence with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette by recombineering (19Brooks C.F. Johnsen H. van Dooren G.G.

Parasites were grown in the absence and presence ATc for 48 h, and free tachyzoites were metabolically labeled as described previously (9Mazumdar J.H. Wilson E. Masek K.A. Hunter C. Striepen B.

Briefly, 108 tachyzoites were incubated with 10 μCi of sodium [14C]acetate (Movarek) in 1 ml of DMEM for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Total lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1). The extract was dried, and fatty acid methyl esters were subjected to acidic methanolysis. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane and analyzed on RP-18 HPTLC plates developed in methanol/chloroform/water (75:25:5) and exposed to film for 1 week. T. gondii-infected fibroblasts were grown in DMEM in a T175 flask in the absence or presence of ATc for 48 h. The medium was supplemented with 8 mm [U-13C]glucose (final concentration of [13C/12C]glucose was 16 mm) 24 h prior to egress. Free parasites were separated from host cells by filtration through a membrane with a 3-μm pore size. Parasites were quenched by rapid chilling of the cell suspension in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and parasites were recovered by centrifugation (4000 × g, 25 min, 0 °C). Cell pellets were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and cell aliquots (2 × 108 cells) were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 s, 0 °C). Pellets were suspended in chloroform (50 μl) and vortex-mixed thoroughly prior to the addition of 200 μl of methanol/water (3:1). Samples were sonicated for 1 min at RT and then incubated at 60 °C for 20 min. Extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was subjected to biphasic partitioning by addition of 100 μl of water. The organic phase was transferred to a partially sealed capillary for methanolysis, dried with an internal standard of 1 nmol of scyllo-inositol, and subsequently washed twice with methanol. Dried residues were dissolved in 0.5 n methanolic HCl (50 μl, Sigma), and the capillaries were sealed under vacuum and incubated at 95 °C overnight. Samples were neutralized with 10 μl of pyridine (20 min) before being transferred to GC-MS vials, dried, and derivatized by addition of 25 μl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide/trimethylchlorisane. Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 7890A-5975C GC-MS system. Splitless injection (injection temperature 280 °C) onto a 30 m + 10 m × 0.25 mm DB-5MS + DG column (J&W, Agilent Technologies) was used, using helium as the carrier gas. The initial oven temperature was 80 °C (2 min), followed by temperature gradients to 140 °C at 30 °C/min, from 140 to 250 °C at 5 °C/min, and from 250 to 265 °C at 15 °C/min. The final temperature was held for 10 min. Data analysis was performed using Chemstation software (MSD Chemstation D.01.02.16, Agilent Technologies).

Statistical significance was evaluated by Wilcoxon Rank Sum Testing with continuity corrections, using the R data analysis package (version 2.14.0), where p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Yeast strains were grown on YP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) or yeast synthetic complete (SC) media (yeast synthetic dropout medium supplement (Sigma)), supplemented with 0.67% Difco yeast nitrogen base (BD Biosciences), containing either 2% (w/v) d-galactose and 0.05% (w/v) d-glucose (GalGlu), 4% (w/v) d-glucose or 2% (w/v) raffinose as the carbon source(s). For solid media, 2% agar was added. Selections were carried out on plates lacking leucine (SCGalGlu−Leu). Counter-selections against plasmids containing a URA3 marker were done on 5′-fluoroorotic acid plates (23Amberg, D. C., Burke, D., Strathern, J. N., and Cold Spring Harbor, L. (2005) Methods in Yeast Genetics, p. 207, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar) supplemented with GalGlu (5′FOAGalGlu). Liquid culture with 4% (w/v) d-glucose was used to repress expression from the GAL1 promoter. Strains subjected to spotting assay were grown overnight in YPGalGlu, kept for 24 h below an A600 <1, and then grown for 8 h in YPRaf. The cell density was normalized to an A600 = 0.5 before being spotted on YPGalGlu, SCGalUra GalGlu, and SC 5′FOAGalGlu. The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae W1536 Δelo2Δelo3/YCp33 GAL1 ScELO3 (URA3) (Δade2, Δade3, his3-11, his3-12, trp1-1, ura3-1, elo2::kanMX4, elo3::kanMX4) has been described before (24Kastaniotis A.J.

The yeast strain was transformed with either one of the following plasmids (all LEU2): YCp111 GAL1-TgELO-B, YCp111 GAL1-TgELO-C, or YCpP111 GAL1-TgELO-A on SCGalGlu-Leu. (Primers used in the construction of these plasmids are listed in supplemental Table S3.) Candidate transformants on SCGalGlu-Leu plates were picked and streaked on 5′-FOAGalGlu plates to select against the presence of the YCp33 GAL1 ScELO3 plasmid. Complementation of the Δelo2Δelo3 mutations was indicated by the production of a large amount of FOA-resistant colonies. Presence of the plasmids carrying T. gondii constructs was verified by the ability of the FOA-resistant colonies to grow on SCGalGlu-Leu. These candidates were used in further experiments. Strain W1536-5B Δtsc13/YCplac33 GAL1 ScTSC13 (MATa; Δade2, Δade3, his3-11, his3-12, trp1-1, ura3-1, tsc13::kanMX4) was transformed with YCp111 GAL1-TgTSC13 on SCGalGlu-Leu, and colonies complemented by T. gondii TSC1 were identified and isolated in an analogous fashion as described above. Finally, yeast mutants complemented by T. gondii PHS1 were generated in a similar manner, using strain W1536-5B Δphs1/pYES2 PHS1 (MATa; Δade2, Δade3, his3-11, his3-12, trp1-1, ura3-1, phs1::kanMX4) transformed with YCp111 GAL1-TgPHS1. Yeast cells were grown to exponential phase (2·106 cells·ml−1) and then harvested by centrifuging for 15 min at 1300 × g, 4 °C. The pellet was washed with sterile water and suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer. The cells were disrupted with glass beads and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C to remove the cell debris. The supernatants were centrifuged for 90 min at 85,000 × g in a Sorvall Ti70 rotor at 4 °C to generate pellet (P85) and supernatant (S85) fractions. The P85 was suspended in lysis buffer and used for the elongase assay. The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Equivalent amounts of total lysate, P85, and S85 were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a 10% final concentration and processed for immunoblotting. Yeast cultures were inoculated from an overnight starter culture to an A600 of 0.05 in 100 ml of YPGalGlu, allowed to grow to an A600 of 0.5, and harvested by 5 min centrifugation at 4300 × g. Cells were washed in 50 ml of water and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2123842652,"Sponges are suspension feeders that use flagellated collar-cells (choanocytes) to actively filter a volume of water equivalent to many times their body volume each hour. Flow through sponges is thought to be enhanced by ambient current, which induces a pressure gradient across the sponge wall, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Studies of sponge filtration have estimated the energetic cost of pumping to be <1% of its total metabolism implying there is little adaptive value to reducing the cost of pumping by using “passive” flow induced by the ambient current. We quantified the pumping activity and respiration of the glass sponge Aphrocallistes vastus at a 150 m deep reef in situ and in a flow flume; we also modeled the glass sponge filtration system from measurements of the aquiferous system. Excurrent flow from the sponge osculum measured in situ and in the flume were positively correlated (r>0.75) with the ambient current velocity. During short bursts of high ambient current the sponges filtered two-thirds of the total volume of water they processed daily. Our model indicates that the head loss across the sponge collar filter is 10 times higher than previously estimated. The difference is due to the resistance created by a fine protein mesh that lines the collar, which demosponges also have, but was so far overlooked. Applying our model to the in situ measurements indicates that even modest pumping rates require an energetic expenditure of at least 28% of the total in situ respiration. We suggest that due to the high cost of pumping, current-induced flow is highly beneficial but may occur only in thin walled sponges living in high flow environments. Our results call for a new look at the mechanisms underlying current-induced flow and for reevaluation of the cost of biological pumping and its evolutionary role, especially in sponges."
https://openalex.org/W2117009425,"Emerging evidence has shown that aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly associated with tumour development and progression. However, little is known about the potential role of miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. In this study, miR-409-3p was found to be downregulated frequently in human GCs, and its expression was significantly associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymph node metastasis. Enforced expression of miR-409 in GC cells significantly reduced their migration and invasion in vitro and their capacity to develop distal pulmonary metastases and peritoneal dissemination in vivo. Moreover, we found that miR-409 exerted its function predominantly through the mature miR-409-3p, but not miR-409-5p. Microarray and bioinformatics analysis identified the pro-metastatic gene radixin (RDX) as a potential miR-409-3p target. Further studies confirmed that miR-409-3p suppressed the expression of RDX by directly binding to its 3′-untranslated region. Silencing of RDX by small interfering RNAs phenocopied the effects of miR-409 overexpression, whereas restoration of RDX in miR-409-overexpressed GC cells reversed the suppressive effects of miR-409. Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR-409 suppresses GC cell invasion and metastasis by directly targeting RDX and that patients with downregulated miR-409-3p are prone to lymph node metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1994729314,"By analyzing public data sets of gene expression in human breast cancers we observed that increased levels of transcripts encoding the planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins SCRIB and VANGL1 correlate with increased risk of patient relapse. Experimentally, we found that reducing expression of SCRIB by short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) reduces the growth of human breast cancer cells in xenograft assays. To investigate SCRIB-associated proteins that might participate in the responses of breast cancer cells to altered levels of SCRIB, we used mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy. These studies reveal that SCRIB is present in at least two unique protein complexes: (1) a complex of SCRIB, ARHGEF, GIT and PAK (p21-activated kinase), and (2) a complex of SCRIB, NOS1AP and VANGL. Focusing on NOS1AP, we observed that NOS1AP colocalizes with both SCRIB and VANGL1 along cellular protrusions in metastatic breast cancer cells, but does not colocalize with either SCRIB or VANGL1 at cell junctions in normal breast cells. We investigated the effects of shRNA-mediated knockdown of NOS1AP and SCRIB in vitro, and found that reducing NOS1AP and SCRIB slows breast cancer cell migration and prevents the establishment of leading–trailing polarity. We also find that reduction of NOS1AP enhances anchorage-independent growth. Collectively these data point to the relevance of NOS1AP and SCRIB protein complexes in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2085019446,"Though prostate cancer is often indolent, it is nonetheless a leading cause of cancer death. Defining the underlying molecular genetic alterations may lead to new strategies for prevention or treatment. Towards this goal, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on 86 primary prostate tumors. Among the most frequent alterations not associated with a known cancer gene, we identified focal deletions within 5q21 in 15 out of 86 (17%) cases. By high-resolution tiling array CGH, the smallest common deletion targeted just one gene, the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1). Expression of CHD1 was significantly reduced in tumors with deletion (P=0.03), and compared with normal prostate (P=0.04). Exon sequencing analysis also uncovered nonsynonymous mutations in 1 out of 7 (14%) cell lines (LAPC4) and in 1 out of 24 (4%) prostate tumors surveyed. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CHD1 in two nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cell lines, OPCN2 and RWPE-1, did not alter cell growth, but promoted cell invasiveness, and in OPCN2-enhanced cell clonogenicity. Taken together, our findings suggest that CHD1 deletion may underlie cell invasiveness in a subset of prostate cancers, and indicate a possible novel role of altered chromatin remodeling in prostate tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2122033693,"We report that elevated microRNA-133b (miR-133b) acts as an oncogene in human cervical carcinoma to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. In situ hybridization confirmed that miR-133b is localized in proliferating human cervical carcinoma cells with levels progressively elevating throughout advancing stages. Cellular studies showed that miR-133b enhances cell proliferation and colony formation by targeting mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 2 (MST2), cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42) and ras homolog gene family member A (RHOA), which subsequently results in activation of the tumorigenic protein kinase B alpha (AKT1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1 and ERK2, here abbreviated as ERK) signaling pathways. Mouse experiments revealed that upregulation of miR-133b in cervical carcinoma cells strongly promotes both in vivo tumorigenesis and independent metastasis to the mouse lung. The data indicates that upregulation of miR-133b shortens the latency of cervical carcinoma. Together, these findings suggest that miR-133b could be a potent marker for the early onset of cervical carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1973563968,"Filopodia are dynamic actin-rich cell surface protrusions involved in cell migration, axon guidance, and wound healing. The RhoGTPase Cdc42 generates filopodia via IRSp53, a multidomain protein that links the processes of plasma membrane deformation and actin dynamics required for their formation in mammalian cells. The Src homology 3 domain of IRSp53 binds to the actin regulators Mena, Eps8, WAVE1, WAVE2, mDia1, and mDia2. We show that mDia1 and WAVE2 synergize with IRSp53 to form filopodia. IRSp53 also interacts directly with these two proteins within filopodia, as observed in acceptor photobleaching FRET studies. Measurement of filopodium formation by time-lapse imaging of live cells also revealed that depleting neuronal cells of either mDia1 or WAVE2 protein decreases the ability of IRSp53 to induce filopodia. In contrast, IRSp53 does not appear to partner WAVE1 or mDia2 to give rise to these structures. In addition, although all three isoforms of mDia are capable of inducing filopodia, IRSp53 requires only mDia1 to do so. These findings suggest that mDia1 and WAVE2 are important Src homology 3 domain partners of IRSp53 in forming filopodia."
https://openalex.org/W2071299561,"Once stimulated, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) undergoes self-phosphorylation, which, on the one hand, instigates signaling cascades, and on the other hand, recruits CBL ubiquitin ligases, which mark EGFRs for degradation. Using RNA interference screens, we identified a deubiquitinating enzyme, Cezanne-1, that opposes receptor degradation and enhances EGFR signaling. These functions require the catalytic- and ubiquitin-binding domains of Cezanne-1, and they involve physical interactions and transphosphorylation of Cezanne-1 by EGFR. In line with the ability of Cezanne-1 to augment EGF-induced growth and migration signals, the enzyme is overexpressed in breast cancer. Congruently, the corresponding gene is amplified in approximately one third of mammary tumors, and high transcript levels predict an aggressive disease course. In conclusion, deubiquitination by Cezanne-1 curtails degradation of growth factor receptors, thereby promotes oncogenic growth signals."
https://openalex.org/W1976369107,"The cyclin-cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) has a crucial negative role on cell cycle progression. In addition to its classical role as a cyclin-cdk inhibitor, it also performs cyclin-cdk-independent functions as the regulation of cytoskeleton rearrangements and cell motility. p27 deficiency has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome, although the mechanisms underlying this participation still remain elusive. We report here a new cellular function of p27 as a transcriptional regulator in association with p130/E2F4 complexes that could be relevant for tumorigenesis. We observed that p27 associates with specific promoters of genes involved in important cellular functions as processing and splicing of RNA, mitochondrial organization and respiration, translation and cell cycle. On these promoters p27 co-localizes with p130, E2F4 and co-repressors as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and mSIN3A. p27 co-immunoprecipitates with these proteins and by affinity chromatography, we demonstrated a direct interaction of p27 with p130 and E2F4 through its carboxyl-half. We have also shown that p130 recruits p27 on the promoters, and there p27 is needed for the subsequent recruitment of HDACs and mSIN3A. Expression microarrays and luciferase assays revealed that p27 behaves as transcriptional repressor of these p27-target genes (p27-TGs). Finally, in human tumors, we established a correlation with overexpression of p27-TGs and poor survival. Thus, this new function of p27 as a transcriptional repressor could have a role in the major aggressiveness of tumors with low levels of p27."
https://openalex.org/W1972985696,"The collagen triple helix is the most abundant protein fold in humans. Despite its deceptively simple structure, very little is understood about its folding and fibrillization energy landscape. In this work, using a combination of x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we carry out a detailed study of stabilizing pair-wise interactions between the positively charged lysine and the negatively charged amino acids aspartate and glutamate. We find important differences in the side chain conformation of amino acids in the crystalline and solution state. Structures from x-ray crystallography may have similarities to the densely packed triple helices of collagen fibers whereas solution NMR structures reveal the simpler interactions of isolated triple helices. In solution, two distinct types of contacts are observed: axial and lateral. Such register-specific interactions are crucial for the understanding of the registration process of collagens and the overall stability of proteins in this family. However, in the crystalline state, there is a significant rearrangement of the side chain conformation allowing for packing interactions between adjacent helices, which suggests that charged amino acids may play a dual role in collagen stabilization and folding, first at the level of triple helical assembly and second during fibril formation."

Recent genetic data in yeast shows that the choice between these two pathways for the repair of DSBs is via competition between the NHEJ protein, Ku, and the HR protein, Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX) complex. To study the interrelationship between human Ku and Mre11 or Mre11/Rad50 (MR), we established an in vitro DNA end resection system using a forked model dsDNA substrate and purified human Ku70/80, Mre11, Mre11/Rad50, and exonuclease 1 (Exo1). Our study shows that the addition of Ku70/80 blocks Exo1-mediated DNA end resection of the forked dsDNA substrate. Although human Mre11 and MR bind to the forked double strand DNA, they could not compete with Ku for DNA ends or actively mediate the displacement of Ku from the DNA end either physically or via its exonuclease or endonuclease activity. Our in vitro studies show that Ku can block DNA resection and suggest that Ku must be actively displaced for DNA end processing to occur and is more complicated than the competition model established in yeast.

Biol. 1993; 58: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to DSBs, prompt and precise DSB repair is critical because unrepaired DSBs can result in genomic instability, cell death, and tumorigenesis (2Burma S. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Role of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in maintaining genomic integrity.DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). There are two major DSB repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) (3Pastink A. Eeken J.C. Lohman P.H. Genomic integrity and the repair of double strand DNA breaks.Mutat. Res. 2001; 480: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). HR involves a series of steps including damage sensing, DNA resection, strand invasion, DNA synthesis, and ligation. HR is likely initiated when the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex recognizes the DSB and recruits CtIP and Exo1 to mediate DNA resection. Resection of the DSB ends generates 3′-single strand DNA overhangs that are bound with RPA and then replaced by Rad51 for homologous template invasion and HR completion (4Sun H. Treco D. Szostak J.W.

In NHEJ, Ku quickly recognizes the broken DNA ends where it then functions as a platform to assemble other NHEJ factors including DNA-PKcs, Artemis, XLF, and DNA ligase IV/XRCC4. After minimal processing, the DNA ends are ligated via the DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 dimer (2Burma S. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Role of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in maintaining genomic integrity.DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).

Although much work has been performed to identify and characterize factors that are required for repair by both DSB repair pathways, important questions are still unresolved, including what is the mechanism that modulates the pathway choice/switching between NHEJ and HR. Two factors are believed to play major roles in the choice of HR over NHEJ. First, the cell cycle phase is of importance as HR requires a homologous template; therefore, HR is believed to only be active during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when a sister chromatid is available. NHEJ does not require a homologous template and is thus not restricted to a certain phase of the cell cycle but it is believed to be the dominant repair pathway in the G0 and G1 phases. The second factor is DNA end resection. The prevalent model for DNA end resection comes from genetic data generated from studies in Sacchromyces cerevisiae. The studies in yeast suggest a competition for DSB ends between the HR factors, Mre11 or Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX), and the NHEJ factor, yeast Ku (yKu) (6Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. Ku prevents Exo1- and Sgs1-dependent resection of DNA ends in the absence of a functional MRX complex or Sae2.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3358-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Shim E.Y.

As both pathways require initial DNA damage sensing and processing, the choice between the two pathways may reside in which repair protein complex is initially assembled at DSB sites and how DNA ends are processed before ligation. Both MRX and yKu are recruited to DSB sites independently and simultaneously (8Wu D. Topper L.M. Wilson T.E. Recruitment and dissociation of nonhomologous end-joining proteins at a DNA double strand break in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2008; 178: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and lack of either complex results in an increase in the binding of the other complex and thus an increase in the other repair pathway (7Shim E.Y. Chung W.H. Nicolette M.L. Zhang Y. Davis M. Zhu Z. Paull T.T. Ira G. Lee S.E. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 and Ku proteins regulate association of Exo1 and Dna2 with DNA breaks.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 8Wu D.

Recruitment and dissociation of nonhomologous end-joining proteins at a DNA double strand break in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2008; 178: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, in the absence of the MRX complex, yKu is accumulated at DSB sites and blocks Exo1-mediated DNA end resection (7Shim E.Y. Chung W.H. Nicolette M.L. Zhang Y. Davis M. Zhu Z. Paull T.T. Ira G. Lee S.E. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 and Ku proteins regulate association of Exo1 and Dna2 with DNA breaks.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This data implicates that the MRX complex can mediate the dissociation of yKu from DSBs to allow DNA end resection to occur. The data in yeast suggests that competition and physical displacement of Ku from DNA ends via the MRX complex pushes the pathway choice to HR-mediated DSB repair instead of NHEJ. Although the studies in yeast produce a very compelling model for DSB repair pathway choice, the functional relationship between the HR and NHEJ pathways and the choice between the two may not directly apply to the human system. First, in yeast, the MRX complex is essential for classical NHEJ but it is not required for NHEJ in human cells and appears to only be involved in an alternative end-joining pathway. Second, Ku is very abundant (∼5 × 105 copies in HeLa cells) and NHEJ is more dominant in human cells, whereas yeast uses HR as its major DSB repair pathway (9Sonoda E. Hochegger H. Saberi A. Taniguchi Y. Takeda S. Differential usage of non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination in double strand break repair.DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). For example, Ku deficiency causes severe radiosensitization in humans but Ku deficiency does not result in radiosensitivity in S. cerevisiae unless the HR protein Rad52 is also deleted (10Siede W. Friedl A.A. Dianova I. Eckardt-Schupp F. Friedberg E.C. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku autoantigen homologue affects radiosensitivity only in the absence of homologous recombination.Genetics. 1996; 142: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, there are structural differences between yKu and human Ku (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. SAP, a putative DNA-binding motif involved in chromosomal organization.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L.

As there are clear marked differences between the human and yeast Ku proteins, in this report we wanted to examine in vitro with purified human proteins whether Ku and Mre11 or Mre11/Rad50 compete with each other similarly as yKu and MRX for DNA ends and modulate DNA end resection. An in vitro assay system was established to biochemically study the interplay between human proteins in HR and NHEJ by using Ku, Mre11, Mre11/Rad50, and Exo1 and a specific DNA substrate with forked structure at one end. It was found that human Ku blocks Exo1-mediated resection and that neither Mre11 nor Mre11/Rad50 could actively mediate the displacement of Ku from the DNA end either physically or via its exonucleases or endonucleases activities to free the end for Exo1-mediated resection. Our data is in contrast with previous in vitro data generated with purified yeast proteins and suggest that the displacement of human Ku from DNA ends is more complicated than the direct competition with the MRX complex, which was established in yeast. The forked dsDNA was synthesized with a long single strand of 5′-CGCGCCCAGCTTTCCCAGCTAATAAACTAAAAACTCCTAAGG-3′ (42 nt) and a short single strand of 5′-CCTTAGGAGTTTTTAGTTTATTGGGCGCG-3′ (29 nt) (Invitrogen). The underlined nucleotides represented the hairpin sequence. 5′-End labeling of the long strand of the forked DNA was performed by incubating 2 μl of long strand of the forked DNA (10 μm), 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10,000 units/ml), 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), and 1 μl of cold ATP (200 μm) in a 20-μl reaction system at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 20 min. 3′-End labeling of the short strand of the forked DNA was performed in a 50-μl reaction system containing 5 μl of short strand of the forked DNA (10 μm), 1 μl of terminal transferase (400 units/reaction), 5 μl of 3′-labeled [α-32P]Cordycepin 5′-triphosphate (5000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) (Roche Applied Science), and 5 μl of CoCl2 (25 mm) at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by addition of 5 μl of 0.2 m EDTA (pH 8.0). Both 5′- and 3′-labeled DNA were applied to a MicroSpin G-25 column to remove free 32P-nucleotide (GE Healthcare). The radiolabeled strand was annealed with the same molar amount of its complementary strand by incubating them together at 95 °C and cooled down to room temperature slowly. Labeling efficiency and DNA quality were examined using a 16% TBE native gel electrophoresis. DNA binding of Ku was performed using 10 nm forked DNA in a reaction system containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Binding of Mre11 or Mre11/Rad50 to DNA in the absence or presence of Ku was performed using forked DNA in a binding buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm MnCl2. All reactions were performed in a 10-μl system at room temperature for 15 min and 2 μl of loading dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, and 30% glycerol) was added. The samples were separated via a 4% Tris glycine native gel, dried, and analyzed by Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare). All nuclease assays were performed in a 10-μl reaction. Exo1-mediated DNA resection was performed using 3′-end labeled forked DNA. To study the effect of Ku on Exo1-mediated DNA resection, 10 nm Exo1 and increasing concentrations of Ku (as indicated in Fig. 1B) were incubated with 3′-end labeled forked DNA in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 1 h. Mre11-mediated DNA digestion was performed using 5′-end labeled forked DNA in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm MnCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. To study the effect of Ku, increasing concentrations of Ku were added to the above reaction buffer. To differentiate nuclease activities of Mre11, 12 nm Mre11 was used for exonuclease activity and 60 nm Mre11 was used for endonuclease activity. To study whether the Mre11 helped Exo1 to process DNA in the presence of Ku, increasing concentrations of Ku were incubated with 10 nm Exo1, 120 nm Mre11, and 10 nm 5′-end labeled forked DNA in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 1 h. Mre11/Rad50-mediated exonuclease activity was performed in the same reaction buffer as for Mre11. For endonuclease activity of Mre11/Rad50, ATP (1 mm) was added to the same reaction buffer. To study the effect of Ku, increasing concentrations of Ku were added to the above reaction buffer. The effect of Mre11/Rad50 on Exo1-mediated DNA resection in the presence of Ku was examined in a two-step procedure. Increasing concentrations of Ku and 50 nm Mre11/Rad50 were incubated together with 10 nm 5′-end labeled forked DNA with or without ATP (1 mm) in a 10-μl reaction buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm MnCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. In the second step, 10 nm Exo1 and 5 mm MgCl2 were added to the reaction to a final volume of 12 μl and incubated for another 1 h at 37 °C. All reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of formamide dye (95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, 18 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS), boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and cooled down on ice for 5 min. The samples were separated by 16% urea-PAGE, dried, and analyzed in Typhoon 9410. Mre11 siRNAs were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The sequence for siRNA oligonucleotides against Mre11 was ACAGGAGAAGAGAUCAACUdTdT. Transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides was performed using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Live cell imaging combined with laser microirradiation was carried out as described previously with modifications (13Uematsu N. Weterings E. Yano K. Morotomi-Yano K. Jakob B. Taucher-Scholz G. Mari P.O. van Gent D.C. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs regulates its dynamics at DNA double strand breaks.J.

Fluorescence was monitored by using an Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), with a Plan Apochromat ×63/NA 1.40 oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). A 365-nm pulsed nitrogen laser (Spectra Physics) was directly coupled to the epifluorescence path of the microscope and used to generate DSBs in a defined area of the nucleus. For quantitative analyses, standardized microirradiation conditions (minimal laser output of 75% for 5 pulses) were used to generate the same amount of DNA damage in each experiment. Time-lapse images were taken by an AxioCamHRm camera and the fluorescence intensities of microirradiated and nonirradiated areas within the cell nucleus were determined using the Axiovison Software, version 4.8 (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). To eliminate the influence of nuclear background fluorescence, the fluorescence intensity of an undamaged site in the same nuclei was subtracted from the fluorescence intensity of the accumulation spot for every cell at each time point. Nonspecific photobleaching and UV lamp output fluctuation were compensated for by correcting the accumulation site fluorescence intensity (IN) of each time point based on pre-laser background intensity using the formula: IN(t) = Idt/Ibt × IbpreIR, where Idt represents the difference between the accumulation spot intensity and the undamaged site background intensity of each time point, Ibt represents the background intensity of each time point, and IbpreIR represents the background intensity before irradiation. Relative fluorescence intensity (RF) was calculated using the formula: RF(t) = (INt − INpreIR)/(INmax − INpreIR), where INpreIR means IN of the microirradiated area before laser damage and INmax is the maximum IN in the microirradiated area of all time points. Each data point is the average of at least 10 independent measurements. Previous data generated in yeast showed that Ku may block DNA ends and that the MRX complex may actively displace Ku for DNA ends resection to occur. To study the mechanism of human Ku dissociation from the DNA end and determine whether it is similar to the yeast system, we first established in vitro binding conditions of human Ku70/80 to a model dsDNA substrate. The model dsDNA substrate used in the study is a forked DNA (F-DNA) substrate, which contains a 22-bp linear region connected to a branched structure that contains a 7-bp linear DNA on one end and a stem loop on the other (Fig. 1A). This forked DNA substrate was chosen because it allows Ku binding at the 22-bp linear region in only one direction and prevents its translocation off the DNA via the branched structure. The forked DNA structure with a 22-bp linear region also mimics the average 20-bp linker DNA found in nucleosomes, which likely only allows one directional loading of protein onto DNA in vivo. In addition, as 14 nt are required for Ku70/80 binding to DNA, the length of the linear region (22 bp) limits the binding of only one Ku to the model DNA substrate and allows the generation of a homogenous protein-DNA complex (15Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Ku heterodimer bound to DNA and its implications for double strand break repair.Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Finally, a similar structured DNA was used previously to solve the x-ray crystal structure of Ku70/80 as it assured uniform complex formation of Ku and DNA (16Yoo S. Kimzey A. Dynan W.S. Photocross-linking of an oriented DNA repair complex. Ku bound at a single DNA end.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20034-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). First, quantitative binding of Ku to the model DNA substrate was performed by incubating increasing concentrations of Ku with 10 nm 32P-labeled forked DNA. One Ku (5–20 nm) and DNA band was observed in the 4% native Tris glycine gel representing 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). The band intensities of both free DNA and Ku-bound DNA from the same binding reaction were measured to calculate their relative ratio. The values of ratios were expressed as percentage of total amount of DNA, which included free DNA and Ku-bound DNA and plotted as a histogram (Fig. 1C). It was found that 5 nm Ku was able to bind ∼80% of the model forked DNA, whereas 10 to 20 nm Ku occupied nearly 100% of the model DNA (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that at higher concentrations of Ku70/80 a small amount of higher order Ku-DNA species were observed (Fig. 1B and data not shown). These are likely due to the ability of Ku to unstably bind to shorter stretches of DNA, but the vast majority of the Ku-DNA species observed were 1 Ku with 1 DNA (15Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Ku heterodimer bound to DNA and its implications for double strand break repair.Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). In summary, a stable 1:1 stoichiometric binding was formed between 5 and 20 nm Ku and 10 nm forked DNA and the open end of the forked DNA substrate is clearly bound by Ku. As yKu has been implicated in blocking Exo1-mediated end resection in the absence of the MRX complex, we wanted to establish an in vitro DNA end resection system with human proteins to test if human Ku could block end resection by human Exo1 using the defined DNA substrate (7Shim E.Y. Chung W.H. Nicolette M.L. Zhang Y. Davis M. Zhu Z. Paull T.T. Ira G. Lee S.E. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 and Ku proteins regulate association of Exo1 and Dna2 with DNA breaks.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recombinant human Exo1 and Ku70/80 were purified from Sf9 insect cells following expression via recombinant baculoviruses (supplemental Fig. S1A and data not shown). First, the exonuclease activity of Exo1 was studied by incubating various concentrations of Exo1 (1–10 nm) with the forked DNA substrate, which was radiolabeled at the 3′-end at 37 °C for 1 h. After the end of the reaction, DNA was denatured and separated by a 16% urea denaturing gel. The efficiency of DNA resection was determined by observing reduction of the original DNA substrate and appearance of resected DNA fragments. Low concentration of Exo1 (1 nm) resected DNA modestly as it produced an intermediate DNA fragment of ∼15 nt as marked by an arrow (Fig. 2A, lane 2). More thorough DNA resection was observed with increased concentrations of Exo1 as the amount of the original DNA was nearly lost and two newly resected DNA fragments were observed as marked by a bracket (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). To examine whether human Ku blocks human Exo1-mediated DNA resection, DNA was incubated with 10 nm Exo1 and increasing concentrations of Ku. Only very limited Exo1 resection was observed in the reaction when 5 nm Ku was added to the reaction (Fig. 2B, lane 3). As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, addition of 5 nm Ku resulted in ∼80% forked DNA bound with Ku and ∼20% unbound. Thus the limited resection observed in the presence of 5 nm Ku70/80 is likely due to Exo1-mediated resection of the 20% unbound DNA. When the Ku:forked DNA ratio was at a 1:1 molar ratio (as measured in Fig. 1, B and C) Exo1-mediated resection of the model DNA substrate was completely abrogated. This data shows that similar to the data generated with yeast; human Ku70/80 can bind to DNA substrates and block Exo1-mediated DNA end resection. In S. cerevisiae, either Mre11 or Rad50 deficiency causes excess Ku accumulation at DSBs, which suggests that the MR and Ku complexes compete for the same DSB ends (7Shim E.Y. Chung W.H. Nicolette M.L. Zhang Y. Davis M. Zhu Z. Paull T.T. Ira G. Lee S.E. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 and Ku proteins regulate association of Exo1 and Dna2 with DNA breaks.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Mre11 itself rather than its nuclease activity is required for DNA resection and repair of HO-induced DSBs suggesting that structurally Mre11 can regulate and compete for DNA ends (7Shim E.Y. Chung W.H. Nicolette M.L. Zhang Y. Davis M. Zhu Z. Paull T.T. Ira G. Lee S.E. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 and Ku proteins regulate association of Exo1 and Dna2 with DNA breaks.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 17Llorente B. Symington L.S. The Mre11 nuclease is not required for 5′ to 3′ resection at multiple HO-induced double strand breaks.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9682-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Taking this into consideration, we next wanted to test the competition between human Ku and purified recombinant Mre11 or Mre11/Rad50 for DNA ends in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). First, quantitative binding of Mre11 to the model DNA substrate was performed by incubating varying concentrations of Mre11 with the F-DNA. The gel shift data shows that at low concentrations, the Mre11-DNA complex produced smeared signals in the native gel (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). Increasing the concentration (120 and 250 nm) of Mre11 resulted in the formation of high order Mre11-DNA complexes (Fig. 3A). The data suggests that Mre11 has relatively low DNA binding affinity and likely forms heterogeneous complexes with the F-DNA substrate. To study the competition between Mre11 and Ku70/80 for binding to F-DNA in vitro, F-DNA was incubated with 20 nm Ku and either 12 or 60 nm Mre11 simultaneously. Because the Mre11-DNA and Ku-DNA complexes migrated differently in the native gel (Figs. 1B and 3A, respectively), direct competition between Ku and Mre11 for DNA binding can be determined by the disappearance of one of the protein-DNA signals. Ku-DNA formed the only major protein-DNA complex when 12 nm Mre11 was added to the reaction (Fig. 3B, lane 5). The Ku-DNA complex was the dominant protein-DNA complex when 60 nm Mre11 was added, suggesting that Mre11 could not compete with Ku for DNA binding (Fig. 3B, lane 6). However, a new band with higher molecular weight than the Ku-DNA complex was observed when 60 nm Mre11 and 20 nm Ku were incubated together (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Furthermore, the addition of 60 nm Mre11 appears to result in a switch in the dominant Ku-DNA complex from one Ku binding to the F-DNA to two Ku. This suggests that Mre11 and Ku may be able to simultaneously bind the same DNA substrate and possibly change the binding of Ku to DNA. Furthermore, the data suggests that Mre11 may interact with Ku itself. To test whether Ku and Mre11 can interact independent of DNA, we tested protein-protein interaction with purified proteins. After incubation of purified Ku and Mre11 at 4 °C, each protein was immunoprecipitated via a specific antibody and tested whether they interact in the absence of DNA in vitro. The results show that Ku and Mre11 fail to interact in vitro (supplemental Fig. S2). We conclude that Ku and Mre11 do not physically interact and Mre11 is not able to block Ku from binding to DNA or mediate its dissociation from DNA. Rad50 makes a complex with Mre11 and confers allosteric regulation on Mre11 by coordinating the binding of Mre11 to DNA. In addition, ATP hydrolysis mediated by the ABC ATPase of Rad50 allows an open to close conformation of Mre11/Rad50 (18Williams G.J. Williams R.S. Williams J.S. Moncalian G. Arvai A.S. Limbo O. Guenther G. SilDas S. Hammel M. Russell P. Tainer J.A. ABC ATPase signature helices in Rad50 link nucleotide state to Mre11 interface for DNA repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Hence, we repeated the gel shift assays with Mre11/Rad50 to determine whether DNA binding was different from Mre11 and if Mre11/Rad50 could outcompete Ku for or mediate the dissociation of Ku from DNA ends. The condition of the Mre11/Rad50 binding reaction was similar to Mre11 except ATP was also included in a set of reactions to test a potential effect of ATP hydrolysis in binding to the F-DNA substrate. Like Mre11, Mre11/Rad50 binding also showed smeared signals regardless of the presence of ATP (Fig. 4A). However, its binding affinity was much lower than Mre11 because most DNA was left unbound and the smeared signals were weak even with 250 nm Mre11/Rad50 (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 8). When the concentration of MR was increased, a number of sharp bands were observed, possibly representing different stoichiometry between Mre11/Rad50 and DNA (Fig. 4B, lanes 3, 4 and 7, 8). In addition, unlike Mre11 alone, a number of sharp bands were generated by the Mre11/Rad50-DNA complex at higher Mre11/Rad50 concentrations, which suggests that Mre11/Rad50-DNA complexes are more uniform than the Mre11-DNA complex. Data also showed that ATP hydrolysis may affect the DNA binding affinity of the Mre11/Rad50 complex as a slight reduction in DNA binding was observed with the inclusion of ATP (Fig. 4B). The potential competition between Mre11/Rad50 and Ku for DNA binding was studied by incubating increasing concentrations of Mre11/Rad50 (25–250 nm) and Ku (20 nm) together. As shown in Fig. 4C, even high concentrations of Mre11/Rad50 (250 nm) with or without ATP cannot compete with Ku for DNA ends. Furthermore, unlike Mre11, it appears that Mre11/Rad50 cannot bind to the same DNA substrate as Ku. Taken together, the data shows Mre11 has higher binding affinity to the forked DNA substrate than Mre11/Rad50 and Mre11 partially changed Ku-DNA binding. However, neither Mre11 nor Mre11/Rad50 was able to"

Dietary zinc (Zn)-deficiency (ZD) increases the risk of ESCC. We have previously shown that short-term ZD (6 weeks) in rats induces overexpression of the proinflammatory mediators S100a8 and S100a9 in the esophageal mucosa with accompanying esophageal epithelial hyperplasia. Here we report that prolonged ZD (21 weeks) in rats amplified this inflammation that when combined with non-carcinogenic low doses of the environmental carcinogen, N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) elicited a 66.7% (16/24) incidence of ESCC. With Zn-sufficiency, NMBA produced no cancers (0/21) (P<0.001). At tumor endpoint, the neoplastic ZD esophagus, as compared with Zn-sufficient esophagus, had an inflammatory gene signature with upregulation of numerous cancer-related inflammation genes (CXC and CC chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines and Cox-2) in addition to S100a8 and S100a9. This signature was already activated in the earlier dysplastic stage. Additionally, time-course bioinformatics analysis of expression profiles at tumor endpoint and before NMBA exposure revealed that this sustained inflammation was due to ZD rather than carcinogen exposure. Importantly, Zn replenishment reversed this inflammatory signature at both the dysplastic and neoplastic stages of ESCC development, and prevented cancer formation. Thus, the molecular definition of ZD-induced inflammation as a critical factor in ESCC development has important clinical implications with regard to development and prevention of this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W2069311331,"Cortical GABAergic interneurons originate from ganglionic eminences and tangentially migrate into the cortical plate at early developmental stages. To elucidate the characteristics of this migration of GABAergic interneurons in living animals, we established an experimental design specialized for in vivo time-lapse imaging of the neocortex of neonate mice with two-photon laser-scanning microscopy. In vesicular GABA/glycine transporter (VGAT)-Venus transgenic mice from birth (P0) through P3, we observed multidirectional tangential migration of genetically-defined GABAergic interneurons in the neocortical marginal zone. The properties of this migration, such as the motility rate (distance/hr), the direction moved, and the proportion of migrating neurons to stationary neurons, did not change through P0 to P3, although the density of GABAergic neurons at the marginal zone decreased with age. Thus, the characteristics of the tangential motility of individual GABAergic neurons remained constant in development. Pharmacological block of GABAA receptors and of the Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporters, and chelating intracellular Ca2+, all significantly reduced the motility rate in vivo. The motility rate and GABA content within the cortex of neonatal VGAT-Venus transgenic mice were significantly greater than those of GAD67-GFP knock-in mice, suggesting that extracellular GABA concentration could facilitate the multidirectional tangential migration. Indeed, diazepam applied to GAD67-GFP mice increased the motility rate substantially. In an in vitro neocortical slice preparation, we confirmed that GABA induced a NKCC sensitive depolarization of GABAergic interneurons in VGAT-Venus mice at P0-P3. Thus, activation of GABAAR by ambient GABA depolarizes GABAergic interneurons, leading to an acceleration of their multidirectional motility in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2018886132,"The CUB domain-containing protein-1 (CDCP1) is a transmembrane molecule that has recently been implicated in cancer progression. In this study we have established a novel mechanism for initiation of CDCP1-mediated signaling in vivo and demonstrated that specific 135→70-kDa processing of cell-surface CDCP1 by extracellular serine proteases is a prerequisite for CDCP1-dependent survival of cancer cells during metastasis. The in vivo cleavage of CDCP1 triggers a survival program involving recruitment of Src and PKCδ, Src-mediated phosphorylation of cell-surface-retained 70-kDa CDCP1, activation of Akt and suppression of PARP1-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate in vivo that phosphorylated Src, PKCδ and Akt all constitute activated elements of a CDCP1-signaling axis during tissue colonization of tumor cells. Preventing in vivo cleavage of CDCP1 with unique anti-CDCP1 antibodies, serine protease inhibitors or genetic modulation of the cleavage site in the CDCP1 molecule completely abrogated survival signaling associated with the 70-kDa CDCP1, and induced PARP1 cleavage and PARP1-mediated apoptosis, ultimately resulting in substantial inhibition of tissue colonization by tumor cells. The lack of CDCP1 cleavage in the lung tissue of plasminogen-knockout mice along with a coordinated reduction in tumor cell survival in a lung retention model, and importantly rescue of both by in vivo supplied plasmin, indicated that plasmin is the crucial serine protease executing in vivo cleavage of cell-surface CDCP1 during early stages of lung colonization. Together, our findings indicate that in vivo blocking of CDCP1 cleavage upstream from CDCP1-induced pro-survival signaling provides a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention into metastatic disease."

https://openalex.org/W2016660437,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor, fatal within 1 year from diagnosis in most patients despite intensive multimodality therapy. The migratory and microscopically invasive nature of GBM as well as its resistance to chemotherapy renders conventional therapies inadequate in its treatment. Although Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibition has been shown to decrease the long-term survival and improve the chemosensitivity of GBM in vitro, its role in malignant cellular migration has not been previously evaluated. In this study, we report for the first time a role for Mer RTK in brain tumor migration and show that Mer inhibition profoundly impedes GBM migration and alters cellular morphology. Our data demonstrate that Mer RTK inhibition results in altered signaling through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and RhoA GTPase and a transformation of cytoskeletal organization, suggesting both molecular and structural mechanisms for the abrogation of migration. We also describe a novel and translational method of Mer RTK inhibition using a newly developed monoclonal antibody, providing proof of principle for future evaluation of Mer-targeted translational therapies in the treatment of GBM. Previous findings implicating Mer signaling in glioblastoma survival and chemotherapy resistance coupled with our discovery of the role of Mer RTK in GBM cellular migration support the development of novel Mer-targeted therapies for this devastating disease."
https://openalex.org/W2105902704,"The link between inflammation and colorectal carcinoma has been acknowledged. However, the impact of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on chemokine receptors in human colorectal carcinoma cells still remains to be elucidated. The present study shows that exposure to LPS elevated CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) expression in colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines expressing TLR4/myeloid differential protein (MD-2). CXCR7 is associated with SW480 cell proliferation and migration. However, exposure of SW480 and Colo 205 cells to LPS had no effect on CXCR4 expression. To further support the above results, the expression of TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 was analyzed in human colorectal carcinoma tissues. Higher rates of TLR4 (53%), MD-2 (70%), and CXCR7 (29%) expression were found in colorectal carcinoma tissues than in normal tissues. We demonstrated that the recombination of TLR4, MD-2 and CXCR7 strongly correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis in colorectal carcinoma tissue samples (p = 0.037, p = 0.002, p = 0.042, resp.). Accordingly, simultaneous examination of the expression of TLR4, MD-2 and CXCR7 in cancer tissues of colorectal carcinoma may provide valuable prognostic diagnosis of carcinoma growth and metastasis. Interplay of TLR4, MD-2 and CXCR7 may be of interest in the context of novel immunomodulatory therapies for colorectal carcinoma."

Among these, HypA and HypB were proposed to exert nickel delivery functions in the metallocenter assembly process, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we have overexpressed and purified wild-type HypB as well as two mutants, K168A and M186L/F190V, from Helicobacter pylori. We demonstrated that all proteins bind Ni2+ at a stoichiometry of one Ni2+ per monomer of the proteins with dissociation constants at micromolar levels. Ni2+ elevated GTPase activity of WT HypB, which is attributable to a lower affinity of the protein toward GDP as well as Ni2+-induced dimerization. The disruption of GTP-dependent dimerization has led to GTPase activities of both mutants in apo-forms almost completely abolished, compared with the wild-type protein. The GTPase activity is partially restored for HypB(M186L/F190V) mutant but not for HypB(K168A) mutant upon Ni2+ binding. HypB forms a complex with its partner protein HypA with a low affinity (Kd of 52.2 ± 8.8 μM). Such interactions were also observed in vivo both in the absence and presence of nickel using a GFP-fragment reassembly technique.

https://openalex.org/W1997447080,"The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a multifunctional protein with roles in gene regulation and maintenance of viral latency. Post-translational modification of LANA is important for functional diversification. Here, we report that LANA is subject to arginine methylation by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 in vitro and in vivo. The major arginine methylation site in LANA was mapped to arginine 20. This site was mutated to either phenylalanine (bulky hydrophobic, constitutive methylated mimetic) or lysine (positively charged, non-arginine methylatable) residues. The significance of the methylation in LANA function was examined in both the isolated form and in the context of the viral genome through the generation of recombinant KSHV. In addition, authentic LANA binding sites on the KSHV episome in naturally infected cells were identified using a whole genome KSHV tiling array. Although mutation of the methylation site resulted in no significant difference in KSHV LANA subcellular localization, we found that the methylation mimetic mutation resulted in augmented histone binding in vitro and increased LANA occupancy at identified LANA target promoters in vivo. Moreover, a cell line carrying the methylation mimetic mutant KSHV showed reduced viral gene expression relative to controls both in latency and in the course of reactivation. These results suggest that residue 20 is important for modulation of a subset of LANA functions and properties of this residue, including the hydrophobic character induced by arginine methylation, may contribute to the observed effects."
https://openalex.org/W2029736210,"Tah1 and Pih1 are novel Hsp90 interactors. Tah1 acts as a cofactor of Hsp90 to stabilize Pih1. In yeast, Hsp90, Tah1, and Pih1 were found to form a complex that is required for ribosomal RNA processing through their effect on box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein assembly. Tah1 is a minimal tetratricopeptide repeat protein of 111 amino acid residues that binds to the C terminus of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone, whereas Pih1 consists of 344 residues of unknown fold. The NMR structure of Tah1 has been solved, and this structure shows the presence of two tetratricopeptide repeat motifs followed by a C helix and an unstructured region. The binding of Tah1 to Hsp90 is mediated by the EEVD C-terminal residues of Hsp90, which bind to a positively charged channel formed by Tah1. Five highly conserved residues, which form a two-carboxylate clamp that tightly interacts with the ultimate Asp-0 residue of the bound peptide, are also present in Tah1. Tah1 was found to bind to the C terminus of Pih1 through the C helix and the unstructured region. The C terminus of Pih1 destabilizes the protein in vitro and in vivo, whereas the binding of Tah1 to Pih1 allows for the formation of a stable complex. Based on our data, a model for an Hsp90-Tah1-Pih1 ternary complex is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2040873881,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional phosphorylated protein containing the integrin binding sequence Arg-Gly-Asp through which it interacts with several integrin receptors, such as the αVβ3-integrin. OPN exists in many different isoforms differing in phosphorylation status that are likely to interact differently with integrins. The C-terminal region of OPN is particularly well conserved among mammalian species, which suggests an important functional role of this region. In this study, we show that modification of the extreme C terminus of OPN plays an important regulatory role for the interaction with the αVβ3-integrin. It is demonstrated that highly phosphorylated OPN has a much reduced capability to promote cell adhesion via the αVβ3-integrin compared with lesser phosphorylated forms. The cell attachment promoted by highly phosphorylated OPN could be greatly increased by both dephosphorylation and proteolytic removal of the C terminus. Using recombinantly expressed OPN containing a tag in the N or C terminus, it is shown that a modification in the C-terminal part significantly reduces the adhesion of cells to OPN via the αVβ3-integrin, whereas modification of the N terminus does not influence the binding. The inhibited binding of the αVβ3-integrin to OPN could be restored by proteolytic removal of the C terminus by thrombin and plasmin.

https://openalex.org/W2022830695,"The membrane insertase YidC inserts newly synthesized proteins into the plasma membrane. While defects in YidC homologs in animals and plants cause diseases, YidC in bacteria is essential for life. Membrane insertion and assembly of ATP synthase and respiratory complexes is catalyzed by YidC. To investigate how YidC interacts with membrane-inserting proteins, we generated single cysteine mutants in YidC and in the model substrate Pf3 coat protein. The single cysteine mutants were expressed and analyzed for disulfide formation during 30 s of synthesis. The results show that the substrate contacts different YidC residues in four of the six transmembrane regions. The residues are located either in the region of the inner leaflet, in the center, as well as in the periplasmic leaflet, consistent with the hypothesis that YidC presents a hydrophobic platform for inserting membrane proteins. In a YidC mutant where most of the contacting residues were mutated to serines, YidC function was severely disturbed and no longer active in a complementation test, suggesting that the residues are important for function. In addition, a Pf3 mutant with a defect in membrane insertion was deficient to contact the periplasmic residues of YidC."
https://openalex.org/W2091789457,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from inhibitory interneurons located within the cerebellar cortex limits the extent of neuronal excitation in part through activation of metabotropic GABA(B) receptors. Stimulation of these receptors triggers a number of downstream signaling events, including activation of GIRK channels by the Gβγ dimer resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic sites. Here, we identify RGS6, a member of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins, as a key regulator of GABA(B)R signaling in cerebellum. RGS6 is enriched in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum along with neuronal GIRK channel subunits 1 and 2 where RGS6 forms a complex with known binding partners Gβ(5) and R7BP. Mice lacking RGS6 exhibit abnormal gait and ataxia characterized by impaired rotarod performance improved by treatment with a GABA(B)R antagonist. RGS6(-/-) mice administered baclofen also showed exaggerated motor coordination deficits compared with their wild-type counterparts. Isolated cerebellar neurons natively expressed RGS6, GABA(B)R, and GIRK channel subunits, and cerebellar granule neurons from RGS6(-/-) mice showed a significant delay in the deactivation kinetics of baclofen-induced GIRK channel currents. These results establish RGS6 as a key component of GABA(B)R signaling and represent the first demonstration of an essential role for modulatory actions of RGS proteins in adult cerebellum. Dysregulation of RGS6 expression in human patients could potentially contribute to loss of motor coordination and, thus, pharmacological manipulation of RGS6 levels might represent a viable means to treat patients with ataxias of cerebellar origin."

We hypothesized that these could be used to systemically monitor loss of extracellular matrix due to chronic arthritic diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). To test this, we predicted sites of deamidation in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and confirmed, by mass spectroscopy, the presence of deamidated (Asp64) and native (Asn64) COMP epitopes (mean 0.95% deamidated COMP (D-COMP) relative to native COMP) in cartilage. An Asp64, D-COMP-specific ELISA was developed using a newly created monoclonal antibody 6-1A12. In a joint replacement study, serum D-COMP (p = 0.017), but not total COMP (p = 0.5), declined significantly after replacement demonstrating a joint tissue source for D-COMP.

With the aim of identifying new compound inhibitors of the angiogenesis process, we used an established enhanced green fluorescent protein-transgenic zebrafish line to develop an automated assay that enables high-throughput screening of compound libraries in a whole-organism setting. Using this system, we have identified novel kinase inhibitor compounds that show anti-angiogenic properties in both zebrafish in-vivo system and in human endothelial cell in-vitro angiogenesis models. Furthermore, we have determined the kinase target of these compounds and have identified and validated a previously uncharacterized involvement of phosphorylase kinase subunit G1 (PhKG1) in angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, we have found that PhKG1 is upregulated in human tumor samples and that aberrations in gene copy number of PhK subunits are a common feature of human tumors. Our results provide a novel insight into the angiogenesis process, as well as identify new potential targets for anti-angiogenic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1991399753,"Replication protein A (RPA), the major eukaryotic single-strand DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, is essential for replication, repair, recombination, and checkpoint activation. Defects in RPA-associated cellular activities lead to genomic instability, a major factor in the pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases. ssDNA binding activity is primarily mediated by two domains in the 70-kDa subunit of the RPA complex. These ssDNA interactions are mediated by a combination of polar residues and four conserved aromatic residues. Mutation of the aromatic residues causes a modest decrease in binding to long (30-nucleotide) ssDNA fragments but results in checkpoint activation and cell cycle arrest in cells. We have used a combination of biochemical analysis and knockdown replacement studies in cells to determine the contribution of these aromatic residues to RPA function. Cells containing the aromatic residue mutants were able to progress normally through S-phase but were defective in DNA repair. Biochemical characterization revealed that mutation of the aromatic residues severely decreased binding to short ssDNA fragments less than 20 nucleotides long. These data indicate that altered binding of RPA to short ssDNA intermediates causes a defect in DNA repair but not in DNA replication. These studies show that cells require different RPA functions in DNA replication and DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2045457557,"Mechanical force is known to modulate the activity of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade. However, the effect of mechanical stresses on JNK signaling activation has previously only been analyzed by in vitro detection methods. It still remains unknown how living cells activate the JNK signaling cascade in response to mechanical stress and what its functions are in stretched cells. We assessed in real-time the activity of the JNK pathway in Drosophila cells by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM), using an intramolecular phosphorylation-dependent dJun-FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) biosensor. We found that quantitative FRET-FLIM analysis and confocal microscopy revealed sustained dJun-FRET biosensor activation and stable morphology changes in response to mechanical stretch for Drosophila S2R+ cells. Further, these cells plated on different substrates showed distinct levels of JNK activity that associate with differences in cell morphology, integrin expression and focal adhesion organization. These data imply that alterations in the cytoskeleton and matrix attachments may act as regulators of JNK signaling, and that JNK activity might feed back to modulate the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion. We found that this dynamic system is highly plastic; at rest, integrins at focal adhesions and talin are key factors suppressing JNK activity, while multidirectional static stretch leads to integrin-dependent, and probably talin-independent, Jun sensor activation. Further, our data suggest that JNK activity has to coordinate with other signaling elements for the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell shape remodeling associated with stretch."
https://openalex.org/W2086533558,"Single cell analysis has allowed critical discoveries in drug testing, immunobiology and stem cell research. In addition, a change from two to three dimensional growth conditions radically affects cell behavior. This already resulted in new observations on gene expression and communication networks and in better predictions of cell responses to their environment. However, it is still difficult to study the size and shape of single cells that are freely suspended, where morphological changes are highly significant. Described here is a new method for quantitative real time monitoring of cell size and morphology, on single live suspended cancer cells, unconfined in three dimensions. The precision is comparable to that of the best optical microscopes, but, in contrast, there is no need for confining the cell to the imaging plane. The here first introduced cell magnetorotation (CM) method is made possible by nanoparticle induced cell magnetization. By using a rotating magnetic field, the magnetically labeled cell is actively rotated, and the rotational period is measured in real-time. A change in morphology induces a change in the rotational period of the suspended cell (e.g. when the cell gets bigger it rotates slower). The ability to monitor, in real time, cell swelling or death, at the single cell level, is demonstrated. This method could thus be used for multiplexed real time single cell morphology analysis, with implications for drug testing, drug discovery, genomics and three-dimensional culturing."
https://openalex.org/W2039548299,"Background The extracellular domain of the influenza A virus protein matrix protein 2 (M2e) is remarkably conserved between various human isolates and thus is a viable target antigen for a universal influenza vaccine. With the goal of inducing protection in multiple mouse haplotypes, M2e-based multiple antigenic peptides (M2e-MAP) were synthesized to contain promiscuous T helper determinants from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, the hepatitis B virus antigen and the influenza virus hemagglutinin. Here, we investigated the nature of the M2e-MAP-induced B cell response in terms of the distribution of antibody (Ab) secreting cells (ASCs) and Ab isotypes, and tested the protective efficacy in various mouse strains. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunization of BALB/c mice with M2e-MAPs together with potent adjuvants, CpG 1826 oligonucleotides (ODN) and cholera toxin (CT) elicited high M2e-specific serum Ab titers that protected mice against viral challenge. Subcutaneous (s.c.) and intranasal (i.n.) delivery of M2e-MAPs resulted in the induction of IgG in serum and airway secretions, however only i.n. immunization induced anti-M2e IgA ASCs locally in the lungs, correlating with M2-specific IgA in the bronchio-alveolar lavage (BAL). Interestingly, both routes of vaccination resulted in equal protection against viral challenge. Moreover, M2e-MAPs induced cross-reactive and protective responses to diverse M2e peptides and variant influenza viruses. However, in contrast to BALB/c mice, immunization of other inbred and outbred mouse strains did not induce protective Abs. This correlated with a defect in T cell but not B cell responsiveness to the M2e-MAPs. Conclusion/Significance Anti-M2e Abs induced by M2e-MAPs are highly cross-reactive and can mediate protection to variant viruses. Although synthetic MAPs are promising designs for vaccines, future constructs will need to be optimized for use in the genetically heterogeneous human population."

Netrin-4, the most distant member of this family, is related to the laminin β chain and has recently been proposed to play an important role in embryonic and pathological angiogenesis. However, the data reported so far lead to the apparently contradictory conclusions supporting Netrin-4 as either a pro- or an anti-angiogenic factor. To elucidate this controversy, Netrin-4 was analyzed for a vascular activity in both cell-based models (human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human umbilical artery endothelial cells) and two zebrafish models: the wild-type AB/Tü strain and the transgenic Tg(fli1a:EGFP)(y1) strain. We show that Netrin-4 is expressed in endothelial cells and in the zebrafish vascular system. We also show evidence that Netrin-4 activates various kinases and induces various biological effects directly linked to angiogenesis in vitro. Using a morpholinos strategy, we demonstrate that Netrin-4 expression is crucial for zebrafish vessel formation and that a blood vessel formation defect induced by netrin-4 morpholinos can be partially rescued through drug delivery leading to protein kinase activation. Together these data underscore the crucial role of Netrin-4 in blood vessel formation and the involvement of protein kinases activation in Netrin-4-induced biological effects related to vascular development."
https://openalex.org/W2093519662,"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is the most common type of pediatric peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In 70–80% of cases, the chromosomal aberration t(2;5)(p23;q35) results in the juxtaposition of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with nucleophosmin (NPM) and the subsequent expression of the NPM-ALK fusion protein. NPM-ALK is a chimeric tyrosine kinase, which induces numerous signaling pathways that drive proliferation and abrogate apoptosis. However, the mechanisms that lead to activation of downstream growth regulatory molecules have not been completely elucidated. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screen, we identified GSK3β as a signaling mediator of NPM-ALK. Using a selective inhibitor of ALK, we demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase activity of ALK regulates the serine-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β. Expression of NPM-ALK in 293T cells led to an increase of pS9-GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) compared with kinase-defective K210R mutant NPM-ALK, but did not affect total GSK3β levels. Phosphorylation of pS9-GSK3β by NPM-ALK was mediated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. ALK inhibition resulted in degradation of GSK3β substrates Mcl-1 and CDC25A, which was recovered upon chemical inhibition of the proteasome (MG132). Furthermore, the degradation of Mcl-1 was recoverable with inhibition of GSK3β. ALK inhibition also resulted in decreased cell viability, which was rescued by GSK3β inhibition. Furthermore, stable knockdown of GSK3β conferred resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of ALK inhibition using viability and colony formation assays. pS9-GSK3β and CDC25A were selectively expressed in neoplastic cells of ALK+ALCL tissue biopsies, and showed a significant correlation (P<0.001). Conversely, ALK-ALCL tissue biopsies did not show significant correlation of pS9-GSK3β and CDC25A expression (P<0.2). Our results demonstrate that NPM-ALK regulates the phosphorylation of S9-GSK3β by PI3K/AKT. The subsequent inhibition of GSK3β activity results in accumulation of CDC25A and Mcl-1, which confers the advantage of growth and protection from apoptosis. These findings provide support for the role of GSK3β as a mediator of NPM-ALK oncogenesis."

In this report, we use an assortment of powerful biochemical and molecular methods to assess the existence and potential functional impact of oligomeric hPCFT. [3′,5′,7-3H]Mtx (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Unlabeled Mtx was provided by the Drug Development Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD).

Tissue culture reagents and supplies were purchased from assorted vendors with the exception of fetal bovine serum, which was purchased from Hyclone Technologies (Logan, UT). The cross-linking reagent 1,1-methanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (MTS-1-MTS) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). An expression construct for deglycosylated hPCFT with a Myc epitope tag (dghPCFTMyc-His6) and Gln substituted for Asn at positions 58 and 68 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis, using wild-type (WT) Myc-His6-tagged hPCFT (wthPCFTMyc-His6) in pCDNA3.1 (24Desmoulin S.K.

To prepare WT HA-tagged hPCFT (wthPCFTHA) with an HA epitope insertion (YPYDVPDYA) at amino acid 459, preceded by a 3-amino acid (GTQ) linker, the hPCFT cDNA fragment was excised from the wthPCFTMyc-His6 construct by digestion with BamHI and KpnI and cloned upstream of the HA tag in pCDNA3 after deleting the hRFC cDNA fragment from a carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged hRFC construct (41Payton S.G.

WT Myc-tagged hPCFT (wthPCFTMyc) was prepared from wthPCFTHA by inserting a Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) in place of the HA tag, followed by a stop codon. A FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted at the hPCFT N terminus just after Met-1 of wthPCFTMyc to generate wtFLAGhPCFTMyc, and from this construct, wtFLAGhPCFTMyc-His10 was generated by inserting a His10 immediately following the Myc sequence. Deglycosylated hPCFT (dgFLAGhPCFTMyc-His10) was also prepared from wtFLAGhPCFTMyc-His10 by substitution of Asn-58 and Asn-68 with glutamine. To prepare fluorescent protein-tagged hPCFTs for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments (see below), YPet-His and ECFP*-His cDNAs optimized for mammalian codon expression of yellow and enhanced cyan fluorescent proteins, respectively, were provided by Dr. Tomoo Ohashi (Duke University Medical Center) (43Ohashi T.

The mYPet cDNA fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned in pCDNA3 using these same sites. mECFP*/pCDNA3 was prepared using the same strategy with BamHI and EcoRV. To attach mYPet to the C terminus of hPCFT (hPCFT-mYPet), the hPCFT cDNA fragment was excised from the wthPCFTMyc construct by HindIII and BamHI digestions and inserted upstream of the mYPet cDNA in the mYPet/pCDNA3 construct using these same sites. An analogous strategy was used to attach mECFP* to the C terminus of hPCFT (hPCFT-mECFP*), using the wthPCFTMyc and mECFP*/pCDNA3 constructs. Both hPCFT-mYPet and hPCFT-mECFP* constructs included a 2-amino acid (GS) insertion between the hPCFT and the fluorescent protein tag.

DT-14-(-)-Epi received (-)-epicatechin (1.0 mg/kg 2 ×/d), whereas water was given to the DT-14-W group. The latter 3 groups performed 5 wk of endurance training 5 ×/wk. Hindlimb muscles were harvested, and Western blots, as well as enzyme analyses, were performed. Training significantly increased capillary-to-fiber ratio (≈ 78.8%), cytochrome-c oxidase (≈ 35%), and activity (≈ 144%) compared to controls. These adaptations returned to control levels for the DT-14-W group, whereas the DT-14-(-)-Epi group was able to maintain capillary-to-fiber ratio (≈ 44%), CcO protein expression (≈ 45%), and activity (≈ 108%) above control levels. In addition, the increase in capillarity was related to decreased protein expression of thrombospondin-1, an antiangiogenic regulator. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in endurance capacity between the trained and DT-14-(-)-Epi groups. Our data suggest that (-)-epicatechin may be a suitable compound to maintain exercise-induced improved capillarity and mitochondrial capacity, even when exercise regimens are discontinued."
https://openalex.org/W2069014881,"Control of sulfur metabolism in plants and bacteria is linked, in significant measure, to the behavior of the cysteine synthase complex (CSC). The complex is comprised of the two enzymes that catalyze the final steps in cysteine biosynthesis: serine O-acetyltransferase (SAT, EC 2.3.1.30), which produces O-acetyl-l-serine, and O-acetyl-l-serine sulfhydrylase (OASS, EC 2.5.1.47), which converts it to cysteine. SAT (a dimer of homotrimers) binds a maximum of two molecules of OASS (a dimer) in an interaction believed to involve docking of the C terminus from a protomer in an SAT trimer into an OASS active site. This interaction inactivates OASS catalysis and prevents further binding to the trimer; thus, the system exhibits a contact-induced inactivation of half of each biomolecule. To better understand the dynamics and energetics that underlie formation of the CSC, the interactions of OASS and SAT from Escherichia coli were studied at equilibrium and in the pre-steady state. Using an experimental strategy that initiates dissociation of the CSC at different points in the CSC-forming reaction, three stable forms of the complex were identified. Comparison of the binding behaviors of SAT and its C-terminal peptide supports a mechanism in which SAT interacts with OASS in a non-allosteric interaction involving its C terminus. This early docking event appears to fasten the proteins in close proximity and thus prepares the system to engage in a series of subsequent, energetically favorable isomerizations that inactivate OASS and produce the fully isomerized CSC.

Bacterial sulfur metabolism is a complex, sensitive function of an organism's environment.

OASS catalyzes a classic PLP-dependent, ping-pong β-elimination reaction in which PLP, in Schiff-base linkage with a conserved lysine, is displaced from the enzyme by attack of OAS, forming an external Schiff base that rearranges to eliminate its β-substituent (acetate). Hydrogen sulfide then adds to the enzyme and attacks the β-carbon of the intermediate, forming a cysteine-PLP adduct that is cleaved to release cysteine during re-attachment of PLP to the conserved lysine. The SAT mechanism had long been considered to be ping pong (32Leu L.S. Cook P.F.

To better understand how the CSC assembles, formation of the complex was studied at equilibrium and in the pre-steady state. The system was probed for folding intermediates on the assembly pathway using an experimental design in which the irreversible disassembly of the CSC is initiated at various points during complex formation. Reaction-stage-dependent reversal of the forward process allows transient, optically silent intermediates to be detected as they return to their optically active forms. Two such intermediates were identified using this strategy. A single intermediate has been suggested for the CSC from Haemophilus influenza (36Salsi E. Campanini B. Bettati S. Raboni S. Roderick S.L.

Comparison of the kinetics and energetics of the binding of SAT with its 10-mer, C-terminal peptide supports a mechanism in which the C terminus of SAT attaches to OASS through a non-allosteric interaction that tethers the CSC proteins. The loosely coupled complex then engages in at least two energetically favorable isomerizations that lead to the optimally stabilized CSC and the inactivation of OASS. The list of materials used in this work is as follows: OAS, dithiothreitol (DTT), EDTA, l-glutathione (reduced), glucose, imidazole, isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, LB media, lysozyme, maltose, β-mercaptoethanol, potassium phosphate, pyridoxine, SDS, and thiamin were the highest grade available from Sigma. Glutathione- and nickel-chelating resins were obtained from GE Healthcare. Primers and competent E. coli (BL21(DE3)) were purchased from Novagen. Ampicillin, guanidine hydrochloride, Hepes, KOH, KCl, MgCl2, NaCl, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Tris base were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Restriction enzymes and amylose resin were obtained from New England Biolabs. The P10 peptide was obtained from United Peptide Corp. OASS was cloned by PCR from E. coli K-12 genomic DNA using N- and C-terminal primers containing NdeI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding region. The sense and antisense primer were: 5′-GACTACCATATGAGTAAGATTTTTGAAGATAAC and 5′-GACTACCTCGAGTTACTGTTGCAATTCTTTCTC, respectively. The coding region was subcloned into the pGEX-6P expression vector with an N-terminal His/GST tag (37Andreassi 2nd, J.L. Leyh T.S. Molecular functions of conserved aspects of the GHMP kinase family.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14594-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). BL-21(DE3) containing the OASS expression plasmid was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), pyridoxine (10 μm), and thiamin (15 μm) to an A600 of ∼0.7. The culture was then cooled to 18 °C, isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1.0 mm, and cells were harvested 16 h later. OASS was purified according to a published protocol (37Andreassi 2nd, J.L. Leyh T.S. Molecular functions of conserved aspects of the GHMP kinase family.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14594-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resulting enzyme was >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. The kcat of purified enzyme (0.36 s−1) and its A412/A280 ratio (indicative of PLP content) were similar to those reported for the closely related enzyme from S. typhimurium, 0.56 s−1 and 3.5, respectively (38Tai C.H.

The subcloning strategy and procedures are similar to those used to clone OASS with the exception that the growth medium did not include thiamin and pyridoxine. The sense and antisense primers (5′-GACTACCATATGTCAGATCCCATCACC and 5′-GACTACCTCGAGATGTCGTGTGCCGAACTG, respectively) position NdeI (5′) and XhoI (3′) restriction sites at the edges of the cysE coding region. Using these sites, the PCR product was inserted into a triple-tag pGEX-6P vector in which maltose-binding protein (39Kapust R.B. Waugh D.S. Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein is uncommonly effective at promoting the solubility of polypeptides to which it is fused.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) is fused to the C terminus of GST (pGEX-His-GST-MBP). The induction protocol was identical to that of OASS. The SAT fusion was purified according to manufacturer's recommendations using Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin followed by amylose resin. The N-terminal His-GST-MBP tag was removed by digestion with PreScission protease during overnight dialysis against Hepes/K+ (25 mm, pH 7.5), KCl (0.10 m), and DTT (1.5 mm) at 4 °C and separated from SAT using a glutathione resin. Removal of the tag with PreScission protease leaves a small peptide (GPLH-) at the N terminus of the inserted coding region (40Cordingley M.G. Callahan P.L. Sardana V.V. Garsky V.M. Colonno R.J.

In the resting enzyme, PLP covalently attaches to a conserved active-site lysine and forms a protonated internal aldimine, which is fluorescent. The spectral features of the two protonated aldimine tautomers (the ketoenamine and enolimine) are distinct. The ketoenamine excitation λmax is near 414 nm, and its emission spectrum is centered near 510 nm (red spectrum, Fig. 1A). Substrate binding changes PLP fluorescence. In particular, the active site of OASS contains a subsite that binds the α-carboxyl of substrate. Binding at the subsite triggers partial closure of the active site of OASS (42Schnackerz K.D.

This closure is believed to result in the observed ∼15 nm blue-shift in the PLP emission λmax and the increase in the emitted light intensity, which is due to a lengthening of the ketoenamine excited-state lifetime (42Schnackerz K.D.

Although the CSC structure has not yet been determined, structures of OASS in complex with the C-terminal peptide of SAT provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of complex formation. Notably, these structures have provided the impetus for peptide library screens that aim to identifying novel antibiotics (25Salsi E. Bayden A.S. Spyrakis F. Amadasi A. Campanini B. Bettati S.

The C-terminal carboxylate of the peptide is docked into the acceptor subsite, suggesting that the fluorescence changes caused by peptide binding should mimic those of compounds that bind the subsite: this is precisely what is observed. The binding of either SAT or peptide to OASS increases the intensity of PLP fluorescence (6.1- and 3.7-fold, respectively) and blue-shifts the excitation λmax by ∼15 nm (black and green spectra, Fig. 1A). Unlike peptide or SAT, the addition of OAS causes OASS to move through its first half-reaction. This chemistry produces an external aldimine whose absorbance maximum is red-shifted ∼45 nm, causing a near cessation of fluorescence at λex 414 nm (blue spectrum, Fig. 1A). These spectral changes and interpretations are used extensively in the studies that follow. To construct a quantitative model for SAT binding to OASS, the forward and reverse directions of the binding reaction were monitored via fluorescence.

https://openalex.org/W1991802626,"Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases are typically characterized by deposition of abnormally folded partially protease-resistant host-derived prion protein (PrPres), which is associated with activated glia and increased release of cytokines. This neuroinflammatory response may play a role in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy pathogenesis. We previously reported that brain homogenates from prion-infected mice induced cytokine protein release in primary astroglial and microglial cell cultures. Here we measured cytokine release by cultured glial cells to determine what factors in infected brain contributed to activation of microglia and astroglia. In assays analyzing IL-12p40 and CCL2 (MCP-1), glial cells were not stimulated in vitro by either PrPres purified from infected mouse brains or prion protein amyloid fibrils produced in vitro. However, significant glial stimulation was induced by clarified scrapie brain homogenates lacking PrPres. This stimulation was greatly reduced both by antibody to cyclophilin A (CyPA), a known mediator of inflammation in peripheral tissues, and by cyclosporine A, a CyPA inhibitor. In biochemical studies, purified truncated CyPA fragments stimulated a pattern of cytokine release by microglia and astroglia similar to that induced by scrapie-infected brain homogenates, whereas purified full-length CyPA was a poor stimulator. This requirement for CyPA truncation was not reported in previous studies of stimulation of peripheral macrophages, endothelial cell cardiomyocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Therefore, truncated CyPA detected in brain following prion infection may have an important role in the activation of brain-derived primary astroglia and microglia in prion disease and perhaps other neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory diseases.

Molecular biology of prion diseases.Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). These diseases include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in cervids, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. A critical event in TSE pathogenesis is the conformational transition of the cellular prion protein (PrPsen; also known as PrPC) into an abnormal, partially protease-resistant host-derived prion protein (PrPres or PrPSc). Accumulation of PrPres in brain is associated with spongiform degeneration of gray matter, neuronal cell death, and gliosis involving activation of microglia and astroglia.In response to brain infection, injury, or neurodegeneration, microglia and astroglia often promote inflammation by releasing neurotoxic factors and proinflammatory cytokines (2Rock R.B.

However, the specific roles of glia and their stimulatory molecules in TSE pathogenesis are still not clear. Microglial activation in vitro and induction of release of IL-6 and IL-1β by the prion protein peptide 106–126 have been demonstrated (14Peyrin J.M. Lasmézas C.I. Haïk S. Tagliavini F. Salmona M.

Chemokine control of West Nile virus infection.Exp.

In the present work, our goal was to identify molecules present in scrapie-infected brain that are responsible for stimulation of cytokine release by microglia and astroglia. Analysis of fractionated scrapie-infected brain homogenates identified cyclophilin A (CyPA) as an important factor in scrapie-infected brains stimulating cytokine release from microglia and astroglia in vitro. CyPA has previously been shown to be involved in inflammatory processes of peripheral tissues in diseases such as arthritis and atherosclerosis (23Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G. Liao D.F. Yan C.

However, this is the first report describing a potential role for CyPA in the activation of brain microglia and astroglia. We now demonstrate that CyPA from scrapie-infected brains is a potent stimulator of cytokine release by both microglia and astroglia in vitro. Inhibiting CyPA activity in scrapie D-sups by treatment with α-CyPA or with CsA, a CyPA inhibitor, decreased cytokine release by both microglia and astroglia in vitro. Furthermore, we identified truncated forms of CyPA in glial stimulating preparations such as scrapie brains and rhCyPA. The purified full-length form of rhCyPA did not induce a glial cytokine release, but purified lower molecular weight forms of rhCyPA induced a pattern of cytokine release in cultured microglia or astroglia similar to that induced by scrapie D-sup (summarized in Table 3). This pattern of glial cytokines differed from that released by astroglia after stimulation by a brain stab wound (41Takamiya M. Fujita S. Saigusa K. Aoki Y. Simultaneous detections of 27 cytokines during cerebral wound healing by multiplexed bead-based immunoassay for wound age estimation.J. Neurotrauma. 2007; 24: 1833-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or by exposure to HIV Tat protein (42Fitting S. Zou S. Chen W. Vo P. Hauser K.F. Knapp P.E. Regional heterogeneity and diversity in cytokine and chemokine production by astroglia: differential responses to HIV-1 Tat, gp120, and morphine revealed by multiplex analysis.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but was similar to that described earlier in brains of scrapie-infected animals (22Tribouillard-Tanvier D. Striebel J.F. Peterson K.E. Chesebro B. Analysis of protein levels of 24 cytokines in scrapie agent-infected brain and glial cell cultures from mice differing in prion protein expression levels.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 11244-11253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The correlation in the cytokine patterns induced by scrapie brain extracts and truncated rhCyPA strengthened the conclusion that CyPA contributes to the stimulation of astroglia and microglia observed during prion disease pathogenesis. Moreover, preclinical scrapie D-sups from 61 to 135 days postinfection demonstrated a progressively increasing ability to stimulate CCL2 release by astroglia (Fig. 8). The presence of this stimulating activity correlated with the timing of the progressive gliosis following scrapie infection and suggested a role for CyPA in the gliosis observed at preclinical as well as clinical stages of prion disease. We also analyzed these preclinical samples by immunoblot for the presence of truncated CyPA products, but the truncations were likely below the level of detection by Western blotting (data not shown).In our experiments, neither purified PrPres nor amyloid PrP fibrils were capable of stimulating microglia or astroglia to release cytokines. One might expect that the disease-associated PrPres would be capable of stimulating glial cells as deposition of PrPres is usually colocalized with gliosis (10Van Everbroeck B. Dobbeleir I.

However, our findings using PrPres were contrary to those using peptide 106–126 and suggested that the role of PrPres in glial cytokine release and induction of brain inflammation during prion disease may be due to indirect neurotoxic effects rather than direct effects of PrPres on glial cells.Possibly, the damage caused by PrPres during the disease process may induce active secretion and truncation of CyPA by either neurons or microglia (23Jin Z.G.

During the process of prion infection, truncated and/or full-length CyPA may be released by dying neuronal or glial cells (23Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G. Liao D.F. Yan C. Haendeler J. Suh Y.A.

In our experiments, these truncated forms of CyPA appeared to be the most potent activators of glial cytokine release. In contrast, such truncated CyPA forms were not present in the normal D-sup. This might explain why CyPA in normal D-sup was not a stimulant of glial cytokine release.In this study, we found apparent similarities between one commercially available rhCyPA (Abcam) and the scrapie D-sup. Both have intact full-length and truncated CyPA. These truncated forms of CyPA in both scrapie D-sup and rhCyPA were recognized by our α-CyPA antibody, which is directed against residues 100–165. Thus, the truncated CyPA forms contain an epitope within the C-terminal third of CyPA. Based on our fractionation studies of the mixture of intact full-length and truncated rhCyPA, the intact form is at best a weak glial stimulator, whereas the fractions with truncated forms are strong glial stimulators. By immunoblot in fractions 3 and 4, we could detect fragments containing an epitope in the C-terminal third (Fig. 9A), but by mass spectroscopy analysis, forms lacking C-terminal sequences could not be excluded (data not shown). The fact that this C-terminal CyPA region was present in the truncated fragments in the stimulatory fractions of both purified rhCyPA and scrapie D-sup strongly supported the conclusion that these fragments in scrapie brain D-sup are important stimulatory molecules for both astroglia and microglia.This last finding raises the question of why truncated forms of CyPA are better glial stimulators than the full-length CyPA. Possibly, the folding of truncated forms of CyPA might be more favorable for the binding to the CD147 cellular receptor. Residue 126 present in the C-terminal region of CyPA, which is necessary for the binding to CD147 (50Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B.

Alternatively, some sequences present in full-length CyPA might interfere with the binding of the C-terminal region to the receptor CD147. The extra sequences might be involved in interactions with additional cellular molecules that might alter the availability of CyPA for binding to CD147. It is also plausible that truncated CyPA might interact with an as yet unidentified alternate receptor other than CD147 on glial cells. Further studies of glial stimulation and inhibition with other CyPA fragments will be required to distinguish among these possibilities.Although extracellular CyPA has been reported to stimulate the activation and release of various molecules from several cell types derived from peripheral tissues, including vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages (23Jin Z.G.

Possibly, the spontaneous breakdown found in some of our commercial CyPA preparations might also have occurred in the experiments of others. Alternatively, full-length CyPA might be a strong stimulator in these other cell types, suggesting a distinct difference in the ligand requirements for stimuli of astroglia and microglia.The cytokine response by glial cells after scrapie infection is restricted to a few cytokines at low levels (22Tribouillard-Tanvier D.

Virol. 2009; 83: 11244-11253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is still not understood whether glial activation is part of the pathogenic process or part of the host response to brain damage or both. Controversy exists over the neurodegenerative versus neuroregenerative roles of microglia in many brain diseases (52Mallat M. Chamak B. Brain macrophages: neurotoxic or neurotrophic effector cells.J.

Possibly, CyPA might also be released and contribute to gliosis during CNS inflammatory or degenerative diseases unrelated to prion infections. Our present results showing a role for CyPA in glial activation during prion diseases may provide new approaches such as using CyPA knock-out mice or inhibiting CyPA in vivo with cyclosporine A for studying the effects of gliosis and CyPA on disease pathogenesis in vivo. IntroductionPrion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) 3The abbreviations used are: TSEtransmissible spongiform encephalopathyPrPprion proteinPrPrespartially protease-resistant host-derived prion proteinCyPAcyclophilin ACsAcyclosporine Adpidays postinoculationsupsupernatantBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolrhCyPArecombinant human CyPARANTESregulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secretedG-CSFgranulocyte colony-stimulating factor. diseases, are infectious neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals (1Prusiner S.B. Molecular biology of prion diseases.Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). These diseases include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in cervids, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. A critical event in TSE pathogenesis is the conformational transition of the cellular prion protein (PrPsen; also known as PrPC) into an abnormal, partially protease-resistant host-derived prion protein (PrPres or PrPSc). Accumulation of PrPres in brain is associated with spongiform degeneration of gray matter, neuronal cell death, and gliosis involving activation of microglia and astroglia.In response to brain infection, injury, or neurodegeneration, microglia and astroglia often promote inflammation by releasing neurotoxic factors and proinflammatory cytokines (2Rock R.B.

In the present work, our goal was to identify molecules present in scrapie-infected brain that are responsible for stimulation of cytokine release by microglia and astroglia. Analysis of fractionated scrapie-infected brain homogenates identified cyclophilin A (CyPA) as an important factor in scrapie-infected brains stimulating cytokine release from microglia and astroglia in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2012648788,"Background Recent studies have reported that patients with end-stage heart disease can have cognitive deficits ranging from mild to severe. Little is known, however, about the relationship between cognitive performance, neurophysiological characteristics and relevant clinical and instrumental indexes for an extensive evaluation of patients with heart failure, such as: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and other haemodynamic measures, maximum oxygen uptake during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, comorbidities, major cardiovascular risk factors and disease duration. Our purpose was to outline the cognitive profiles of end-stage heart disease patients in order to identify the cognitive deficits that could compromise the quality of life and the therapeutic adherence in end-stage heart disease patients, and to identify the variables associated with an increased risk of cognitive deficits in these patients. Methods 207 patients with end-stage cardiac disease, candidates for heart transplant, were assessed by complete neuropsychological evaluation and by electroencephalographic recording with EEG spectral analysis. Results Pathological scores in one or more of the cognitive tests were obtained by 86% of the patients, while 36% performed within the impaired range on five or more tests, indicating poor performance across a broad range of cognitive domains. The executive functions were the cognitive domain most impaired (70%). Poor performances were not related to the aetiology of heart disease, but rather to cerebral dysfunction secondary to haemodynamic impairment and to comorbidities. Conclusions Severe heart failure induces significant neurophysiological and neuropsychological alterations, which may produce an impairment of cognitive functioning and possibly compromise the quality of life of patients and the therapeutic adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2135160408,"We have reported previously the development of small-molecule phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) antagonists (PITs) that block pleckstrin homology (PH) domain interaction, including activation of Akt, and show anti-tumor potential. Here we show that the same molecules inhibit growth factor-induced actin remodeling, lamellipodia formation and, ultimately, cell migration and invasion, consistent with an important role of PIP3 in these processes. In vivo, a PIT-1 analog displays significant inhibition on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) was recently identified as an important mediator of cytoskeleton and cell motility, which is regulated by PIP3-dependent membrane translocation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide binding site opener (ARNO) and general receptor for 3-phosphoinositides (GRP1). We demonstrate that PITs inhibit PIP3/ARNO or GRP1 PH domain binding and membrane localization, resulting in the inhibition of ARF6 activation. Importantly, we show that expression of the constitutively active mutant of ARF6 attenuates inhibition of lamellipodia formation and cell migration by PITs, confirming that inhibition of ARF6 contributes to inhibition of these processes by PITs. Overall, our studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing specific small-molecule targeting PIP3 binding by PH domains as potential anticancer agents that can simultaneously interfere with cancer development at multiple points."
https://openalex.org/W2054473776,"The standard collagen triple helix requires Gly as every third residue in the amino acid sequence, yet all nonfibrillar collagens contain sites where this repeating pattern is interrupted. To explore the effects of such natural interruptions on the triple helix, a 4- or 15-residue sequence from human basement membrane type IV collagen was introduced between (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) domains within a recombinant bacterial collagen. The interruptions had little effect on melting temperature, consistent with the high thermal stability reported for nonfibrillar collagens. Although the 4-residue interruption cannot be accommodated within a standard triple helix, trypsin and thermolysin resistance indicated a tightly packed structure. Central residues of the 15-residue interruption were protease-susceptible, whereas residues near the (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) boundary were resistant, supporting a transition from an alternate conformation to a well packed triple helix. Both interruptions led to a delay in triple-helix folding, with the 15-residue interruption causing slower folding than the 4-residue interruption. These results suggest that propagation through interruptions represents a slow folding step. To clarify the relation between natural interruptions and pathological mutations, a Gly to Ser missense mutation was placed three triplets away from the 4-residue interruption. As a result of this mutation, the 4-residue interruption and nearby triple helix became susceptible to protease digestion, and an additional folding delay was observed. Because Gly missense mutations that cause disease are often located near natural interruptions, structural and folding perturbations arising from such proximity could be a factor in collagen genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1975011192,"The biosynthesis of chlorophyll, an essential cofactor for photosynthesis, requires the ATP-dependent insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX catalyzed by the multisubunit enzyme magnesium chelatase. This enzyme complex consists of the I subunit, an ATPase that forms a complex with the D subunit, and an H subunit that binds both the protoporphyrin substrate and the magnesium protoporphyrin product. In this study we used electron microscopy and small-angle x-ray scattering to investigate the structure of the magnesium chelatase H subunit, ChlH, from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Single particle reconstruction of negatively stained apo-ChlH and Chl-porphyrin proteins was used to reconstitute three-dimensional structures to a resolution of ∼30 Å. ChlH is a large, 148-kDa protein of 1326 residues, forming a cage-like assembly comprising the majority of the structure, attached to a globular N-terminal domain of ∼16 kDa by a narrow linker region. This N-terminal domain is adjacent to a 5 nm-diameter opening in the structure that allows access to a cavity. Small-angle x-ray scattering analysis of ChlH, performed on soluble, catalytically active ChlH, verifies the presence of two domains and their relative sizes. Our results provide a basis for the multiple regulatory and catalytic functions of ChlH of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and for a chaperoning function that sequesters the enzyme-bound magnesium protoporphyrin product prior to its delivery to the next enzyme in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, magnesium protoporphyrin methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2076219117,"Background Quality is central to understanding provider motivations to join and remain within a social franchising network. Quality also appears as a key issue from the client's perspective, and may influence why a client chooses to use a franchised provider over another type of provider. The dynamic relationships between providers of social franchising clinics and clients who use these services have not been thoroughly investigated in the context of Myanmar, which has an established social franchising network. This study examines client motivations to use a Sun Quality Health network provider and provider motivations to join and remain in the Sun Quality Health network. Taken together, these two aims provide an opportunity to explore the symbiotic relationship between client satisfaction and provider incentives to increase the utilization of reproductive health care services. Methods and Findings Results from a series of focus group discussions with clients of reproductive health services and franchised providers shows that women chose health services provided by franchised private sector general practitioners because of its perceived higher quality, associated with the availability of effective, affordable, drugs. A key finding of the study is associated with providers. Provider focus group discussions indicate that a principle determinate for joining and remaining in the Sun Quality Health Network was serving the poor."
https://openalex.org/W2018718014,"Prostate cancers (PCs), initially responsive to anti-androgen therapies, often advance to a hormone-refractory ‘castrate-resistant’ PC (CRPC) stage. However, the androgen receptor (AR) pathway remains active and key for cell growth and gene expression within tumours, even in the apparent absence of hormone. Proposed mechanisms to explain progression, including AR amplification/mutation, are insufficient to completely explain CRPC and possible roles of AR cofactors such as prohibitin (PHB) are poorly understood. We investigated whether PHB loss could sensitise PC cells and tumours to adrenal gland-derived androgens, which persist even after androgen ablation, hence contribute to development of CRPC. Using a pair of PC cell lines, inducibly expressing ectopic cDNA or RNAi for PHB, responses to different androgens and hormone concentrations were studied both in vitro and in vivo. PHB was found at the promoters of several genes, both AR and non-AR-regulated, and knockdown increased histone acetylation at these promoters. Further, PHB knockdown increased the rate of AR ligand-induced chromatin binding, and binding rate and occupancy of AR upon the PSA promoter. This resulted in increased cell growth and AR activity in response to all androgens, including promoting a response to the weaker adrenal androgens previously absent at physiological concentrations. In vivo this had functional consequences such that PHB knockdown resulted in androstenedione being sufficient to promote tumour growth, under conditions mimicking those in patients undergoing androgen ablation therapy. We conclude that reduction in PHB levels is sufficient to lower the threshold of AR activity in vitro and in vivo; this may be via a general increase in histone acetylation that could potentially affect signalling by other transcription factors. PHB loss may provide a mechanism for progression to CRPC by sensitising PC cells to ‘castrate’ conditions—that is, low levels of testicular androgens in the continued presence of weak adrenal and dietary androgens."
https://openalex.org/W2089301003,"Many severely hypoxic cells fail to initiate DNA replication, but the mechanism underlying this observation is unknown. Specifically, although the ataxia-telangiectasia-rad3 related (ATR) kinase has been shown to be activated in hypoxic cells, several studies have not been able to document down-stream consequences of ATR activation in these cells. By clearly defining the DNA replication initiation checkpoint in hypoxic cells, we now demonstrate that ATR is responsible for activating this checkpoint. We show that the hypoxic activation of ATR leads to the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the cdc25a phosphatase. Downregulation of cdc25a protein by ATR in hypoxic cells decreases CDK2 phosphorylation and activity, which results in the degradation of cdc6 by APC/C(Cdh1). These events do not occur in hypoxic cells when ATR is depleted, and the initiation of DNA replication is maintained. We therefore present a novel mechanism of cdc6 regulation in which ATR can have a central role in inhibiting the initiation of DNA replication by the regulation of cdc6 by APC/C(Cdh1). This model provides insight into the biology and therapy of hypoxic tumors."

Depression has been associated with insecure attachment, and both have been associated with changes in brain reactivity in response to viewing standard emotional and neutral faces. In this study, we developed a method to calculate predicted scores for the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) using personalized stimuli: fMRI imaging of subjects viewing pictures of their own mothers.28 female subjects ages 18-30 (14 healthy controls and 14 unipolar depressed diagnosed by MINI psychiatric interview) were scored on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) coherence of mind scale of global attachment security. Subjects viewed pictures of Mother (M), Friend (F) and Stranger (S), during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using a principal component regression method (PCR), a predicted Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) score was obtained from activity patterns in the paracingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 32) and compared to clinical diagnosis and the measured BDI-II score. The same procedure was performed for AAI coherence of mind scores.Activity patterns in BA-32 identified depressed subjects. The categorical agreement between the derived BDI-II score (using the standard clinical cut-score of 14 on the BDI-II) and depression diagnosis by MINI psychiatric interview was 89%, with sensitivity 85.7% and specificity 92.8%. Predicted and measured BDI-II scores had a correlation of 0.55. Prediction of attachment security was not statistically significant.Brain activity in response to viewing one's mother may be diagnostic of depression. Functional magnetic resonance imaging using personalized paradigms has the potential to provide objective assessments, even when behavioral measures are not informative. Further, fMRI based diagnostic algorithms may enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of depression by identifying distinctive neural features of the illness."
https://openalex.org/W2081894756,"New tetradactyl theropod footprints from Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian) have been found in the Iouaridène syncline (Morocco). The tracksites are at several layers in the intermediate lacustrine unit of Iouaridène Formation. The footprints were named informally in previous works ""Eutynichnium atlasipodus"". We consider as nomen nudum.Boutakioutichnium atlasicus ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov. is mainly characterized by the hallux impression. It is long, strong, directed medially or forward, with two digital pads and with the proximal part of the first pad in lateral position. More than 100 footprints in 15 trackways have been studied with these features. The footprints are large, 38-48 cm in length, and 26-31 cm in width.Boutakioutichnium mainly differs from other ichnotaxa with hallux impression in lacking metatarsal marks and in not being a very deep footprint. The distinct morphology of the hallux of the Boutakioutichnium trackmaker -i.e. size and hallux position- are unique in the dinosaur autopodial record to date."
https://openalex.org/W1969483763,"Myocardial ischemia is characterized by reduced blood flow to cardiomyocytes, which can lead to acidosis. Acidosis decreases the calcium sensitivity and contractile efficiency of cardiac muscle. By contrast, skeletal and neonatal muscles are much less sensitive to changes in pH. The pH sensitivity of cardiac muscle can be reduced by replacing cardiac troponin I with its skeletal or neonatal counterparts. The isoform-specific response of troponin I is dictated by a single histidine, which is replaced by an alanine in cardiac troponin I. The decreased pH sensitivity may stem from the protonation of this histidine at low pH, which would promote the formation of electrostatic interactions with negatively charged residues on troponin C. In this study, we measured acid dissociation constants of glutamate residues on troponin C and of histidine on skeletal troponin I (His-130). The results indicate that Glu-19 comes in close contact with an ionizable group that has a pK(a) of ∼6.7 when it is in complex with skeletal troponin I but not when it is bound to cardiac troponin I. The pK(a) of Glu-19 is decreased when troponin C is bound to skeletal troponin I and the pK(a) of His-130 is shifted upward. These results strongly suggest that these residues form an electrostatic interaction. Furthermore, we found that skeletal troponin I bound to troponin C tighter at pH 6.1 than at pH 7.5. The data presented here provide insights into the molecular mechanism for the pH sensitivity of different muscle types."
